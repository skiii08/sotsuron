The Rock," Wham bam, thank you Connery
","The Rock has what people go to the movies for (well, the majority anyway), big action, good characters and reused plot stuffers, not to mention Sean Connery.  While I can't say I thought everything in the Rock was great, I must say it did give a good show.  Ed Harris plays a disgruntled Marine who holds Alcatraz hostage and only Biochemist Cage and Connery (the only man to escape it) can save it's hostages.  Big, loud and often Hokey, however it is gripping overall.  A-",7,3,3,15 January 2001
The Double Life of Véronique," at times a confounding experience, but one I hope to revisit, for Irene Jacob and the direction
","The Criterion DVD for The Double Life of Veronique includes many of the bells and whistles when it comes to special features, not to mention a long, in-depth interview with the director, Kieslowski. Maybe I'll watch that some time soon, but not right after watching this film. I could go looking for some easy answers - if there are any, which I doubt anyway - but I'd rather stay for now in a moment where I can just ponder everything I watched. It's such a rich and moving experience, and is one of the most unique mystery films I've seen in a very long time - possibly ever.In a way its chief mystery is what it's all about, which remains, possibly, elusive even to the end. Of course we have an idea of the concrete fact that there were two babies born on the same day in different countries, France and Poland, and they grew up to be beautiful young women with dark hair and brown eyes, and looked exactly the same. There's also a moment where the two see each other (one sees the other on a tour bus in Krakow, this in the midst of a protest/riot in the streets, and yet this other woman on the bus won't see her, at least not yet). Will they try to look for one another is a key question.But Kieslowski is so not interested in anything conventional here. The mystery is about discovering things, but not necessarily the deeper mystery of one knowing for sure the other exists; in other words, this isn't one of those double movies like, say, The Double (2014). We really get two stories here of these women, and they're full-on character portraits: the first half hour is dedicated to Weronique, the Polish woman, who is a professional singer (and former piano player) who has a heart condition. The rest of the film focuses on Veronique, who is a music teacher and, after seeing a puppet show performed by a charismatic man named Antoine (or is it Alexandre, one of those), he starts to... stalk her? Follow her in an intriguing way? Certainly he leaves clues for her to find, and when she does... then what? I'd like to make note for a moment music in the film. I don't think it's some flippant 'artsy' choice on the filmmaker's part that each of these people are involved with music. Music is so central to the film, especially when Weronique is singing and becomes her most vulnerable, but also in those moments (on the flip-side image, so to speak) where Veronique isn't paying as close attention to the music she's teaching her students. Notice the opera that Weronique sings comes back more than once, like when Veronique is watching the marionette show. There is significance there, and it may be rooted back into that realm that music can lie with every person - like romance, which this film has, you can't always use the utmost logic ('the heart wants what it wants' so to speak) so why a music moves one person won't necessarily be the same for another. Why is music so paramount for Weronique, while for Veronique it doesn't seem so? Or, is music one of the things that connects them in that elusive, deep-deep down inside sense that they both have? Or maybe they're latent Jedis or something (I kid).How this is all filmed is completely absorbing; Kieslowski uses hand-held camera-work, but in a steady way that often creates tension, like when the two Veroniques are walking out in public (i.e., French side after she leaves her rendezvous with this not-so-mystery man and tries to go through crowded streets, and the Polish side after a rehearsal, where her heart becomes weak and she stumbles to catch her breath). How he uses color is especially breathtaking as well, and not always in ways that forces it but suggests things - red filters and bright whites and yellows here and there (not as blatant as the Colors trilogy, but maybe this was a practice round). So even when things get so enigmatic that it could, in just a few moments, become pretentious, Kieslowski reels it back in and makes the direction vital and important in ways that are unexpected. The camera itself is often another character, which is impressive.I've come all this way and haven't noted that without Irene Jacob this might all not work, or at least as well. There may be a moment here and there where it doesn't seem like she's doing much - she's so beautiful (on the cover I thought for a moment it was Ingrid Bergman with her eyes closed) that one might underestimate how deep and powerful she gets into both these women. The vulnerability is what's so staggering, and how much she feels the moments of joy and wonder, how her face registers genuine curiosity and in seeking out this mystery, and that crucial scene at the café when this Frenchman is revealed, notice how her face changes - it's subtle, but it's really there. I could watch Irene Jacob in this film or Red and see an actress so in tune with the character(s) that she in a way does half the work for Kieslowski. In other words, even when I was wondering, more than once, 'this storyline, such as it is, is getting a little weird and quixotic, maybe for its own good', she really grounded me in the emotional logic, and the pathos becomes so much that it makes something like a scene near the end this mix of heartbreak and bewilderment that I've rarely seen like this in a film.It's at times confounding, in certain choices and moments, but never in ways that might alienate; Kieslowski asks the audience 'come, a little closer - find out more about these women, and whatever the outcome, the journey is genuine and interesting.'",10,1,3,14 October 2015
The Devil's Advocate," Overated, not really lucifer
","I liked this film.  Mainly because the performances.  The plot is as confusing and complicated as the man who wrote it.  The acting though is top notch.  Keanu Reeves (usually a bad actor) pulls in a good performance, and Al Pacino shines (as usual) as the head of a firm, who is not only Reeve's (knowing, but not telling) father, but has so many names it boggles the mind.  Great entertainment with Charlize Theron being hotter than ever before.  Some fun, but mainly drama/horror (but some good drama/horror). A",8,3,8,19 June 2000
Ford v Ferrari," Rule Breakers v Capitalism
","This is made by the filmmaker who previously did a lot to inspire Walk Hard, so it may be redundant to say that this biopic about the Men Who Raced Hard in the 60s has conventional moving parts and mechanisms in its plot and certain (ok most) characters.Aside from an ending that isn't a surprise or shock given how clearly (or blatantly) it's set up in the three-point Set-up/Reminder/Pay-off style in conventional screenwriting, this even has the kid who is there so that some of the grown-ups can explain things involving making some of the turns and, oh, being set on fire and surviving (not to say that this guy Ken Miles didn't have a son I'm sure he did that's not what I'm saying I'm talking about the TEXT of the story for pete's sake). Id even say Josh Lucas is only here because the writers think the stakes of a 24 hour race aren't enough so one needs the Corporate Suit Who Is Against Our Rebel Batman-Driver (and not to say there weren't pencil-pushing hacks at Ford then, I wasn't there and neither were you, but it's a total cliche thru and thru).....YET, There's two things. First, to make a car analogy again because it's fitting, Ford v Ferrari works and moves like a dependable and well-oiled machine and which, not to get off on a long tangent because who the hell has time, would probably please journalists nowadays looking for 'Pizzazz' with otherwise enthralling events (sorry if you know what Im referring to and I digress on current events), it also has star-actors who get to find subtleties within the little beats of the script and/or where Manhole finds a moment to let it breathe (a pivotal character beat between Ken and Mollie where she speeds like hell to get the bloody truth out of his man ends up being one, and so in the very last scene with Shelby and the kid), fantastic cinematography and editing and a score/song selections that rock immensely, and Tracy Letts (writer of Bug and Killer Joe) hilariously crying like a baby at another key scene in a fast car.Second, the climax threw me for a loop in a way that made me very pleased - especially, as odd timing and weird I won't say luck but happenstance would have it, as this is a former Fox movie but now 'owned' by Disney - because it speaks to a strong, hard lesson about what can happen in following the Corporate Line. Ken could go one way and be the independent rock star hero he is to himself and his son and a few others, or follow what he's been told will look good for a photo. His decision at first seems like and is deceptively a 'Good' beat, where it's almost like the movie is saying, 'yeah, sometimes you gotta suck it up and do what they tell you.' But the actual consequence of this turns it on its head, and while the film doesn't hold on it for too long, it still resonates in a world where so many people are told to do something a particular way, and it opens one up to get... Screwed.I don't know if I read into it too much or the way the filmmakers intended, but it puts an excellent bow on the underlying subtext (or flat out text, your pick) about how to get ahead or not get ahead or simply the pitfalls in a world dominated by corporate interests.Oh, and it's a helluva adaptation of Speed Racer and/or Mario Kart, you decide there.",8,3,5,19 November 2019
The Blair Witch Project," One of the scarriest films ever
","This film is not like those usual killer with weapon slasher movies in which everyone in the theater screams when something scary happens.  This is the type of film where you watch the proceedings and are so afraid when you leave the theater you feel paralized.  Why, because this film is so realistic, it looks like this is actually the footage found in Maryland. But no, it isn't, and that is what makes Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick such good directors.  They just give the cameras to the cast and let them run rampant. This film shows what happens when 3 student film-makers (Heather Donahue is excellent in the best female lead of the year, Michael Williams is convincing as a scarred and insane sound man, and Joshua Leonard is exceptional as a mad cameraman) who get lost in the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland.  What follows is scarrier than anything I've seen in a really long time, and it is enjoyable (especially in the dark).  One of the best films of the year.  A++",10,3,9,6 May 2000
The King's Speech," Colin Firth's jowls steal the spotlight, but it's a jolly well good movie too
","Probably the strongest asset to The King's Speech, which could have been a dry period piece examining the problem of the stutter that King George (aka Prince Albert) had to overcome with his Australian speech therapist, is brought to life with conviction due to good acting and some creative direction from Tom Hooper. There's also some other interest with some of the machinations of the King-hood, how he interacts with the Church of England (being, y'know, the head of the Church) and George's brother who actually steps down as the King after their father dies due to his philandering and wanting to marry a divorced American woman. But you don't go to see The King's Speech for Colin Firth playing the Duke of York with that impediment that he's had since 4 or 5 and Geoggrey Rush as his therapist who is never not helpful and is also helpfully critical with his decisions, even if George doesn't like some of his comments. He's the Duke of York after all; they're not very used to things like criticism. And especially not the stuttering 'Bertie' who used to be called B-b-b-b-Bertie as a kid.Stuttering is also the kind of impediment that combined with a regal story of power changing hands at the door of WW2 that could probably get Firth the Oscar. Not only that, but Firth is just that damn good here; for the kind of performance that one could dub 'Oscar bait' (that is the kind of movie or performance that is giving it over to the Academy on a silver platter), it's much more human and sympathetic than I expected. He often looks like he's about to mope any moment in the movie, but what mope! And George's temper makes it interesting as well: George not only has to overcome the stammer, but his own low self-esteem brought on by years of verbal abuse from his father George V and his snide s*** of a brother. If not for the introduction to Lionel or the support of his wife Elizabeth he might be found compulsively cowering in the corner of Buckingham Palace. Firth makes that fear believable, and the desire, genuinely, from the audience that he should get better, or come closer to it.One of things that I did like is how by the climax of the film, when George, now the King (this isn't a spoiler, folks, this is bloody history, look it up), has to give the speech to England in 1939 on the cusp of going to war with Germany, he's still not quite confidant. And he only just gets by in the speech, yet he makes it believable as it should be to a Nation, nay a world, to hear him out. The confidence factor is what counts, and I liked that that was what was at stake even more than the stammer. That Firth has such a good co-star with Rush, who can play friendly-pushy and blunt very well is a big plus; that's another thing separating this from another stuffy English Royalty piece, the humor. The lines are witty enough to get someone who can be tired of trying-to-be-witty British humor excited and taking notice of my own laughter. Especially during the swearing scene, which was unfairly what made the film R rated in the US, and with off-handed comments all the way up to and including dramatic confrontations like when George talks to Lionel about his credentials in the royal coronation room. If nothing else the two actors have such good friendly chemistry I could recommend the movie on that basis alone. But it's also a jolly-good period piece that is inviting for a modern audience.",8,2,5,9 January 2011
Saturday Night Fever," It has it's moments of absolute glory
","Saturday Night Fever is thoughtful, engaging, and sometimes brilliant. While some might call it one of the greatest films ever, I must disagree. But along the lines of a groundbreaker, yes it is.  The film does for disco what Suburbia did for punk.  And the film gives John Travolta, the cool Italian guy from Engelwood, NJ a good break.  He plays a paint guy who at nights (and sometimes days) has a love for dancing, which he is absolutely excellent at (those dance scenes are quite memorable).  Not always on the money, but when it is, it delivers the goods.  Bee Gees provide songs here that everybody likes (I would have to assume from Wayne Campbell's statement in Wayne's World).

The Lobster," What does it mean to be connected? Or arranged? Or programmed? Or all of the above?
","Among the major artistic triumphs of cinema as a medium of the 21st century - and yes that is a hefty bunch of coconuts when it comes to praise - The Lobster is on the surface a dead-pan, ice-cold, horrific-as-the-Shining satire on marriage (notice the strings and shots of long hotel corridors), but is about so much more. It's a film that is devastating to watch in many moments, and it all comes down to how people are programmed; like the best dystopian fiction there is - Clockwork Orange, Kafka, 1984, Philip K Dick - it examines what it means when the heart and mind are ripped open and messed with to where they can conform to standards and rules. How can the heart have rules if it wants what it wants, so to speak? In Yorgos Lathimos' brutal, hysterical and harrowingly funny and sad look at what it means to fall in love, the rules are made to be broken and yet the hard-wiring is also essential.The film's themes are rich for examination, such as how it looks at marriage, this idea that we have someone we 'must' be with (arranged of course, in a great manner of speaking as, if you don't in this world, you're turned into an animal, albeit of your choice with makes it rather existential in that very real sense), and also on the flip-side what it means to have solitude and be content with that (or not, as case may be). But a great film, a new favorite film, won't be one only on its themes, if it feels like homework to watch it. While The Lobster is not something that is made by a filmmaker who is out to conform to what everyone's idea of a typically shot narrative is (in this way he wants to stick to a rigorous form, maybe like Wes Anderson but also I got some RW Fassbinder in there as well, and Bresson in some of the acting but not all), it's a lot of fun to watch... well, in a manner of speaking.This is horrific stuff: Colin Farrell's character has to find a wife in 45 days and is sent to a hotel where all men and women are put into, for lack of a better term, uniforms (all the same suits and pants and dresses) and must find a mate. Also compatibility is all in this instance; while initially they may have found their first spouses on their own (this is a world so rich by the way in its construction you can feel the confines of it outside the hotel or, later on, in the woods), they're trained from birth that they MUST be with someone or ELSE. So when they are in this hotel they have to try and find, um, 'matching characteristics' such as a lisp (John C. Reilly, perfect from start to finish) or a limp (Ben Wishaw's John) or, for Farrell, near-sightedness. But this compatibility turns into a nightmare when a particular someone is matched up - they're moved from single to double beds - and the nightmare seems to be over once, as in many a dystopian story (i.e. Fahrenheit 451) when the hero escapes to join the so-called underground rebellion. Nope, not quite.What's so remarkable to me about this film is how it manages to show in its style and approach forms of distance and alienation (again Fassbinder comes to mind), but I was so emotionally engrossed in what was going on. The actors I think do so much to contribute with that, as people like Farrell, Rachel Weisz, even in her own subdued way Lea Seydoux (who becomes sort of the real, unexpected but most terrifying villain of the story in the conflict sense, at least to me), bring so much emotional weight to a movie that is all about what we hide and what we show. What you show can get you punished, or transformed (notice the odd but awesome placement of a flamingo in the woods at one point among some other animals), or killed or even worse turned into something that will change you while keeping you human, so the 'characteristics' aspect of a relationship - do you like this, do you know this - is all part of the point.It's a daring and provocative film that feels like a breath of fresh air, even as it's at many points unpleasant to watch. It's a strange thing to recommend a film like The Lobster so readily, in large part because it's a) like nothing else out there (a credit to my new favorite film studio, A24, also responsible for the horrific delights of The Witch and Green Room this year), and b) it's highly watchable. Again, this is, with all its slow-motion sequences (done at times to classical music) a chore to sit through. In a way its watchability is what may contribute to you squirming. I say good - sometimes you should squirm, whether it's a comedy or a horror or a cynical take on love or a tragedy. This is all of the above. Lanthimos may have his influences - some I may guess in my critical response, some I may have not gotten right - but he is all his own director, fully formed like some figure from Greece who's risen to the top of the ladder of artistry. I can't wait to see everything he does (aside from Dogtooth, which is amazing as well).",10,5,13,31 May 2016
Whip It," spunky little movie about doing what makes you happy
","Drew Barrymore has been acting in movies for a very long time, producing for about half that time, and here she makes her first film as director. How personal a project it was to her I can't say (haven't read or seen too many interviews, and it's based on a book by a real-life roller derby player). But one can speculate that Barrymore, as a free-spirit who's had her ups and big downs in her life (mostly the latter when she was much younger, too young in fact), connected with Bliss' attempt to be happy doing something she wants to do, that she feared her parents would disapprove of, and that Bliss finds another family of friends in the girls playing as the Puke Scouts. Certainly there is one thing at least: she's made a 'Hell yeah' movie for girls, or just anyone, saying that you should do what you like, as long as it's not too illegal and you don't get hurt too badly.And sure, Whip It has its share of clichés. I imagine Barrymore wanted to be very careful with her first script, make sure she hit all the right beats- or just the expected ones- so she could let her actors have some fun. That is really where the film rests for the most part, outside of its premise being out of the ordinary (when was the last time we saw a Roller Derby movie, a good one, and not a documentary). She makes a very good bet on having Elle Page star who is small- at one point a character even refers to her as 'munchkin'- but has a lot of energy and heart and subtlety that she pours into Bliss. The character shouldn't be anything special, being a sort of typical rebellious seventeen year old searching for something that she can do well, on her own, but Page adds some charm and urgency to the performance, and gives it her all in those Roller Derby scenes darting always to the front of the pack.And sure, again, some scenes are just outright silly. There's one in particular that might stick in your craw where Bliss and the boy she's pining for, a less than honorable dude in a indie rock band, jump in an indoor pool in the middle of the night and stay under water for what seems like a full five minutes before they emerge with (some) clothes still on. And we can tell what might happen by the end, save for the outcome of the Championship game, which is thankfully unpredictable.But even if the story is just OK, again, Barrymore proves herself as a very fine actor's director, bringing out some excellent work from her fellow Derby players (Zoe Bell, Kristin Wiig, rival player Juliette Lewis in her best role in years), and Bliss' parents, Marcia Gay Harden and the criminally underrated Daniel Stern (great to see him getting work again). Oh, and Andrew Wilson as the coach hits it out of the park, in a performance that fully distinguishes himself from his brothers Owen and Luke. Only Jimmy Fallon feels kind of like the weak link here, if still amiable and amusing.All in all, if you have to see one roller derby girl flick (not 'chick flick', it's not that sappy or formulaic) set in Texas and featuring lighthearted spoofs on beauty pageants and very small-town diners that have 3-minute slop-eating contests, this is the one for now. It's a semi-auspicious debut.",7,3,8,28 January 2010
The Avengers," Fun, and great characters and dialog first and foremost
","Any comic book movie - worth its salt far as budgets go - can give us terrific action with mind-blowing CGI and special effects. Marvel's The Avengers, the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first, Iron Man), is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye, with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings), and if you want to get your money shots, Joss Whedon doesn't skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn't just for name cachet (though it probably helped).What Whedon's done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy, Firefly, Dr. Horrible, Angel, etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical, supernatural, other-worldly/alien forces, but making it always about stakes, humor, horror, drama and solid conflicts. Villains don't just act nasty, they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do, and if they're not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters, full of the stuff that makes them great to watch, especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy, for those that recall).So here we get Loki, previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2), and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery, but does it in a kind of elegant, theatrical, relishing way. By the time he spews out 'Muelling quim', you're on the edge of your seat. His performance, what he does with every moment of screen time, is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in, and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character, making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of 'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles' formula - the four main players, each distinct, playing off one another, but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston, Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other 'complex' male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on, she stands out, especially Widow's scene with Loki. Ruffalo, too, does a lot with a little... until he gets to the 'other guy'.I don't know if Avengers is great art, but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together, and gives them interesting, entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast, not too slow, nothing drags here, and that counts as well. Along with the first Iron Man and the recent Marvel Netflix show Daredevil, this is the MCU at the top of their game.",10,2,12,30 April 2015
Angels & Demons," it's not something to get excited about either way
","Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a 'wait, it's at the chapel' or 'Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!' or 'No, that's not it, it's in the sewer' or 'Wait, it's in my hat!' It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was 'message' like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero.",5,5,9,16 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," On the whole, so to speak, or by itself, the second part of Kill Bill fits the Tarantinian psychology
","Although, as a film buff myself, having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would've been satisfying, like the first part that was split Vol. 2 works extraordinarily well. In terms of storytelling it's direct and (of course) unconventional, in style Tarantino pays homage/borrows (or depending on your point of view steals) from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal. And with dialog, in maybe a couple of moments it doesn't seem up to par, but it's not often. And the acting is in the greatest tradition of B-movie, spaghetti western, shaw-brothers, kung-fu et. all. If you look at both Kill Bills it's fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven't seen before (i.e. the whole blood-coated style of the climax in vol. 1) and things you recognize right away (i.e. the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone, who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino's style).What's there to say about the story, except that it picks up where it left off? Sort of- as usual, the non-linear story aspect kicks in, and two sections of the film derail from the continuing story of revenge on the DIVAs and Bill (the squad members this time being the perfectly paced in tone and presence Michael Madsen as Budd, and Daryl Hannah's most vindictive role as Elle Driver). At first, we get a stark, black and white view of what the 'Massacre at Two Pines' was like, and right away we're introduced (finally) to Bill, played by David Carradine, one of the most calm, affecting film villain performances in recent memory. The other derailment is to tell the immensely entertaining story of The Bride's training by the heavy-duty Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, in one of his performances in the whole KB saga). This could be counted as the funnest part of the film, aside from a few key moments, as the camera sweeps from medium to close up happen every thirty seconds or so. In the acting department, as I've said, Tarantino gets a big boost- this could be counted as being one of the key performances of not only Carradine's career, but Thruman's as well. They elevate the mood of Tarantino's (sometimes) tongue-in-cheek dialog, but they're also pro's that do their best when it comes time to the showdown, with monologues that come close to being QT's most memorable (although not his best- as cool as it all sounds, it doesn't hit the Pulp Fiction marker). When it does end, the whole operatic sense of the film seems to work, and to the audience it will either be a fitting end or a disappointment. It is, at least, the most ambitious action/comedy/drama/kung-fu/western/romance film (this is referring to Vol. and both volumes together) in many a moon; it's a lot like opening up the filmmaker's skull, and getting a scrambled up dosage of his memories and references, and it works much more often than not. Oh, and how about a bit of applause to Bob Richardson and Michael Parks! A+",10,47,84,22 August 2004
First Man," conventional in some ways, but its deep well of feeling and experimentation resonates
","Who knew what the astronaut dramatization needed was the aesthetic from Saving Private Ryan? (Or Man of Steel came to mind too, and here it is far more effective viscerally and emotionally, and apt as it is, you know, real people who have lived and suffered and triumphed)Every time Damien Chazelle and company have one of the space sequences, from the opening to the Gemini 8 sequence, to the horror of the Apollo 1 test, it occurred to me that this is less the Right Stuff and more a hardcore war movie: these men are as much soldiers as they are scientists, and so the feel of the thing makes sense. If you're facing death and have an acceptance of it (not to mention in Neil/Jane's case, after the worst has already happened), that should ask of the storyteller something more than locked-down cameras. This is to outer space what Black Swan is to dance - there's largely horror to what happens and, if we're lucky, some awe, though not so much.This resonates and the filmmakers use a mix of 16mm and 35mm photography to achieve the kind of intimacy that could grow old fast, and we've seen this style before, but, what can I say except I responded to Chazelle and Lundgren's closeups, the way they would keep some shots steadier than others to keep the pace off our guard, Gosling channels convincingly how men of engineering (and men often were in general) from that generation, and it's Claire Foy's time to win like 700 awards for this performance.This is the kind of Oscar bait Im happy to watch, and I'm anticipating this will get best picture for reason to do and not do with the film in and of itself (in a sense this would win because Right Stuff, which is greater and more artistically ambitious, lost). And, man, seeing this in IMAX really does make a difference and feels a part of the whole thing (and unlike Nolan and Dunkirk, it doesn't change at random moments, it's IMAX on the moon and that's it). It's a gripping tension between conventional (the script) and experimental/loose (Chazelle)....I might've liked Buzz Aldrin to come off as more than just an a-hole though (and Lukas Haas gets the short shrift as Mike Collins, who is barely even named that out loud). 8.5/10",8,1,3,24 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," follows the book quite well - if you liked that, you'll like this, or...
","... If you haven't read the book, but keep up with the series, Mockingjay part 1 - the first half of an adaptation of the third book in the Hunger Games series - it still works. Or it did for me. One of the main things is that it takes its story from the book, and it gives some time to breath for the characters. You get to see how this develops - how Katniss is poised to become this symbol/figure of the revolution for all the other districts, how she's molded (at first unsuccessfully, then majorly) as a figure for the people through what is another 'reality' show, only this time more on the side of propaganda - and you don't have to rush through it, it's laid out piece by piece, you get a sense of this District 13, the other districts rebellions, and so on.So, first things first, it's its own movie. It's not simply easily dismissible as a 'it's only HALF a movie' sort of thing. Also, the acting is still top-notch for what this material asks for. Lawrence is still incredible as Katniss, having to express more the PTSD that her character has by this point going through two hunger games; Hoffman, in one of his last performances (part 2 of Mockingjay will be the last) strikes a jolly-calm-stern balance throughout his work here as the progandist; newcomer Julianne Moore maybe has the toughest role to play - and she is a lot colder in the book for those who have read it and know - but carries herself strongly in her scenes, aided by gray hair; more surprising is Liam Hemsworth, who I thought was weaker in the previous films, kind of like window dressing. Here, he has to if not carry scenes be more of a firmer presence, like when they return to District 12, or scenes between him and Katniss. He's gotten better.What I liked here is the mix of the 'Media Image', on both the sides of District 13 and the malevolent President Snow with his interviews staged with prisoner Peeta (some of the make-up as he gets weaker is a bit cheesy), and how this is set in the backdrop of this revolution. How much people want change? Well, enough to storm a dam or fight back by going high into trees for a couple of things (these are things we at best hear about in the book but don't see, one benefit of film vs the book in terms of point of view). But best of all I like how director Lawrence paints a relentlessly grim picture, and it's never entirely dour. Nor does it have to be super action-packed; this might deter some audiences who just want the blood and carnage of the Games of the previous films. And to be fair Catching Fire did improve upon it.But unlike something, say, Harry Potter 7 part 1, there's not a lot of aimless wandering around or pondering. Things keep moving, the story keeps going, Katniss' progression as a kind of 'icon' that she naturally becomes through her anger and persistence (and of her handlers), not to mention the bit-by-bit rising of the other districts, it makes for a dynamic film that is really about politics as much as anything else. So that by the time Snow and Katniss have their brief face-off through a video screen, the intensity is white-hot. This is a smart, brawny blockbuster that is not exactly, you know, a ball of laughs, but for what it presents as another in a line of thrillers, it's different and has enough of a satiric edge amid its epic qualities to make it stand out from, say, the Divergent series.",8,2,20,7 December 2014
The Legend of Bagger Vance," One of Redford's best
","I am hot a complete Redford fan.  I am a hater of The Horse Whisperer and The Way we Were.  But I did really like Ordinary People and that and now The Legend of Bagger Vance show that he can make a good film here and there. Bagger Vance is a film beautifully photographed (love those golf shots), acted and directed, even if some parts a a little too mushy for most.  The story follows a champion golf player, Rannulph Junnah (Matt Damon giving a good performance) who looses his swing from WW1 and has been lost in himself.  But thanks to a mysterious caddy, the title character (played by Will Smith with yoda like wisdom) who begins with Junnah the rehabilitation to win a exhibition and his soul.  A  good film, golf player/fan or not, though if you are a golf oficionado, you will appreciate it more than others.  A-",6,1,5,6 November 2000
Vertigo," Favorite Hitchcock and likely one of the most challenging, harrowing great films ever
","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is probably his most discussed film, and I believe that since it is so controversial- and yet living up to such hype by having a level of mystery, daring and true human interest that is open to interpretation- it gets better with every passing year. It deserves more credit than it gets (like most of Hitchcock's films) and though it is well credited with it's intrigue, I think that Psycho (not that it is a bad film) gets more credit than this film should get. There are at least a few reasons for this, arguably of course. One, the acting is spectacular including James Stewart in one of his very best turns as the weary, emotionally perplexed and obsessed cop with a slight fear of heights and a 'thing' for a certain 'dead' woman. Hitchcock's leading lady here Kim Novak, is equally interesting and ambiguous as the leading lady (or ladies). Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music. It's also the kind of picture that is a MUST if you've already seen it, or even if not, and it comes around town on the big screen as all the images and dark scenes come into great view. Not one of the more outright 'fun' Hitchcock films, with the few chuckles plain comic relief, and maybe his best serious work. A++",10,36,56,13 February 2000
Changeling," Clint's best since Mystic River, and a harrowing performance from its star.
","I saw Clint Eastwood recently on the Daily Show, and Jon Stewart brought up a point I have not read in the handful of reviews I had read before going into his latest film, Changeling. Often one sees movies about civil rights, racial or ethnic, but rarely in a well-produced Hollywood picture will the topic of the history of 'hysterical' women being 'dealt with' come up, of the hardships of those who could be pushed around by the (given) crooked types at the LAPD. This isn't just what Changeling is all about, either, which makes it all the more impressive how much Eastwood, via a good writer, can accomplish.This is the kind of tremendous drama that could become daunting for any other director- any one little step one way and it could be straight-to-Lifetime glop- but the director at hand here is such a pro that he's able to put in incredible artistry at nearly every step, even when it looks as though it should be cut and dry film-making. And then there's also the cast. But first, the story, which incredibly is just 'a true story' at the start, is about Christine Collins (Jolie) who is just a regular single working mother raising her boy in LA who one day comes home and finds her son is not around: missing. The cops barely do a thing until a few months later when another child who happens to be lost is picked up, instructed by the police to say that he's the Collins boy, and that this will all make sense as a happy-ending story.This is, except for Miss Collins, who keeps asking repeatedly a very simple but quickly angered question: where is my son? This leads into two tangents as a film: the roller-coaster tumble and rise and tumble of a mother fearing life and death for her son- sometimes in a mental hospital where she's been committed by police- and of a child killer who may or may not have killed Walter Collins, along with other missing/abducted children. Each of the tangents are interwoven with tense and particularly dark and harrowing detail, and once put together form an inexorable link that becomes all the more fascinating in the kind of way that most horror movies don't reach. Truth can be stranger than fiction, but in this case it's just uglier, and with only the faintest of hope.Which, in a sense, works to Eastwood's advantage. It'd be hard for me to imagine many other directors grappling with the facts in the case. How much Changeling sticks to the details of corruption and murder in the LAPD ranks back then (not surprising, of course, given the history of the force in reality and in cinema) or the Collins saga I can't say, but so much of the picture feels vital and without compromise to suggest that it is more than likely close to real, stark tragedy. Eastwood had that perfectly with Mystic River and somewhat in Million Dollar Baby. He gets it this time again, and applies a style that is one of his most ambitious (just on the technical side the way he and his DP desaturated the color of present-day 1928 era and of the flashbacks, which come out in some realm between color and b&w, not to mention the lighting, is completely extraordinary for a drama of this magnitude).And, once again, Eastwood shows his master's chops as an actor's director. Jolie, who is probably more well-renown as a star than as an actress at this point in her career, reminds the audience what she's got going for her, and in fact almost appears to underrated in any estimation (Oscar win notwithstanding). She's devastating at all the right moments, but tender and vulnerable and subtle without overdoing it, and at the same time conveying the star power that the role does need. It's a near triumph, and in a sense she does better on the Oscar-bait chart than her director might this time. Also noteworthy are Malkovich as the pastor (one of the few good-guys of the tale), and especially Jason Butler Harner in the crucial, role of Gordon Northcott who skims that line just slightly of hamming it up and turns in one of the creepiest killers in recent memory.It may be easy to label a Clint Eastwood picture, at least as of late, is a buzz word of masterpiece or great or classic or whatever. But with Changeling, he's made what is at once a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker and one of those stories of mothers and children and women and dirty cops that stick excellently both ways, and possibly earns rightfully a status like masterpiece because he doesn't ever go soft on the subject, never turning an eye to what lies behind certain conventions or pit-falls in a script of this sort, and will only allow the smallest, most ambiguous note of hope at the end. It's intelligent, brave work.",10,11,20,24 October 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Hey, he's Captain Jack Moneyrichardsparrowjet!
","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is a big McDonald's thing of the movies, where it comes slapped with the greasy paws of Jerry Bruckheimer and ready to sail off into matinée serial territory. This could be fine except that as each passing film goes on (with a couple of minor exceptions to scenes I'll mention) the quality of the series lessens with each film. It also doesn't help that this time the franchise loses one of the interesting things going for it in Gore Verbinski's visual/storytelling sensibility. While he ended up making parts of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End cumbersome with super-sized plots not worth much (albeit parts of Dead Man are a lot of fun, and the Davy Jones Locker segment of 'World's' is a perfect slice of surrealism), Rob Marshall just doesn't really have it in him to take the series where it could go.This latest effort, On Stranger Tides, misleads in its title (not too strange), and is still stuffed with over-plotting with double crosses and other shenanigans and new characters. The premise should be simple, and it is: there's word of a Fountain of Youth(TM) off on an island somewhere, but as Captain Jack (Depp, of course still around once again) is off to find it he has to contend with Blackbeard (Ian McShane) going also for it. This could make enough for a movie, albeit lifting a bit already from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And there's a little extra intrigue with Blackbeard's daughter, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), being Sparrow's kinda-sorta-not-really love interest of yore. And of course the mermaids, who for at least five minutes when revealed as the blood-thirsty hybrids they are make the film full of vigor and excitement.But then there's other stuff padded in to make it once again an over-long effort (not as long as At World's End thank goodness, but too long still), with Barbosa, Geoffrey Rush's most hammiest of ham-bone characters (whether it's also in his acting I'm not sure), also chasing after the Fountain but for more shady reasons as he appears up front as an actual 'Captain' in the Royal British navy or whatever.AND there's another goody-too-shoes along the lines of Orlando Bloom, though this time not him (thank foodness) but some other bland guy I don't remember his name at all and then he gets into some entanglement with the one mermaid they catch to take to the fountain. Why the mermaid? It's complicated... or, rather, not really, just a tear of a mermaid and some water and a couple of glasses and that's it... but it's more complicated than it seems, after a while.Frankly, memory of this is spotty. Not because of it not trying, but because it just didn't try hard enough. Marshall's direction doesn't really try for anything that inventive like Verbinski was able to, and directs action in the most cardboard-cut-out of styles that one could see in any Bruckheimer actioneer. If that floats your boat, you might enjoy the movie a lot, but the action and excitement of past films (save for an escape scene early on with Sparrow through the streets of London, or some such town, and the mermaid scene mentioned earlier when they first appear and attack the pirates) is lacking here.So, therefore, much of the movie has to rest on the appeal of its performers. How does it fare? Taking out of account whoever that bland-priest-kid was, and the mermaid girl equivalent (aka Bloom/Knightley 2.0), we got a couple of the regulars with Depp and Rush, and they both have their moments for sure - Depp especially has to carry a lot of scenes (arguably, even, the whole movie overall) on his shoulders, and for what it's worth in the fourth go at it he can still hold attention and get some chuckles... not laughs, mind you, just chuckles at this point. Honestly why they keep Sparrow's father, -the almost inimitable Keith Richards- as such a walk-on player on these films is beyond me as he could save portions if it was bumped up to a small role. Rush, meanwhile, is often relegated to exposition even when things should get interesting.Curiouser still is McShane and Cruz. McShane could have made this a really memorable villain, but he seems to be tired through a lot of the performance, sometimes getting a little energy to yell during a scene, and not enough to make one feel that this is such a 'Bad Man' as he calls himself. Cruz does better as a firebrand tough-girl sort who can kick butt and take names when need be, but isn't given much of a character either except near the end when there's some wicked double-crossing going on between her and Sparrow on a beach. It's a fine scene that the two actors have - and it's even a moment that shows why they're such *great* actors in other performances - and yet a little too little too late. By then the plot has turned its gears, Hans Zimmer's surprisingly generic score has gone through its motions, and mermaid tail (pun intended) is sorely lacking.One small note to Marshall's credit, he gets ONE really fantastic WTF cameo during the city-chase scene with Sparrow when he lands in one of the carriages crossing town. I won't say who it is, but it's a self-conscious regal-joke that had me laughing harder than almost anything else in the movie. And a scene like when Sparrow argues over a big-giant-scary jump off a cliff into a river should have been the tone of much of the movie... and it isn't. It's not too terrible to hate (sorry House Next Door guy, this probably makes me a half or quarter of a c*** then), but to recommend it as anything other than at best a rental or a lazy summer afternoon nothing to do cable TV view would be false.",5,0,1,14 November 2014
Come and See," Horror by Stedicam in this near-masterpiece
","Come and See comes off almost like a post-apocalyptic film, far more than what you typically may associate with a world war two spectacle. Of course director Francois Truffaut once said that you can't make a war film as 'anti'-war because of the excitement of the violence. Aside from many other examples refuting this, Come and See isn't simply anti-war, that would be too easy. Director Elem Klimov (in what turned out to be his final film) lays on the brutality and the barbarism so thick and with such force and magnified wrath that you'll never want to watch another war film as long as you live - and really, how can you go back to watching a regular ol' shoot-em-up-let's-kill-bad-guys war flick after this? You're basically put in the position as the audience member of the main character, the boy Florya (Kravchenko), and you are witness to see ALL of the devastation that the Nazis levy on the Belarussians. In other words, if you find this 'exciting', you may need to check your head.I should note the filmmakers don't go right away into the horror and death. They do give a few moments at the start to show how Florya gets into this - he gets brought on to fight in the army (against his mother's wishes, and at this point Florya hasn't gone through anything yet to feel either way about it). He gets left behind by the troop to guard the base, what little there is, and we get a moment to know this character alongside a young woman named Glasha (Mironova). It feels like from this scene the doom is already pending - what do these two have really, at this moment, but each other - and characters address the camera head-on (think how Demme does it), and it's startling. But then come the bombs and explosions. For a good long while, Florya thinks he's deaf. It's just the beginning of his troubles.No family (all dead), no hope, no future except for the struggle to survive. If one weren't thinking that this was set so squarely in 1943 Eastern Europe, one might confuse the backdrop as the bleakest post-apocalyptic drama ever made; The Road looks nearly weak by comparison to Come and See. Florya, as played by this actor, spends practically most of the rest of the film in a state of shell-shock - it also appears he's ages older as it goes on, looking like an old man by the moment he plugs bullets into a particular painting - and while it may not allow for the greatest 'character development' or whatnot (and early on a scene where he's cleaning a pot that'll be used to cook meat by the troops is a little on-the-nose metaphorically), we're with this kid all the way. He's meant to be us, and really if there's any purpose to something as unrelentingly bleak and punishing as this film it's to get us to feel SOMETHING from scene to scene.And what makes the film so effective in large part is that the filmmaker doesn't, much as he can, look away from destruction with the stedicam. Shots can go on for a while if you got a good guy behind leading away on the camera, and in Come and See the epic vision of apocalypse comes thanks to a composition that doesn't waver to another cut when it doesn't have to. By following along we get caught up more in the action (think back to The Shining, which was another film that masterfully utilized the stedicam for such an effect). And what happens because of this is that when it comes time for the filmmakers to really unleash it all - a sequence that seems to last a half an hour in the second half of the film, where the Nazis gather up a village and, well, guess what Nazis do - the effect is tumultuous.I had the feeling near the end of almost, just a tiny bit, being exploited by the filmmakers; not that I was looking for a ton of nuance with, you know, foot soldiers of a Jew-hating mass-murderer like Hitler, but the tone is so relentless in what it's set after it leaves little room by to be distraught. I found myself saying out-loud more than once, 'Jesus Christ!' One may want to criticize a young actor like Kravchenko for having the same pained expression through much of the film, but can you blame him? Is it even acting after a certain point? The soundtrack, too, I should mention, adds to the uneasiness and surreal nightmare of the production, making moments like crawling through mud or watching a cow's last moments via its eyeball all the more horrific - it even brings in some Mozart, at one point sort of (I think) ironically, and then by the end it's just good ol' Requiem.Come and See is not something you'll 'Want' to watch, but as something to 'Need' to watch, it's not dishonest about its intentions. It doesn't wave false patriotism, and through all of the images of the Nazi machine in the final reel (most notably a black and white montage of backwards propaganda film), this could be any people being subjected to murder and warfare. I don't know when I'd watch it again, but I'm glad I did for its artistry and the simple fact that it shows what 'Things That Go Boom' *really* do to people . 9.5/10",9,4,5,2 July 2015
The New World," there might be a great film in here somewhere, but I just didn't see it as much as others have
","Terence Malick's The New World is something that I really did want to find to be the brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing visual masterpiece that some have been calling it (apparently though it is one of the most audience divided films of 2005 for those who have seen it). In a couple of ways it is unique- Malick takes on the history of this time and puts his visual look onto the era, and wants to say to the audience through his form of poetry/philosophy 'come, look at all this, the lands, the rivers, the Native people soon to be tainted by the West'. In a way he tries to treat the period piece much like Kubrick did with some of his films. But the problem then comes, how do you really draw a viewer into the story? Kubrick could do this because there was something intriguing and involving about the characters, with the pace corresponding with the emotional pull. Malick, however, loses sight of the narrative at times, at least to me. If the film is more about the journey than the destination, too often the film finds itself looking for a narrative pull, and as the story does move along, it's done so in a muddled way through narration that either works OK for some parts, and in others is totally unnecessary. It's like the filmmaker has a definite passion for the period, and for these near icon characters of American history, and yet is too wrapped up in visuals to correspond with the dialog.Colin Farrell's performance in the New World, Terence Malick's fourth film, is one of the better parts of the picture, as well as the performances from Christian Bale and first-timer Q'Orianka Kilcher. At the same time there is a kind of strange quality to their performances, they're also observant, subdued, and trying to get their own grasp of the material, and for the most part it works. Kilcher in particular gives off something here that is both touching and maybe, in a way, off-putting. I liked a lot how she would not be too over-emotional in scenes that could go terribly wrong with first-time actors, though at the same time she could also be quite aloof in certain scenes, and maybe a little one-tone. But maybe that is what Malick was looking for, more of the 'presence' of these actors in these roles than the actual full-on strengths. It becomes one of the interesting points in this film that acting out such textbook/museum people like John Smith, John Rolfe, and Pocahontas, becomes as much of a challenge to take in as the rest of the picture.This review, I suppose, may be rather subjective, though in a way that is almost a compliment to Malick. This is a work of a true auteur, who does side-step the possible pit-falls of a mainstream Hollywood director, and makes the film he wants to on his terms. If it was just a silent film, for example, I might be even more fascinated in what occurs. But unlike my favorite work of his, Badlands, there is a distance put between the audience and characters that isn't achieved so well. Maybe I'll respond to it more on a repeat viewing, as some films often need. But one time in the theater was enough for me.",8,5,11,13 February 2006
Scarface," Fascinating storytelling, not so fascinating lead performance
","Brian De Palma's Scarface, a remake of the 1932 gangster classic by Howard Hawks, changes locations to Miami where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) arrives without much going for him. Soon, under circumstances at his disposal, gets to the reign of the gangster's world of 80's cocaine, soon having a sort of empire around him that soon becomes too much to control under the influence of snow. The elements that kept me interested the most while watching this film were Brian De Palma's direction and certain aspects of Oliver Stone's adaptation on Ben Hecht's material. The direction by De Palma (which owes a little credit to the cinematography by John A. Alonzo and the splendorous production design by Ferdinando Scarfiotti) is always at an edge and style to kept the audience hooked into where the story is going even if it seems inevitable in the sort of rise, seize, and fall saga of the money dream. Even though De Palma's presenting us with a more-often-than-not despicable character in Tony Montana, the techniques aren't tiresome or boring in the near 3-hour length of the film. It was by De Palma - and Stone's script, which delivers some good, tongue-in-cheek dialog, and tries to understand the scope of the characters in this world - that I stayed through till the end of this film. There were also a couple of surprises amid the conventions (i.e. the infamous 'Chainsaw' scene).And yet, I was not one of those who thought that Pacino's performance was something incredible. I'm sure it's been influential in the twenty years since the film's been out there (the DVD did a whole tribute special by various rappers and real-life hoodlums), but from my perspective it served as something of a big liability. The supporting roles are alright, but his bravado, heavily-dramatic style seems like it COULD fit this revised version of Paul Muni's performance. BUT the accent and accentuations he uses from start to finish become distracting, and overtly comical, very quickly. And his booming persona is misused here; I can think of at least a dozen other performances where Pacino's been able to utilize his presence and style magnificently for the sake of a picture (The Godfather movies and his movies with Sidney Lumet are great examples, but so are some of his recent films like Insomnia or even the Devil's Advocate). This isn't one of them- here he confuses theatrical, operatic acting with ridiculous showmanship. What's even more interesting to me is that Pacino and De Palma's second collaboration- Carlito's Way- was a bit more mature in dealing with the conventions within the crime genre, and found that balance of forceful directing and acting. I do recommend Scarface and yet I don't recommend it as well. There were elements about the film that kept sturdy, even gripping (the last fifteen minutes or so is rather bloody though brilliantly filmed). However the film does have a number of flaws, and not just in Pacino's work (some scenes are a little too much for me, and I get a kick out of most crime films). 6.5/10",7,12,29,7 December 2003
Love and Death," funnier now that I've gotten deeper into Russian literature, European history, and Bergman
","Love & Death is an example of Woody Allen as a filmmaker, writer and comedy star as, one of the characters says in Stardust Memories, as an 'early, funny movie'. If anything it reminds me most in tone to how Allen used to write in his short fiction and little bits he contributed to magazines and books. The comedy is both verbal and physical, and its probably that one film that connects him from those earlier films of the 70s into the more personal realm he would dive into in the late 70s and beyond. It's light comedy even as it deals with Death (both with a capital and lower case d), murder, war, hunger, the struggles of love and marriage, religion, politics, and other penchants of Russian literature. It mixes this up to an effect that isn't 100% successful, but does keep me laughing on repeat viewings.Allen's character Boris Grushenko goes through an epic story at first having to face Death itself as a child (great homage to Bergman, not the first for the filmmaker), then he goes into a War he (of course, being the usual Allen character) doesn't want to go into, but does, and comes out alive somehow. He marries his cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton, one of her funniest performances), to her dismay as she doesn't love him- at first. When she realizes so, it is then into the biggest chunk of the film, as she plots for Boris to assassinate Napoleon. There's almost an overload of some classic Allen quips and puns and other gags, and sometimes as Boris and Sonja break into philosophical discussions, Allen mocks this to the point where you can't help but laugh. I didn't totally get this joke that happens more than once in Love & Death, until I read some Dostoyevsky, and then it clicked further. One particularly funny bit is when Allen's Boris writes the 'ragged claws scuttling across the floor' line. But there are almost too many to list here. The key is that there are enough so that at least some can stick even if one or two are a little cheesy thirty years later. But its hard not to bust a gut as Allen has a talk in close-up with the audience as Napoleon's knocked out.It's a movie with a gleeful way about it as Allen Lampoons many of the most dramatic points, either real or written about or fictionalized, in that time of 19th century European/Russian history. It's a parody, but not one overloaded with dirty jokes like a Mel Brooks movie. And it's another showcase for Allen and Keaton's perfect on screen chemistry, as she shows her own comic chops, usually playing it straight or with some goofiness. I love the musical choices too.",8,1,3,4 September 2006
Frost_Nixon," see it for the craftsmanship, sure, but the title fight is the real kicker- and a towering performance
","Ron Howard, at his best, can be a very good director in the Hollywood tradition. He's not the kind of artist one might rank Scorsese or Altman or more recently an Aronofsky, but when he's on top of the subject matter he's dependable throughout to deliver on the story. With Frost/Nixon, probably one of his best films (if perhaps by default due to the nature and power of the subject matter and original play), he re-tells in docu-drama form the interview with David Frost and his most challenging 'opponent', Richard M. Nixon, 37th President, only one to resign in our Nation's history.We see all of the prep work undertaken (or, at times, forgone to do other things like seeking out sponsors or Frost's other projects), the pressure simmering under, and then suddenly reeling from the s***storm that Frost may have gotten himself into. This kind of story, unto itself, is nothing very new, and some of the rise-and-fall aspects make it out to be like a sports movie: a boxing match of words and attitude and persistence where one side has an obvious advantage and the other has to combat with facts and the like that can undercut Mr. 'Tricky-Dick' himself.What *does* however make Howard's film a must-see this season are the performances from its cast, primarily Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Come to think of it, more-so Langella than Sheen; while the Brit does a terrific job as the grinning and ambitious and/or terrified talk show 'performer', it's somewhat of a two-dimensional character in the scope of the actual story. Frost wants the big ratings at first, and that's really the priority with the facts and research coming in second for his team (with Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as good supporting players), who want to give Nixon the grilling that he and by proxy the American public deserve to lay bare to hear and, more importantly, to see in close-up on TV. He's a sturdy presence, but by himself merely very good but not great.No, the big contender here is Langella, both for the film and, without having to knock on much wood, as best actor in countless award ceremonies. His work here is to the point of immersion completely in the presence, not even so much the character, of Richard Nixon, to the point that it's a little scary, which is dead on for such a larger-than-life presence as him. He's lightly (or hugely) condescending, subtle, menacing, charming, devious, everything that Nixon the public or in private was, and then some, and Langella captures it in every gesture, every flinch. In a sense it's akin to Streep's latest performance in Doubt in that at first and from time to time it almost seems amusing, though this may be just the obviousness of the character in and of itself (i.e. strict nun and Nixon). But it's the great gift of the actor to go deep into these people- Daniel Day Lewis last year is another prime example- and make us forget what we're seeing, that's real power and skill.Take simply, if nothing else, maybe my personal favorite scene of the film, when Frost, on edge with the possibility he may lose his regular talk show programs in Australia and England, receives a very late-night call from the ex-President. He's drunk, he's got the tape machine going (of course), and he dominates the conversation. What starts off as an innocent bit about cheeseburgers turns into half-rambling and half monolithic monologue regarding these men's places in life. I was almost kind of smiling at how good Langela is in this scene - this is such bravura work just in these five minutes that one sees both the nature of the complexity that was Nixon on display and how much the actor is willing to let go for the scene. Frost/Nixon may not be a very great movie, but it does contain a very great performance, one that hopefully will be talked about and re watched for years to come.",9,4,7,27 December 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," loaded with enough imagination and sweet vibes for three movies!
","I can't say for certain, especially after only seeing the English-language dub of the film in the theater (and seeing bits of it again on TV)- that Howl's Moving Castle is one of the very best of the great Hayao Miyazaki's feature films. But I didn't leave it feeling un-happy in the slightest, and if anything I remember most the feeling of uplift, which is what the best fairy tales try to accomplish. It follows the strand left by Spirited Away (though also trailing off from other Miyazaki films to be sure) where a female character is the protagonist thrust into strange circumstances, really around a curse.Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer and the great Jean Simmons in the English dub) gets cursed by an evil witch, and then meets up at Howl's castle (Howl, by the way, is a slightly melancholy and quirky wizard, voiced in a fun way by Christian Bale), and sets about to make herself useful, however to also keep order in the guide of her now old-lady persona (and, more importantly, to free herself from the curse). She also has to contend with an overly cautious flame (Billy Crystal, odd choice for a talking fire, but it works better than I expected), and a scarecrow who sometimes just can't sit still.Soon Sophie becomes the unwitting assistant to Howl, as she goes in partial disguise to help him be present instead of him before his former tutor, Madame Suliman. And, of course, in the meantime, a love story unfolds. Although I could argue that Howl's Moving Castle begins to stray a little from the completely satisfying world portrayed in Spirited Away or particularly in Princess Mononoke- and that the story is given way, frustrations and all, for the visual wonderment- it's still a delight from start to finish. While I wondered when I first saw it if the Japanese dialog would make a difference by much, seeing the American voices didn't detract much at all, and if anything the cast fulfills the story more than one could hope for. And, of course, those visual inventions are never to be taken for granted in Miyazaki's world (more than likely attributable to the source from Diana Wynne Jones and leaning more to Western influence then the decidedly awesomely Eastern Mononoke). If anything individual moments, like when Howl almost melts away from not having certain powers, is really intriguing, or in just seeing the castle itself, with all of the little parts and spindles a marvel in and of itself (Ebert's not far off from saying that it's one of the great unique places of the movies, and for me almost resides on the other industrial side of the cutesy wonderment of Totoro).I definitely need to watch it again, as Miyazaki's worlds usually do, but for now I do recommend it, even if you've never seen one of his films. Little girls too, I'd imagine, might get an extra kick out of the strong-willed female lead and the strong romantic interests in the storyline (and having a handsome leading man voiced by Bale doesn't hurt either).",9,1,3,30 December 2006
Walk the Line," the performances and music, and a fairly credible story, that's all you need...
","Sometimes I take an actor like Joaquin Phoenix for granted, or maybe just not take too much into consideration his talents and strengths. Maybe in films like Gladiator or Signs, he had good roles but amid all the spectacle and big themes and action/suspense, some of his work was lost in it. Or sometimes he just doesn't find the potential in a character. Here though he finds himself in one of his best, if not his most ambitious, role yet as Johnny Cash, a man who rose up from nothing to become one of the legends of 20th century country. His drama and tragedies and successes are nothing new to this sort of sub-genre of the musician's bio-pic (in fact last year's Ray, which can likely draw up many comparisons with subject matter, was in some ways pretty similar). But its the convincing in the performances by Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon that help elevate what could've been more likely standard material.At times there are some fantastical moments (not that it's unbelievable, but like some of the stuff with Elvis early in Cash's career for example), and yet it's not to totally 'wow' the audience. This really comes in the form of the love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter (Witherspoon) who have an on-and-off kind of relationship that borders on being a couple, to being bitter at each other, to being tender on one end and near helpless on another, and then leading to a really moving finale. It's their connection on screen, and the surprisingly fresh dialog, that helps make situations that in Ray weren't as fleshed out make this world not too far from some truth. There are also little supporting performances that help, most notably Robert Patrick as the tough, practically unforgiving for a certain tragedy father of Johnny Cash.So there's the acting, and the story that sticks well with the themes of addiction (this time to pills and alcohol) and to being burned by insecurities and the demons of the past (and present). But there is also the music. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Cash's music, at least I wasn't really before I saw the film (I like some songs, notably from the period covered in the film). If anything co-writer/director James Mangold uses the songs and live performances, and cool gifts of the musical Phoenix and Witherspoon, to his advantage. The songs are sometimes more of a pure rock and roll sound rather than country, and the film does shine some light on how Cash did have a unique sound to him. And the circumstances shown around him playing at Folsom prison is one of my very favorite parts of the film. I'm not saying this is one of the all-time great musician bio-pics. However, if you're looking for something toe-tapping, and something too as a solid, emotionally rewarding 'date' movie, this is the one of the month.",8,6,15,29 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," most fearless, vulgar, and successful satire of the year
","Even before I saw Borat: Cultural Learning of... I knew what I was in for. Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat on Da Ali G Show is possibly the most consistently funniest character of the lot of his creations. Just the theme music and the opening images of him running after a truck and swimming in a pool are funny. It's not hard for me to figure out why- Cohen gets what it is to lampoon current times- bring out the worst in people without even really trying. This is a tactic that is, of course, Mel Brooks inspired, as he was once quoted as saying of his film the Producers 'my film rises *below* vulgarity.' Once you see Borat you'll see what I mean, and if you've never watched the show don't fret, you may still find it to be a truly funny comedy on its own.What's even more genius is how Cohen even figures in a storyline, however thin, to his movie. It would be one thing if it was just random vignettes spliced together, which could still make a great time. But there's a road-movie quality to the picture, as Borat and his friend Azamat Bagatov, go off to make a documentary about the US-of-A for his homeland of Kazakhstan. He suddenly comes across Baywatch- particularly Pamela Anderson- and finds his ultimate goal, to make her his wife by any means necessary (which includes, of course, bagging her, literally). So this becomes the template for the picture, and which leads to not only great comic scenes, including little ones that strike up a lot of good lines and gags (i.e. antique shop; the 'gypsey' yard sale), but the kind of outrageous sequences that make my sides hurt thinking about them. The rodeo, the bed & breakfast (that might be my absolute favorite), and of course the 'running of the Jews'. Of course, complications come along, and sad times, but there could still be hope just yet- perhaps by Jesus? All of this outrageousness would work a lot less if not for two main factors- 1) Cohen has a mind that never stops, and so his Borat is always on the move with a line or a small gag that ends up becoming part of the fold of the rest of the film (the retard line, heh), so the improvisation is at the highest caliber. 2) the people that he sets up are not even necessarily set-up all that well; what you see really is what you get, and not without too much by way of him 'tricking' these people. There was recently a small blurb in a Newsweek magazine where one of the people complained, after getting fired, that Cohen made him look bad. How can this be though if the person, among many others, don't get that it's a joke for a SECOND? It's almost a shame that (possibly) there will never be another round of Borat material after this. Like Andy Kaufman, soon Cohen's personalities will be known all too well, and will lose their flavor. But in the meantime, we do have this film, which is a kind of near-priceless work of satire by someone who has no shame, or rather has no shame in how far he goes with the material.In other words, even if you don't think you might be much of a fan, give it a chance and see what might spark up. Borat, for all of his little quirks and un-knowable ways around him (e.g. the result of him going to the bathroom in a mannered Southern home), is never really a mean person, and with one exception of a violent outburst (you'll know it when you see it) is a kind of bumbling fool of a character too. Still, this doesn't stop Cohen, through Borat, showing what ugly things racism and stereotyping are in America, and in a sense this is kind of like a near-masterpiece compendium of the state of America right now. That we can at least laugh at it is a good sign, and all apart of the kind of Brooksfilm vein Cohen is descending from wonderfully. JINGJAMESH!",10,19,43,3 November 2006
Alien 3," the reconstructed version is a vast improvement even without Fincher's personal supervision
","For quite a number of years, between my friends and I was an on-going if minor argument about the favorite Alien movie. Most said the James Cameron sequel, and one or two would pipe in on Ridley Scott's original. Only one would stick up for the 115 minute film of Alien 3 (mostly out of preferences for the characters and the ideas behind having a lack of weapons). Unfortunately, in the theatrical version one can immediately sense the lack of someone really behind the wheels at times, despite the production design still being as top-notch as the previous films (and no wonder; Fincher, on his first studio assignment, practically disowned the theatrical cut after it was taken away from him). Luckily, with the advent of DVD and the 'special edition', a 'reconstructed' version of the film has been put together, including over half an hour of missing footage. While the reports stated this was not a real 'director's cut' (as Fincher didn't supervise the re-edit), according to the producers this comes as close as we're going to get it.And luckily the full version, with its story pumped up with not necessarily back-stories to the supporting cast (all prisoners on a kind of dilapidated mining colony on a remote planet), but just to give more depth to the peril that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is in. The basic outline is this- Ripley, after surviving the hazards of the climax of Aliens, winds up on the planet as an outsider through and through. The colony (including good-to-excellent character actors like Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Pete Postletwhaite, and Paul McGann) is full of a nasty bunch, some more-so than others, who have no idea what Ripley has brought along with her on the ship. This then sets up what we might expect from the rest of the film; riveting action sequences, tough dialog, and a climax that is surprising and fulfilling.When looking at the theatrical cut, the look of the film is all in-tact and rather mind-blowing; Norman Reynolds production design is loaded with texture and the grittiness of space that is constant through all the films (though still unique); HR Gieger's alien designs (sometimes for some unconventional bits of business, to say the least) rattle the mind as much as in the first film; Alex Thomson's cinematography is a little relentless at times, but suiting so for the film. Unfortunately, what falls apart is the story, and the thin, trite qualities in the supporting cast, and when looked at in relation to the first film and even the second (which is more of a class unto itself), is pedestrian and very much in-line with something Hollywood. You can sense that there is Fincher's presence in the scenes and ideas, but also that what was cut out wasn't necessarily 'extra fat' to the story.In this reconstructed version, however, it feels more epic in scope, and some things have been changed (i.e. the cow now a dog for the Alien 'birth'), and a lot has been added. To go into everything that has been added would take too long, but to make it short not only do we get a better science-fiction style story, in the end it adds to the effectiveness of the chases down tight corridors, fights, etc. Some of it is even a little more disturbing this time around (an 'attempt' at Ripley by some of the prisoners is as frightening as the Alien), an added plus to the mood of the production design and visual effects. The ending is still a little overtly dramatic, but also Weaver's performance is given more clarity; it's not just seeing her with a shaved head that's worth watching the film, she's given some scenes where she out-acts everyone around her, with her strengths of subtlety and patience as an actor.I would even recommend watching this reconstructed version, if you can, even if you've never seen the theatrical cut. And for those who love the original version anyway (there are things about the studio cut that make the film under-rated if still flawed), you get more for your buck, kind of like Apocalypse Now Redux or something. I still wonder what the director now thinks of this footage put back in, if it comes closer to his vision, albeit through the interference and meddling.",8,38,69,31 August 2005
Gremlins," seeing it as a kid vs an adult
","Seeing this again in a theater today on 35mm, and it strikes me how much this is a product of the 1980's even as it holds up (that is if you are one of those few brave souls who love the hell out of practical effects and creatures that have to be built - so many of these things have great individual personalities and designs, even as they're all either gremlins or mogwais). Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman, for example, plays the sort of borderline-adorable xenophobe - his one character trait here is that he doesn't trust a single thing that comes from another country - that today in America is not so adorable anymore (a Nixon frame on his wall seems quaint by today's standards). And the gremlins themselves can be seen as the sort of 'other' or 'outsider' threat that's coming to get us if we're not careful; it's not that we can't or shouldn't have in these foreign critters, but the responsibility is on us, perhaps, to make sure we don't turn them into hideous terrorists....I may be reading a bit much into this. But it's still a piece of Spielberg Americana, a small suburban town (maybe less suburban than ET but close enough) where everyone seems to know everyone, but given Joe Dante and Chris Columbus's extra-dose of love for B movies and Loony Tunes. It also is wonderful as an homage to the sort of small town one saw in It's a Wonderful Life (which we see on a TV here) and gets sort of featured with the one cantankerous woman who practically runs the bank (her storyline gets put by the wayside for one reason or another).Not unlike with the Evil Dead series, the first movie is more of a horror movie than a comedy, and I think it takes a little while for the comedy to find its footing - as a kid I found Billy's dad, played by Hoyt Axton, to be amusing, though now as an adult he doesn't hold up as well with the running gags of his mishap inventions (it's kind of cute, at first, but runs out of steam). But once the bad mogwais and especially the plethora of gremlins take over the town, it is an amazing pop-comedy spectacle. If nothing else it's worthwhile for the set pieces in the second half: that bar scene with Phoebe Cates at the mercy of all these damn creatures (the highlight of this movie for me is the jazzy, Tom Waits-like gremlin accosted by the one with the hand-puppets); all of them watching Snow White; the finale with 'Stripe' and how it's an actually effective suspense sequence, with maybe one too many false endings.And in the middle is little Gizmo, like the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi built for no other purpose except to be sickeningly cute and... who wouldn't want a Gizmo, long as one is responsible for the little guy? It may take a little while for him to become notable to the plot, but when he does it's also a great deal of fun in that finale. So, there is a lot of nostalgia in this for me, as this was one of the first movies I can remember seeing as a little kid. How I respond to it today isn't too different, though I do recognize some of its flaws. Perfect ending.",8,9,15,11 December 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash! Abomination fights! Pretty good movie!
","I wasn't sure if this new reboot-cum-remake-cum-sequel to 2003's Ang Lee Hulk would make as good, or better than the predecessor. Turns out that the director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn capture the spirit of the Hulk from the comics with lots of fiery action and panache, if not with the flawed ambition of Lee's vision. It's a bashing, smashing, exciting summer blockbuster, giving what it delivers for the fans of the books and even the cheesy 70s TV series, even if it's not quite a great comic book movie. It's also less substantive than other Marvel movies like Spider-Man and Iron Man.Actually, in a couple of ways, it's close to being better entry than the previous entry, and not simply because Leterrier is suited for the material. Edward Norton fulfills the role of Banner/Hulk with a level of intelligence and subtlety that is uncommon for a role like this. It's great to see him and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination face off and fill up their two-dimensional roles to the hilt. William Hurt is also good as the General Ross, after him with any and all means at his disposal but not a clue to how really to stop him (mostly his role consists of commands barked and some glances of concern over his daughter). Only Liv Tyler is only so-so, often pouting or giving the same look of concern or affection for Banner that makes one pine for Jennifer Connelly from the previous Hulk.There are moments that disappoint or feel unfulfilled (Stan Lee's cameo here is just a plot device for a bit with Banner's blood in a drink where it could've made for something more interesting than a 'hey, it's Stan Lee' cameo), and the drive of the story for Leterrier is to load it with music in pretty much every scene. But then there are those terrific scenes of the Hulk doing what many of us love best about the jolly green giant: smashing s*** up to pieces, and having the occasional King Kong beat as the only one who can make him calm down is the girl of his life. Hell, we even get an artistically amazing scene when the Hulk first emerges out of the shadows and darkness in the factory. And by the time Leterrier gets us to the climax, with Hulk and Abomination facing off, it's like eating a box of candy: CGI coated and with the only necessity to keep the action fast and harrowing, but not rushed.In short, it's an improvement in some ways (not to totally trash Ang Lee's film), and only as satisfying as a big-budget summer popcorn flick can be. It's a fun ride, in short, without too much pretension and good performances (plus, of course, the obligatory 'hint' for an Avengers movie in the last scene).",7,2,10,13 June 2008
Antz," One of the best animated films for ALL ages
","I say this statement because this film is an example of a hybrid (like Close Encounters, or most Anime films) because this film works on many leves. Sure kids will like the animation and when two ants get stuck to a gum-shoe (literally), but how many kids know the themes in this film.  Like individualism, teamwork and stuff.  Kids that wacth this film will probably expect what came from Pixar (Toy Story and A Bug's Life).  But will they be able to understand a line from the lead Z- 'Instead of killing the termites, how about we stuin them, with campaign contributions?'Plot follows a thoughtful Ant named Z (voiced by first time voicer and filmmaker Woody Allen) who, thanks to a trail of circumstances, meets and falls in love with the Princess ant Bala (voiced by a slick Sharon Stone) and gets mixed up in trying to save the colony of ants he lives with underneath Central Park.  An amazing film as far as Anmation goes, and is recommendable for everyone.  I might fear (though I honestly don't beleve) the action sequences between ants and termites are too violent, while adults who love Fellini and Allen films won't appreciate Allen in a film like this. But I don't care, because Allen adds a lot of good humor into the mix of mind-blowing animation and fun.  So watch it, and hopefully enjoy. A",8,2,4,22 October 2000
Mission: Impossible III," as the first turn-off-your-mind and suspend major disbelief action picture of 06, it's decent at best
","I'd be more inclined to recommend Mission: Impossible 3 if I was as ready as I maybe should have been to prepare for the amount of preposterous twists, goofy dialog, and out-of-mind action sequences that this movie holds. But coming from the first two films, which were good on their own terms in doing the summer-Hollywood-popcorn action deal, I thought there might be at least some credibility in some of the parts of the story or characterizations. As it is, this third installment is just OK as far as attaining a level of suspense, even as it goes further and further to wear down my expectations. This is the Tom Cruise world of escapism, after all, and his co-writer/director JJ Abrams (of TV's Alias) is definitely not an un-talented guy by evidence here. Even as his camera goes with a jittery hand-held way, and his editing style pushes into the kind of kinetic mode that might've made Scott/Bruckheimer proud (indeed, there's the kind of dialog in this flick that almost out-ranks their works with cheesy talk).What maybe bugged me throughout the usual strokes of the movie was that, well, just that, the usual strokes going through. There are a couple of twists meant to be of the pretzel kind (but then again who's going for the story), and the enemy of the film in Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is a good one. So, what, if anything, do I really have to criticize about anyway? Is it just a personal preference that, while not by a long-shot, this is my least enjoyed installment in the franchise, or am I just carping about the parts that are maybe better than the whole? Maybe one thing is that in the other two films, while not to a great degree, there was some interest to be had in whatever it was Cruise's Ethan Hunt was seeking out or protecting, and in this film as he goes after the MacGuffin-like Rabbit's foot, the interest just wained and wained. And the more the script tried to intermittently shake the importance of this obscure object of espionage desire, the more I resented it for how much more so they went for the action scenes.A kind of balance that can work in action films is slightly askew this time, and for all the little moments I liked, i.e. Cruise and team's scenes getting in and around the Vatican, part of the chase in Shanghai. While others were just, to put it in short, about as dangerously formulaic as possible (bordering on, if not just, stupid). This being said, I know that if you're reading this and still want to see it anyway, all I can say is have fun, as it is quite a preeminent force in the big, loud, exploding-kind of Hollywood thriller this year. But I would also say it might not be the best to look for either. 6/10",6,8,21,5 May 2006
Requiem for a Dream," A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made)
","Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance. In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination. Like it or not though, this film begs for multiple viewings- and some extra years of looking at other films, which was the case with me. There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end, and nothing will ever be the same for anyone, especially as they're alive and lacking redemption (though if I had to place who's story is most compelling, and performance-wise as well, it would be Burstyn's).",10,20,33,22 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not heartwarming, but fun
","Episode 1 is a good film, but it is by no means the best of the series. True, this is technically the first of the series (or the fourth), and it does set a good stage for the other films, but this film does have it's flaws.  1- Jar Jar Binks!  What drug was Lucas on when he created that character.  I haven't seen a character (a comic relief one at that) as bad as that since Godzilla in 98.  And 2- It's not as heart warming as the last ones, the other films seemed to at least have a good sense of love in it. 
Yet, that doesn't stop writer/director George Lucas form having plenty of fun (including with spectacular visual effects that make up most of the movie) including a terrific Pod Race sequence, great fight scenes, and cool battle action.  But it does prove one thing, that like episode 4, the episode following it (like the dark episiode 5- The Empire Strikes Back) will be dark and good.  Good entertainment anyway.",5,15,30,21 February 2000
10 Cloverfield Lane," I think we're alone now...
","When you think about the towering forces of American character actors - or maybe when character actors just become STARS and household names - I sometimes wonder if John Goodman is someone who not necessarily gets overlooked but he isn't the one you jump to right away. Here is a man who has been in so many modern American films that can be called classics/masterpieces, but when he shows up in something that might be, you know, not quite so much (i.e. Red State) he still brings it a sense of gravitas and makes the character he plays stand out.This might be an odd way to start a review about 10 Cloverfield Lane, but the primary reasons it works, aside from the strong writing and the surefire direction of newcomer Dan Trachtenberg (expect to see him work for a long time if all goes well), can be seen by Goodman's performance. Howard is someone who takes Michelle (also the wonderful/wide-eyed Mary Elizabeth Winstead) off from the road after an accident into an underground bunker on his farm at the address of the title. Howard admits this was his doing, for her 'safety' as the air is not breathable above ground and, with only one other survivor (Emmett, played by an unrecognizable-from-The-Newsroom John Gallagher JR), have to stay until the air above and whatever 'else' is there is clear... which could be years.Goodman has no other choice than to be a force of nature, a constant threat, someone who can be trusted, not be trusted, looked at as someone who was a father, an ex-Navy man, and... may very well be a psychotic madman. In this scenario the name of the game is suspense and paranoia - the music cues that up as the great Bear McReary does his finest work yet channeling Herrmann - and the screws are constantly tightened on audiences expectations. No matter what we're with Michelle on this, but Howard is this lumbering presence, and I don't mean (simply) Goodman's girth or what have you. Psychologically he's imposing, with a voice that has that edge of 'don't you TRUST me? I *saved* your life!' This can be sometimes calm, with that great heaping edge of terror, or maybe something else. The ambiguity about the situation is (and isn't) there from the end of the first act onward, but who Howard is remains something to be seen fully until the third. Oh, and sometimes he may dance a little...Of all things, Cloverfield, the 2008 roller-coaster ride of a monster movie (slightly overrated, in my estimation, but that's just me), is not what I thought of watching this. That film lacked what this had in spades: characterization, real dread and terror, maximum stakes for people who we care about, very few (if any) hasty or stupid decisions (up until arguably the last 10 minutes, which, yes, I'll get to shortly). This reminded me more of another Abrams produced project, Lost. In that, which had many episodes taking place in a bunker setting - and also with a fellow who you couldn't really know what he was up to at first, Benjamin Linus - you had to go from one step to the next, and every moment had mystery and intrigue, but carried along on what human beings are capable of, and what happens when you realize you can't trust someone. And what if is outside is really true? Or not? What is malevolence, or control of one man over a woman or a man over a group?Trachtenberg and the writers (including Whiplash's Damien Chazelle) have an innate love of storytelling without dialog; there is a fair amount of talking, to be sure, but not a word seems wasted when Howard talks to Michelle, or her to him, or when Michelle and Emmett become closer when Howard isn't around. Everything builds to such an intensity, and pays off with such clever and clear logic - not to mention becoming, for a few real, key moments, as much of a horror film as they can get away with (which is a lot) - that it's sort of a shame the last ten minutes are just... alright. This isn't to say they're bad, far from it, but it's when the sort of 'Cinema Sin's counter started to move a little bit as Michelle gets outside, confronts the actual menace there, and Abrams and company start to (sort of) give the 'audience' that came to this movie on its name what they were expecting... which it sort of isn't.This is as much a sequel to Cloverfield as Tarantino made a direct sequel to Django from Corbucci's 1966 film: some of the spirit of dread might be in there somewhere, but one would have to really dig into the kernels of the material to find tangible connections. It's a Twilight Zone episode stretched to feature length, but this is in the best possible way: it's a story that feeds more on what terror anyone can face any day, from the person you know, or think you know, and what danger means in a nightmare scenario like the End of the World. This means it may make those hoping for a monster-mash disappointed, but if you give it a shot you may be paid off by one of the great chamber drama-suspense films in a very long time, with Oscar-worthy performances (no, really).",9,2,7,11 March 2016
3:10 to Yuma," as solid, violent, and sophisticated a Western you'll see this year
","The best western I've seen since the Proposition - which might not mean a lot since it's been a year since that film came out. But while Mangold's film may not have the existential resonance and eerie quality of the Aussie feature, we do have a better-than-average feat of genre film-making, loaded with great machismo presence (and heart), and a feat of storytelling uncompromised by muddled metaphors or Leone copycatting. It's very violent and without too much hope for the characters on the surface by film's end. It looks as though things have suddenly, surprisingly turned against the conventions (whether this is different from the original I can't say having not seen the 1957 film version yet). But underneath, there's a moral code that is evoked brilliantly.The premise is as simple as they come for a story based on a short- originally written by Elmore Leonard early in his career- for a pulp western magazine. Gang outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe, his best performance in quite a few years, even if he could potentially play it in his sleep) is captured without the help of his posse (with icy fast-shooter Ben Foster as second in command), and is sent to be hung for numerous crimes and murders in Yuma. Dan Evans (Christian Bale, terrific as always, usually in silence) is a rancher who is in danger of losing his land if he doesn't get enough money together, and so takes the job of being part of the group (among them an old and weary and hard-ass Peter Fonda as Bryon McElroy). It's a tale where good versus evil should be well defined, but this where the conventions sort of get muddled, which is really what starts to make 3:10 to Yuma more than just a star vehicle or blockbuster of the week.Beneath the veneer of each man lies truths that haunt them, and have made either one into how they are in the present. Wade is calculating and evil, but somehow has a level of honor beneath his countless sins; watch him tell of reading the bible cover to cover as a kid after getting it from his mother, and then never seeing her again. Or how Evans got his war wound, how he hides that simple fact from his children, even from his son (William Lerman, maybe the most limited performance as his sole motivation is 'I'll go with you', though still does it well enough to act with the best of them). There's some level of understanding that forms between Wade and Evans, and amid the countless gun battles and wounds faced against Apaches, train workers, and the whole town of Contention, loaded with gun power, as the train is soon on its way, neither man can ever quite give in, aside from what the end goal entails.Mangold directs this picture like a pro in the tradition of someone like Howard Hawks- a few really good scenes (the climactic battle through the town, a dinner scene between captured Wade and the Evans family, and maybe the scene between Wade and Evans in the hotel room, among maybe one other I can't pin down), no bad ones. It's interesting to read the only substantial criticism of this 2007 version of 3:10 to Yuma being too long, where the original was just right in length. But nothing seems to be fattening to the storyline here, and the script keeps things moving along at a very tense pace while never stopping for a moment of characterization, like one of the campfire scenes. And giving enough breathing room for actors like Crowe and Bale allow for them to do what they do best.In this near-classic feature that works as a very respecting throwback to tragic tales of doomed men in the guise of typical Hollywood product, while working finitely as a pure action movie for today's audiences, 3:10 to Yuma is taut, precise and superlative as a 'guy' flick.",8,6,14,11 September 2007
Ali," I like your show and I admire your style...
","Michael Mann's Ali is a film that has the elements in place for a movie that could've been better than it is.  It has the performances- Will Smith is a good choice for Ali and in his best scenes he shows some real talent (the best scenes with him were when he was in front of the TV camera with or without Voight as Cosel), Jamie Foxx as Bundini, Ali's half-drunken inspiration who gives the film a added comic punch, and Jon Voight in a miraculous transformation as Cosel who plays off Smith's Ali with the greatest of ease.  Plus the boxing scenes were (sometimes) quite enthralling.But like I said, these are the elements in place to make a good movie, but the film doesn't pull through.  Mann goes too long with details that aren't needed to illustrate Ali's thoughts and feelings and in contrast shows Ali and what he wants to do in and out of the ring but never gets inside of his psyche totally which would've been really interesting.  It is a longish and sluggish picture that at times can be good and at other times can be actually annoying: what is the point of the overlong jogging scene in Zaire, the overuse of dramatic music in scenes where it's not needed (I don't mind music for dramatic use but every 30 seconds is something I do mind) and having Martin Luther King's assassination when he plays a lot lesser of a role than Malcolm X did for Ali?  Overall, Smith is able to pull through as do other members of the cast, and there are things to look for, yet it's not worth sitting through the constant lulls.  If you want to see a great Mann movie rent Insider, Heat or even Manhunter.  C+",6,1,3,28 December 2001
The Expendables 2," the guiltiest pleasure? I lost some brain cells...
","The Expendables 2 is loud, violent, messy, and yet, mostly, pretty enjoyable. At its best it embraces its stupid-macho outlook and aesthetic, and if you don't go with it after the first big set-piece (well, let's just say didn't go with it in the first one), then just leave the theater and don't try to come back. It has a premise - men go into a mission to bring a girl to get some map for a mine with plutonium (sadly, no Doc Brown available), and then a villain (no, his name is Jean Villain, which is French for John Villain), and then they have to get back at him when he kills one of the Expendables (a 'Red Shirt', don't get worried).Aside from that... who needs plot anyway, stupid f***ers? Let's KILL! And let's have not just walk-ons this time but extended cameos - not just with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis either, but Chuck Norris (ok, ease those erections fan-boys)! And Hey, who needs really firm grasps on how bullets or physics or an airplane crashing through a mountain works, it's an Expendables flick! The movie takes once again off of the mood of 80's/90's B/C/D action movies. Notice I mention C and D. There is such a dearth of intelligence here that if you go in trying to analyze anything, then, again, you're up blank. All that's here with context is male 'we're gonna get im' mentality and, yeah, if you want that, you got it.For the benefit of the filmmakers, they do a better job engaging with the characters than in the first one, and Simon West, not an 'auteur' with any personality, can manage action scenes and the usual 'shoot fire shoot' cinematography with more competency than Stallone did himself as director with the first movie. The problem, as was (also moreso) with the first movie, is that along with being a 'tribute' to the 80's action fare, it's also the same generic dialog and character relationships. Where it does help is some scenes, not all, have funny camaraderie with the group, with Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, and Jason Statham. When they can all interact, like going over what their ideal final meal would be (and lines like 'Cereal, how about Earrios?'), it's genuinely fun.Other times, when the action ramps up like in the opening, and especially the last twenty minutes of the movie, it just ramps up being totally senseless except for LOTS AND LOTS OF DEAD BODIES! And one- liners ('I now pronounce you men and knife' '(Insert old-catch phrase here)'). It's still not technically *good* filmmaking or storytelling, per-say, but I could enjoy its dumbness when I left my more critical faculties. That is, except when Stallone himself would try to seriously act, even in small instances, which made me most embarrassed of all as he has lost most of the charisma that used to be with him as a star in his hey-day. In reality, the Expendables 2 works best with anyone *not* Stallone, be it Van Damme's cardboard villain, the other Expendables interacting, and even by Willis/Ah-nuld/Norris. Yes, Norris, the most overrated action star of the past thirty years has his moment in the sun.The movie made me alternately bored, ashamed, entertained, amused, thrilled, and dulled by the action and chaotic violence, to the point where I lost track of the body count and wanted the chaotic- unintentional-comedy to be ramped up further. While Expendables 2 is a Bad-Good improvement (if that makes sense, which it probably doesn't), I hope if they make a third one to get someone more ingrained in over-the- top B-movie-dom like Robert Rodriguez. The movie at times goes over the edge into the absurd, but then it goes back to being the same sort of just-OKAY tribute to the older action flicks and star vehicles. I say, make it MORE meta and MORE gonzo. Then you'll have something different and truly exciting.",6,2,5,25 August 2012
Source Code," like a Twilight Zone episode... only a very good one, and by a strong director
","Duncan Jones and science fiction, after only two films, makes for a pretty darn good fit. With 'Moon' he had an exploration of an astronaut losing his mind on a spaceship with a talking Kevin Spacey robot as his only companion, and it was a surprisingly entertaining-but-deep exploration into consciousness and what it's like to be lonely in space. Now with Source Code he has a more traditional Hollywood film - a ticking time-bomb scenario that doubles back on itself repeatedly as a soldier (Jake Gyllenhaal) is caught up in a mission to find out where a bomb will go off on a train heading towards Chicago. It's a time travel movie, in a sense. I say that last part since Jones and his writer do something clever and unexpectedly touching with it: the character is not exactly on the train, but rather his 'self' is transplanted into the body of another man on the train, with an attractive woman (Michelle Monaghan) and he has to keep looking for clues at to first where the bomb is and second who will set it off.But, as with any good Twilight Zone style story, there's twists and turns that make for an unexpected trip. What's somewhat unexpected is how much heart the director puts into the material. It's as much, if not moreso, about a man having to come to terms with his own mortality and his relationship with his father that was left without resolution before this mission. Plus there's the whole thing of 'can-you-change-the-past' kind of thing and what this Source Code could provide, which is akin to what was done in Twelve Monkeys only with more to-the-minute timing ala 24. I was drawn into the science of it, and the trickier questions of 'is this 'right'' as coming from essentially a military-prevention-weapon' stand-point (and Jeffrey Wright's character, kind of channeling Cornel West?).Aside from the cleverness displayed in the plotting, which is classic in its science fiction appeal and how it deals with the mystery without too many flash and gimmicks (mostly relying on some solid supporting characters, the kind that might pop up as 'characters' in a Hitchcock train picture), the acting from Gyllenhaal is really a winner here. Maybe it's cause of what's there in the character to explore, and his relationships and connections with the outside world that were left unresolved, but he really knocks it out of the park here, as he's stuck in this chamber of sorts for half of the movie in-between when he's zapped back to the train and has to think quickly on his feet. As an actor Gyllenhaal has always had his charms, but now as he grows older with this film and last year's Love & Other Drugs he's come into his own as an actor-star. Just watch as he calls up his 'father' on the train near the end. It's more moving that I would have ever expected.Sure the film has a few minor faults with some of the supporting actors- I never believed that 'comic' on the subway car, and the villain when he's revealed is a little too simplistic for this story- but the main story is tight and it makes real suspense out of the 'will this happen' and then has a big reveal near the end that turns the story completely on its head. It's still a 'Hollywood' blockbuster, but it features the same attention to 'smart' (or just not-as-crappy) science fiction that Jones showed with his previous film. I look forward to whatever he does next. 8.5/10",8,3,7,12 April 2011
Skyfall," unambigously a pleasurable movie-going experience
","007 is after a hard-drive. In the opening a chase, one of those breathless ones that populate a lot of Bond films, ensues, but it being Bond he has to get a little flashy (but just a little) when it comes to a train: on top of it, with a bulldozer on it, and then a fight with the baddie right there. After a botched 'Take a shot!' order from M, Naomie Harris' agent sends Bond off the train and into... death(?) Or just a little vacation from Mum ('M', Judi Dench believable as ever, even more conviction as she gets older), who has to deal with this drive still missing, this explosive MacGuffin that calls to question what MI6 is actually *doing* in the first place? Are there 'shadows' anymore? Or are there just freaks with revenge plots that take years and meticulous planning to shape? But Bond is Bond (and word is Bond), so he returns. But will it all be the same? A real 'MOVIE' in big capital letters (much like The Avengers and The Cabin in the Woods earlier this year). A meaty thriller that takes itself seriously, but it never takes itself SO seriously that it becomes a film, which may be the key difference between this and the Dark Knight (which is what Mendes claims was the inspiration... or was it what he wanted to critique in a way? Skyfall acts as tribute to Bond, its own cohesive unit as a 007 entry, AND film-analysis of what makes Bond work compared to other blockbusters). Does it always make sense for 007 to make a quip after something tragic like a death of someone close to him? But, hey, it's another glass of scotch that shan't go to waste as well.It's a solid plot, the visual pleasures via Roger Deakins where every shot, every unit in an action set piece, get even MORE gorgeous on repeat viewings (the entire Shangahi-tower sequence is so breathtaking because it''s about how we watch it, it calls attention to itself carefully but deliberately with many mirrored images, like a neon-lit fun-house ala Orson Welles, but with silhouettes and a thrilling Thomas Newman back-beat). And while Javier Bardem slithers with gay joy here (both the gayness of a 1950's happy-go-lucky kid with a bunch of 'radio' toys, and a vengeful man who may have been decent once but it's long gone in innuendo and grandiosity made flesh), Craig is also keenly subtle when he wants/needs to be, and it adds to him being such a bad motherf****r (look, seriously, it's right on that gun that only he can shoot). Not to mention Ben Whishaw earning his marks as the new 'Q' as a 'kid with spots', and Harris being Earthy, sensual, but can also hold her own when the action comes down. If anyone is given more humdrum work to do it's, oddly enough, Ralph Fiennes. That's alright - Skyfall needs one guy waiting in the wings to fully join the franchise. Bond is resurrected once more, and his hobby is spine-tingling, and at the same time about what it's about: you love Bond, it's a treat, you're a newcomer, it's good storytelling about a story that isn't new but not tired, and for those who couldn't care less about Bond... well, at least watch the opening titles and every nano-second with Bardem. Please. Do it for Mom.",10,3,17,14 November 2012
Catch Me If You Can," it did make money over its time... entertaining
","...but did Steven Spielberg's latest Blockbuster-fodder, Catch Me If You Can, have to be released now? The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks have already turned in their best for the year (Gangs of New York and Road to Perdition, respectively), even if those performances weren't great, and Spielberg's other chase film released during the summer, Minority Report, was one of his best films. While the release date shouldn't directly effect the film itself, it might've given Scorsese's Gangs a little chance to breath without having this and that as two Leo films at once during the Christmas-break film rush. Catch..is inspired by the story of Frank W. Abignale Jr., who as a teen became a con-man, impersonating an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc, and was finally caught in France. DiCaprio plays Frank, and tries to play him as a suave, if occasionally panicked, teen, and while there have been worse performances this year, it is very clear that the better work for him is in Gangs, not here- he's often too straightforward with his emotions and only hints to that he's someone outside of a conniver. Hanks, on the other hand, does a decent job, with a keen accent and demeanor, and Christopher Walken, who plays Abignale Sr., turns in the best performance of the film, and shows more depth than his son in the few scenes he has. Overall, there are some moments of fun that shine through, like when Frank Jr. does his first con as a school teacher at 16, or when he fools Hanks at the Miami airport, yet it can be seen in many scenes that more challenging material was manipulated by Spielberg and company. Still, it should appeal to the mass market of movie-goers.....this is a re-edit some four years later. On repeat viewings, the film works better. DiCaprio actually works as more effective with his character, and even Hanks becomes more interesting than just 'decent'. B+",9,3,5,25 December 2002
The Hangover," a near unapologetic pleasure - better than Old School
","The Hangover, until its closing credits, is a little like the Reservoir Dogs of bachelor party movies; as we never saw the heist in Dogs, we never see the party in this film. It becomes like a comedy-of-errors trapped in a mystery-riddle-enigma where three guys, Alan, Stu, and Phil (Galifianakas, Helms, Copper) can't seem to find their buddy, Doug, who is, you know, the groom in the wedding happening in one day. So, their quest leads them on a path of the unlikely and outrageous. There's a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet when they wake from their stupor. When they leave to look for them Stu finds out he got married to a hooker (Heather Graham, very funny bit part) and she even has her grandmother's holocaust ring. As you might have seen in the trailer Alan's line 'I didn't know they gave out rings at the holocaust', that should give a glimpse of other classic tid-bits in the movie. Oh yeah, and there's Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins, an effeminate Asian gangster (maybe the only meh stereotype done), and an scene with Rob Riggle that, damn his weak Daily Show bits, is really hysterical.Oh sure, if you think about the movie for too long then it's predictable and not all the jokes work 100%. But so much of it does, and the director Todd Phillips, making the third round on this kind of outrageous-guy-buddy-comedy flick (before was the good Road Trip and the sometimes good sometimes overrated Old School) is assured with his craft here. What appears to be just a situation being told does become a story, with separate conflicts (i.e. the nice Mercedes, Stu's fractured relationship with his girlfriend), and spectacular camaraderie between the three main stars. To give away many more of the gags, some of them so obvious that they work because of the attitude of Galifianakis and the style of comedy Ed Helms has perfected from his time at the Office, towards scenes that could be played for simple laughs. There's real wit here, and a sense of 'what-the-f***' going on at every turn that makes it worthwhile.So, grab your buddies, sneak in some beers, and get ready to kick back with some guys you might recognize, maybe so close you'll be wondering if art imitates life a little much (save, perhaps, for Fat Jesus jokes, ha-ha), on a road trip in Vegas. Delicate sensibilities need not apply, as all will be offended at some point, even with mild jokes like Mike Epps' character having the same name as the missing bachelor-groom ('Black Doug', 'White Doug'). Did I mention Mike Tyson sings and throws punches in-between? One can't decide if this or his recent documentary takes the cake for Tyson's comeback via cinema.",8,6,13,5 June 2009
Iron Man 3," Action, humor, stakes, flaws, and a whole lotta Downey & Kingsley & Pearce
","Iron Man 'Three'. I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the 'twist', but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it's the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we're living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it's media manipulation. It doesn't over-do it; and the actor's revelation is just splendid. I can see why it'd p-off some folks though, especially if you really really really wanted to see this particular character.This would be higher up on the list of Marvel movies in general, except for one really irksome character flaw at the end. What is an otherwise highly entertaining and smashingly-though-darkly absurd climactic battle on a bunch of naval ships, which is that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) decides to blow up his remaining suits. It seemed like such a needless act, even for the likes of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), especially as we in the audience know how many more times Stark will return in the suit in future films (whether it's *only* Avengers 2 or other films, it's not a question of if but how much).And yet, aside from this, it's a fun summer movie that takes some real chances – Ben Kingsley, nuff said – and always keeps its heart in the right place as Stark, who faces some big risks with the likes of the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian, doesn't stop for a sarcastic barb, a moment of self-conscious knowing, and Black as writer/director keeps the action, humor, thrills, and spectacle moving at an intelligent, coherent clip, not to mention Downey, who fills the role and conflicts of Stark with bravura as always. It was the only summer blockbuster I could stand seeing more than once (though I really tried for another HUGE spectacle, which we'll get to in a moment).",8,17,28,8 November 2014
Marie Antoinette," Coppola's personal take on a historical figure is keen, hip, too loose and very stylish
","Sofia Coppola challenges the idea of doing a costume/period drama with her film Marie Antointte, and it's an interesting exercise in the art of showing how empty and frivolous royalty can be. It also reminded me that, compared with this, Lost in Translation's screenplay is actually much more focused and cohesive- in the sense of the structure of nothing going on (yet things seeming to be going on all the time). It's a European style character study where the characters don't have a whole lot of depth to them, even if the first hour or so delivers on being absorbing entertainment and craftsmanship (err, Craft-woman-ship now I guess). Coppola has her heels dig very well into the history and period detail of it, but she's actually not even that interested in the politics and the main desires of the people of France and elsewhere in Europe (in fact it isn't until the last ten minutes that the audience is really aware of a mass public who hates their guts to pieces). The world of the French royalty in the late 18th century- where Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is plucked up from Austria at 14 and picked to be the breeder for Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman)- is an insulated one, and the picture really becomes about how these two young people deal with this kind of heavenly constrictive paradise.Coppola does a lot to make the costume drama a lot more spiffy and fun than one might find in the common Ivory/Merchant film. We get 80's pop and new-wave songs on the soundtrack, many times over in the midst of some regular classical music in the halls of the Versailles. And there are many a montage devoted to shoes and pastries and cake. But through this, as mentioned above, the first hour is the most compelling and fascinating, as the first twenty minutes actually come off more or less like it could be all silent- the images totally speak for themselves, in the very restrained, always-pattered way of life that's lead for Marie and the King. It becomes apparent that Louis isn't really all that interested in her- matter of fact not really interested in anything at all, kind of incurious aside from his locks and hunting (kind of sound familiar, cough- Bush- cough). Schwartzman plays this superbly well, with a countering to what Dunst does with her main female protagonist. While Schwartzman is always reserved, a little dim, and trying to always cling to the proper ways up until the last dinner, Dunst's Marie starts off not totally sure what to make of this environment, and finds that the escapism of this world is the only way to find some kind of fulfillment, however shallow it might be.It's in the second half, however, that Coppola's script becomes a little more than meandering. It's like as if things just seem to be happening, though not really at the same time. While there is always the obvious, welcome influence of Antonioni lurking in many scenes (Coppola admitted to him being an influence at the 04 Oscars), particularly towards the end in showing the lack of true emotive connectedness between people in the upper class, there is also a lack of cohesion to all of this that wasn't as apparent in 'Translation'. There is a good sub-plot involving Marie's tryst with an American officer, but more often than not we get scenes with her doing not much at all, wandering aimlessly, fooling around with her kids, wandering hallways, etc. Moments like these are fine over the main context of the first part, as Marie is under pressure to bear children, but after a while the thread, however loose, gets a little un-reeled. Even an interesting moment like transitioning through time via paintings becomes obvious.In the end, I liked what I saw, and liked the intentions that Coppola had with the material, and especially the cast that she assembled (aside from the other two, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, Steve Coogan, Rip Torn, Molly Shannon and Marianne Faithful are among the many talented members of the cast), but it didn't amount to something that would mark it as a great film or even as an important one. It's a well produced, self-conscious interpretation that gives a few sparks to the notion of how material like this can be approached differently, though also longer and not as altogether as it thinks it is. I'd love to find the soundtrack though.",7,3,5,24 October 2006
The Ring," a remake with its own impressive, terrifying perspective that works
","Coming back to The Ring, having (unfortunately) yet to see the original Ringu or Japanese Ring features, it is most involving and absorbing as an effort of a filmmaker who takes the materials of convention and forms them into terrifying shapes. It's all about ambiance, really, and director Gore Verbinski doesn't take any of this in a silly manner, or one that he would want us to think is too silly. It's about a video tape that when watched in seven days the viewer of said tape (a series of images not unlike a master's class at a university in gut-wrenching and eye-tumbling surrealism) will die.The characters in the ring investigate this, and come upon some familiar tropes of the ghost story and of things like sentience (I got a particular feeling and connection back to the Shining, no pun intended), but Verbinski's intent is to grip the viewer in a story that keeps to itself very well, is filmed without the gimmicks of, for example, Michael Bay's productions of remake-horror crap, and features actors that can make us believe this material. As with other superior ghost-story horror movies this decade like the Orphanage, it appreciates what is possible in just lighting a room, in letting a character take time to see things and experience them in a visceral manner so that we can as well, and Verbinski and his write bring on images that are inescapable (i.e. the horse on the ship, the girl crawling out of the TV and going across the room).It's a crafty piece of slick Hollywood horror, and it's intrigued me enough to go back to the unseen source material, which is the best a remake can do aside from its potential re-watchability. 8.5/10",8,5,10,25 October 2002

","The perfect action-adventure matinée movie? Damn near close. If I had to pick it apart I could find a couple of things that aren't exactly flaws but just aren't sensible (ie how Marion just happens to be alive with the explanation of one line). But who need sense when you've got HISTORY, DR JONES?! One thing I noticed this time around though - Marion is really a bad-ass woman! In the annals of tough gals, she may not be Ripley but she could hold her own in a bar fight that had Ripley in it (see how she drinks anyone under the table, and can be sly with a, uh, butter knife!) Maybe it's just in comparison to the horror that is Kate Capshaw, the polar opposite of bad-ass.But yeah, what else can be said? It's the kind of storytelling that feels so seamless that it almost goes by in a flash, but there's still so much UMPH in those action set-pieces, primarily when Jones is chasing Belloq and the Nazis and drives the truck. Damn if that still doesn't rock one's the socks off. One last thing - the special effects was done by Richard Edlund, who three years later would make the masterpiece of his 80's career with Ghostbusters - I say that since now I can't watch certain sky and make-up fx in this film without yelling ZUUL!",10,1,6,13 November 2000
Spartacus," Not Perfect, but better than Ben-Hur
","Stanely Kubrick's Spartacus is a good epic of a film, but it is by no means perfect.  Especially because this is Kubrick's only true Hollywood movie. Luckily, Kirk Douglas comes to the rescue as Spartacus.  The gladiator who wants to be free.  With his terrific acting abilities and gets the film going when it lulls.  And even though the film does go over long, Kubrick still makes it work and gets a damn near close masterpiece here.",10,0,5,13 February 2000
Deepwater Horizon," honest and harrowing, led by three remarkable performances
","Deepwater Horizon can't help but be compared to Clint Eastwood's Sully if only because they each came out within a month of each other (if that), and they both involve hard-working, dedicated professionals at their job who pay a varying degree of prices for being at the right place but the most wrong time possible. While one certainly carries the Pedigree of Legends(TM) at the helm, I think that what makes Horizon the better movie is that Berg doesn't muck around with telling his story: these men went to this oil rig (after a safety team left very prematurely), and after a couple of Negative Impact tests the entire rig went to s*** and caught fire.No, more than that, it turned into the kind of disaster we often take for granted in big 100+ million tentpoles. Only difference here, it's not oil riggers drawn up by Michael Bay - these guys were real, and goddamn it, Peter Berg will make you KNOW it! This is a somewhat manipulative film emotionally speaking, but then Berg isn't out to make something subtle - he can't when it involves a story that is (do I have a synonym I can use for this word, nah, fine) explosive as the one he has here. Like Sully too it's not overlong, clocking in at 96 minutes. Unlike that film this doesn't have such detail into the investigation of what happened after the fact, probably because Berg and his producers and team know there's WAY more than enough drama in just detailing what happened to lead up to the explosion and how it got so out of control. It's a film cut in half structurally: the first is all set-up, giving us the dedicated workers (Mark Wahlberg as our hero, which is emphasized because he's the only one with a wife apparently with Kate Hudson on the other end; Kurt Russell as the character who may be missing from a Howard Hawks movie; John Malkovich playing his best kind of villain, which is slimy and yet icily intelligent), then the second is when things go to hell.I think the structure works well most of all for the film, and all the actors bring not just emotional intensity; Wahlberg isn't always Olivier (who ever said he was on the other hand), but put him as a commanding but unassuming blue-collar guy and he can give it a great degree of truth. It almost (no, what 'almost', it does) goes into overload in the final minutes of its climax as he and one other character are left on the oil rig, and his character hits the apex of being a Mega-Hero (part of the manipulation I think is strategic - Berg and co. know nearly everyone seeing this movie won't know if Mike Williams comes out alive at the end or not, so all the set-up with his wife and kid at home makes it seem both very obvious and very not). Meanwhile, Russell and Malkovich make good opposing figures, one all about safety as his character in the New Webster Dictionary definition under IRONY gets a safety award within minutes of the devastation, the other all about... well, his own kind of logic, but deep down all about money.If anyone brought a degree of dimension it actually was Malkovich, who certainly doesn't appear to be someone we are going to have much sympathy with - he comments at one point that BP's worth of 185 billion will go up to 186 with some extra time shaved off to get the oil out - but he also has a job to do, in his way. He seems more pathetic by the end of the film than someone who has been crushed by any other opposing force, and really the villain of the story is fate and pressing against nature: you f*** with the Earth too much and it will fight back. But there's also in Berg's vision not a heavy deal of commentary there either; if you feel guilty driving in your car from the movie theater after seeing this, it's less a direct result of the film's message than it is a by-product.If there are marks against the filmmaker it's that he brings the same hyper-kinetic shaky-camera style and editing, how he brings us into the filmic space of this location and as the situation unfolds so tragically, and it gets to be much. At times. I say that qualifier because there are some moments, mostly when characters are finding one another in the darkened and chaotic mess right after the explosion, how Mike finds Mr Jimmy and the others, and there it works well. It's when Berg has to cut between so many multiple points of view - the Coast Guard getting things together, men getting on to lifeboats, the woman being put under immense pressure at the station to get things moving (or not, under direct orders), and Kate Hudson at home - that it goes into over-drive. Not so much that I ever lost the thread or felt an emotional disconnect, but it did remind me in an uncanny way 'hey, it's STILL a movie... mostly... you know, right?!' I think Deepwater Horizon is a good movie. It's honest in its presentation and the depictions of these men on the rig before the explosion, with just enough humanity to them (not to be confused with depth) that you can get invested when it kicks into 1000x gear, and near the very end there's some hard gut-punches that are more about how this *is* a trauma for those who lived through it and it may never go away completely. Could it have been a masterpiece? Not sure... maybe if James Cameron had been there.",8,2,4,14 October 2016
United 93," Greengrass's masterpiece
","Watching United 93, I was suddenly reminded of a paper I had been writing about the director Roberto Rossellini and his post-war 'trilogy' of Italian neo-realist films. Not necessarily because United 93 is about the struggles of the poor in a post-war environment. But because of the qualities of the neo-realist filmmaker's attempts to capture reality as honestly as possible. Like Rossellini, writer/director Paul Greengrass uses real locations, and while not non-professional actors all unknowns in the cast, and does what critic Andre Bazin once wrote, 'directs the facts.' The film captures the most harrowing aspects of that morning that shook everyone in America (and the world) without pretense or melodrama. There's not a trace of director Greengrass exploiting those who died in the line of a terrorist takeover. And, like Rossellini's films, there is genuine emotion achieved for the audience by just putting up human beings up on the screen, without full-on characterization or over-whelming Hollywood sentimentality. Basically, what Greengrass gives the audience is this 'what it is is what it is.' This is a power that few filmmakers can pull off, yet he is able to achieve it with what will very likely be the best film of the year released by a major studio.One of the ways Greengrass is successful is in the style that he uses. In a way, he chooses to abandon all noticeable technique. His cinema verite camera, led with a tenseness that is rather shocking in its non-stop approach by Barry Akyroyd, lets the audience in as if you don't notice what is exactly going on at any given moment. The story is less that than it is just the eventual unfolding of the events. And he cuts between two very specific sets- the air traffic controllers and Norad, and the plane itself. It's important to point out that just in the sheer film-making and pacing, aside from the significance behind the subject matter, shows the filmmaker able to create true taut suspense. One wonders when the hijackers will finally get up from the seats. One wonders if the air traffic controllers will know if the plane is THE plane, among the many others scrambled at the moment, amid the chaos of the twin towers. And one wonders what will happen to the passengers, as they call with every ounce of fear and horror to their loved ones on the ground. And throughout, the tension just keeps on building like a brutal, bleak-as-Bergman vice.The film has been drawn criticism for being 'too soon' in depicting a dramatization of the events of 9/11, and even for being too disturbing for some. To put it mildly, it's not an easy film. The way that Greengrass ends the film alone marks it as enough to make some in the audience just ball their eyes out with tears. But, again like Rossellini and other filmmakers assured with their intent in the depiction, it's not the kind of film that tries to cheat its audience like too many Hollywoodized bio-pics do. The film starts off mundanely, and then pits into a kind of tunnel of consciousness of the situation at hand. It's truly the kind of work that isn't afraid to provoke a response out of its viewers, which (as an American) was all the more rewarding for me. Like many great films, it asks underlying questions while still working as a piece of storytelling and action, and even through the shaky camera one never wants to look away. In short, I recommend the film to, well, just about anybody, even to those who think of the subject matter as being too taboo, which it is not at all. Stripped from the usual abstractions association in the years following 9/11, it's a peak that Greengrass may never be able to reach again. And so far as of fall 2006, the best film I've seen this year.",10,5,11,2 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Yeah, it's a masterpiece, but... yeah, it is.
","Alright, alright, you got me, ET is a great movie - mostly for the little moments that Steven Spielberg captures in the first half (or first two-thirds) before it becomes the big emotional spectacle that the director deals with as something he has to do as a Capra fan. What I loved was seeing the early, 'hmm' part of Elliot/ET's friendship, where its a bit like a boy and his dog, only the ET is much more curious than a dog (and he can TALK!) I can't deny this is a director at the peak of his powers. That said, my one real 'but' is in that sense it's like his North by Northwest; Hitchcock, too, was at the peak of his powers with that, making as much a symphony as a movie. It's just not 'personal' favorite of mine (I still get more from Close Encounters).Nevertheless, also like NBNW, this is a very entertaining film at its core, with a lot of shameless laughs (Gertie SCREAMS! ET SCREAMS BACK!), and it has BY FAR John Williams greatest score. It helps that he scored some of the film without even really watching the film cause it didn't all match up. I could listen to this just as classical music, not even as a 'this track goes here, that goes there' with the scenes. If it's not Spielberg's greatest film, he still gets the greatest assist from his closest collaborator.",10,4,9,12 April 2000
It," creepy, with a talented director at the helm
","IT, directed by Andres Muschietti, fires on all of the cylinders it has to, and I think my perspective on it is that it does so much that impresses, aside from attempting and mostly succeeding at adapting the ambition of King's book, is that it does a lot that horror movies today DON'T do. This movie doesn't, for example, over-crowd you with jump scares; oh, it has a couple, don't get me wrong, but they aren't so distracting that it ruins the movie (or, for that matter, have the final shot of the film be the character lunging at the camera, like it's a theme park ride and we need one more 'good' scare), and Andy Muschietti and his DP (who usually shoots Park Chanwook films) pour on the atmosphere here while at the same time NOT doing the thing where horror movies drain the color palette or make things blue. This is a director who trusts the audience and, as the opening weekend would show, it seems to have paid off.He's also attentive to casting everyone just right (only the young actor playing Stan Uris feels like he's just 'okay', but that may be because everyone around him, especially the actors playing Bill and Beverly, are so fully invested in their roles, and by the way casting one of the main kids from Stranger Things to be Richie is so on the nose I love it), and to making Derry feel like a real place - or, if not *as* much as the book does, as much as can be done in a two-hour movie. There are certainly predictable parts to the narrative, as there may have been to its source (mostly this is felt for me when it gets to the second act end and into the third, with some of the CGI in the climax being less than impressive - oh, some of it is really good, and some of it... is not).On top of everything else, Skarsgard surprises with a sinister interpretation of Pennywise. You won't get another Tim Curry performance, you just can't really, but the direction Skarsgard goes in is full of a darkness but also... well, let's put it this way, once you see that scene between Pennywise and Georgie in the opening by the sewer drain, you can believe that this clown *might* appeal to small, impressionable children before, literally, feeding off their fear as well as flesh. It's a turn where every time he came on screen and did something (with the exception of those couple of jump-scares, which made the trailer give the impression it would not be so solid), I was smiling in not a scared expression but simply being entertained by a performer giving it his all. I really hope he gets to do a lot more things as an actor because this is a star-making turn.In closing: the critic who said in one review, 'This is not the best Stephen King movie, but it comes close, but it is the MOST Stephen King movie' hit it on the head. It isn't great overall and yet I had a blast watching it from start to finish: it's emotional and dramatic and earns those beats; it shows friendship in childhood as a powerful and necessary thing to have and keep a hold of; it's there to scare the hell out of you if you're open to it; and it shows how a good lot of people are... really f***ing creepy. One last thing: it doesn't over-do it's 80's references, and if they're used it's either for actual plant & pay-off in the story (i.e. New Kids on the Block) or a thematic connection (Nightmare on Elm Street 5 is playing at a local theater? You don't say) 8.5/10",8,5,14,10 September 2017
Casablanca," a classic that's known to people long before they actually see the movie
","For years when I was younger I thought I had seen Casablanca, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I actually SAW the entire thing from start to finish. Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense. It's a must-see-once kind of movie, even if you find that you don't like the movie.And the cast is probably one of the best reasons to see it. It's really got the best crop of stars and character actors from Warner brothers and beyond. Bogart and Bergman have their spotlight on them here at full blast and they each deliver impeccable performances in roles that aren't too unexpected, but never less than stylish and dramatic. Then there's Peter Lorre, Peter Greenstreet, and of course Claude Raines who probably gives if not his most memorable performance one of his most striking. It's rare that an actor is given such a part that really fits him and still keeps a hold on the viewer so many years later. From the story intrigue and deception and danger involving the Nazis, the heroism and sacrifice that gets involved, and at the core of it- after the club which Bogie owns- is the love triangle that gets resolved in a somber way that makes for a sensational ending. In fact, it's main goal is to be sensational, and for the most part it's truly successful, from its 'a kiss is just a kiss' song to the sweet one-liners.",10,5,8,26 August 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The best family film of the 80's
","I say this film is a family film because that is what it is.  Anyone in the family will like it.  It pitches it's animated rabbit to the kids, and for the teens and adults, they can look for humor in other things.  The plot is a complicated one (like most detective mysteries) that brings a drunken detective back to the detective game of cartoons.  Sometimes funny, sometimes compassionate, always entertaining.  With director Zemeckis bringing one of the best animated films in a film that is half live action/half animated. It is a landmark in visual effects and nothing like this will ever come around again.

One Hundred and One Dalmatians," maybe not the 'best', but certainly a lot of fun
","Disney's 101 Dalmations is fine for kids. Whether it really holds up for adults I'm not sure - I actually haven't seen the whole film in quite a while. But it holds up, for what it's worth, in my mind as a fun spectacle for kids. There are so many Dalmatians, naturally, not all of them can get personalities. Most of them don't, really. The real focal point though is the villain - Cruella DeVille - and of course with villains like her, who needs strong heroes? She, and the actress voicing her, Betty Lou Gerson, are eating up scenery with the large fur coats and wild,crazy eyes. Even her design is creative and just a bit warped in that villainous way to hold up well; I still remember her driving in the climax and that being as memorable a set piece as any in the classic Walt Disney animation era (that is, before his death).And it's enough that the Dalmatians can get around with some direction - and some help of furry friends (the shaggy dog Colonel and the cat Segreant Tibbs, are very entertaining and funny supporting characters) - to get through the narrative. So that even if they aren't always as great as the villain, they have enough to keep things moving. The animation itself is not as 'polished' as the widescreen epic that came before it, Sleeping Beauty, but that's fine.More than fine; this is a cartoon, and it has some of the rough contours of the animation studio trying to find their way, and, usually, getting there. Apparently Xerox was also used to make copies of all the dogs, and there's kind of a hypnotic quality to the shots of them all running in unison, one after another after another. It's scratchy, and this would continue for a number of movies (Aristocats for one), but I liked the look - it's taking a chance on a different style, and it connects in the way to the high-velocity adventure style of the story.So, for the kids? Sure. For adults? Well, there's always Cruella.",8,3,3,23 November 2014
Minority Report," You still have a choice...
","Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects.  Minority Report is a shining example of that, which also has the grace of having an intelligent concept to start with, which so many sci-fi films lack much less summer sci-fi films (look at MIB2 to see what I mean), and also better than average acting.Cruise takes the lead role here as John Anderton, who leads, more or less, the agency of police that prevent all murders on the basis of predictions from three Pre-Cogs (one of them Samantha Morton who has the most important role of the three).  The system is presumably perfect, until to the surprise of Anderton, he is seen to commit a murder and so starts his quest to try and find out if there is a flaw in thirty six hours.  This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures. Grade: A+ or A",10,61,88,21 June 2002
Lifeboat," a Hitchcock 'talking heads' picture, and what talk! WW2 melodrama at its most provocative
","Alfred Hitchcock has often put himself to certain tests as a filmmaker, if for nothing else probably just to get the blood flowing a bit in-between his big commercial projects. In the case of Lifeboat though it is and it isn't a similar situation to that of Rope: there's only one location, but he's not going for something one-of-a-kind with the stylistic approach. His main innovation with Lifeboat is in putting up a big theatrical ensemble, where the thrills are more in two points- pure instinctual survival and the damnation of opposing sides in wartime- and it's a successful one all the same. As directors like Ford and Huston were off doing their own parts during the war, Hitchcock didn't make a 'real' war film (aside from a couple of doc shorts, albeit the holocaust one is stunning), but this is to say on the battle-lines. But one could look at this film and Foreign Correspondent as the Master of Suspense putting his eye on the fragile relations and backstabbing of those not out in the battles. The premise, as set-up by John Steinbeck and fleshed out by Jo Swerling, is that eight people get put together by fate (or rather, a sinking during a shoot-out) onto a lifeboat, with all but one Americans or British.The German of the group, pulled up among the others, is distrusted, but also seen as something of a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't figure, as he was the Captain of his ship. This adds immediate tension for Hitchcock to toy around with, but he doesn't make it that simple. On the contrary he casts his ensemble very wisely, with Bankhead playing the prissy but pragmatic photo-journalist who one by one loses everything of monetary value of her person. There's also the tough all-American who doesn't at all trust the German from the start, the weathered middle-aged skipper, the ex dance-hall guy who now has an amputated leg, and the woman who was once a nurse and cannot do a thing, not to mention the token black guy, who actually isn't nearly as stereotypical as could have been for the period. And the drama is boiled down to essentials: they're running out of food, especially with water getting tossed about; Schmidt/Smith, who loses his leg, tries to think of other things, but gets drawn into the German's fiendish exploitation; trying to get on course; the subtle romantic advances of the women to a respective man on the ship.What ends up happening is something of a mild double-edged sword, though not necessarily in a very bad way. Instead of his classic thriller set-pieces featuring a trademark Herrmann score, or with ultra famous stars heading off on the front bill (albeit Bankhead is, and acts like, the star of the movie as the sort of odd-woman-out among the others), it's about character revelations, and about the subtle tricks that a desperate situation can bring out in people, for better or worse. Not that Hitch doesn't give a few momentary thrills for those expecting, as there's a scene in a storm that's rather suspenseful, and there's a rather brilliant ironic twist towards the end involving the German ship. At times one might feel the tendency that the script may start to drag, but it doesn't take long for the backwards claustrophobia of a lifeboat starts to creep in. It's also, uncharacteristically for Hitchcock, with something of an agenda for the period, which is fine as well; if he didn't make at least one or two movies meant to boost morale for the Allies it would seem a little odd. Luckily for him he found just the right thematic materials, and a good enough cast, to mask them around a melodramatic morality play at its finest.",8,1,2,13 June 2007
Training Day," Hard Boiled and extremely well acted cop drama
","Antoine Fuqua's Training Day is a film that gets a big boost in the acting department from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, but it's script is also acute and sharp as a knife when it comes to showing corrupt cops in Los Angeles.Hawke plays Jake Loit, a rookie cop with 19 months training who's gonna get some real training (narc training) on a day in L.A. from a unconventional detective (Washington).  You know a cop movie will be quite different when in the first 30 minutes a cop is smoking dope (laced with PCP), though it isn't quite simple how it got to that anyway.  As is much of the movie, which never takes the easy way out of scenes (outside of a unreal ending) and stays in it's region quite well.  Sometimes it seems like we've seen this before, but Washington is so convincing as a villain type, which he usually avoids, that the film is overall quite entertaining and worthwhile. Hawke is also noteworthy as the rookie whose life and perspective of what he once thought of (the LAPD) will change.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray co-star.  A-",9,2,17,5 October 2001
Detroit," gritty, in-your-face, hard to watch as it should be.
","With Detroit, ostensibly about one night of terror that cops bring on a group of black men (and two white women) after a toy gun goes off as tensions are high during the 67 riots, Bigelow returns to the horror genre. The vampires are gone - you cant compare them to cops. It's shot in a documentary style, but its content brings it into a realm of the visceral disgust of the and in the human spirit. The cast gets to show themselves as human beings before the living nightmare takes hold - even, to the extent the movie can allow Will Poulter, who is the quintessential young-racist cop devaluing his position to that of a terrorist after realizing he won't get support from his superiors (when we first see him he shoots a man stealing groceries in the back, killing him) - so that only makes it much worse.It's showing the dark side of the American character; Night of the Living Dark Thirty (it also seems like an unintentionally poetic irony that it's the Algiers motel, ala the Pontecorvo film, to which Bigelow and Boal owe a debt). Like their previous 2012 film, it looks at torture and justice, but here its less ambiguous where its intentions and spirit lies. It may not be subtle, but this subject isn't supposed to be, and there's no such thing as indifference when it comes to the shock of oppressors and the oppressed. Like Romero's film, it's intention is to make you feel like there's not a moment of breath to be had. It's a reality that provokes with the underlying point (especially at whites): what the hell is going to be done about this?One fault: its too long. Or, more approximately, it almost feels like the movie is over by the time its at the last 20 minutes. We know where this train is headed because its the same goddamned train American police have been riding on in the courts when it comes to violence and murder. Trim maybe 15 minutes and it could be a masterpiece.As it stands its really good and perhaps so strong a tonic that its hard to see wanting to experience more than once. At the same time I can understand it rubbing some as too much; the review on Rogerebert.com went as far as to say it was not right for a white person/white people to make it. I totally get this being upsetting - but I put it to you (and I know I started this review comparing it to other works by Bigelow, notably her breakthrough Near Dark but that's just me): if you didn't know it was directed by a 65 year old white woman and written by a white (former) journalist, would that stand out? Does it truly make a mark against this all? I don't buy it.",8,4,15,7 August 2017
In Bruges," melancholy drama-comedy of career criminals in moral jeopardy
","Playwright McDonaugh's debut feature, In Bruges, works only up to a point as a crime comedy (however considering up to what point is quite remarkable), featuring a supporting cast ranging from quirky Euro-trash and plain old jolly eccentrics. But as a moral drama, it's almost as top of the pops one could ask for. The trailer didn't make it seem as such, then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quip-type one liners (i.e. 'You're a bunch of bleeping elephants!' or 'If I was retarded, or grew up on a farm, Bruges would impress me, but I didn't, so I'm not impressed.') When In Bruges is at its best- and until its self-consciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its 'Best' whatever that means- it expresses what I love seeing in films about career criminals: the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person. If it's true that no good deed goes unpunished, the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of In Bruges, where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is, the character Ken observes, like 'a fairytale', and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading Ken, Ray, and Harry.The basic thrust of the plot is that Ray (half wise-ass womanizer and half half-suicidal played by Farrell) did a job back in London, a murder, which went horribly wrong in just one misstep (I won't reveal it here, though I should, except to say that it's one of those cardinal rules career criminals/hit men have to stick to), and so he and the older, less cynical Ken (Gleeson, who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world, a spot-on casting choice), are sent to Bruges to receive more instructions. But those instructions, sent by the easily angered Harry (Ralph Fiennes, doing almost a hilarious imitation of Kingskey in Sexy Beast), aren't followed through, and then some manner of chaos ensues.Here and there McDonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation, as if an odd-matched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets (scuse me, dwarfs) in movie-making and hitting on the one hot girl in all of Bruges. But it's such a strange form that McDonaugh is working with here, with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels, in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances, truthful. It goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost, and that McDonaugh doesn't throw too many out-of-left-field curve balls with the plot. If he does, it's not of the sort we know we're usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and Catholic redemption mini-saga.In short, if I were a bloke in Britain or a fella in Dublin, or a dupe in Bruges, as a writer this is the kind of stuff I'd immediately try to go for. It's smart, serious, mature genre work that relies on just enough blood-shed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper, and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully off-kilter 'comedy' scenes for fans of British gangster flicks.

John Wick," aka 'My name is John Wick... you killed my dog... prepare to die.'
","I read a Todd Solondz quote once (yeah, weird way to start a review for John Wick but stick with me, folks), where he was talking about his movie Happiness and how it's actually quite simple to gain sympathy from an audience, and he talked about how the writer can just give a character cancer and everyone will feel sorry for that person and if you make someone a victim (and he/she's not right off the bat the villain or something) then there's identification right away. At the start of this movie we don't know who this man John Wick exactly is or what he does or how he can afford such a good house and car, but we do know that he has just lost his wife to some sickness and that she left him as a parting gift a dog so that he could move on with his life. And not any old dog or some mangy thing from the vet, but the cutest goddamn puppy that you could ever lay your eyes on. Needless to say things look good... until Wick happens to stop at a gas station, a Russian s***-head talks some crap (good ol' 'Reek' from Game of Thrones Alfie Allen, who is another good s***-head here), then that night the mobsters come to his house, trash it, beat him up and, worst of all, kill the dog.The writers go for a premise that's fairly easy and borderline lazy; of course we want to see Wick get the payback on these guys - even as they were once his former employers and ironically, in order to really retire, he had to pull a number that set up the Russian mobster's empire in cozy terms - because they killed the pretty-witty-wicky dog! As the Dude would say in Big Lebowski, this aggression will not stand! What ensues from here is a whole lot of violence and carnage, peppered with a whole lot of good character actors and awesome people - Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Dean Winters, Adrienne Palikci, Lance Reddick (remember him from The Wire and Oz?) - and that's about it. In that way it's admirable as a kind of meat-n-potatoes flick for the guys (and maybe some girls out there too): watch Keanu Reeves kill a LOT of people. But there are two things that I didn't expect out of what is basically a gigantic action kill-fest that is a time-waster: 1) the fight and stunt choreography, and how the director and cameraman and editor get it all together, works with some tight and efficient work while also being complex at the same time. You can tell where everyone is in relation to one another whether it's Keanu and a dozen guys on a club floor, or just him and Palicki getting dirty (not *that* dirty, the fighting kind) in a hotel room, or three cars in a high speed chase. It's not chaotic but it is intense work and I got more drawn in to it than I expected.The 2) is that there's a whole lot of good background to this world that Wick is in. What I mean is that it almost resembles something out of a comic book (for adults) in a good way: it's like there's this whole set up functionality for someone like Wick to work in, to the point of almost (or simply being) satirical. I had a big laugh at one moment when a cop (just one) comes to Wick's place after he guns down a whole bunch of guys at night, they know each other apparently and he sees a dead guy on the floor behind him, and he just gives him a 'have a good night' and walks away. Then the cleaning crew comes (what do they do when they're *not* cleaning up, or maybe there's always work to be done as far as disposing of bodies in this New York), and then there's the hotel that Wick stays at while he looks for Josef, and it's run like a hotel *for* the criminal element, as if they are always expecting guys with guns to be in their midst and only as that, maybe, they keep it down a little.This is a heightened reality as opposed to something fully realistic, but this added to my pleasure watching the movie. I wanted to see a whole movie set in this world that McShane's character seems to run - like some old film-noir he sits in a jazz club (lit very prettily, this is a colorful movie for big chunks) - and that Reddick is the concierge I suppose. The problem though is that underneath all of this style and potential for a much grander experience it's still a shallow action movie. In a way it may work for this kind of material that it's simply 'you stole my car, you killed my dog, and my wife...'; for an audience coming to this, maybe too much ambiguity would muddy the waters. But I wish the filmmakers, who are clever enough to put in the touches of a much larger environment for these criminals (Dafoe has a good if predictable role also as a hit-man by the way), had gone a little further.As it stands I liked it, though by a certain point - like say in the last twenty minutes - it starts to get into overkill territory. I was still into it for the action and would recommend it simply on those terms. But if you're looking for something challenging as far as engaging/challenging and audience's sympathies, you won't get it. This is all about Reeves punching, kicking, slamming, knifing, blasting, crashing, shooting, choking, and doing everything under the sun, and while he's not Neo here he might as well be.",7,3,6,30 April 2016
Kung Fu Panda," a balance between the predictability of the plot and the loving homage/spoof of the subject matter
","Kung Fu Panda was the first Dreamworks animated movie I even considered going to see, nevermind liking, in quite a while. Perhaps it's because I didn't see it on a professional critic basis, and none of the past Dreamworks animation didn't have any appeal aside from a basic, kiddie movie basis (the last one was Sharktale, which left a bad taste in my mouth for a while). But after hearing some high praise, and recognizing some voice talent that seemed a little unusual (i.e. Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen), I took a chance. Thankfully, it paid off more than I would've imagined. It's an entertaining ride, and somehow uproariously funny in some pockets. And just when I thought I'd had enough of those 'Don't Talk' ads before the movies at AMC with Po the Panda! It is, in fact, still predictable in that quasi-Shrek kind of way: a big, lovable lug somehow gets chosen for a task of great importance, and along the way becomes everything that he never though he could be, gains respect, and retains individuality all the way through, particularly at the end. What's interesting this time around is how the filmmakers marry this repeated theme for animated kids fare with the basic plots of cool, old-school kung-fu movies, like the fare from the Shaw Brothers from the 60s and 70s. Or, for a more contemporary example, it comes closest to the Kill Bill movies (i.e. the Pai Mei chapter) in attempting homage for a 21th century crowd. What's been done over and over in those films somehow comes fresh with what's expected for a kid's movie, and it all works thanks to the sharp script.Voice actors, as well, contribute pretty well to the proceedings. Jack Black, who can be hit or miss depending on the viewer (or just the mood of the moment), is fit like a glove for this character, who's a dreamer and weak-willed but wants to not stay a noodle-boy his whole life after being chosen for the Dragon Scroll. Hoffman is terrific as the 'Master' of the members of the group of the 'Five', who are a Mantis, a Tiger, a Monkey, a Crane (you know, the 'moves'), and all the voice actors in these parts are also pitch perfect- Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross (a big surprise), Lucy Liu- because, for many moments, they disappear into their parts (an essential if hidden asset to good voice acting). Points should also go to Ian McShane who plays the bad-ass-turned-villain of the film.Featuring training montages that veer on spoof (plus a dumpling scene that might be the funniest in the movie), fast and lively and energetic animation, and some intense fight scenes, it's a real treat for its target audience of children, but adults and martial-arts genre fans should not fear. They might have as good a time as the first Shrek, if that's indeed possible after so many years of Pixar's golden standard.",7,3,8,9 June 2008
Chinatown," As coolly intense and exceptionally-staged as any detective story/film-noir of the 40's & 50's
","Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's. Director Roman Polanski (his last film in America, and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate), stars Jack Nicholson & Faye Dunaway, and writer Robert Towne, all come together to create a detective story classic. At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character, to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in (i.e. when he goes to the empty reservoir, when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time). And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story, fueled by curiosity, grit, and cynicism, and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters. J.J. Gittes (Nicholson, in one of his best 70's performances) is in Los Angeles circa 1933 in the line of private investigator, usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having an affair. Evelyn Mulwray feels this may be the case with her husband Hollis, and Gittes decides to take the case. However, this draws him into a deeper case involving the city's loss of water once Hollis- a major player in the water supply controversy in the city- is found murdered. This eventually leads him to Noah Cross (John Huston), a big businessman and who also happens to be Evelyn's father. Intrigue starts to develop, as Jake's own life begins to be at risk. As a intricate, detailed detective story the film is an above-average work, with Towne's script containing the maturity, and wicked sense of humor, of a James M. Cain or Raymond Chandler novel. When the thrills come they come as being striking. And when humanity and compassion get thrown into the mix, the film reaches a whole other plane of intelligence. The last third of the film could turn off some of the audience (depending on one's own level of belief), but it holds strong thanks to the performances. Nicholson doesn't over-step his bounds in any scene, finding the right notes in suggestive conversations. Dunaway is better than expected (though I'm not sure if it's an great performance). And Huston's Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies. Add to it some good cameos (Burt Young as a driver, Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous 'knife' scene), and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, Chinatown comes out as strong piece of movie-making, and arguably one of the greatest in the crime/mystery genre.",10,144,200,17 December 2003
To Be or Not to Be," the dark and light of the Nazis and theater, with Carol Lombard!
","To Be or Not to Be is a film that carries the real horror and dread of Europe facing the threats and devastation of Hitler and the Nazis, and never forgets that, but is also a light, screwball comedy about the art of performance and the enjoyment we all get knowing someone is getting something over on another guy. Lubtisch's filmmaking and comic timing moves like a precise slab of butter (if that's a weird analogy), smooth and on point all the time.It follows a Polish theater company that see a the Germans invading, bombing their town, and the two stars of the company played by Jack Benny and Carole Lumbard, embroiled in a plot with a Nazi-leaning professor and even going up to Hitler himself. Nevermind they don't have Polish (or even most German) accents, they don't bother pretending on that front ironically considering the trickery on hand. This is meant to be a piece of world war two theatricality that can and does endure because it deals with showmanship, actor ego (from Benny with his Hamlet to the side characters trying to get Shylock just right) and playing a character as it's main focus (if there's any modern film that owes It's debt to Lubitsch and how people put on ruses in such high stakes it's Inglouious Basterds, down to a climax in a theater full of Nazis).And as funny as Jack Benny is, especially when his character reacts to that dear of a bomber pilot who has the hots for Carole Lombard, I think Lombard really makes this even better than expected. She's exquisite, ferocious, precocious, sexy, and yet terribly serious about her craft and the people she loves, plus the theater itself. You see just charm and grace radiating off her, and yet she completely gets how to make Mary always reacting and figuring things out. Benny is the big wonderful goof of the movie, while Lombard is the star.Its sublime entertainment and I only regret not seeing it sooner; Mel Brooks made a remake in the 80s which is good but nowhere near the impact of this picture. Just the scene with the Germans marching into town and Lubitsch's cut aways to the citizens looking on in shocked-but-passive disbelief makes it a must see alone.",10,1,3,22 July 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Not necessarily laugh-out-loud every minute, but it's satirical edge and wit is as clever as the technical side of the film
","Monty Python's follow-up to their cult smash Holy Grail was Life of Brian, a film that takes on (if not always with the utmost seriousness, then usually with a mix of silliness and slight intellectualism) the believers in religions, the zealous nature that belief brings out in people.  I first saw the film in the theater upon its re-release last month, and I found it very funny, though not with the kind of belly laughs that I had on my first reaction to Holy Grail.  It's not without it's scenes that stick out as some of Python's finest (the Stoning, Pilate's scenes, the Spaceship sequence), even as sometimes it goes a little too broad for comfort (part of the colisseum).Yet, the great strengths that lie in Life of Brian are that 1) the writers and performers (Chapman, Cleese, Gilliam, Jones, Idle, Palin) bring their irreverent strengths to a fine point with the script and multiple roles. Even when a scene doesn't get the laughs it could've or should've, it turns out to be a scene brimming with a cleverness that could only exist in the 'Python-esque' universe.  2) the director (Jones) and designer/animator (Gilliam) lay the groundwork for this realistic atmosphere of 33 A.D. and bring out what is the best in the acting, Pythons or otherwise (famous British comedian Spike Milligan has a role of note).  Held over from the sets of Franco Zeferelli's Christ film, the Pythons use all these locations and settings and little details to spring out their wild, brilliant gags. The look of the film enriches the comedic elements, and the result is (arguably, of course) the troupe's best film.  Not for all tastes by the way (Monty Python in general for me took some while to warm up to, but paid off once it worked).  Grade: A",10,78,127,21 June 2004
Wind River," the best movie of its kind since Insomnia: a snow-bound tale of murder, dread and existential horrors
","With Wind River, I'll get a nitpick out of the way first, There's in Wind River a mournful score (by none other than Nick Cave with Warren Ellis), and it gives scenes that would otherwise have a stock tone to them a sense of tragedy that isn't laying it on thick but is there and one you can feel in your bones, like being out there in the sort of cold that would give Marquis Warren in Hateful Eight some pause. The nitpick is with the voice in the score, this whispery male voice that is saying things as Jeremy Renner trudges through the snow or a character goes through a mysterious part of the woods. What is that? Why is he doing that? I feel like a grump for even bringing it up, but it took me out of the movie.OK, what is this movie? Wind River is another Taylor Sheridan script, a man who has cut a' real figure in recent cinema making violent, brutal films with the sort of brutality that is about how people can be just awful creatures, and we all know it but somehow get subsumed in it. Wind River probably shares more of a kinship with Sicario, Sheridan's first produced script (here he directs for the first time), as it's almost as much about the setting and how it contributes to the discomfort.Actually both movies also have a woman who *is* already a tough cookie and can do her job well (to the point where one should feel foolish even trying to equate her to a man, as if she's not good enough, and both Blunt and Olsen make these women such), while around men who have been shaped by the world around them... Come to think of it, there's also a male protagonist who has lost his family and has transformed him over time into something much harder. I could probably go on and on with the comparisons, including the unforgiving nature of the whole culture.But while del Toro in Sicario was lost forever to his darkness, Renner's Cory is someone who still does have family - we see him with his son, still doing his best, though separated from his wife now (why this is is... one of those movie things, I can buy it, more due to the mother's pain as they both lost a daughter to some tragic circumstances) - and he has another job as a tracker. But that pain is always there, and internalized in a different way. He can be scary, but it's not in his immediate nature; he is a good person, but has been shaped by so much around him and has had to adapt. The girl in the middle of the plot of this story who is found dead, frozen, miles from the nearest place she could have been from (it's the sort of mystery that really isn't, and we know that, and it makes it sadder), has a father and of course he is devastated. When Cory offers up his consolation, it's genuine, and how Sheridan writes in and Renner plays it has all of the pain but grudging knowledge of what comes with... time.Like Pine in 'High Water' last year, it's easy to take certain actors for granted - it's been a long time (maybe since The Hurt Locker? probably not Bourne Legacy I'd bet) that Renner has had any character to play that's challenged him, much less as a lead, and he sinks his actory teeth into this completely. He has Olsen to play off of too, and she does well, but the framing is really from his point of view; some may find more identification with her, as the one who is not from such a place as Wyoming. I found myself totally in Renner's point of view, and it made it a richer experience because of how every moment has a simplicity and truth to it. One of the pleasures of seeing movies for, well, grown ups that Hollywood does(ish) in a genre is to see actors not just getting to but allowed to show all the complexity they're capable of. I'll remember those scenes where Renner gets to really shine as the awesome actor he is (i.e. when he tells about his daughter to Olsen), but it's the quieter scenes that are tougher and that he does so well.This isn't a pleasant experience inasmuch that you'll leave feeling elated or something. What makes Wind River stick out as being a very good film is that Sheridan isn't ostentatious about it. He has confidence in showing us all of this out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-ness and we get it, and he even finds quality in those scenes with characters that are only there so briefly (Jon Bernthal does pop up, but I won't tell you when or what his role is, for example). My favorite is the dead girl's brother, who is about the same age as her and a waste of life drug addict. But Sheridan does the work, even in several minutes of screen time, to get us to understand who he is, why he's come to this place, and that he's not very sympathetic (Renner's Cory helps make this clear). I don't even remember the actor's name, and he'll stay with me for a long time with that scene in the car at night. Sheridan's setting may seem or just be obvious as was the Mexican one - heat is oppressive and so is the cold, and, as we see, it can kill if one is not careful - but he stays true to what he's after, and when he goes into the dark parts of the human experience, it feels earned. If he's not quite to where Villeneuve is yet, he will be soon.Just, you know, tell Nick Cave to cut out that voice s***.",8,9,16,25 August 2017
Erin Brockovich," One of the most over-rated films of the year
","Like Dancer in the Dark (and unlike good over-rated films like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Almost Famous which had over-rating it's biggest flaw), this film has over-rating not at it's biggest flaw, but in a midst of them.  Steven Soderbergh made gold with Traffic, but Erin Brockovich is the lowest of his fodder, and while it is OK, it might've been better (or possibly not).Julia Roberts plays a mid western hick with 3 kids and no husband or job, and gets a job working with lawyers all the while distracting guys with a boost in her shirt that would make Tyra Banks feel intimidatied (for only one reason).  She then begins to get smart and start to help her firm in a case.  Often quite unbelievable, even if there are actually a few convincing moments, however the story seems like Rosewood or Civil Action (the second one was much better) and probably most over-rated of all is Roberts.  Oh well, I guess you can't argue the 4 Oscar Nom's, and I guess I do pull for Soderbergh to win best director (but only by default for him to win Traffic).  B-",6,3,9,13 February 2001
The Death of Stalin," Russian 'Backstabbers' by the Comrade OJays
","This is like Dr. Strangelove but with fewer laughs (and I should say rightfully so!) and not as great an aesthetic... But then again thats a tall friggin order to fill. Taking place all within the first days if Stalin's death (with a sort of prologue showing the night before, which includes the obvious and ridiculous but probably very true set piece of an orchestra having to do their live performance again, audience included, because it wasn't recorded, plus the stroke that got him), this is satire so thick in its darkness you will get lost trying to find your way out.  With a couple of tweaks this could have been a straightforward and highly believable biopic on that period when Stalin's death revealed the many maggots writhing underneath the Red facade. Luckily Iannuci has learned from the masters - Michael Palin being here isnt an accident I'm guessing (Holy Grail was shot with the look of Pasolini influence) - that if you have an authentic backdrop, everything else you can buy into. While everyone using their own accents might seem distracting to some, I dug it; it's like, hey, you know what? Lets not kid ourselves with putting on phoney-baloney accents. It makes for a wholly unique, unnerving, often funny experience that I won't forget for a while. By the way, it's banned in Russia... Sure. They'll allow The Road Movie, but this?",8,1,2,29 March 2018
Meet the Parents," Fun that any man can relate to
","This film is off and on very funny, and overall it is a good time. Mainly due to Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller's performances as the father and the guy who wants to marry his daughter. Stiller meets the parents (De Niro and Blythe Danner) in one very chaotic weekend in Long Island where anything that can go wrong for Stiller does (a spray-painted and potty trained cat, burning down by accident the alter, overflowing the septic tank, being caught with a dragon that he likes to puff and telling a story about a cat that is a show-stopper) and enhances the comedy. A feel-good comedy, even if it may hit close to home for many a lot of men. Directed by Jay Roach (or Austin Powers and Mystery Alaska fame).",8,8,16,7 October 2000
Se7en," Disturbingly effective, for two audiences
","A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later.",10,2,3,17 October 2000
I'm Not There," strangely insightful, feverish trip into the consciousness of Bob Dylan- public as well as mythic and personal- and great tunes!
","It's not quite as the ads have said - there aren't six people specifically playing Bob Dylan. It's fragments, pieces, all making up a tableau regarding the myth, history, pop-mania, arrogance, self-deprecation, strange humor, and undeniably powerful musical ability of Bob Dylan. It's Todd Haynes working wonderfully without a net on what isn't a film that will be for everyone, much like Dylan himself. It shuffles around the six perspectives- albeit never in a manner that is confusing or too startling in terms of the storytelling relating to each other- and it does depend a lot on how much one knows about their Dylan history (Woody Guthrie, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, horrible husband, erratic rock star, folk legend-cum-born again, and the enigma always hiding that wound up more contradictions than a pretzel smothered in ice cream). Godard would approve.For those that admire Dylan, or at least can understand how hype and fame can merge with the possibility of Dylan as an outsider in the 1960s of all times, and knows at least a little bit (the 'hey, it's Alan Ginsberg!' gag, as he rides up alongside Dylan's limo, played by David Cross, is one of the funniest things I've seen in years), and can respect how the filmmaker pays respect while ultimately adulating the whole ideal of a iconoclastic figure, the film serves up many moments of 'pure' enjoyment. Others, who know him as writing Blowin' in the Wind and All Along the Watchtower, and know him as the guy on that album cover with the girl on the New York street, might be a little more perplexed - actually more-so than a little. Haynes's film can be argued on the flip side of the coin as pretentious doodling and meandering with Felliniesque aspirations and grandeur Americana. On the other hand, at least for the former, the same can go for Mr. Dylan. Does he care what he says? Who's to say? If for nothing else, aside from the brilliant editing and mind-blowing camera-work, edging on the sublime, see it for the songs, of course (including a mixture of classic Dylan material, some of which is not new to my ears, some is, and very well done covers), and for the performances. Cate Blanchett is a marvel, totally deserved of another Oscar nomination, as she digs deep into the most well-known period of Dylan's height of glory (and the tipping-point, as we see, prior to his real-life motorcycle accident), with the bushy hair and the kooky manner of speaking and almost shy demeanor, Blanchett makes it all her own. But lest not forget Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, who may actually fare a lot better here than in the upcoming Dark Knight (who's to say, of course), as Bale especially takes on the persona of the young and reinvigorated Dylan, looking exactly like the 'Times They Are-a-Changing' form, and Ledger as the devilish, mean womanizer side. And the little black kid and Richard Gere are OK too- actually, the black Kid, Carl Franklin, is more than OK.The point is, I'm Not There is exhilarating for the open-minded, revelatory in spurts, and with that kind of rush that a story, fable, history, and musical mixed together can bring only so often in cinema. And like Dylan, it's post-modern to the point of at one moment scratching your head and another moment wanting to clap your hands like hell. It makes Across the Universe, frankly, look like Child's Play in comparison. The Beatles, I might add, appear in the most blatant (and uproarious) cameo of the year.",10,8,20,24 November 2007
Wayne's World," I laughed my head off! Funniest film of the early 90's
","Wayne's World is a silly yet utterly hilarious look at two dimwits (based on they're SNL skit Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) who have their own public access TV show called 'Waynes World'.  The story thickens to a nice touch with Rob Lowe as a big time hot-shot who wants to bring their show to big heights.  Tia Carrere has never been hotter as the woman who Wayne wants and 'we'll be mine'.

The Big Lebowski," Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges
","The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. 'The Dude' Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of 'meaning', life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.On top of The Big Lebowski, at the core, one of the most odd, off-the-wall, and creative of the Coens' scripts, with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane, the casting is near perfect, if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors, and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint, Bridges, for lack of a better term, displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman, but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny, and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film, where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset, another strange, surreal, and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in. Throw in some unique production design, and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does, or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?), and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run, but not by much), yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans, but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact, I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older, depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way, think of the silliest, though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen, and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences, and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's, and has a toe-tapping soundtrack. A+",10,16,31,9 September 2004
Unbreakable," One of the better films of the season
","M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense was a very, very good example of exquisete storytelling wrapped around a good egg full of good acting and suspense.  Unbreakable isn't too much different, with only a few minor things making it no masterpiece.The story follows a average security guard in Philly played by Bruce Willis, who is in a train when it crashes, being the only survivor, with no injuries sustained.  Then, a avid (yet serverely physically sick) comic book collector played by Sam Jackson find him and if you've seen the previews, you get the point.  Some things in common with Shyamalan's past success (an unraveling plot, lovingly played out performances, conflicted ending) with not only the obvious, but also that he has such a trust in his audience of patience and understanding, it is a wonder films like these are made anymore.  With only flaw being a scene of comic book wonder, this film may not be as ground breaking as Sense, but it comes close.  Look for the writer/director in a scene wearing a blue jacket.

Star Trek," The New/Alternate Generation
","JJ Abrams is a smart director - at the least smart enough to know what makes the original Star Trek show from the 60s, as well as the movies at their best (see Wrath of Khan thru Voyage Home), appeal so strongly to everyone from hardcore trekkies to just your average TV or movie-going public at large. It's a good script. Smart, actually, enough to try and give some new ideas or at least give us some characters to give a damn about. In his revised version of Star Trek he starts at the beginning, only an alternate beginning: it's still Kirk, Spock, 'Bones' McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and (for a little while) Scotty, but there's some slight changes, alterations in the lineage thanks to a meddlesome, incredibly ticked-off Romulan.In this case Abrams and the writers, Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann, get to have their cake and eat it in terms of story and character development; they can reboot a franchise right from the start but with some extra surprises. And because it treats time travel with a fresh perspective - you may be confused at first as to why Spock appears not only as his young self played by Zachary Quinto AND as the (formerly) one-and-only played by Leonard Nimoy - there's no limit to what can occur in a franchise that is only beholden to the original in terms of staying true to the characters, their methods and personalities, and the essential things that make Trek what it is with its ships, the federation, Klingons and Romulans, Vulcan, everything. It's a truly inspired screenplay written by people who love the show, and want to get right to the heart of the big behemoth to see what makes it tick.If there are any complaints they're mostly minor, in terms of technical things. Abrams, who's only previous film was the third Mission: Impossible feature, isn't always assured during the fight scenes and cuts around a little too fast and jagged to always take. There's also a pet-peeve that one can have with lens flare (you may know what it is, in layman's terms it's that blue and other colored light that comes in horizontal lines, of which in this film I lost count), which became I assume an artistic choice as opposed to a flaw, one that didn't serve the movie really well. And while it's definitely a step up for Abrams in getting top-notch performances, especially from young actors who are definitely getting their biggest breaks yet here (albeit some are already stars and character actors, some unknown by me), there's a treatment to the direction in the movement of it that is somewhat akin to TV. Sometimes this is not a bad thing in the slightest; whenever scenes out in space were shown, in big battles or otherwise, it was fantastic, spectacular footage, by far the best in the entire franchise. As for 'dutch' angles and rapid-fire camera movements...But I digress, what most people will be concerned to know is: are these new kids the real deal? Do they fill in the shoes of iconic pop-culture figures like James T. Kirk and Spock and everyone else on the Enterprise? Without a doubt, they all rise to the challenge. Chris Pine is Kirk without having to submit to a Shatner imitation (save, arguably, for a couple of scenes like when he hits on girls or is doing the Kobayashi Maru test), and he makes Kirk his own through and through; he makes me thoroughly excited to see where he'll go in this rebooted series. Ditto for Quinto, who brings his own calm and intensity to a Spock that needs to rise up to meet his elder form right in front of him at one point. Others like Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, (of course) Simon Pegg and John Cho, they're all a pleasure to see not taking over roles as imitations, but just being themselves as the characters.So, Star Trek, this revised edition is up to the standards of a franchise that can concern itself with action and suspense and adventure, but is also as much character driven as it is with story. No matter what quibbles I might have with certain aesthetic choices, this is the best we've seen from this diluted and over-exposed franchise (I mean Trek in general, through all of its re-incarnations of Next Gen and Deep Space 9) since its previous hey-day in the 1980s. It's fresh, exciting, funny, and has smart action to go with its package.",8,8,22,7 May 2009
Fury," superb moments amid 'Hollywood' war-time stuff
","I have to wonder if Fury had been made by, I don't know, Sam Peckinpah or Robert Aldrich or George Roy Hill or someone if it might be more effective or memorable. Of course, those guys have been gone for years, and David Ayer seems to want to aspire to those filmmaker's heights of having real 'macho' male cinema on a grand Hollywood scale with blood and guts and camaraderie for the characters and all. Fury is more ambitious for this director than some of his past work - think Hard Times with Christian Bale or even End of Watch, which had a wonderful script and performers amid some terrible direction - and he clearly put a lot of heart and soul in to it. Sadly, there's some Hollywood Movie-BS as well.This isn't to say the premise isn't intriguing, and one we might have not seen quite this way, though there have been countless WW2 flicks: a young man, basically untrained outside of clerical work (Lerman) is assigned to the 'Fury' tank led by Brad Pitt and including the likes of Shia LaBeouf (rocking a mean mustache), Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal, and among them he is by far the greenest of the lot. The men don't like him that much - the beginning of the film shows one of their men has just died, which is why they need a replacement - but have no choice as they plunge ahead in Germany near the end of the war.The problems with the story come from familiarity, and lots of it. It's hard, for example, if you have seen Saving Private Ryan to not see the similarity with Jeremy Davies joining Tom Hanks' bunch in that film. This time Ayer ups the sort of 'horror' quotient of war, like Pitt's Sgt making Lerman's character shoot a captured German soldier and it becoming a whole big thing. It's tough to watch, but more-so because it feels too melodramatic, even for a war film. Of course Pitt's character has his reasons: as he says he's killed Germans in Africa and throughout Europe for three years, and he's been weathered by the war. It sets up a natural conflict to have this newbie in their ranks who has to come up to snuff with where the real MEN are at (in caps).There's a lot of big talk, and even bigger war set pieces, especially when it comes time for tank vs tank (and while the Fury isn't the only one, there are a few others, it comes down to one tank vs the other and it is probably the most thrilling part of the film as far as the action goes). But the characters just didn't seem that deep at all, though the actors certainly try to imbue them with more. Pitt of course just has full-on Star quality, as he also did in his other (much greater) war flick Inglourious Basterds. LaBeouf is half very good and half... well, when he gets upset in a scene or emotional, tears flow and it feels just uncomfortable to watch. Bernthal is one dimensional. Pena is okay, and Lerman does what he can as the sort of 'audience' surrogate.Fury does have a tremendous set-piece though, which feels almost like a short film amid the other set-pieces of the whole (its not like there's one mission for the Fury tank, it's a bunch leading up to the climax which Ill get to in a moment). But it doesn't involve a lot of violence on the physical scale really; the men take over a German town that's been a stronghold for a long time, and Pitt and Lerman see a couple of women looking at them from an apartment. They go up, and at first we're not sure what will happen. But Pitt... just needs a shave, and some food, maybe, and he can speak German which helps, and encourages Lerman to spend 'time' with the younger, more attractive (really, really beautiful) younger woman (I believe he says 'If you don't take her, I will'), and yet it's not savage, it's more delicate and about trying to find that human connection that, as the film drills into the audience, has been lost by April of 45.But this isn't all - the other men in the Fury tank come up to the apartment as well, and it becomes much more tense and awkward, especially with Bernthal's meat-head personage. The scene takes on so many qualities and feels like Ayer at his true strengths here: showing power dynamics, especially between men, how women figure in to it, and what trauma does if you stop and think about it. It's not like the film stops to have this whole scene in this apartment unfold, on the contrary it seems like it's from a better, more engaging film.Sadly, this doesn't last though, and the climax is disappointing mostly as the characters do what they do just because it seems like the time to do it in the story, and it gives one of the main characters a big 'out' that doesn't feel earned or properly explains. It just seems to happen because, you know, Screen writing-Hero reasons. Fury ultimately is a grueling, depressing and super-violent and grim film that may do what it's supposed to do for an audience, but it's also come after movies like it before and doesn't explore (with some exceptions) what can be more remarkable about a war film in the little moments.",6,2,8,4 November 2014
Fight Club," One of Norton's best, year too
","Chuck Palahniuck's Fight Club is a exciting, stimulating and surprising look at a typical macho porn (coincidence to porn, at the end of the movie, look real close for Brad Pitt's d***).  The movie circles around a man (a usual great performance by Ed Norton, who plays this man but is only know as narrator) who has a dead-end job and life until he meets a man played by Tyler Durden (played well by Brad Pitt) who convinces him that the best way to live is to beat each other senseless.  Soon a club starts, and a type of fascist society of fighting men are abound.  This film takes many turns, many odd ones at that, but it is cool, action packed, and sometimes even funny.  One of the best of the year and Fichner's best since Seven.",10,4,12,10 April 2000
Akira," As inspired and bizarre an anime sci-fi film you're likely to see, not perfect, but still a post-apocalyptic wonder
","Science fiction films, even when they might be a incoherent in spots (and maybe the story and action in Akira is not completely incoherent but as an American some of the Japanese styling is, well, f***ed up), are supposed to raise questions about human behavior and thought, and be intelligent enough to let the audience try to fill in the blanks instead of force-feeding the answers. The film Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo (from the comic by him) does just that, and at the same time is a visual extravaganza. It has been quite a number of months, truth be told, since I've seen the film, but many of the images, particularly the more grotesque ones but also the 'simpler' ones, have stuck with me for so long. It's a post-apocalyptic take on manipulation of a person to serve what could be considered the 'greater good', but in the end, what does it feed but more destruction? That there are some interesting action and character elements in the story helps, and after an explanation of what happened to the natural world (by way of a large, atomic-like explosion), we're introduced to a group of bikers. One of them is Kaneda and the other is Tetsuo. Tetsuo, while on the run from some other bikers, gets caught up in a Government program that is all too elusive for his own good. After some crazy scenes involving his body changing around, it's clear that things have gone awry, on both his end and the government's. So it's up to Kaneda, with a little help from some friends to stop the forces that be from causing destruction. It is through the various confrontations that happen with Kaneda and the 'powers that be', and Tetsuo's reactions, that make up Otomo's outrageous, seemingly unlimited visual prowess.Aside from a climax that might feel a little 'long', however hypnotic, and how gruesome some of those transformations and the violence can get, it actually isn't necessarily as disturbing an animated film like the masterpiece Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. It could even serve, as strange and 'heavy' the film gets, as a good starting point for those interested in watching anime and have never been much exposed before. Some sequences, to be sure, are not for the squeamish. But there is also a certain innocence that goes along with the story as well, with the theme of experimentation on small children. When coming from a Manga comic book, it's also fascinating to see how the film also works as a kind of transition into what anime would completely blossom into in the 1990's (for better or worse). And that the plot, once understood up to a point, is 'gotten' it becomes very worthwhile, because it deals with questions that are always abound in science-fiction stories, and told with an energy not captured in American films.",10,2,4,24 December 2005
As Good as It Gets," By default, one of the best films of the year
","At first, i didn't know if I should put this film in my best of the year category, I liked it alot, but I wondered if Titanic would go over it.  It didn't, so I put this film in, and well deserved.  The film is directed by Oscar winning director James L. Brooks (of Terms of Endearment and The Simpsons TV show fame) and stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt (Nicholson won his third Oscar for this and Hunt won her first). 
The story follows a bitter old scrooge (Nicholson in his usual perfect self) who is also a romance novelist (his line 'I think of a man, and I take a way reason and accountability' when describing writing women is classic), but through a series of events including a cute dog, a gay artist (Greg Kinnear is endearing in this role), and a waitress with some problems (Hunt), he becomes a little better.  Conventional to be sure, but it is definately a winner in laughs and romance.  That's comic veteran Harold Ramis as a doctor.  A+",10,5,8,3 December 2000
Citizen Kane," Rosebud
","Oscar winning Writer/Director/Actor/Producer Orson Wells gives one of the best American films ever made (AFI thought it was number one, but I'm not quite sure on that) as the title giving enough meaning as it is.  Wells tells the story of fictional (yet based from) newspaper owner and politician Charles Foster Kane (also played by Wells) who is remembered in life as in death.  Quite a complicated film (or maybe just too dark) for many people, but for me it is just right for the drama presented.  Brilliant, but (unfortunately) over-hyped to be the greatest film ever while being a great achievement despite.  Only Oscar went to original screenplay (out of 9) for Wells and co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz, losing it's awards (yet well deserved) mainly to other great achiever 'How Green Was My Valley'.  A+",10,1,8,15 July 2000
The Rookie," Rated G sports movie starring Dennis Quaid
","Dennis Quaid was ill-used in this movie.  He's a good actor and does what he can in the role of Jimmy Morris, a 30 something teacher and baseball coach who becomes a rookie in the Majors, but the movie gives off a certain feeling of aloof that lingers from the first shot to the last.  This could've been a really interesting sports movie and at times shows signs of what was on the drawing boards, and then it goes back to it's Disney, G rated pillow that makes this based on a true story fizzle whenever it should go further.  Oh well, there's always Major League.  Grade: C",6,2,3,3 April 2002
Memento," See it twice, or more, depending on your brain
","Memento, unless you outright hate it for one reason or another, needs to be seen twice. I saw it once and immediately, as a dumb-s*** 17 year old, jumped to comparing to to the backwards-episode of Seinfeld (not, as I should've the Harold Pinter backward-plot construction he was infamous for). Now, years later, little moments and parts of performances remain in the memory. And now, how curious, to revisit the film with a greater knowledge and appreciation for film art and story construction, not to mention going through a few more Christopher Nolan pictures, and... it's much, much better than I remember it. Just luck, I guess.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man on a mission, and he'll go after his wife's rape and murder, that is in reverse. Or really, at the start of the film its the end, and he kills a man named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who we are not sure who or what he's doing there but have some trust that out hero, or just protagonist, knows what he's doing. Does he though? His own tattoos and his own markers are not always the great markers of truth. He says others, like Teddy, lie and can't be trusted, but is it so? The color and B&W photography is symbolic of something, I think, not simply as a gimmick with creating temporal 'present' and 'past'. It's as if they combine to create a real GRAY area, one where it's hard to tell if Teddy is telling Leonard all he needs to know (though he may be a cop in point of fact, who knows for sure what he has for Leonard, or if he'll help him in the end... not).This is a tricky little movie, but seeing it with eyes fresh and mind ready for anything its really brilliant on the front of construction. A scene ends right where the last one ended, the sequences of Shelby in his motel room punctuate these scenes with his story of another man with short-term memory loss (no 'New Memories' as he says repeatedly), and it loops back around again. By the end we have a better idea of what happened, and how Leonard was most likely not at all an innocent in the rape and murder of his wife, but we also don't have the certainty of closure. Only in the point of view of Shelby, who is an unreliable narrator, do we have a real semblance of events.The effect is disorientating, but never boring, and the film-making is rich and clever and direct. There's no punches pulled by Nolan this time, and his editing is as elegant as his cinematography (the latter was much more for than the former in his Batman movies). And we feel for the characters, or at least character; especially painful is seeing how Natalie really feels about Leonard, berating him with a dirty mouth and then after being punched for egging Leonard on, sits in the car and comes back in to start the 'new' memory that will soon fade, much like the polaroid unless its fanned out. The performances rock as well with the script, with Guy Pearce giving a career high point as Leonard (albeit I could just as easily see Steve Buscemi in the role of Teddy).It's a memorable movie, ironic enough, because we care about the character's plight and descent (or is ascent) into/from hell. He has no life except this mystery to unravel, which may be no real mystery at all. It's a post-modern enigma that is fun to watch, again and again.",10,1,18,8 April 2001
Inglourious Basterds," a spectacular achievement of 'movie' cinema
","Inglourious Basterds won't please everyone. It's not a full-blown crowd-pleaser like other (dumber) blockbusters from this past summer. It's a war film, but in the same way that Pulp Fiction was a crime film. Some will be thrown off by things that people tend to take for granted with Quentin Tarantino films: it's 'talky', with pages and pages of dialog performed sometimes like a stage play, and the violence, when it happens at a moments notice, is graphic and harsh and not with much hope for the character killed or injured or, in this case, scalped. It might not even be a film some will claim is the greatest film ever of a generation like with PF. But, for me, it is about as pure a piece of cinematic bliss I could ask for this year. And, dare I suggest, it's as audacious and genre re-defining as anything Tarantino's done, or may do again.Tarantino makes up his own rules to break them down and see what makes them tick. Godard was like that, but in this case we don't see a filmmaker lose control of his own rules as Godard ultimately did in his career. Instead its a sprawling epic that throws a few really big damn monkey wrenches into Americans vs. Germans vs. French in world war two. It tells concurrent stories that come together in the BIG climactic chapter (and make no mistake, these are BIG, long chapters unlike Kill Bill) about a Jewish girl, Shoshanna (Mélanie Laurent) who runs away just in time before the Nazis kill her family who are in hiding on a French farm, and years later becomes an owner of a movie theater in Paris and is picked out by a popular 'star' Nazi soldier (Daniel Bruhl) to screen a film starring himself in a recreation of his slaughtering 300 people from a roof-top.The other is, naturally, the Basterds. It's actually with these story lines that Tarantino makes up his first rule to break: why not have a movie called Inglourious Basterds and *not* have them in every frame of the movie? Indeed, by my estimation, the Basterds are in about 55 to 60% of the full running time of the movie. But their scenes are the larger-than-life sort where we see Brad Pitt in an outstanding-cartoonish portrayal of a mass murderer/scalper who, in the real world, is a true-blue war criminal. Him and his men, which include 'the Bear' (Eli Roth in a surprisingly good turn) and Hugo Stigliz, tear-ass around Europe taking down any Nazis in site (the 'killin' Nazi business' as Ray says very clearly), and its hear we see an exaggeration of the take-no-prisoners philosophy of men in combat. Prisoners? Too much to bring along. Better to sic the Bear on em.And all the while Tarantino provides us with an absolutely menacing presence with Hans Landa, a German colonel who appears in the opening scenes in a manner akin to Angel Eyes in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (this is surely intentional, of course), only his evil is the smiling, chilling kind that reminds one of a William S. Buroughs line: the face of evil is the face of total need. Landa needs information, constantly, and asks so questioningly and with such cunning that we feel a sense of uncommon dread when he appears on screen, even when its just to eat a pastry with the (incognito) Shosanna. And leading in this role, almost threatening to tower over all of the other great or at least just revelatory performances, is that of Christoph Waltz. Take your eyes off this guy, I dare you. He's about as hypnotic and alluring and subtle as they come, and can floor you like Samuel L. Jackson reciting a Bible quote.But oh, yeah, this film is 'talky', make that clear again I should. Some scenes go on with a kind of cruel precision that one finds often in Tarantino's work, where you wonder if it might be going *too* long but, in reality, you'll probably be too caught up in the acting, or the suspense that builds (i.e. the basement-bar scene is a classic example) to such a thick point you'll get goosebumps. But at the same time that Tarantino makes a muchly European movie, with small nods to German and French cinema and a surprisingly mature control of the characters and mis-en-scene, he also makes a gaudy spectacle with his Hitler (at first) coming up like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges in You Natzi Spy, or even just Pitt's voice and mannerisms. It's something special to see a filmmaker embrace conventions and then set them with a box of grenades in another. If you see the climax you'll see what that means even more (and that, perhaps, reaches a pornographic exploitation of Nazi carnage).Inglourious Basterds left me intrigued, startled, laughing, cringing, jaw-agape and eyes-widened, and left me hungry for more. Some will leave disappointed and some will complain. There not without their rights in this case. It's also one of a handful of examples in 2009 cinema of true f***-the-world 'art' you'll come across. I, for one, can't wait to go into it again, even with that final line screaming (delightfully) of its director's hubris.",10,11,33,21 August 2009
Amistad," Good, but kinda odd
","Steven Spielberg's Amistad is a good effort on his part (also his first directorial effort for his Dreamworks pictures), which is the direction, but it is kinda odd. The plot is well executed, but many scenes (mainly with the Amistad Africans) seemed strange. But besides that, the story gets the movie to be good. Especially with It's acting by Morgan Freeman, Sir Anthony Hopkins (oddly, he is the only real main white lead in this film and he got an Oscar nomination), Matthew McConaghey and in a breakthrough performance Djimon Hunsou. Film follows int he tradition of Spielberg's black cinema (The Color Purple). Not in the best of the year film category, but not Spielberg's worst either. B+",7,1,4,10 July 2000
Coraline," Henry Selick's slightly familiar but nonetheless inventive and wonderful journey through the light and dark of child's dreams
","It's important that films are still being made with stop-motion animation, the all-encompassing and painstaking art that involves hundreds of animators and designers to move pieces of plastic and mold and clay and whatever second by second and frame by frame. We still have the Wallace and Gromit guys at Aardman working well, and later this year Wes Anderson, who used some stop-motion in Life Aquatic, will be releasing a stop-motion adaptation of Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's not quite a dying animation form that may or may not need resuscitation like regular cell animation.But the form also needs ideas and fresh invention and some kind of approach that keeps innovation going on with where to take any sense of fantasy and wonder up for grabs. Henry Selick, thankfully, is a master having been the director of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, and he was the right and maybe only choice to give Neil Gaiman's Coraline an inventive perspective. This is a children's film that is not limited for its audience. Kids will eat it up and mostly be good for it (the screening I went to had barely a disruptive peep from the under 12 tykes), but it also stirs up a sense of enchantment with older viewers like, for example, those who were kids when 'Nightmare' came out. It has some obvious comparisons to make to Alice in Wonderland and other fantasy lore, and its slight sense of familiarity in the conventional parts to the story keep it from being the animated event of the year.But, as I said, it also provides the unexpected. For example a comparison to make which some may not pick up is that the first half of the film is akin to Michel Gondry's The Science of Sleep. Both films have that immensely powerful and intoxicating and just plain damn fun quality that is child-like with its main character's connection to dreams as a means of experiencing what is much more gratifying than in real life's doldrums and disappointments. This threw me off in the best way; the trailer and previews made it seem like Coraline has this ho-hum existence being in a new home in Oregon with her distracted parents and slips through the hole in the door in the wall and stays there for the whole movie. I was content with that expectation, but the facet of dreams meshing with reality- and reality itself already being strange enough as it is with its inspired and odd characters like the European trapeze artist and the two aged female performance artists with stuffed angel dogs- added a whole other dimension.This time it becomes about this little girl Coraline's temptations of staying in this dreamworld, where her 'other' parents have button-eyes and offer up constant treats and goodies and the father makes a garden around the house to look from the sky like Coraline's face, and how she has to overcome some pretty startling obstacles to get her real parents back into reality from the evil twisted version of the 'other' mother... sound complicated? It's not.This is such a whimsical movie that it's hard to describe everything that makes it so jaw-droopingly amazing. There may be a bias for those who gobble up new and crazy sights in stop-motion, and here some of it is just conventionally strange like the next-door neighbor boy of Coraline's with the frizzy hair and half-bike-half-motorcycle, or the trapeze artist voiced by Ian McShane with a propensity to feed his kangaroo mice (in the 'dream' side of things of course, one of my personal favorites of any movie in years), or the dead ghost children the evil skeletal mother keeps locked away who need their real eyes back. The story proposes nightmarish visions for children but nothing so shocking as to send them crying down the aisles... or maybe so depending on their temperaments (I really jumped in my seat from some shocks Selick delivered), and it thrills precisely because it doesn't pander to a child's imagination. It's a film that understands how dreams work, and how intoxicating they can get, and why for perhaps all the dangerous reasons it's essential to have them. It also reminds us why to keep little doors that are supposedly bricked-up to stay that way. 9.5/10",9,0,2,15 February 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Less than great, a whole lot less than exceptable also
","John Madden's Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a film which lags and sags, and it is pretty pathetic at times.  Some lush settings and John Hurt don't make up for inane dialogue, and braindead performances.Penelope Cruz lives on a island that has been pretty secluded since, oh I'd guess since the dawn of time?  Ok, not the greatest sarcasm.  Anyway, she has a fiance, played by Christian Bale who doesn't really fit the role of a greece type of person unfortunately, and she will marry him as soon as he comes back from the war.  But while he's away, the Italians come in to the island and it should seem that her world might seem normal anyway.  But then her father, played by Hurt who is the only watchable guy in the movie, lets an Italian Opera soldier (is that what you'd call this contradiction of a man) played by Nicolas cage with Italian accent and all, inter her home. And I don't think I need to go any further, not because it's unthinkable, but because I don't want to drone on with the obvious plot points.Not reccomendable, unless you are a really die-hard fan of Madden's last film Shakespeare in Love (which I felt was ludicrous when it came time to the Oscars) or the novel it's based on.

This Is the End," outrageous fun, and a solid satire on fame
","You don't expect that a movie that purports to be a silly comedy about the end of the world happening to the 'real' Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel to have poignancy or a satirical message, but that is what you actually get here. As the directorial debut for Rogen and long-time collaborator Evan Goldberg, they really put the work into this. A 30 million dollar flick that looks bigger and bolder than it does, though weirder than you'd expect at times. Mostly, it's full of gross-out gags and tasteless jokes.But why then does it work so well, as a laugh-a-minute (even more sometimes) comedy that, up to a point, even takes it characters seriously? Because the actors have, naturally a rapore, and don't mind making knuckleheads of themselves. It's also an example of dumb being done smart, which can also be seen in Superbad and Knocked up and up to a point in The Green Hornet (The Interview, their follow-up, is even bolder and mostly works as well).Celebrity culture can be easy to lampoon, but the targets here are not exactly obscure or in-jokey, at least too much. When McBride shows up, practically unannounced, eating all of the character's stashed-away-for-the-duration food at Franco's place and proceeds to mock them mercilessly, every line is a zinger and is funny even if you don't know (by some chance) that Hill got nominated for an Oscar for Moneyball. Rogen and Golderg rely on the character's behavior, and a knowingness that the characters do dumb things.The difference in quality between this and more super-low-brow stuff - let's say the Scary Movies flicks - is in the timing and quick-witted spontaneity and the embracing of the crude humor. When a demon shows up with a big swinging, uh, phallus, it certainly isn't subtle. But if just reading that you chuckle, then you know what you're in for. The actors are all game for being made jokes out of one another, and recognizing their idiocy especially in the back-drop that is presented here. And it's a real MOVIE as well, the filmmakers take the back-drop seriously and present it not as a joke - it can be rather terrifying to see some of the crazy things happen around these character (rapturing, holes in the ground sucking people in, fires, demons, crazy CGI creatures).Among all this, the 'characters' are, to varying degrees, self-obsessed ego-heads (Hill especially gets a fun part to play as himself with a 'Oh, I act nice, but really I'm this' sort of guy), all basically not equipped for such an apocalypse as is happening to them, and Rogen/Golderg have great enjoyment, but take seriously within the scope of what they set out to do, in making the character dynamics count. So, within the scope of the story, every character has something to do, a viewpoint, even (gasp) arcs to go through, all leading up to that wonderful plot device known as the Rapture.Ultimately, This is the End is all in good fun, revels in the ups-and-downs of these characters and their conflicts that bring them down to base levels, and the mockery is knowing and clever. It's also stylish and fun, and shows young filmmakers really strapping in and taking people for a ride. It's the kind of flick you can watch over and over. Especially if you have been aching to see PIneapple Express 2 featuring Woody Harrelson.",10,2,9,4 February 2015
Dawn of the Dead," A post-modernist's take on Romero's masterpiece- a good film, for what it's worth...
","(SPOILER WARNING)I won't be a complete close-minded critic of the remake of the new Dawn of the Dead remake, but I do have to be critical about it, not just for my own piece of mind, but because I think the original happens to have a crucial place in horror, and indeed all of cinema, history.  When Romero created his film it was definitely original, or at least an original riff on what he had started a decade before.  It had laughs, but it didn't over-do it in cheesy-ness, and there was a constant sense of doom and satire when dealing with the apocalyptic climate of his slow-moving, blue-ish & pale zombies roaming the country-sides.Now we have Zack Snyder, working from a script by James Gunn, who has decided to take on Romero's view of society and sense of horror for 2004. As I left the theater I felt similar, coincidentally, to how I felt after I first watched Tom Savini's remake of 'Night' years ago - yes, the make-up and special effects are improved, yes there are some effective scares here and there, and yes, every once in a while there's a laugh at a zombie's expense.  But, and here's a question for horror fans, why should it have been titled Dawn of the Dead?  Yeah, it takes the concept of the survivors in the mall, and it has some bits of dialog lifted from Romero's script. However, there I would say draws the line for the similarities.  In a way, I felt like the filmmakers could've just ripped Romero's material off, given the film a different title, and I wouldn't of thought and felt the story and attack sequences were not entirely improvements on the original but, well, mutations.Because, as a zombie film in and of itself, set aside from the reality that it is a remake (this is for all you who didn't see the original yet and are thinking of seeing this one first), it's not a poorly made or deplorable work.  The acting is also dependable, especially by the likes of a strong lead in Rhames, an interesting female lead in Polley, a chilling supporting role in Phiefer, and plenty of well-balanced work turned in by character actors like Weber and Burrell.  As I said, the make-up is impressive (er, for it's Hollywood budget), and there's one scene involving a pregnant woman that did have me glued to my seat.But then there came the problems I had with the film, and it wasn't just that not enough time and patience was given to develop the characters more appropriately or give the story a certain juicy-ness Romero had pouring out of him.  Now, I don't think running zombies are a cause for total uproar - I thought it was highly effective in 28 Days Later, as prime example - yet I may not be the only one who thinks that there's something just slightly eerie and exact to how the living-dead moved in Romero's films as opposed to Snyder's.  There are the explanations I've heard from various zombie fanatics (many on this site) to explain it, but it's almost irrelevant to explain it for a genre such as this.  The living-dead exist entirely in the 'movie world', and since this film doesn't even bother to explain how the virus got started (the original didn't explain it either, but it didn't have to as it was a sequel to a film that did explain it in its sci-fi quality), saying one is more shocking than the other doesn't give much justice to how people will react person to person.  As for the other flaws, I thought the dog element was a little under-cooked (is dog too good for their tastes, huh?), a number of times the dialog felt forced, and also the very end left a bad taste in my mouth.  I won't say much about it, but the last scenes in this film remind me what separates such a remake from an original horror film from the 1970's - a minor lack of respect for audience intelligence and expectations.Maybe I've been sounding biased in parts of my review, that I should recognize that it's a revision, and it should be respected.  I do respect it, and it wasn't a disappointment.  As I left the theater though, I realized something that also came to me after I left the Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake (which was a huge mess any way to look at it), and also after seeing the remake of Cape Fear recently (a film of which I haven't seen the original yet, which I fear I may not like as much, though time will tell).  Some movies may be seen when we are young, and they may leave such an impression, especially after multiple viewings, that the first notion of a remake sounds ridiculous.  It's not to say that when a director has an idea of how they personally want to improve on a classic it's not warranted. But, with some films, it's often very challenging to be equalized let alone top them.  A number of films may improve on originals, giving the original director a taste of what new blood has to offer for the genre.  In dealing with Dawn of the Dead, I won't be a movie-snob and say that a remake should not have been attempted let alone executed.  It's not a failure - it's just not anything I'll pay to see again unless it's on cable.  Note of interest to fans, they're (for gag value I suppose) cameos with original stars like Ken Foree and Tom Savini, though for not much other purpose than to remind viewers it's a remake.  Oh well - (strong) B",7,3,6,25 March 2004
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2. Must be the start of summer
","Jon Favreau is out to make a good comic-book summer popcorn movie with Iron Man 2, no more no less. Anyone expecting the super dark out of this film lime the Dark Knight need venture along to something else (for one, Nolan's own Inception, but that's not here nor there). We once again have Tony Stark, the man and self-made legend, who is unique among superheroes as he 'came-out' as it were at the end of the first film as being in fact Iron Man. He now has to deal with other things, such as the government wanting, telling, him to hand over his technology for defense ('I have just privatized world peace' is a keeper of a line), and his heart and soul Pepper Potts, and other new things, such as prickly competition in Justin Hammer, a hot red-headed secretary who can kick ass (and other things)... oh, and his father's legacy and the possibility that his technology for his heart may kill him.So as you can imagine, Stark is not quite at the top of his game. He can still kick ass as Iron Man - when the suit is in close proximity - but his nearly-close-to-deathness and still cleaning up after Stark company mistakes (such as the gnarly Russian cold-war leftover Ivan, aka 'Whiplash', played with gnarly gumption by Mickey Rourke), make him even more of an egotistical jerk than usual. This is what Favreau makes interesting: Stark has grown over time, but the obstacles in his path really knock him for a loop despite always putting a slightly self-deprecating and sarcastic face on things (or, other times, drunk-off-his-ass face on things, which brings Rhodey to become a 'War Machine'). What does a hero have to do to still be an extravagant billionaire out in public and not have to suffer fools trying to crib his technology? Stark's complexity carries the dramatic weight (if sometimes not quite as much as before; the midpoint becomes a little sluggish, though certainly not unwatchable when Sam Jackson comes on screen as Nick Fury), and Downey Jr still makes him one of the most fascinating and just plain f***ing fun superheroes around. Tony Stark is someone you'd love to hate if he weren't such a lovable louse. He's a womanizer and doesn't put on airs, but he deeply cares more about things that do matter than most, and Downey is able to balance out that snark and sense of humor of things with more heartfelt moments like with Paltrow's Pepper Potts (watch those scenes where he offers her the CEO position and then near the end when... well, don't want to spoil that, but they are touching). The new additions to the cast help a bit as well: Rockwell has some fun playing a one 1/2 dimensional slimeball of a politico, and Rourke gets to grit and act gnarly with the best of them as Whiplash. And Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Romanoff... woof.Oh, and the action is still high-flying and exciting and has some surprises in store for the audience (others like the 'ex-wife' actually, pleasantly, underwhelm as irony), and Favreau is able to still manage getting in the humorous beats in those intense moments of action and daring-do. While not every joke hits or line connects, enough do to keep things going on; Favreau even has fun with himself in the Happy Hogan role in a fight scene that is just about perfect for him. The biggest problem though is the allusions - no, wait, flat out references - to the upcoming Avengers movie and other tie-ins to the Marvel universe. In the past it was a little more subtle (a SHIELD joke near the end of the first one, and a cameo of Stark in Incredible Hulk notwithstanding), and in this they are crowbared in a few scenes, albeit one involving Captain America is very funny.But look, this isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't necessarily trying to up the ante on the first one (though, frankly as one of the truly great comic-book adaptations, what could), but it kicks some ass and gets some laughs and assembles a top-shelf cast for a script that's worth the time and money and energy. It's a nice kick-start: the summer of 10 is here.",7,1,4,7 May 2010
Lords of Dogtown," passable enough for a easy-going afternoon, but less than outstanding entertainment
","Maybe I'm a little jaded from Lords of Dogtown following the documentary Dogtown & Z-Boys, and maybe my interest in the film is compounded by the fact that I'm not that heavy into skateboarders- even ones that can do some incredible things like the Z-Boys. But the film here, which has some moments of fine humor and edge and even a little drama, isn't something I would outright recommend unless you already know what you're getting into. For example, if you're the kind of person, male or female (though probably male as, for the most part, it is a male-dominated activity), that shops often at the VANS store, or own many Tony Hawk video games, this is the film event of the year. But for the casual observer of the sport, reactions may vary. The drama, of what is there, doesn't totally pick up mainly until the latter part of the film as the Z-Boys start to gain more notoriety with their shake-up of the skateboarding world. From what I remember seeing, much of the film is set among guys- some very famous future skaters like Stacy (John Robinson) and Jay (Emile Hirsch, who does make an impression with his longish blonde hair and cool demeanor)- who hang out a lot, and try to one-up each other with their 'moves', mostly in swimming pools they sneak into and other grungy places in 1970s surf-side California. Some of these scenes are really funny; I particularly liked Heath Ledger (somewhat unrecognizable) as the head of a skater-shop named Skip. But a lot of this is also a bit aimless, even as it has a quasi-organizing principle. As a much stronger storytelling/visual stroke was in the documentary, director Catherine Hardwicke just tries to make it as 'docu-drama' as possible, with more attitude than real characterization, and sometimes scenes that come off TOO improvised, if that's possible. Not a bad film in the slightest, and if it's ever a pretty mellow day with some friends who are more into the high-stakes, big-game skater world than I, I'd watch it again. It's just that it doesn't necessarily work either as an affecting tale of a small revolution with the youth in the 70s.",6,2,9,6 November 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Ripley's Believe it or Not
","One wouldn't think of pairing Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a half of the directing team responsible (in the 90's) for the very good Delicatessen and visual masterwork City of Lost Children, and Joss Whedon, a comedy writer fresh off an Oscar nomination for Toy Story (yes, there was a time) and just about to start Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But here they are, taking the franchise that started with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into another direction. It's one that's very promising, and in a very 'sci-fi'-like approach: 200 years in the future, the little remains left of Ripley after the end of Alien3 (you know, the one where she, uh, throws herself into the fire), is taken by evil corporation guys who clone her after several tries and extract from her the alien being still inside her to make, what do you think, MORE aliens to, you know, get them to do tricks and cure diseases and things like that. I smile just writing it.Of course, almost immediately, the aliens break out of their hermetically sealed cages (oddly enough through slaughtering one of their own for the benefit of its acid blood), and wreak havoc, once again, on a vessel carrying Ripley and a motley crew of bandits on a ship called 'Betty', who were originally hired to get some extra clones to the military dumb-asses. After this, along with some of those juicy scenes of tough-but-funny dialog, Whedon kicks off a series of action set pieces that leads up to a revelation that is... not entirely satisfying. But it's got characters that, as unsavory (Ron Perlman) and strange (the clone-dude from City of Lost Children) as they are, we care about for the same reason we did in Alien and Aliens; they can take care of themselves pretty well, but only so far as in the midst of a dozen aliens - that have already hatched, of course.Sure, the tropes of the series are well worn by now, and perhaps Whedon and the producers knew this too. That is some of the fun of it, though its familiarity keeps it from being completely fresh (i.e. another 'a-hole' robot on board, you might guess who based on star ranking, traitor on the ship) and there's a couple of things the characters do that seem a little stupid, or rather stupider than one would think to be done by either the director or writer (i.e. bringing along the guy infected by the alien egg), its the re-fresh part that makes it worthwhile. It's visually got the same kind of knock-em-off-your-feet flair that Jeunet made his name on at the time, particularly with an underwater sequence and just the way his camera can VROOM (not zoom) in on a character's face or a moment of action. And the storytelling, however old-hat in parts, tries for some clever things and even tries to lighten it up, ironically, with sarcastic touches and even campiness. Not to mention the actors all having a fun time, even if they don't show it a whole lot (Weaver especially rises up her flat Ripley into something cunning and sarcastic) At the same time, there's a few glaring things keeping it from real greatness. Aside from the conventions that in previous times Ridley Scott subverted as opposed to just taking along and charging up with adrenaline and ultra-violence, there's the factor of the 'human-alien' hybrid. Its design isn't that bad, but what it does is never really made too clear. How much does its human side end up affecting the alien part? Is it cause its a baby, or has it grown super-fast? And before we can have some time with this creation that has some interest even in its silly dimensions (ever seen an alien 'lick' someone with its tongue, don't think so), it's given one of the most needlessly gory death scenes I've seen in recent memory. I find it hard to believe it was originally planned for the first Alien movie, but even as such its presentation here from Jeunet is just mind-bogglingly over the top, and not in a funny way. Up until this point I had been with the movie, more or less (mostly more), as a work of commercial Hollywood art. And then it had to go into pricey-goofy Troma-vision. 7.5/10",7,2,3,11 August 2009
Passengers," so much talent, and an ideal premise, poorly and even dangerously executed
","It was a tough call for me to even go see this; I knew what the 'twist' was, which isn't even so much of a twist if you pay enough attention to the trailer (the 'there's a reason we woke up early' line is and isn't a trick from Chris Pratt's character Jim), and I saw the early reviews, which were and still are not promising. I could have gone on with the rest of my Christmas vacation having not seen Passengers except for the simple fact that I'm currently somewhat a sucker for a movie, any movie, that is made with this ambition and scale (let alone a release at this time, albeit with major stars leading the way) and is an original script.Oddly enough I could say that about a number of films out this Christmas season - Sing and Why Him? are also 'original' properties - but this one, still a genre film as those are, looked like it had some real potential as science fiction or at least a desert island scenario with some existential ramifications: what happens if you're out of your cryogenic slumber for more than a lifetime before you're supposed to wake up? And what happens when loneliness settles in and the temptation to have a, uh, 'companion' along the way becomes too great? It struck me as mildly ironic that Jennifer Lawrence fought for and succeeded in getting paid more than her male co-star for a movie that is at least a little, if not more, sexist. I should try to separate myself from seeing it that way, but I can't help it as what writer Jon Spaihts and the producers present here (don't forget the latter being the ones who also call the shots, Mortem Tyldum directs though who knows how much say he had here with such a massive studio film) is skewed in such a way so that it comes close to (no, maybe, just being) a story of a man committing a life-rape. It's about violating someone's free will, not to mention the sex that comes with it (I'd stop short of saying it's actual rape, but I won't stop any SJW's coming forward with that charge), and then what should be the ramifications of when Lawrence's Aurora discovers the deception on Jim's part - which, I might add, is a stupid character thing that happens (thanks robot Michael Sheen - probably the best character in the movie).I pondered leaving the movie as to what might happen if the roles were reversed, what if it was about a woman waking up early on a ship with 90 years to go before reaching the destination only to get so lonely as to wake up a hunky guy who thinks that he woke up by accident. To get even more intense about it, what if it wasn't a *white* hunky male kind of likable guy like Chris Pratt (and it's a deceptive thing casting him, since, well, who doesn't like Chris Pratt after all?) What if, say, it was Laurence Fishburne instead, who is also in this movie and brings a great heap of pathos for about ten minutes of screen-time? Was this movie sort of, I don't know, calculated around how audiences would respond to such a monstrous thing as dooming someone to live the rest of their lives on a space-ship? Is that hashtag of white (male) privilege not applicable here? Maybe I am thinking this over too much, and that I should enjoy this film outside of the context of who these people are and what they do. I think if the third act had done a strong enough job of giving Jim a comeuppance, or bringing in some other stakes into the situation (i.e. what if a bunch of people wake up on their own, no problems to the ship). Instead it becomes one of those scenarios that's familiar from other sci-fi movies where disaster is looming if X isn't fixed with Y doing this and so on. It speaks to Tyldum not being a bad director (he doesn't have a ton of real vision, but he is competent) that I was even, if only on a surface level, feeling some of the intensity as the climax approaches and is executed, sort of like a less risky version of, say, the ending of Event Horizon (which Fisburne's presence reminded me of and made me wish I was watching instead).But near the end, like the last five minutes, it wastes more of the goodwill I was willing to extend it. I don't know or am not sure if the filmmakers took into context what this story and its consequences mean in line with the images being portrayed - again, forget if it's still a white guy, what if he looked like Seth Rogen or Kevin James, would we buy the redemption as much if it wasn't Star Lord - but beyond that, it ends up having similar problems to Spaihts own (co)scripted Prometheus: a film who's premise and set-up has so much that can spring from it, but how the details come out makes things frustrating, especially given the talent involved.If the movie had committed more to being darker, embracing itself as a full-blown horror movie (again, not unlike Event Horizon did), or made it less intentional, like if Aurora actually woke up on her own, then it could be different. But it's not, and we're left with something that is slickly made and troubling as hell.",5,19,43,22 December 2016
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," another success for Apatow and company, if not as spectacular as 07 releases
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the latest comedy of ups and downs with men and the opposite sex (err, women), is a solid effort, loaded with plenty of laughs, if a little too predictable to boot. Then again, this predictability has a charm to it; the central conceit of the picture is something of an irony: a broken-up couple, Peter (Jason Sigel) and Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), go their separate, coincidental ways to Hawaii- the guy to just escape to somewhere nice and secluded and typical, the girl to, well, have a week-long sex fest with her new British pop-singer guy- and the two find they're at the same hotel. So, they end up going through the most painful motions of the break-up right in sunny, surfy Hawaii at a resort where they can get drunk as they want, have sex much as they want, and both go through their paths of self-discovery.Of course, we're on the side of poor Peter, who might be a shlub but is a respectable one; he's working as a 'tone-maker' (not so much composer) for a CSI-rip-off show (starring Billy Baldwin! great gag #1), which Sarah is also the co-star of, and in his spare time is penning a rock opera of Dracula featuring puppets. And his heart was broken in the most inappropriate moments- right after being buck naked in the shower- which adds to the vulnerability. It's somewhat typical of the Apatow formula to go along with the guy, but why carp? Sigel, also co-writer, crafts Peter as a guy we want to get the right girl at the end (certainly not the hypocritical if beautiful Sarah), which ends up being Hawaian hotel customer service rep Rachel (Mila Kunis of That 70's Show), who is of course the right girl at the right time.Again, predictable, but the formula works so well, so why carp? The jokes come with some intermittent lulls, and despite regulars like Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd only appearing intermittently in one-note gag parts (both hysterical for what they're worth), the cast holds their own, particularly Sigel as the breakthrough of the bunch. Most noteworthy though is the Lothario/pop-star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, the real wild card of the movie), who is frank about his sleeping with whomever he wants, and is uproarious in that 'hey, he's British, and an a-hole to boot!' sort of way. Then, of course, there's the whole lot of gags involving penises, dialog referring to penises (and sometimes vaginas!), and, most thankfully, a juicy Dracula song sung by Sigel himself. What makes Forgetting Sarah Marshall a good, if not great, effort is the how knowing the cast and filmmakers are with slipping in little things, improvisations and a general attitude that makes it OK to laughs at some really uncomfortable things.It is, in a simplistic word, enjoyable. Did I mention a Dracula musical as its climax!",8,2,8,29 May 2008
The Hunger Games," like Harry Potter 1, at least we have a start
","The Hunger Games books were surprising for me in simply the way that I was recommended them not by teenagers but by adults my own age (late 20's/early 30's). It's a series that is marketed for the 'young adult' market, and it does have a strong female protagonist and a romantic love-triangle and things like that. But it's far less in the tradition of Twilight - Suzanne Collins can right and craft characters and make a strong, interesting point of view (Katniss narrates all three of the books) - than it does stuff like The Running Man or even The Long Walk (the Bachman books set in dystopia) or of course 1984 and things like that. It's grim, it's desolate, it's pitiless, and the 'Capital' is a place where people there (under President/Dictator Snow) create a sense of pageantry and pomp and colorful dresses and of course TELEVISION all while the Hunger Games are a series of death matches pitting teenagers against one another from 12 different districts.We know from the moment we see Katniss she'll be fine - this IS more than one book that we know of going into this first film, after all - but what is exciting is seeing how she gets out of the predicaments she gets in, how her hunting background and being a hunter on her own time, and just having a thickened skin from years of oppression and mind-screwery from propaganda, and the ways that people DIE. And sometimes these deaths of people are really miserable and rather wild; the one that stuck with me from both the book and the film involved a particular breed of bees/wasps, and that's all I'll say about that if you haven't seen the film.From the start the real strength in this film is Jennifer Lawrence in the lead of Katniss. She makes the center of the film so strong and captivating - a lot of it is what she holds back, has to internalize, which is always interesting when an actor can do that well - and so around her she gets actors that vary in quality from really tremendous (Sutherland, Banks, even Stanley Tucci in an over the top TV personality performance), and maybe OK ones, adequate ones that can get the movie rolling along (Hutcherson and Hemsworth really). But what is the weakness is that the filmmaking isn't that strong; Gary Ross and his DP Tom Stern and his three editors have taken an R movie, or what should be that due to the quality of the violence (it is vicious, just a step below its Japanese step-cousin Battle Royale), and made it into a PG-13 flick. It's still brutal at times, but it's in such a way that feels cheating and jarring, like Ross watched a bunch of Bourne movies to prep and doesn't really know how to shoot this stuff coherently.In other words, The Hunger Games disappointed me on a technical level, and sort of rushed through a few points that the book made more heartbreaking (a character named Roo gets a moment but not quite enough), and yet the acting saves a lot of the experience and there's a sense of satire that sneaks up on you where you don't necessarily expect it. It at first appears to be a much darker experience than mainstream audiences - I mean the MALL crowd, not just genre fans, this is meant for as many people as possible - but the sense of play with the world, how it doesn't steer away from the reality TV aspect, that it sort of embraces the conventions reality TV creates while skewering them, is creative and cool.",6,0,3,30 November 2015
Zootopia," a smart, funny, deeper than you'd expect animated film for adults as much as for kids
","Usually Disney means that it lacks a certain edge or quality that makes it 'safe' or palatable for all audiences. While Zootopia is certainly another big blockbuster for the studio, and especially for the filmmakers and animators who have been behind many of the smash successes of the past 10 years (starting with Meet the Robinsons up through now, when John Lasseter took over), it's not a movie with talking animals something that is dumbed down or has a message that gets obfuscated by too much (dumb) goofball comedy (I'm looking at you, Ice Age and Madagascar sequels). This is actually about something in the same way, not quite up to this level but in the same ballpark, as Watership Down or The Fox and the Hound - though the former is certainly darker than this and the latter a little sweeter and more grounded (much as it can be) in the real world, Zootopia is an excellent example of using animals to convey a message about where we are at today.The film might eschew the current horrors of police brutality (hey, it is ultimately a movie that kids can enjoy, and that might be a lot to take in as far as an animated movie with animals), but it is really impactful about telling a good message about a complicated subject: how does the 'melting pot' work? What happens when groups of people - or animals - converge in one city and have to interact with one another? What happens if the thing that separates the animals, acting without the human qualities (or like savage/aggressive beasts) is amplified to create tensions? And what happens when someone who doesn't fit in has the veracity and intelligence and just will-power to rise to the top of something tries to be accepted in a society where he (or in this case also primarily she) doesn't fit in? What I liked in the movie, aside from it having a very clever police procedural plot (which gets in jokes at the expense of The Godfather, which is nothing new but is done with a very funny Don Corleone parody in a tiny rat, and hippie-'nude' yoga-ists), is that it is generally about addressing what it means to be the 'other' in a society. It never comes outright and says 'it's about racism' point-blank, but it shows it even in something like scale.Some animated films may not pay or draw too much attention to how animals' size differences mark then, but here it's clear from almost the beginning that how small Judy the Bunny is sets her apart from everyone when she's in the city (and likewise how she is bigger than those in the Rodent district, which is a part of Zootopia built for little mice). So it's not hard to see why she is set apart, and yet the movie is more about if you really DO try to make a difference yourself and set yourself apart, you can change things. Maybe. Or you might be looked at as a sly fox your whole life, or a slow sloth. How are you perceived in the world? Though it has a couple of story problems (a story turn two thirds of the way through, which is kind of crammed in to create conflict where it could be handled much better as far as something that separates the two main characters), it's probably my favorite of the recent run of Disney Animated Films productions. And as heavy as I'm making this movie sound it really isn't - it's bright and colorful and the filmmakers have a terrific sense of a whole world that has been built; they could've rested on just one part (the main metropolitan/granite part of the city), but there's so many parts to it that it works for so many possibilities (polar bears, panthers, wolves have their parts of the city) that are seized.It's fresh, clever but also funny, with some excellent performances (Goodwin and Bateman sure, but Elba, Slade and Simmons are very welcome additions with their own personalities), plus it's a cop procedural, and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's this kind of movie so I can let it pass).",9,12,24,5 March 2016
12 Monkeys," Confusing, but after a while it comes together, extremely well
","When I first saw Twelve Monkeys, I felt like saying 'WHAT?! I was also twelve years old (odd coincidence), and I was so wrapped up into the atmosphere of the picture, this very worn-in future and grungy, underground style of science fiction. Years later, after having seen the film several times more, it sinks in a bit clearer, though the mystery around it, a sort of questioning that is posed more for the viewer to figure things out, stays around. It's one of the truly challenging works of not-entirely-classifiable science fiction films to come out of the 'mainstream' Hollywood in many years. It deals with madness, time, and how we chose to have our destinies stay the same or change or do anything to find out about ourselves, and it's done in such an entertaining fashion that it's got layers to it. It is a tale of a man (Bruce Willis) who is sent from 2029 to 1996 to stop the end of the world, which will take place very soon (a possible plausible thing considering the amount of possible ways to destroy the world through chemicals, especially towards the end of the 20th century).But, it doesn't start off there; first we get a series of scenes set in a mental hospital in 1990, with Brad Pitt's character as the deranged wildcat in the hospital. There's even a love story- in a manner of speaking- that unfolds between Willis and Madeline Stowe's character that is so unconventional that it is hard to find where the tension stops and where the real compassion begins. What ensues is strange yet intriguing; we're sure up to a point of where this might lead, but the final revelation still ranks among Gilliam's best. Disturbing and yet some great entertainment that doesn't sit like a lump for its audience to chew. The sparks and gears have to work in your head during this one, as layers get stripped and you have to piece it back together once it's done. But it's done in such a way that is totally apart from pretension. For art-film viewers the sight of Willis and Pitt might be a bit jarring, and likewise for the mainstream action-adventure crowd the amount of intense and odd camera moves will seem one-of-a-kind. For me, it's one of the best films of 1995, even the 90s.",10,6,10,29 April 2000
Au Revoir les Enfants," about friendship first, the horror of the German occupation (very close) second
","Louis Malle's Au Revoir Les Enfants goes head to head with Truffaut's the 400 Blows to creating *the* French film about what's real, and sometimes dark and terrifying, about childhood. Both films have conflicted young protagonists who are just starting to become teenagers, and faced with a question: how to live, or just react, in the world around them? In the case of Malle's film, however, there's a lot more going on in the personal side of things than just an outsider/petty criminal. It's about a boy who finds a friend, without really going out of his way, and then that friendship ending because of something that neither boy can control since one happens to be a Jew. The film doesn't start as some haunting elegy to youth, but by the end it becomes just that, and about the very crucial act of remembering.Indeed, one of the many strengths of Malle's masterpiece (his best film perhaps alongside Murmur of the Heart, also about a boy) is that it's so carefully remembered from forty years past and brought to life, as if it were happening today, at least emotionally. It's set in a Catholic all-boy's school in 1944 where Julien Quentin is off to learn and be away from his mom and dad, the latter he barely ever sees. There's a new boy, Jean Bonnet, who is attending the school, and immediately (perhaps predictably) he's picked on and bullied, though nothing too terrible that he can't bounce back. He somehow connects with Jean over the coming months, as they become stranded in the woods during a treasure hunt, one teaches the other piano, and Julien sees something rather startling: Jean praying at night with candles out and in a language he doesn't understand. Something else he discovers is his real name- Jean Kippelstein- and that he's a Jew. He has to asks someone first what a Jew is, the response from one of his school-mates simply 'A Jew doesn't eat pork.' Malle observes the ways of children without interfering with them, but at the same time creating an atmosphere that is so real that the hangups with melodrama never get in the way. The little dramas of an everyday school-boy life, or just the side-issues at the school (trading objects black-market style, sneaking around a copy of Arabian Nights, keeping up with playing be it on stilts in the playground), or, as it turns out, Julien's own little problems. What Malle does is subtle but extraordinary; by letting the story unfold in this gradual style, with little events building upon one another, a whole picture emerges of the story of these two friends set against this backdrop of Catholic highs and lows, French occupation by the Nazis, and the hint that there may be more than one Jew at the school - one where anti-semitism is noticed but not well experienced. We don't get a full dose of this reality until the scene at a restaurant, where Julien, Jean and Julien's family see it first-hand.There is a message Malle wants to convey of course, about the ultimate horror of the Nazi regime on good people, some innocent and some trying to do the right thing by hiding others, and we see this particularly in the climax of the story when the Germans come to the school to sniff out any/all Jewish refugees. But this isn't precisely paramount for Malle, or rather it's not the full reason one senses why he made the film and why it's so personal. It's because he knew these people, and that it's about friends and being cared for and being in a bond like the one Julien and Jean have. I wondered going in to the film if it would be more conventional, that it would be about Julien having to hide this secret from the other kids and something building to a point of Jean being found out.It doesn't work like that, really, except that Malle throws in a hint of existential turmoil: when asked in the class who is Jean Kippelstein Julien, who is the only one who knows, turns his head ever so briefly to Jean, but it's enough to signal the German as to who he is. What's so clever, and just devastating, about this is that it's not Julien's fault, ultimately, if Jean were to be caught, since as it turns out the school is turned upside down for anyone, and eventually three are brought out of the school and sent to Auschwitz. But, by the look on Julien's face, caught in a grip of tragedy, he feels in this moment as an adolescent as if it is his fault. Au revoir les enfants is never forced dramatically and all of its acting and scenes until the last ten minutes are so unforced that its ending is all the more crushing to the soul. It's a heart-rending, powerfully directed portrait of youth, in its ups and downs, and a year that must never be forgotten - not a moment.",10,1,1,30 November 2009
Shaun of the Dead," slightly genre-confused, but still a good comedy/horror show
","Shaun of the Dead has 2/3 of the most ingenious British comedy of 2004, or for that matter the past several years, and even has that appeal that romantic comedies only wish they could achieve in their timing and believable characters, however slacker-ish they are here. Then there's something interesting that goes on as Edgar Wright gets enveloped in making a pure zombie movie, and, for me, odd as it sounds, it doesn't totally work. I could understand why the shift comes, as danger looms in with the un-dead taking over the British village Pegg and Frost have to defend at all costs. At the same time, it's not quite as fulfilling as the razor-sharp satire and visual wackiness that went on in the main chunk of the picture. This being said, it's the kind of 'cult' movie that works at its best because it feeds off of said previous 'cult' movies like a flesh-eater on an intestinal tract; it knows how stupid it would be, however entertaining in an abstract way, if the un-dead started to rise and took over a little town or suburb or other. 'Let's go to the pub' isn't too far of a stretch for these guys as the mall was in Dawn of the Dead.As it stands, from having seen the film quite a while ago, it stays fresh in your mind for a while, for what works wonderfully in its violent and absent-minded glory (hmm, what's really going on here, is the tone for the first part), as well as a plum supporting role from Bill Nighy, and from what doesn't quite work. The last section, unfortunately, doesn't quite strike up the same level of delirious humor that it should, and ironically compared to the original Dawn of the Dead's last section, it's dead-pan without being hilarious, and just a straight-forward horror-fest. Which is fine, but the shift is sort of jarring and something that I didn't think quite recovered by the end of the film, albeit with the nice wink in the final shot. It's the kind of good British comedy that works best with a bunch of friends and a totally tuned-in sense of humor...or, perhaps, just someone looking for a different level of social satire with their zombie movie.",7,0,5,21 April 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," about as twisty and preposterous (and illogically fun) as a summer blockbuster gets
","I didn't expect the moon to be delivered by the sequel to the Pirates of the Caribbean because, frankly, the first film wasn't an awe-inspiring great blockbuster to begin with. It's a franchise based on a ride at a theme park, so you do know what you'll be getting when you enter into the film, which is a story that is less palatable as the action set pieces and sequences. In fact, I'd say I found this sequel to be on par with the first, with maybe a couple of very nice touches with two of the sequences. And, of course, there's Johnny Depp who is like both the magician and the rabbit that's getting pulled out of the hat- you don't know what's up his sleeve, but his mannerisms and facial expressions are also so obvious and over-the-top. He's created one of the more endearingly nutty and more often than not laugh-out-loud funny characters in a Hollywood blockbuster with this and the previous film, and if for nothing else he's worth seeing.But getting back to the pros and cons of the film. To those who've written (and I've read a few comments) saying this is the next Empire Strikes Back have, forgive me for saying, a screw-loose. Dead Man's Chest happens to not be too unique in one aspect- it pumps up so much contrivance in the plot turns that one is asked not to take it too seriously, but to keep it all in mind at the same time. And it's also, like with the previous Pirates entry, overlong as well in trying to fit in every note, this time mostly for the sake of part 3 coming up (with a 'wtf' twist at the very end). But, of course, most will not go expecting that logical or coherent a story, the bang-for-your buck sequences are where it's at, not to mention visual effects, and the filmmakers don't lack too much of that. The two favorites for me is the sort of wild goose chase over the island where Sparrow and Bloom and the others run from a group of crazed natives, and the big climax involving Davy Jones's huge monster against the black pearl.These scenes, with a few minor specks here and there, do make the film entertaining enough for a good 'popcorn' movie sit through once over. And there are even a couple of very funny lines or physical gags that might be worth mentioning to friends once the lights go up (and Davy Jones and his crew are a nice step-up from the skeletons in the last film). It's shame then that the same good in what can come with shallow, big-budget flicks like these don't carry the same creds with a good enough story. 6.5/10",6,3,10,8 July 2006
Last Flag Flying," Go see this movie. We don't get American dramas like this too much anymore.
","Last Flag Flying, from its title to the author of the book to the three central characters to the entire milieu and even down to specific places (from Virginia to New Hampshire, and mostly by train), cant help but be compared and measured up to The Last Detail, Hal Ashby and Robert Towne's towering work of early 70s/Vietnam era tragic-comedy about two Navy officers taking a man to the brig for a petty offense. I'm sure Linklater as a filmmaker knows this all too well, so for him the challenge was to make it appealing to those people (like me) who have seen TLD about a dozen times and at the same time to those who have no idea what that is. It's a rarity in an American cinema that is defined today largely by franchise potential and nostalgic-fetishism for things of $ value to have a *spiritual sequel* at all, let alone one that works. Luckily for us, Linklater hits his dramatic goldmine here with an easy and effort that seems minimal. Which, of course, makes it all the more of an astonishing feat.But here's the thing: Last Detail *is* different from this film in a key aspect- Marines. There was a line from 'Badads' Buddusky in that (Nicholson, who this time is Cranston, more or less, maybe less prone to full-blown outbursts though anger is there) where he said in a moment of vocalizing his sympathy for Meadows, the poor sod off to the Brig: 'Marines are assholes, you know that? It takes a sadistic temperament to be a Marine.' I don't know if that was in Ponicsans original Last Detail book, but I have to wonder if that was on the mind of Linklater when he changed up the characters (I believe the book is a direct followup to the original characters, and for a time Nicholson and Freeman were sought to reprise and fill those LD roles respectively) - what happens when we see these 'sadistic' beings as older men, weathered over time after decades of Vietnam having kicked their asses? Larry is the first name of Carrells character, also an ex-brig man, though why he was put away is left carefully ambiguous, and yet he is so soft spoken... Most likely because at any moment one suspects he might just burst into tears as, in this story, he is a recent widower and even more recent father to a slain Marine from Iraq 2003. So once again its a 'road movie' as Cranston's Sal and Fishburne's Muller (close enough to Mule) are sought by Larry to help him with the funeral arrangements, chiefly to bring the body to New Hampshire. This is not, of course, by the wish of the Marines who want the guy buried in Arlington; how much the lieutenant or captain or whomever impresses this upon Larry is striking and could seem overbearing, but that's the point - this is as much about the system these men have equally embraced and have discovered is a massive hunk of s**t, so to spiel, when it comes to really reckoning with human beings. And along the way there's a train ride where characters grow closer and joke around (its genuinely funny behavior too, which is so welcoming because it's both disarming and helps to diffuse problematic tension with a younger marine who was Larry Jr's best friend in Iraq), and another stop off in New York where the trio miss the train and spend a night just soaking in the city. Where Last Detail may have shown our intrepid (notantibutclose) heroes going to a party to get high and hit on girls, or get drunk or go to a whorehouse, now with a reverend in their midst (Fishburne by the way has the finest material, dramatically, comedically, everything, in so long I cant even remember) they get these magical things called cell phones, at Sal's distinct insistence, and a stop at a diner. All of this could be too much shoved in our faces like 'eh eh, remember that, remember this,' but it doesn't work that way. This is a director so confident in his material and his actors that the pace is perfect; it reflects this time that has to balance how Larry is still in a vulnerable place (also the marine friend too who knows some things that lead to an awkward admission in front of the captain character), but trying to be among human beings who can genuinely comfort him and make him laugh and also reckon with their own past ghosts. These are people who exist in their own story, and the shades to the previous Ponicsan adaptation are like icing on a sweet drama cake. All the cast is excellent here, but aside from Cranston, who one expects will be stellar (and is, makes it seem so effortless too when of course this takes as much character work as Heisenberg did), Carrell quietly walks away with this. He doesn't say much but that's they key: he's never not listening, even when he is a little lost in grief, and he is easily the starkest difference from what Quaid did in TLD. This is someone who has nothing left but tries and actually succeeds in carrying himself with dignity (or as much as possible). Yet he can be forceful, like he is with the marines when he first sees his son and then finds out what happens to him. Its a masters class in director and actor clicking in a way that is so quiet you almost don't notice it, and that's the key - by the end, a typical letter-discovery reading scene feels so earned. This is deeply felt, haunted, but not without a sense of humor. It's what I want out of movies",10,19,37,20 November 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie
","Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.Curse tells of a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer, despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night, he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree). One thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people, and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating, it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqué. For instance, at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it), and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place, and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed, once again under the moonlight, and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies. The action scenes, however, are the weakest scenes of the film, which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay, but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse', the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness, but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-",7,4,8,16 July 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," (cue shouting iconic name of villain with the word: Reboot)
","I actually do recommend the movie, it's good in an overall manner of speaking. The performances never falter, actors like Karl Urban and Simon Pegg never falter when given good lines to say and things to do emotionally in a scene, and Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as John Harrison - until his character starts losing interest past things like clear motivations or stakes past 'destroy everything'. The performances aren't the problem. Into Darkness suffers in the sense that I saw with Abrams' own Super 8 (Spielberg movies), as well as Prometheus (Alien(s)), which also was co-scripted by Damon Lindelof (seriously, has he just not been on top of things since Lost?), where there is just a streak, mostly after the halfway mark, of blatant fan-service. By this I mean that the movie starts out with a good premise, and being from a good place to do something different. But there comes a point where the makers lay out their cards, and the film becomes something else, something *too* familiar. I was fine with them actually bringing back Kahn to the world, in a way. This is the 'alternate' time-line (ala, again, Lost), but maybe they could do something new with him, being unthawed and back to reaping what he's after. Maybe there could have been something there. But from the moment 'John Harrison' says who he is, little by little, in a snowballing effect, the Bad Robot group just does not have it in them to let go of Space Seed/Wrath of Khan. Yes, there is not quite the vendetta that Khan had against Kirk. But at the same time that they were trying little things differently, there was always a sense of where the film was going to go. The writers - also Kurtzman and Orci who wrote the first rebooted film in 2009 - try and inject a lot of seemingly mind-blowing twists into the framework. Needless to say I could see almost all of them coming. And it was not as if I was looking out for this; it comes down to some simple screen writing plot-basics crap, which, in theory, should be fine. Kirk's arc is that he doesn't respect authority, does things his own way, and at the start of the film (again, I have to reiterate, the film has a wonderful set-up, especially with a trip to an indigenous alien planet that goes awry with saving Spock and revealing their ship to a race of aliens), it's clear where Kirk has to go. He must prove himself, if not to himself than to his crew or (again, spoiler) the memory of his mentor, Christopher Pike. Sacrifice is the deal here. And guess what - this time the twists and turns, for all of the characters, are... let's just say not quite organic to the film in and of itself. At least entirely.An homage here and there is fine. Hell, they brought back the tribbles for this one. The problem comes where it's just too obvious, and in Into Darkness it becomes too obvious where the makers are taking their material, which is, basically, anything very memorable about Wrath of Khan or parts of the episode Space Seed, all the way down to a death scene (with a reverse I guess, but still to the note) and a famous exclamation against aforementioned villain. It doesn't quite end the same way as its main influence. Maybe that's a good thing. Search for Spock is safe, for now. But at the same time it ultimately leaves the movie, a thrilling ride for parts of it and never exactly boring, into a place where its this: for a film called Into Darkness, it's too safe, and little plants put in by the writers pay off far too easily. Some fun action, an ideal cast still and performing the hell out of material that is familiar. But it's also frustratingly uneven and does a strange thing for the audience - half of the people seeing this, more or less, will be people familiar with the predecessors. The other half may be young people unfamiliar with TOS or WoK. For the former, I suspect, things will just ultimately come off awkward, laughable even, and odd. For the latter it may be fine, though they may not see some of the plot strands left behind (Klingons, seriously, what happened there?) in lieu of stroking off a portion of cinematic history. It makes one look at Tarantino as subtle by comparison of lifting from influences.",6,6,18,18 May 2013
12 Angry Men," a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema
","It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.",10,23,37,6 March 2006

Hostel," the first 'exploitation flick' of the year doesn't strike where it could've
","Eli Roth is a filmmaker I've heard about through the cult film 'Cabin Fever' and his latest film, Hostel, is presented by action-film maestro Quentin Tarantino, and produced by him and horror filmmaker Scott Spiegel. I wondered as the lights went up why Tarantino decided to put his name on the film. I can sort of understand why- as it brings out some grisly violent scenes, with enough gore to pack in his seeming enjoyment for it (see Kill Bill for details)- but also remembered that another film he was involved in, From Dusk Till Dawn, was quite similar. Dawn, also a film where it's sort of two topics converged into one 'exploitation' flick (which Tarantino himself might argue or not, depending on your pov of what's exploitive in the genre), was a much better film, with main characters (one of them played by QT himself) who were also violent, but somehow relatable. Roth's film here doesn't really give much to invest in the characters, and then when the film focuses on its final character's survival, it becomes not so much unbelievable- as I know by some point I SHOULD try to suspend disbelief- as it is empty.I like a horror film to be something that actually gives me suspense, and if it shocks me then to back it up with something in the story, or with the characters, to give it some leverage. The first forty-five minutes or so of 'Hostel' just shows our main characters, Paxton and Josh, living it up in Amsterdam, then taking a tip on another Hostel (or practical prostitution palace) in Bratislava. There's nothing given at all to the character really, except that one is less inhibited than the other at times. Roth tries to add substance by giving the run-down city an almost Third Man feel (i.e. there's curious, dangerous beings all around, particularly children and other undesirables, everyone possibly 'in' on what the main characters aren't). But Roth as a writer isn't much concerned with spending that much time with these guys, unlike Tarantino did with his screenplay ten years back. If there had been perhaps even more set-up, or more scenes showing the two (err three) friends together, there would've been back-up. However Roth is more interested in what comes in the second half of the film.To give credit where credit's due, Roth at least doesn't commit the sins of the filmmakers of, for example, 'Saw'. The cinematography and production design is a full notch above those far lesser, laughably bad films. In the sort of 'exploitation' sense he doesn't screw around with the audience by playing too many guessing games. Like QT, he goes for the torture scenes- and there are a good many few of them- by not always showing it, more of showing the reactions to the violence. And I suppose as a director dealing with such subversive, trashy material like sex (lots), drugs (some), and unmitigated carnage, he does film it without too many gimmicks or stupid flash cuts and such. However, his style, which isn't a horrible one, is lacking due to how the substance is too ambiguous for its own good (I only knew what this whole torture building was for after reading a couple of reviews after the fact) and didn't really keep me on the edge of my seat. If he was looking to make me laugh at times as well, which is good and bad depending on which scenes I might mean, its sometimes at far too inappropriate moments. All of the imposed atmosphere is moot when torture just happens for the sake of it.I know that Roth, unlike someone like Mel Gibson who said his film would be 'good for the soul', doesn't relish in these scenes, and maybe is trying for something gruesome out of the recent slew of ultra-violent Asian flicks ala Fukasaku and Miike. But the wit of those films, albeit quite dark, is too absent here, and after a while one wonders if all of this is more for the filmmakers' benefit than the audience's. Who knows, maybe I can recommend it for a certain quota of the public who are into the take-no-prisoners films like from the 70's (I Spit on Your Grave for example). But it just wasn't for me; after a while even after trying to shut my brain off and enjoy the mindlessness of it all, I got impatient. There's some good stuff in the film, but muddled over by not being able to connect the set-up with the payoff. C+",5,6,11,18 January 2006

The Rocker," Rainn Wilson is funny, but it can't elevate slight material
","The Rocker is content to be in its place, and I was content that it was, more or less. Less because it could have been something very funny, maybe on a level of smart rocker comedy like School of Rock (there's probably been numerous comparisons, but it ends with it being about a 30-something rocker teaching the 'kids' how to do it right), and would have perhaps peaked my interest to see it in the theater. But nothing from the trailers or the commercials made it appear to be much more than it looked: bland PG-13 stuff with some occasional prat-falls and Rainn Wilson used like a $10 hooker. As it turns out, expectations were met: it's perfectly suitable as a rental, but it shouldn't be something you feel sorry you missed. And, sadder still, it was the right choice to release it in one of those lesser release periods for movies: the ass-end of summer, so to speak.Oh sure, Rainn Wilson tries, and is funny throughout the movie as 'Fish', a once-drummer for Vesuvius, a heavy-metal bank that kicked him out so they could make it huge with a record company that insisted a family member replace him. After 20 years Fish's nephew comes to the now cranky old-school rocker and asks him to play the prom with his band, A.D.D. (not, not ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder- this brings a chuckle, but only one). It's a bust gig, but the idea of him as drummer sticks around, and soon it turns into, well, one of 'those' rock and roll movies, where it's not about the music so much as it's about the sort of 'rise-and-fall' story we've seen often: big record deal spear-headed by a one-dimensional a-hole (Will Arnett) and lots of fame and glory, but then the downside of ego and, in this case, a confrontation Fish has to make with his past demons of a former band.Wilson's sense of comic timing is impeccable, even when not a whole lot is going on. It's kind of sad seeing him try so hard, and sometime succeed, with material that either tries to be funny too much (again, physical or gross-out gags of the PG-13 variety) or not quite enough ('the naked drummer' good was amusing, but then the writers just left it behind without taking it a step further- a similar flop comparable to the much touted nudity scene in Forgetting Sarah Marhsall). Certain lines are memorable (' A lot of elevators play Celine Dion - that doesn't make it right'), and one or two scenes do stick out (the funniest without Wilson is by far Dimitri Martin's bit part as a pretentious music video maestro with a bolex), but, again, too many fall flat or are over-played or whatever. It's as if the filmmakers- and I include co-screenwriter Wallace Wolodarsky, usually a dependable writer from the Simpsons- were content in the knowledge that they were making at best an amusing B-movie and at worst forgettable fluff.This is best evidenced in the fact that a) when there is music from A.D.D. it's middling pop stuff with maybe the one song 'Not Bitter' being above average, and b) a misuse of a comic talent like Will Arnett, who seems to somehow suck the comic life out of any scene he's in - I can't tell whether it's his fault or the director for not letting him go off and improv or maybe not get enough, or maybe both, but either way he's in direct contrast with Wilson, who goes all out and is his usual fun Rainn Wilson self. The Rocker is what you've heard: not terrible, nothing great, a decent little Saturday afternoon potato-couch flick that will only remind you how you could be watching any given episode of the Office or Arrested Development instead.",5,2,6,20 June 2009
Public Enemies," 'What else do you need to know?'
","This is one of those rare cases where a director actually gets in the way of his own best intentions. Michael Mann is a smart director, sometimes so smart that one can see other movies pale in comparison to his distinctive voice and style. But he's also gone the way of David Lynch and Robert Rodriguez, shunning celluloid for digital video (you can say HD but you can't fool me, it's *digital* and it's *video*) no matter what the project may entail. His run in the new medium, this time DoP'd by a former Mann collaborator (previously amazing work in The Insider), started promisingly enough with Collateral, then he took a decent detour with Miami Vice, and now we come to this, a period piece shot and edited with an equal amount of professionalism and amateurish-ness that is hard for the mind to boggle with.Maybe there will be a lot in the audience that won't notice it. And yet for every scene here or there that is brilliantly shot, or a scene where the drama becomes intense and everything gels, there are many scenes that feel rushed, with some compositions way too over-exposed or just looking, well, like a video as opposed to some blockbuster gangster picture. And maybe it's partly my fault for 'not getting it', so to speak, that this is the way that movies will go into. But where-as Lynch's use of DV is like out of a surrealist's laboratory, and Rodriguez provides a clear sense of visual effects, Mann's skills as a director of drama and action seem amiss from the looks of Public Enemies. Too often I found myself being pulled out of the narrative, however loose it sometimes was, with digital 'noise' and uneven lighting got in the way (i.e unnecessary sound and bits of information that HD picks up naturally).But hey, what am I doing going on about all this technical stuff. The question really is this: is Public Enemies worth seeing? Yes and no. No for the technical reasons I mentioned, not to mention some scenes going on for a little too long (it's appropriately epic at 2 1/2 hours) and for some lack of character psychology or development save for Dillinger and possibly Cotillard's Billie. Yes because it is an enveloping bank robber saga more often than not, and it features more than a few pieces of really terrific acting. Some criticism has fallen the film for there not being enough narrative 'focus', but on its quasi-conventional terms in the scope of the gangster movie, there is a compelling story in there, somewhere.And Johnny Depp - he's so on here that it's hard to see him when he's 'off' really, and he makes this Dillinger a striking force, charismatic and suave, with that glint of danger always there, and a certain devilishness that he makes this real-life 'folk-hero' his own (my favorite of this kind of quality Depp brings comes when Dilinger sneaks into the HQ of the Dilinger-Manhunt station and nobody recognizes him). In a way Depp helps to project a similar slick panache the film carries, and between him and a couple of exciting/incredibly bloody shoot-outs, it is at least a curious viewing to see him. Bale, too has his moments, if a little more straightforward in the two-dimensional Melvin Purvis. Big points also go to a great caricature of a 30's figure of J Edgar Hoover by Billy Crudup. And, lastly, Cotillard in her first big Hollywood starring role following her Oscar win is impressive, if only in the last few reels when the intensity builds on her vs. Dillinger vs. the FBI.So what is Public Enemies? It's not a return to form nor a total embarrassment. It's got the fabric and texture of the 30s, the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cars down very well and the look of the film, crystal clear and muddy in a single scene, contradicts this. It's got a purpose, but its soul is contaminated in an odd way. Mann can be commended for giving a try at taking his digital technology in a 'period' piece, but at the end of it all, when the final line it uttered, the results are 50/50 at best.",6,1,8,1 July 2009
The Babadook," a terrifying movie about being a parent, or a child, or both
","William Friedkin, in his glowing adulation of the film, said that 'there's Psycho, Dialbolique, and now The Babadook' (may not be an exact quote, but close enough). I would've thrown in as most directly The Shining. While the house isn't a big part of what makes the creature the Babadook come out - not that the gray walls and drab appearance don't help to add to the atmosphere - the way that the parent-child relationship breaks down into murderous madness does. Perhaps it's like if one takes seriously the whole 'Book-As-Demon-Maker' from the Evil Dead movies as well: you open it up, read it, and things start to materialize in the most horrifying ways possible. But this isn't some people in a cabin in the woods - this is a widowed, single mother and her child, with the kid already a little eccentric (he's cute at being a magician, not so much wielding a small cross-bow, which me makes himself), and this book just amplifies everything wrong in their lives. Will their bond and promise to protect each other hold? The book arrives seemingly by some stranger, right on the doorstep for Amelia (Elise Davis) and her son Sam (Noah Wiseman). She reads to her son, as all good mothers do, but when she reads this book it terrifies him before she can finish it, with graphic images of mayhem and violence and the macabre. She tears it up, but it comes back to her all taped together and with *new* pages, detailing in practically prophetic terms what she will do to her dog, her son and herself. She burns it, and seems like the smart thing (except what to show the skeptical police force?) so she tries to cope and get on with her days. But things get frayed with her sister and her friends, and Amelia starts to... see things. Or have very vivid nightmares. It first starts with her son - the usual trope we see of the kid seeing things are the parent not believing him - and then it goes to her. Oh man, does it ever! The Babadook's triumph is in creating images and scenes and set-pieces where Amelia's frame of mind goes downhill, maybe not too fast but certainly fast enough with a six year old boy in the house. The boy is a fascinating character in how perception of him changes as the movie goes on; at first, he's almost kind of annoying, though not any more than your average 6-year old full of energy and vigor and whatnot, but he's also one of those distant and alone kids (no father, seemingly no friends, a disconnect with his cousin, and, as it's pointed out in almost darkly comic terms, a very quick response to adults with no filter). What's great is to see how he not so much changes but fulfills certain alluded-to set ups early in the movie that one thinks is just little things for the character to do. It's all the more disturbing because of his age; any older, and it would almost take on the qualities of a coming-of-age film for what he has to put up with with his mother.And Amelia... this character is really the main one, though it's arguable the mother and son are on equal footing as leads. The director Jennifer Kent really gets the audience into her frame of mind: vulnerable, broken in some way, healed up over time but the wounds could be ripped open, and it stems back to the loss of her husband (Sam's father of course), and in the way it leaves her by herself all the more when her son is off at her sister's or at school. There's a scene were we just watch her going about her day, walking around some stores, sitting in a car and happening to see another couple making out. Even a moment where she is sexually 'alone' emphasizes her state of mind, to a degree. All through this early part Davis makes Amelia real and strong and forceful along with those other qualities in the writing. So that by the time this book really rears its ugly head, she's in a position to try and fight it, but how can anyone fight the BABA-DOOK-DOOK-DOOK? The imagery Kent creates is staggering. She starts with TV - why are there old silent movies on the TV, would they be on, hey, why carp - and then unfolds it into seeing things in a neighbor's house, then on the walls, the ceilings, in her nightmares with her dead husband. Though it would seem the Babadook is a real demon/entity in this world, it's a constant question, especially in the second and third acts, if this woman is really losing her mind and what she sees is just magnified, wretched manifestations of everything turned upside down and blackened. For myself, after seeing horror films for so many years it takes a lot to get me scared. This one has the goods: it gets you invested in the characters, their relationship, and then gets to work making the mind throw up on itself with a bogeyman that is most terrifying for what it can unleash in the psychological sense.The Babadook may not quite be the new Psycho as Friedkin puts it - the ending is a little too ambiguous, perhaps, though not in any way bad, one just has to sit on it for a long time - but is it really good and worth watching and stop what you're doing and look it up on Netflix? Yes.",10,3,8,8 August 2015
The Other Boleyn Girl," could've been a good deal better, but as it stands it's not too disrespectful (not of history, I mean as a movie)
","The Other Boleyn Girl's approach to its story of corrupted love and lust and, in the end, the cold search for a male heir to Henry the VIII, might have worked a lot better had the director gone for one of two approaches: either an extremely restrained, Barry Lyndon-esq style with the performances and a tight control of shots and editing, OR a trashy guilty-pleasure kind of style, with an R rating and a look at the historical documents that throws it on its head completely. As it stands it's just... conventional, emotional kind of stuff. It's about as shallow in its own way as an episode of Beverly Hills 90210, and yet has enough really good acting (or at least appearing to be so) to justify its existence in movie theaters as opposed to straight-to-PBS weeknight. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know if this PG-13 material is for you.Now, taking just from history perspective, one should understand that it's not for purists: there's very little actual politics here, except 'No, Henry can't split from the Catholic church (next scene) Henry splits from Catholic church'. It's a relationship drama when it comes down to it, between the two Boleyn sisters, Ann (the more famous one, for obvious reasons, played by Natalie Portman) and Mary (the shy and sweet one, and thus the one to produce a male not-so-heir played by Scarlett Johansson), and how they become 'involved' with the infamous Tudor. Involved, by means of a pushy uncle and father who through power and influence get Mary to become his mistress and use her for a child which, ironically, can't be used as an heir to the throne. Meanwhile, Ann tempts Henry in the most dastardly way she knows how- reject him, and force him to break certain rules (i.e. divorce) to truly get what he wants. Bad move, it turns out of course.All of this plays out with sweeping, romantic/period music, great costumes and very good sets, and even the acting from Portman is way above average for this type of pap. She's truly on her way to being one of the best actresses of her time. Johansson, on the other hand, isn't given as much of a character to work with, so her performance doesn't go quite as deep (albeit when asked to do so she is good, weird non-eyebrows and all). Bana, on a whole other hand, has the crap end of the stick: he's so good an actor in other pieces- most notably Munich and, as I've heard but not seen, Chopper- that it's a shame to see him with such a one-dimensional cliché. It almost becomes like a dull running gag where it's more like the Henry Tudor corporation, where we continue to procreate the finest male seed to the next male heir.If it was more dangerous and seductive ala Dangerous Liasons, it's dramatic ambitions might get more and more interesting. As it stands, it's a good piece for the crowd its meant for: highbrow chick-flick fans, and those who want just a spike of difference between their Masterpiece theater and actual Hollywood product. If you want a great film, look elsewhere, probably much elsewhere.",6,2,9,29 February 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Best Animated Comedy I've Ever Seen
","South Park: Bigger, Longer and Un-cut is a great movie.  Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life.  And it also shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem just like a bunch of comedy writers and composers, but that they could be truly freedom fighters by show-casing this film.The story is about the four boys of South Park (Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman) and after they go into a rated R Terrence and Phillip flick, they start to use their new founded dirty words to excessive use.  Since the film is Canadian, a war breaks out between Canada and America.  Kenny dies (thats not a giveaway because on the TV show Kenny dies in every episode) and winds up in hell to find Sadaam Hussein and Satan as gay lovers.  Both plot sides are very hilarious (depending on if you watch the show) and it's very satirical (if you don't believe me, just look at Bill Gates getting shot in the movie).The Movie seems quite content in it's dirty foul-ness and funny comedy musical type way to make us laugh (not that thats a bad thing), but I think that Matt and Trey are tying to tell us something with this film.  It is a wakeup call to America that if censorship doesn't change soon, we might actually go to war with a country over something as arbitrary as censorship and freedom.  Or... it's just a good old fashioned comedy with fart jokes, sex humor, and a Winona Ryder playing ping-pong in her private area.  Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.  Never-the-less, this film is one of the best of the year.  A++",10,87,102,13 January 2000
The Danish Girl," disappointing on many counts
","I can't pretend to know all the particulars of the actual story this is based upon - the Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe (in the first part of the story Elinar) - and even as I can look up the real life facts and those that were in the book the movie's based on (and some of them are startling and could've made the more more compelling, but I'll get to that later), I have to take the movie on its own terms. And by itself, as a story telling about one of the first known cases of a man becoming a woman in the 20th century, it sucks. I don't mean this as any affront to anyone who wants to look for the messages of acceptance of others and considering the politics of the moment it's a touchy subject. But a movie can not be good despite being about something important, and actually that importance can sink a movie even further. In the case of The Danish Girl, it's art-house, Oscar-bait trash, and it's borderline (or simply just) dangerous as far as showing images of what it's like to go through what Elinar/Lili does in this story.Where to begin? I think this is a story that, if the filmmakers (namely the director and screenwriter, I'm looking at you Hooper), had gone to the actual true life material it could have made for some strong stuff, or at least some interesting contrasts. Take Gerda (who by the way with Vikander in a very good performance for what she's given has more screen time it seems than Redmayne, why she has Best supporting actress who knows whatever); she is shown as a talented, capable artist and she gets more offers and perhaps, arguably, gets better and deeper as an artist once she draws Lili - in his/her ambiguous form in art - and that's fine. But the real life Gerda, if one reads about it, was lesbian or at least bi-sexual. Imagine how this would've deepened the material, how there would be some tougher question to ask: a woman married to a man, which is not her exact sexual preference, then married to a woman and... what if she found *Lili attractive*? Forget the book for a moment and look at that original story and what potential is there for exploring sexual ambiguity and doubt on multiple fronts, maybe even being a little more daring with how sex and bodies are depicted (there is nudity here but it's mostly chaste)? Nope, can't go there, we've already got the Hot-Button-Topic of trans so can't let in the bi or lesb part of it, right? Vikander does what she can with the role, but so much of the dialog is trite, ridiculous, and flowery when it really should not be at all. And perhaps real transgender people can correct me, but it seems stupid the way the story takes certain turns. The first time that Lili meets in private with another man (Ben Wishaw's character, who is mentioned to be homosexual so there's, uh, no problem I guess as far as fidelity goes) her nose bleeds. Then when Elinar goes to the doctor and talks about his problems he describes (the doctor reads this) as bleeding out the nose, stomach cramps, and it happening once a month. Really? If psychosomatic things happen as far as men getting the same 'time of the month' bodily functions in the scope of becoming a woman, then fine, but in the scope of how it's presented in the film it's meant to be taken seriously and it feels laughable. So much of this film can be described as laughable, insipid, and frankly insulting to people who go sometimes their whole life feeling this way. From the way the film, not talking about real life or the book I mean the film here, presents it a man suddenly feels womanly as soon as he puts on stockings and a dress and some make-up and a wig.If the script had given just some minor indication about how Elinar felt beforehand then it might be more believable in the dramatic context of what comes after. But it never does that. In fact it goes further - Lili doesn't paint anymore once she is fully herself, and I didn't buy this either; does one really change all that much that artistic talent goes away too? But on top of all of the bad decisions and poor dialog from the script is Redmayne's performance, among the worst I can think of that's has the AMPAS seal of approval in nomination form. He is both so mannered and yet so affected, so over the top and obvious with every move that he/she makes, and it's to the point where his 'immersion' into the role seems more like a stunt. I can't decide if he may just be an actor who isn't particularly believable in general or if it's just here (in Hawking at least his immersion was more physical as far as a full-bodied thing). Here it's... lots of tics and stares and hand motions and a lot of nonsense that is sickening in its excessive nature.Bottom line, this is a poor attempt at making something grandiose, and Hooper's direction, which in his past work was sometimes distracting, is more noticeably bad here (we get it, you like wonky frames) I'm sure there are other films that depict transgender themes and characters better - I haven't seen it but have heard wonderful things about Tangerine from 2015 - but this is both watered down and preposterous, and it leaves its characters stripped down to where Lili is an unlikeable B-word and Gerda is the mostly accepting, all-too-loving wife.",3,5,9,30 April 2016
Coffee and Cigarettes," 3/4 of a masterpiece- some scenes sparkle with laughs and interest, some don't, still worth it
","Jim Jarmusch's latest film, Coffee and Cigarettes, plays like one of those albums by a band you really like, even though some tracks disappoint or overshadow others. I lost count by the time the film finished as to how many vignettes there were, with cups being filled and sipped and factory-made and hand-rolled cigs being put out one after another. But from what I saw, I could tell that the film's greatest asset was that each vignette carried a quirky, unique quality to it. There's something about the way Jarmusch writes dialog (unless some of this was improvised, which is a good guess from Benigni/Wright's scene and Waits/Pop's scene) and uses authentic B&W film stock that creates such a mood that's in-escapable. Love, like, or hate the film, Jarmusch is a pro at his own brand of film-making. Among the highlights, at least for me, were the RZA/GZA & Mill Murray vignette 'Delirium'; The Lee twins with Steve Buscemi in a Memphis diner; both of the Cousin's vignettes (though, personally, Molina just slightly ruled over Blanchett's great double-turn); Benigni/Wright and Waits/Pop were very strong. The other ones varied from being so-so (i.e. the White's vignette) to downright boring (or perhaps not so much as boring as pointless). The running theme keeps every vignette interesting, even when certain laughs don't work and the people, celebrities or not, are left wondering what they're doing there. So, Coffee and Cigarettes is a watchable little independent treat, though one almost wishes there was one more outstanding vignette to attach on.",9,2,5,7 June 2004
Oldboy," a revenge picture that isn't very pretty, and loves it that way
","Oldboy was a film I saw twice in the theater, in New York City (the second time not totally intentional, just the only thing playing worth seeing), and saw again recently. I'm still struck on how balls-to-the-wall director Chanwook Park goes with his story. It's actually not a bad story, but it needs a certain push and originality in drive to make it work. For some this will be overkill, and it's not without an argument. The film is violent, though perhaps not on the level of Fukasaku or Miike's films. It's disturbing, but in a way that hits deep by way of raw emotions that can only come out of East Asian cinema. And it has a level of drama that's staggering, maybe for some a little far-fetched. But it's also a good lot of the time a bitingly funny film, loaded with attitude to match its style, but with a heart as well.The small low-down on the story: Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-Sik in a towering performance worthy of Charles Bronson or Harvey Keitel or both) is nabbed un-wittingly and thrown into a prison. We follow him along in his long stint, seeming forever, until he suddenly gets 'released' into the open. Now it's time for revenge, but is the question of the truth, of the why, even more crucial than actually getting payback? This becomes the main dramatic pull of Oldboy, but it's not just a kind of ultra-violent fight and action filled epic saga. It's also a love story, so to speak, and a film about the mistakes of youth. The antagonist of the story, Lee Woo-Jin (Yu Ji-Tae in what is one of the most absorbing and calmly demented performances in recent memory), becomes a very threatening, dark presence in the film, omnipresent a lot of the time, like a devil watching over it's subject. And when it comes to the climax, there is a level of Greek tragedy that's so strong, it had a good few in the theater I saw the film clinging tenaciously to their seats.The story, admittedly, is relatively thin when one thinks about it, and if a director wanted to pull a Howard Hawks and cut past all of the modern aesthetic the film would be a third less in length. But the twisted pleasure of watching a film like Oldboy unfold is in the manipulation of the style, how Park and his director of photography Jeong Jeong-hung give the film an indie wham-bang zeal while at the same time following no rules. This is demonstrated in many tense scenes, but the memorable ones include at least a few key moments in Oh Dae-Su's prison cell, and particularly the infamous long-shot as the fight breaks out in the prison hallway. Seeing a scene like this may or may not draw some viewers down the line right away; how much can you take seeing a scene lasting 3 or 4 or more minutes of just brutal beating, choreographed to a full intensity? As with the film in general, it's a not-too guilty pleasure for genre fans, and for others they might watch it and think 'eh'.But it is also in the people, in the characters that creates a heightened pitch in Oldboy. It's like a filmed graphic novel in some ways, but dealing with characters who (possible exceptions being Lee Woo Jin and some of his 'posse') are not part of a criminal underworld, and our main hero is turned inside out, into what he calls as himself a 'monster' (watch for the reference to Frankenstein on TV, by the way). So, when it comes time for this harsh, piercing revelation scene in the high tower Lee occupies, it leads to some devastating stuff. Like the darkest bits out of Sophocles, Park's characters are practically doomed by fate, and it's not much of a picnic for them getting there. But for the audience, it's created as a post-modern stew. Oldboy is rough, taut, and in spurts quite visionary.",10,18,96,2 February 2006
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first- Sam Raimi proves his cool knack for balancing elements of action, drama and comedy
","Spider-man 2, at least, accomplishes one thing above all else- this time, when the Spidey flings himself through the air, it doesn't look as fake as it did in the first film. If anything, this time I did feel the exhilaration that the filmmakers intended. They, being the team at Edge FX, have taken the huge lot of profit from the first film, which became the smash of smashes in the comic-book movie genre, and on that end the film is a success. But even on the human front with characterization the film is a bit of an improvement, which is always tricky for a sequel to do. Two major action sequences involving Spider-man (Tobey Maguire) and his nemesis, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina, in a compelling turn), are shot and edited to a wonderful, creative impact. And, in an interesting bit when Doc Ock escapes a hospital, echoes of Raimi's Evil Dead comes through with subtle, if grin-inducing touches. The work done on the villain as well as the hero shows, and it helps that Ock is a sleeker, more threatening presence with his mechanical arms than the weird madman in Willem Dafoe's performance. There are also other factors that give Spider-Man 2 it's worth of entertainment, even as if follows story turns that we as the audience have seen in plenty of other movies (comic-book or otherwise) from Hollywood. There's a nice dosage of humor to tip the scale on the romantic/non-romantic drama, courtesy of J.K. Simmons' added time as the over the top newspaper editor, and as well to a few bits of business in dealing with the problems of being a guy in a costume (plus, there are a couple of fun cameos from some Raimi regulars). The performances aren't bad by the leads, but they haven't improved too well, and with the script that they're given some of the lines don't work as well as they should. Some are appropriate in their corny quality, some aren't. One of the key performances that comes through is Rosemary Harris' Aunt May, who's the most effective of the dramatic parts to the story. So, is Spider-man 2 as great as everyone's saying, that it's one of the great sequels and comic-book films of all time? To me, almost- it actually gets even more engrossing and interesting in its comic-book atmosphere on repeat viewings. It has a fresh appeal as a mainstream, thoughtful action film and, like Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy in the horror genre, it will live on when other superhero movies bite the dust in the video market.

The Secret in Their Eyes," a solid page turner of a mystery movie, with a few truly great scenes
","One of Howard Hawks' axioms was 'A film should have three good scenes and no bad ones,' meaning, basically, wow them a few times, and just make sure you don't suck too much. The Secret in Their Eyes is one of those kinds of movies, and while I wasn't impressed quite enough to agree with the Academy (awarding it Best Foreign film at the Oscars over truly magnificent films like The White Ribbon and Un Prophete), it gives an audience what it wants: believable and unpredictable characters, and a story that flips around through time but doesn't get too confusing. Certainly this is the kind of mystery movie, like a recent Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, that could potentially play to mass audiences (say, a small theater at a cineplex at a mall) and do pretty decently. That it's sometimes dark and a little crazy, with a couple of terrific performances, helps greatly.In the film, we follow a rape/murder case that starts in 1974 for Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin), who is called Counselor but is basically a detective. He and his partner, Sandoval (excellent drunk side-character played by Francella), are trying to solve this case, where a woman was brutally raped and murdered, but the killer is elusive, seemingly disappeared. But then there are some clues that arise, the 'Passion' element, and (spoiler) the killer is discovered. But this is barely even through the halfway point, and the twists keep coming after this, with constant inter-cutting from 1974 to 1999 when Esposito, having finished a book, still has his memories of what happened in the case, how something about it ended, be it what happened with the killer, and Sandoval, and the widower himself, Morales (Pablo Rago), doesn't sit well with him.It makes some sense looking up the director Juan Camponella, that he's directed far more episodes of Law & Order SVU and House than he has films since it really does work best as a kind of conventional murder- mystery (or just straight up 'what happened') story. And, like on those shows, when twists happen the audience is meant to go 'Wow' or 'Oh my God'. This is all well and good, but what about the artistry of it? Well, aside from the stellar acting, mostly by Francella and in his few minutes on screen Javier Godino as the perp (plus some sexy-without- trying acting by Villamil), it's those three scenes that stick out best. One of these is when Espositio and Sandoval, having tracked the 'passion' element to soccer, go to a soccer match, after a whole month of going to games and trying to see if the killer will show up. He finally is spotted, somehow, and runs. The camera-work in this scene is very much of the intense hand-held sometimes-shaky variety, but it's never false in its intentions, and the length of the shots are impressive as well. The standard shooting of a lot of the rest of the movie- save for some impressive and intentionally exceptional close-ups on some things- is broken up by this. Another scene is an interrogation, and this involves Esposito's boss, played by Villamil. This is the kind of interrogation scene that one wishes were this smart and harrowing as on Law & Order; you really don't know how far the characters will take the scene, but you know the actors are game and it makes it exciting.The last really great scene comes near the end, and while I can't reveal it- not as a spoiler but just as to not spoil the fun- its a combination of horrifying cinematography (or 'dark' kind), and the subtlety of the acting. When Camponella is able to strike the iron hot, The Secret in Their Eyes works amazing. The rest of the film is good too, just not as extraordinary as it thinks it might be, or could be. It's an interesting testament to mourning and memory, the loss or lack of love and what justice really means.",8,2,4,16 June 2010
Billy Elliot," The Tale of the Tiny Dancer
","Billy Elliot is one of the most enjoyable dramedies I've seen in a while. It is the opposite of the other independent smash Girlfight (girl becomes boxer instead of dancer, here boy becomes dancer instead of boxer).  The sprawling makes the film a little long, but it is worth the effort to watch this film for some fine performances (especially Jamie Bell as the lead) and some of the best dancing I've seen on celluloid.   Good film for a good time.  A-",8,0,0,1 December 2000
The Fifth Element," 'Does anybody else want to negotiate?'
","The Fifth Element, years ago it now seems (and was), played a lot of TV and I usually watched it many times when it was on. It's not really a 'great' film, or one that should be seen by all serious genre fans like Leon- The Professional was for crime films. But it's probably one of the most watchable science fiction adventures put to the screen in the late 90s, a kind of techno-punk version of Star Wars meant more for the late teens crowd than for everyone. It's story is simple enough- trying to retrieve some missing stones that will help save the world from a meteor or other about to collide and destroy everything, and the group of people who can stop it- that its the colorful, strange supporting performances and imaginative visuals can steal the show. Milla Jovovich, more than anyone, makes her mark as a real kind of 'breakthrough' role (i.e. I never really heard of her before the movie and for a while I thought of her as the '5th element' chick in high school). Her role doesn't require too much dialog- as she barely speaks English throughout most of the film. She's got the sexy look (PG-13 with nudity for the boys), lots of power in the fight scenes, and she can even work the emotional scenes to. I would probably take her work in this film over her other Besson collaboration in Joan of Arc, as here she takes herself seriously for what she is, and it still ranks as one of her very best performances so far in her decade long career playing roles like this.The rest of the cast, however, is a bit more hit or miss, though a little more hit than miss. Bruce Willis is his usually cynical, hard-edged self with remnants of John McClaine kicking around as an ex-officer turned cab driver who's recruited to take the '5th element' (Jovovoich) to get the stones and to the temple. Gary Oldman is very bizarre (see the 'blood' or 'sweat' or whatever trickle down his forehead during a tense phone conversation) as a villain who is a kind of pawn for the enemy, while also supplying weapon for a bunch of ugly creatures. Some of his scenes are the funniest, while being very creepy the whole while. Others like Tony Lister and Ian Holm are dependable as always in uncomplicated 2-dimensional roles. Only Chris Tucker gets pestering in his most flamboyant role to date (if that's possible) as the 'comic relief' in the form of a celeb host. I don't know if whether the character is really the problem or Tucker's interpretation, but I still feel those scenes are kind of distracting and below Tucker's comic skills.But as a pure action spectacle, you could do worse than the 5th Element, where it's a kind of future world with weird gadgets and items, all in a more Earth-bound perspective. The main battle scene in the opera is also on par with some of the better sequences in The Professional. Sometimes the themes are hit a little too often, repetitive if you will, like with Jovovich getting over-emotional (though her little lesson on the history of the world via computer is amazing). So it's not really as fantastic as Besson might think it is, yet every time it was on I didn't change the channel much; it's got that comic-book appeal where you know what will happen- of course in repeat viewings- but you want to stay tuned for the really nifty sequences and rewarding unconventional moments and lines.",8,6,11,23 July 2006
Black Book," lots of Nazi resistance-fighting intrigue, an ideal cast, good but bulky thriller
","Paul Verhoven isn't ever known so much for subtlety as a director, and Black Book doesn't really make any big steps to change that. It is, unlike his films from the past dozen or so years, not intentionally sleazy or overridden with lots of gruesome carnage. There's even a sense that he's probably quite passionate about making a film loaded with gripping history and lots of 'cinematic' characters (not totally real, not totally fake either). But it's also one where melodrama reigns over real incisive dramatic skills, and unlike the recently re-released Army of Shadows there's almost an exhausting quality to the twists and turns, the core being more about direct audience manipulation as opposed to more subdued theatrics. Not that this is the worst thing a director like Verhoven can do, and Black Book is loaded with the kind of entertaining goodies that other directors would shy away from. That it's not a great film- like it might think it is- is hard to ignore.Carice Van Houten puts in a breakthrough performance (breakthrough in that it calls for some greater things for her in Hollywood) as a Jewish woman who loses her family during a shooting via the Nazis. She joins up with the resistance, and her part in it will be, primarily, to sleep with enemy to get information. A little implausible? Not quite, as it's supposedly based on true events (whether it was a Jewish woman sleeping with the enemy or just in the little details of the Dutch resistance is up for argument), and soon the story unfolds in double-crosses and criss-crosses where you're never too sure after a while (and after the war ends) who's really a good guy or not, as for the most part few are. In general, Verhoven puts these double crosses- which end up making the film slightly bulkier than it needs to be- as a cynical but poignant point about loss of trust and all morals in times of war coming to a head. Rachel 'Ellis' Stein (Van Houten) also falls into what the script entails, of her falling in love with the main commanding officer she has to sleep with, which is rather circumspect in logical terms.But then again, after a while, looking at Black Book, ironically for it's veneer being that of an old-fashioned good versus evil story, things become subversive for a reason. The resistance itself, for example, is quite corruptible even with its higher ideals of eradicating all of the Nazis (the ugly side of which personified in the character of the portly Franken, who originally killed Rachel's family), and even have a double side to dealing with the Jewish people; does one value a Dutchman over a Jew becomes one of the central questions for the resistance fighters. And throughout Verhoven is on top of his game directing scenes strongly, with just what is needed for each scene, however convoluted, and the performances usually right on the money (The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch is a believable Nazi turncoat). It is, more often than not, a satisfying entry in the filmmaker's career, and even a return to form after running out of steam with his big Hollywood sci-fi productions. That it's also quite shallow, and with more than one or two really ridiculous scenes (one scenes subtext might be 'is that a gun popping under the bed, or are you just happy to see me?'), is maybe to be expected considering the track record of the filmmaker.",7,19,25,29 April 2007
Pirate Radio," a mild romp more than a rock-n-roll classic
","Richard Curtis' second film following his smash Love Actually (also an ensemble piece) is Pirate Radio (as it's called here, before it was the better-titled The Boat That Rocked). It comes with some minutes missing from its running time since its UK release, though from what was cut I don't know. What can be said is that the movie, at the least, is amiable fun, an amusing trip through the mostly fun times of a boat of 'pirate radio' rockers, who in 1966 had a ship that broadcasted the latest and greatest in rock tunes (Kinks, Stones, Yardbirds, Procol Harum, you name it they spin it), and kept leading along a frustrated Parliament tool (Branaugh, maybe the funniest one-note character of the movie) and his 'Twat' who tried and (sort of) succeeded in shutting them down with a bogus law. That's as much of a plot as you can really get here. Oh, and people really love the pirate radio station, a lot, as we can figure by the odd LOT of assortment of people Curtis cuts away to listening in all the time.The film is at best a hoot; we see talented actors like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rhys Ifans playing DJ's with big reputations and huge egos who play a game of chicken (put to Morricone of course); we see hijinks surrounding a new young guy on the boat who may lose his virginity, if and when he can get a 'con-dom', and once done may be announced over the radio; and Bill Nighy, whose mere presence on screen in his droll announcements as the manager of the station makes such as the 'Good news Bad News' bits. And it goes without saying that the soundtrack, almost neverending except for those scenes with Branaugh, is fantastic and makes scenes move along at a pleasant and often hip movement (my favorite scene like this being an awkward moment where three guys sit with tea and cookies listening to Leonard Cohen's 'So Long Marianne').But, sadly, a cool cast and some fab music a very good movie isn't made. The problem, maybe the big one, is that Curtis can't seem to really make most of these characters defined past their simple face-value features. Even when there's attempts to make them more well-rounded they're undercut by the 'situations' they're put in, and none except for the young man looking for his wayward father on the ship (the revelation a quick larf) have much to do except for small stories that come up like the 17-hour marriage or Nick Frost playing a sex machine (!) It seems, as mentioned, like something meant more for television, where one can dip in and out and be entertained in pieces, and perhaps skip over or flip away from those good but repetitive cut-aways to the odd-assortment of British people listening in to the shows. This is unfortunate since Curtis so made almost every character in Love Actually realistic and relatable, giving them short stories unto themselves as opposed to little 'bits' to do here and there.This isn't to say that if you're a rock fan, especially from that period (and really, if you're into rock and don't like that period in Britain, you should check yourself), you shouldn't see it. It's worth a view and it's never offensive to a viewer's tastes. It is, in a word, breezy: you sit down, have some fun, and only remember some scenes and maybe parts of Hoffman's performance that go beyond the call of duty. He actually is given the one scene that is actually poignant in the film: the station, late in the film, is in trouble, and he sits brooding in his chair: '... these are the best times of our lives.' This is said not as a cliché, but as a truth for this character. They are good times. If only they were less sloppily put together and focused with hilarity.",6,0,3,14 November 2009
"I Love You, Man"," the plot isn't what works- it's all about actors, timing, awkward pauses, realistic dialog
","I Love You, Man may feel like another Apatow company production, but it's mostly because some of its 'stock' company players (I put quotes as it's both a loose term and just about right) like Paul Rudd and Jason Siegel. They give the air of using the screenplay as the easiest of diving boards into just shooting-the-hell-of-it with one another as two friends. Rudd plays a guy about to get married and is embarrassed to find out, from all those around him more than anything, that he doesn't have many, or really any, true friends. He meets Siegel at an open house for Lou Ferrigno (he's a real estate agent and Ferrigno fills the oddball cameo choice, it's a great choice though), and the two hit it off as a 'bromance' develops.It's this 'bromance' that makes I Love You, Man a little interesting as a double-edged romantic comedy. It's already about Rudd and his to-be played by Rashida Jones, their little moments of fun and their arguments too (there's a cute running gag involving Rudd's imitations of the band Rush sounding like an Irishman), but then it's also got plenty of innuendo to this being really about the guys, how Siegel gets attached to Rudd in that way that surely isn't gay but is more than just casual acquaintance stuff (see his 'investment' plan unfold). But truth be told it's not even this that makes I Love You, Man so funny.Rudd and Siegel are simply funny guys, but naturally so; there's a new trend to put a somewhat straight face on gross out gags in these movies, Apatow or its spin-off groups (one can equate it to the good rip-offs of Tarantino in the 90s to a certain extent), and it works very well here. It's like a sweet blending of Curb Your Enthusiasm awkwardness (if, of course, nowhere near the genius of that, especially with story) and some of the low-brow Adam Sandler stuff and joyfully useless banter and non-jock male bonding. It's not any better or lessor than recent stuff from Siegel and Rudd; you could watch this with either Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Role Models and be satisfied about the same. Again, plot is not at all the strong suit, but if you just want some cleverly obvious comedy dialog it's a good detour.At the least, we get one of the funniest lines of the year, or just in years, near the very end: 'I love you... Broseph Goebbels!'",7,9,16,30 March 2009
Batman Returns," seen years later, a rare sequel that's better as an adult then as a kid
","I'm not gonna lie, for a while I was a bit down on Tim Burton's own sequel of his 1989 classic post-modern adaptation of the the dark knight. It was mostly in due to feeling that the script was weak, with dialog WAY over the top, and an overall appeal that just at times seemed either too serious for its own good or too hokey (I mean, penguins doing what they do in their final moments in the film, who'd of thunk). But seeing the film years later, as Batman Begins now has its mark in the comic-book world, I've found a greater appreciation for it and Burton's vision. It's actually one of the best of the franchise, a given to be better than the Schumacher films, but with an added appeal after seeing countless other films since taking this is as a kid.Even as it isn't necessarily great, it has brilliant things about it, from its lavish and spooky production design (hell of a way to make that Penguin lair), fantastic make-up, and twists that have a perverse fascination here and there as a blockbuster entertainment. I'm also very fond of the performances I see again. Keaton still has that deadpan style as Batman that works (even if he's lesser as Bruce Wayne); Pfieffer is the best that could be done with Catwoman; De Vito stand out and occasionally steals scenes as Oswald Cobblepot (his plight is almost the most poetically tragic of the series, however if not the best as a villain); Christopher Walken is, well Christopher Walken in one of the lesser of the over-the-top roles he's done.But maybe most of all that has me gravitating more to Batman Returns as one of the better sequels of the 90's is how much of Burton's vision makes it to the screen, and how his control over the material is present throughout very strongly, as the sense of humor is either very dark or just very silly (in a good way, 'My Babies!' Penguin cries out looking on at his confused penguins). And Danny Elfman's music is one of his best, at being at times eerily somber but with that Gothic edge the material needs. Plus, Burton understands a slight 'camp' element to what the Batman world might have, but doesn't overplay it like Schumacher did. In short, it's really just good entertainment that is maybe even more appealing after seeing all of Burton's films and, in general, just seeing more movies and understanding sloppy vs. successful in these hugely produced franchise pieces.",10,7,16,25 July 2000
Finding Nemo," Pixar's best since Bug's Life- The voice work corresponds magnificently with the artwork
","Finding Nemo, from co-directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (who have worked as directors on past pixar films like Bug's life and Toy Story 2) have devised an adventure film that takes the viewer far beyond anything imaginable with Little Mermaid. In fact, much of the humor and dialogue reminded me of the sophistication that went with an animated movie like Antz, where the top celebrity personalities came forth to give voice to wonderful creature creations.And speaking of Antz, this time there is a neurotic, obsessive caricature of a comic in Finding Nemo, here named Marlin and played by Albert Brooks. After his wife, a clown fish, and his hundreds of eggs are devoured by a larger fish, he finds one egg left and becomes compulsive in securing it's safety. His son Nemo, it turns out, gets caught in a diver's net and taken to a Dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. This sets Marlin off on his quest across the ocean, along with a fish who forgets things as soon as their mentioned, voiced by Ellen Degeneres. They encounter sharks in rehab, turtles with Californian accents, a whale (quasi-Pinnochio there), and much more, all the while little Nemo, inside the fish-tank and renamed Sharkbate, starts to gain the courage his father never considered he had, and vice-versa.The Pixar team, like in their previous treats, deliver worlds that usually can only exist in the imagination - the under-the-ocean scenes, making up about 65 percent of the film, are obviously breathtaking in design while not going overboard in realism, and the scenes in the dentist office and on the pier are precise too. It's like we've thought we've been here before, but now the filmmakers take us right into the nexus of it. This splendor, along with the voice work by Brooks, Degeneres, Willem Dafoe as the leader of the fish-tank pack, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, and all the supporting parts, give anyone in any age group the finest animated spectacle of the summer. By the way, those seagulls are the funniest thing Pixar's come up with since the aliens in Toy Story!",10,0,2,11 June 2003
Blade," One of the most exhilirating, intense and original movies of the 90's
","Blade is a movie that should become a classic.  It stars Wesley Snipes as a half vampire/half human who has they're strength, but also there thirst. So, he becomes a vampire hunter, trying to clense the earth of the horror known as vampires who lurk the earth among us.  Unfortunately, there is a vampire who will try to conquer the earth, but up against Blade, who knows. A film that gets better with each viewing and has so much action it should appeal to horror freaks, and should also appeal to the comic book people that are also in touch with Spawn.  The first bloodbath action sequence is a marvel.  A",8,1,3,28 April 2001
Superbad," a truly and unabashedly immature teen-sex/party comedy, and it's 100% irresistible to the 15 year old in me
","I know these guys, or at least feel like I do. Superbad isn't about simple clichéd figures of teenage angst and pent up sexual frustration, or with goofy nerdy stereotypes (though maybe for the latter there is almost that). Somehow Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who name the two lead characters after themselves, just know what it is about these guys, and that teenagers can be foul-mouthed and witty and naive and awkward and stupid and smart and crazy all in some equal measures with the levels put just right. It's low-brow to the max, but it never looks down on the audience but plays always to it, as if the same people right on the poster (McLovin included) are right in the audience, and are damn proud to see themselves up there. It's pretty damn near close to a teen classic comedy, with as much strengths in the dialog as a Dazed and Confused, and more outrageousness than an American Pie would think to go for. Even the cops in the movie are like the teenagers, only a few years old, and with guns, and lots of beer. It's the most fearlessly vulgar comedy of the year.Seth and Evan (Jonnah Hill and Michael Cera, the former from producer Judd Apatow's Knocked Up and the latter from Arrested Development) are best friends in high school, seniors soon to part way for separate colleges, and it bothers Seth that this is happening. Nevertheless, the partying must go on! But where seems to be the question, as they're both not exactly 'hip' amongst most, and don't get invited. Yet there is a change, as Seth is asked by Jules (Emma Stone) to a party with the condition that he bring the booze. A problem? Not quite- McLovin- a.k.a. Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, one of the great teen movie nerds) has a phony ID with said name, and goes through his own crazy adventure in first getting the supplies, then punched out by a random looter, then riding along with cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) who wan't just as much a good time as he does; what better way to bust a crime than at a bar- some beers on the way! Then comes the party, but first a detour at another party, then some mishaps with a stain (big whoops), and finally some good times at the main party, though it may depend on your definition of 'good' in terms of drunken would-be sex and letdowns.It's all very outrageous, every step of the way, and there's not a scene that goes by that doesn't contain the laughs that the actors, writers, and director go for. Even stuff that should be just crude and insane, like the many, many, many drawings of genitalia (and more if you stay through the end credits) from the 4th grader Seth, or the near Raising Arizona-like chase scene with the cops sloppily on route following a sudden hit and run with Seth and Evan, or puke jokes, or the 'stain' joke (where you can hear the collective groan from the audience, a great sign that people in the demographic can still be shocked or disgusted at least), or even the fate of the cops and McLovin as they tear up the cop car. All of it somehow connects completely, because Rogen and Goldberg, as well as the actors, don't pass by the truth that is within much of the scenes. Through all the antics they're just guys who have equal anxieties at their age regarding sex and friendship (not to mention that perfectly gay scene when they're snuggled drunk in the sleeping bags), and there's even a sweetness to their ambitions and disillusionment.Like Knocked Up, it's relatable as long as there's a given amount of suspension of disbelief. But Superbad goes even further than that film- and rightfully so- at combining physical comedy with what must be improvisation, hinging to the Mel Brooks credo to 'rise below vulgarity', and at the same time not getting scared off to add some fantastic one-liners and pop culture goofs in the mix (that a goof like McLovin stays fresh all the way to the end is a testament to the longevity of a one-note gag played right). Look at it this way, where else will I find a flick with joke about Orson Welles and the Coen brothers in between lots of talk about d***s and p*****s?",9,8,18,20 August 2007
The Great Dictator," plenty of laughs around some rougher moments- comic masterpiece of the year
","The Great Dictator came out at a time when it was riskiest, as on the brink of war a statement of the inaneness shifted n nuttiness of fascism, just shows how Chaplin had practically nothing to fear as an artist. That he is also able to incorporate a version of his usual tramp character into the mix, as a kind of general symbol (if that) of the ordinary shlub suddenly and madly under the gun, is part of the film's major appeal. Going back and forth between the styles of the film are tricky as well, as Chaplin's humor is similar but varying with the two sides of his characters. His Hynkel, the mad dictator of Tomania, is one of Chaplin's most inspired creations for himself, as he sputters off in a perfected gibberish/slant on the German-hate speech with many of the gags coming off. Some of these, ironically for the silent-film legend, are through the dialog pieces in his speeches and in the sometimes volatile and always nuanced (in the over-the-top way)with his underlings. Other bits just come from the way Chaplin's facial expressions go here to there- though his physical way of comedy isn't as strong as the other character he plays (aside from the appropriately iconic globe-tossing symbolism).In the other story we get a revamped Tramp- this time in the form of a Jewish barber- who in the midst of helping out a girl Hannah gets into some trouble with the overbearing troops from Hynkel's army. He also sees around him the effects from this dictatorship, of the Jews being sent to the gas chamber, but is spared and even acts as a sign of hope thanks to an old friend in Schultz. This all leads to a kind of case of mistaken identity, leading up to a 'big' speech. Big maybe being too broad a word to describe it- it's an outpouring of the highest kind that is able to work in such a satire, where all the points are spoken very clearly and to the point of being almost too simple. But the truth behind it undercuts the rest of the comedy in the film, which marks it as being memorable. And for myself as a viewer I remember both sides well. I still have fresh, admiring images in my head of Chaplin's barber running around being chased by the soldiers in the ghetto, how effortlessly a lot of this starts to seem when the craft turns to a beautiful transparency. There are certain parts of Chaplin's script, the final long talk aside, that ring out nicely.One of the best films of the early 1940's, this is also one of- if not the- classic of Chaplin's sound years, where a time in history that needed such a talent as his came through with a precise account of pathos, wit and silliness that all makes his films unique.",10,1,3,7 June 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," no matter how hard it tries, this is soulless, bloodless, unnecessary storytelling
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine could be a prime example for what is superbly wrong with Hollywood film-making. There is a director credited here, Gavin Hood, who has made good movies such as Tsotsi. Perhaps they hired him for that, or for his previous film (unseen by me) Rendition. Or, further perhaps, they knew he could be pushed around for a good paycheck. Maybe he does love the Wolverine character and the X-Men franchise, but from a standpoint of only seeing the film as evidence, it doesn't look that way. This looks more to be a case of film-making-by-committee, where a whole gaggle of producers and studio heads (not least of which Tom Rothman) called the shots on what would happen in this story. Which, ultimately, wasn't really necessary in context of the other movies (or at least the first two).Wolverine, as a character, is captivating and a bad-ass in the comics. In the first two films it's Jackman's performance, and some clever ambiguity, that make him worth watching and a pivotal character, of actually not knowing a whole lot about his past (save for some exposition and the character Stryker, then played by Brian Cox). By delving into this character's back-story, who from what I've heard and been told has one of the most convoluted and complicated backstories in the history of the comic-book medium, there's a whole lot of noise and whistles but not any depth. I didn't learn or gain anything about Wolverine/Logan/Jimmy(?) in the entire running time, except that if you possibly kill the love of his life then, well, he'll get revenge. And, really, if you had claws that could retract and lived over 150 years and was basically indestructible *before* Adamantium, you'd be ticked too.Basically, it's a story that holds very little water to start with and has to work hard to give us something, anything, to care about what will happen to an indestructible man-beast like Wolverine. Jackman is game, but what about the other actors? Liev Schieber grunts and barely acts his way through his Sabretooth, while Ryan Reynolds, who may someday give us something as a version of Deadpool, only acts like that for all of five minutes before he's yanked off only to return late in the film (as apparently a very funny and witty self-conscious comic character in print) without any dialog to speak of! Others like Will.I.Am (yes, that's how his name is spelled) don't bring much at all, while there's some other room for thankless cameos - my favorite (by that I mean the one I was equally mortified and ironically amused by) was Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, appearing before some lost mutants before disaster strikes, his face super-smooth and looking so CGI you'd swear Brandon Routh was neo-realist in comparison.There's simply no invention, nothing that stands out even as a fun bad choice; this is more akin to Fantastic Four than something that is really *fun* bad like The Spirit or Ghost Rider. You have to keep your eyelids open by force just from not being bored by the films generic tendencies, most prominent when it tries to give some sense of humor (totally dulled or with the lowest common denominator of gag, i.e. 'oh, my claws broke your sink, um, ha?), but especially when delving into the action sequences. No personality, nothing to make it stand out from probably much superior video games, and whatever inanities present can't even give rise to unintentional laughter. It's hack work through and through.And the same goes with the story itself, and its super-duper-holy-s*** contrivances. Adamantium is one thing, that's a given, even if one wonders why Wolverine would need or want it thanks to his already near indestructible nature (sorry to harp on it again, it appears vaguely important to me given Wolverine's attitude towards it and Stryker). But the Amnesia-bullets... do I need to go on?",3,10,22,7 May 2009
Alexander," has it's moments of greatness, though surely not overall
","The final product of Oliver Stone's decades-in-the-making epic on Alexander the great had me stunned walking out of the theater. Not because I thought it was particular great or masterful, and not because I thought it was a failure either. What stunned me was how there could be a few points in the film where I thought that Stone, like Alexander in a sense, reached heights he's barely gone to before, but then in other spots he boggled my mind with how he lost me.For example, take the second battle sequence, in which Alexander leads his weary army towards an Indian army, where Elephants stampede furiously against the troops on horses, and Alexander gets a bit of a shock (one which I won't reveal). After this shock, the rest of the battle scene is tinted, with a red glaze and form that gives the scene a complete, abrasive illusionment. I can consider this to include what is best and worst in Stone's talents as a storyteller - he creates this huge, massive sequence, using multiple angles and special effects. There is also an over-load of the kind of symbolism and melodramatic tendencies that have only popped up occasionally in past Stone films. The main focus being the significance of the bird in the sky (or King Phillip) to be used like the shaman in the Doors, only far too prominent to be easily desired. It's the kind of battle sequence I'd like to analyze shot-by-shot sometime, not necessarily because I'd like it more, but because it's the kind of sequence that you almost never see in major motion pictures.Like Natural Born Killers (which is one of the ultimate love or hate films ever made), Stone brings his unique, art-house sensibilities to a Hollywood budget and goes wild. The story he tells jumps around in revealing the rise and fall of the Macedonian. More than showing how ferocious and intelligent he was at battle (though that and other scenes of violence take up more than a third of the whole picture), Stone opts to get into his psychology via parents Phillip and Olympia (the sexy, sometimes frightening Angelina Jolie). This is where Stone makes some interesting ground, yet also, more often than not, doesn't know how to stick to something. A lot of the scenes involving Alexander's anger and frustration with his parents probably looked better on paper than they do on screen. And it's not necessarily the actors' faults entirely- the repetitive usage of close-ups, and the sometimes horrendous musical score by Vangelis, adds to it being less engaging. The acting, much like the direction, tips the scale to both sides by either fitting into their characters wonderfully, or not finding what is there at all and over-playing. Kilmer was impressive at playing a cretin of a father. Jolie was so-so. Leto's was one of the least impressive performances I've seen this year (I just could not see what affect Hephaistilon could have had on Alexander). Dawson and Hopkins were good, though somewhat under-used. Then there is Farrell, who for many who see this film may be what makes or breaks it for them. In most scenes, he finds the right notes and tones for his expression, the way he looks in close-ups. He does prove he can be a leading man in Hollywood. But what disappointed me was in how in some scenes he lost a grip on what he was doing with the character, and I saw less of Alexander and more of Farrell. Sometimes, I suppose, that look in his eyes would just vanish, the kind of look that has been in the major, Dionetic performances of Stones' films (such as Willem Dafore in Platoon, Woody Harrellson in NBK, and Kilmer in The Doors).Alexander, after a first viewing, is my least favorite of Stone's pictures - much of it goes to lengths with historical exposition that might have fared better to show (three battles, even if it was a small one or in montage, may have balanced out with the other major two) than to go on and on with. It doesn't make the mistakes of this year's Troy, but it doesn't fare much better. Simply put, Alexander the film is like the man himself- an ambitious, crazed man who ended up dividing his audience. Go see it, and know you will be challenged to love, like, or despise it.",7,1,12,26 November 2004
Hot Fuzz," uproarious British spoof; a send-up that delivers the high-octane action, tons of puns and tasteless gags
","Edgar Wright has somehow outdone himself from his previous first feature comedy/zombie movie, Shaun of the Dead, with his Hot Fuzz, a send-up of all those cop/law-enforcement movies where the style goes berserk and beyond post-modernism into some kind of frantic 'show-em-what-we-got' method of big-bang action and cheesy catch phrases amid an absurd plot. This time, Wright and co-writer/star Simon Pegg know very well how much the absurdism already goes on in those movies, particularly those by Michael Bay, and the send-up is all the more brilliant because there's nothing extremely hateful towards the movies (one might think, for sort of guilty pleasure sake, Wright and Pegg sit around watching these movies as much as the Danny character does in the film), and the level of zaniness imposed knows no boundaries. Actually, the boundaries are sort of set by genre, however this even dips into movies such as The Wicker Man (which is actually very indebted to the main storyline), Scream, and even Godzilla in one scene. And unlike Shaun of the Dead, the gags, however subtle or post Monty Python they get, practically never stop. This time, tone doesn't drastically change; it's consistently with a tongue placed firmly in its Great British cheek. And speaking of Monty Python, as I walked out of the theater a late Python member popped in my mind in relation to Simon Pegg's Nick Angel in Hot Fuzz: Graham Chapman. Here, Pegg shows completely, like Chapman, that he's perfectly capable of playing the straight man in comedic situations, even more here than in 'Shaun', and that his level of being the 'normal' in an otherwise zany comic setting makes it seemingly even. Then, suddenly, in the third act, we see Pegg's character have to take a turn by way of how the story makes its dark twist in revealing the situation of the 'accidents' that have been going on in the seemingly peaceful small town he's sergeant in, and finally, Pegg brings out the level of crazy comedic timing that's been under the surface the whole time. This climax, of course, is one of the funniest things about the film, but it's all been preempted by Wright and Pegg setting up the film with clichés and archetypes, turns that are pretty obvious each step of the way, and even in the moments that start to get less funny as mores-so amusing, and all the more ironic in that it's set among characters that bring out this level of comic hysteria.At first, some of the humor is in little vicious stabs that strike out because of how blatant they are on the part of the filmmakers: the swan, the unintelligible small-town English folk (some with many, many, many firearms, which is sort of a spoiler by the way), a golden statue man, and a man in a costume of Death, as mere visual gags. Others, for me anyway, were almost in-jokes, like the laugh-out-loud bit with Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy (in the same frame no less). But it's not simply visual comedy, however that is a big factor in it all as Wright is almost TOO good at mimicking the hyper-kinetic Bay style of editing and jump-cuts. It's also that there's a great ensemble too, with Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Paul Freeman, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall, even Timothy Hutton joins in relishing the underlying poke in the ribs in practically every scene. Yet through all of the parodies and splashes, pun intended, of appropriately graphic violence (it comes close to Grindhouse, which Wright provided the 'Don't' trailer, in wisely imploring gore and massive shoot-outs for comedy sake), there's a sharp level of wit in the dialog, a clever repore in making us actually care about some of the characters (Pegg and Frost anyway, especially after a bout with Point Break), and keeps you laughing when the whole shebang ends. As Danny says at one point, in a manner of speaking, 'Man that's off the f**king chain!'",10,2,4,21 April 2007
The Mummy," a look back 18 years later on Stephen Sommers' big stab at Hollywood escapism
","This movie is like if you take Raiders of the Lost Ark (and other Indiana Jones movies in general, those serial-tropes) and deduct like 10,000 IQ points from it. It's *so* Raiders, but it's also still, in being true to the original 1932 film, still SO Dracula- rip-off in some ways, even down to Kevin J O'Connor (OH MY GOD NOT- HENRY_PLAINVIEW from TWWB!) playing Renfield to Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep (though Renfield crossed with Alfred Molina from Raiders- did I mention this is RAIDERS with like a lot of dumbness injected in?) It's a slam-bang action movie where half of the dialog are full-on *Movie* lines. You know the ones? This is where characters, especially Brendan Fraser (who, honestly, is having the time of his life in this role), spout off a lot of clichés - Rick makes sure to say 'We're in deep trouble' more than once, or to be ready with a line while being tossed conveniently across the room of the inside of a pyramid. And characters just do dumb thing after dumb thing, or characters appear where they shouldn't but hey gotta advance the plot... like the whole entire group of dumb American cowboys(!?) who manage to make it off of the boat that catches on fire and while we get scenic views of Fraser and Weisz and her brother going across the desert, the rest are not to be seen... until convenient.Oh, Rachel Weisz, by the way, is a great thing about this movie. Really, she's the one who practically got a career off of this movie, and she is so incredibly charming and dorky (the scene where she gets drunk is a different kind of drunk scene than we get in Raiders with Marion, I should note). She may be a 'Damsel' occasionally in distress, but she is acting Evelyn on a wavelength that gives the movie an energy and delight that helps to balance out all of the stock actors and characters surrounding her (even O'Connor, who is giving this one- note weasel his all, is that). She and Fraser have the kind of old-time Hollywood chemistry, with enough modernity, that makes the movie watchable even as it gets so.... so.... so.... so... so dumb.And yet... it's entertaining. It's occasionally cheesy and haphazard - my God, does that climax where every single thing seems to come alive, usually by mistake - and I neglect to note how, despite being from old Egyptian lore (even if that's lore taken from older movies and serials), it also borrows in one giant chunk from the Evil Dead. But... well, I kept watching and not simply because I had to for an upcoming podcast.PS: Spoiler -about O'Connor's Beni... near the end, they really didn't know what to do with him, did they? I mean the writers; he's about ready to escape on the camel, he has a good amount of gold after getting away with being a conniving creep... but he sticks around and goes back inside, and as soon as he does we know exactly what's coming for him. The movie also goes the extra step of showing us how he meets his maker. It feels oddly cruel though, despite how slimy he's been. I almost felt sorry for him or even something close to sympathy. Isn't it enough to assume he's squashed with everything else inside the pyramid once it collapses? Like anything else here, it's overkill.",6,2,2,7 June 2017
Constantine," certain things- like an uncommonly bad-ass Keanu Reeves- make this better than it has any right to be
","I'm not sure if Francis Lawrence is really up to par to make any kind of great movie, having now seen his first film Constantine and his mega-hit follow-up I Am Legend. But he can make a pretty entertaining spectacle of the dark and supernatural, and add a certain edge that comes most likely for those who are thirsting for it after being out of the desert of Man vs. Satan pictures. In this case John Constantine- inspired by a comic book from the 80s (which had the hero looking like Sting and Satan looking like David Bowie)- is a demon hunter, an exorcisor, and also a hardcore chain smoker who will probably kill himself from lung cancer before getting snuffed by some out-of-the-dark demon. He is called upon by a cop (Rachel Weisz) to investigate what appears to be a suicide of her sister (twin, not too oddly enough) but is really murder. How will Constantine find out? How will she? What will she be needed for? If you don't put a whole lot of thought into some of the logistics, obviously, Constantine is a very fun movie, and chock-full of ultra hellish special effects, some keen one-liners ('Everybody leave now... go to hell.'), and an unusually cool and on-spot performance from Keanu Reeves. While he might've given more of his somewhat limited worth for the Matrix movies, it's here that one sees him trying, and nearly succeeding, a Dirty Harry imitation in the form of a kind of Christopher Walken ala the Prophecy character. It helps since there's some very good supporting work from Weisz, Tilda Swinton as a vengeful angel, and Dijmon Honsu as a witch doctor (Shia Lebouf appears as a driver and is probably the weakest link). The coup is casting Peter Stormare as Satan, however, appearing in only some make-up and a heavy ham-bone performance.So for all you looking for plenty of action with those that come from hell, this is a good flick to catch now that it's showing a lot of cable. It's fast-paced but takes its time as a story, and it has atmosphere coming out of its ears, probably the best gift that Lawrence can bestow (he also has it in spades with I Am Legend, albeit the visual effects are actually better HERE than in the Smith vehicle). It would be a guilty pleasure to rank with Ghost Rider if it weren't somewhat pretty well crafted. 7.5/10",7,3,5,3 May 2008
The Others," Creepy, sometimes thrilling, and a good performance wedged in
","The Others (originally titled The Darkness when I saw it 3 months ago in a private screening) tells the story of a widow, Nicole Kidman plays her with scritness and is actually fitted well for it, and her children.  Now these kids aren't like other ones, as they have to stay in the dark all the time, or else something bad will happen to them.  Things seem OK, and they're are new housekeepers hired, but then things of a supernatural nature begin to occur.The film is in the bloodline of such films as The Sixth Sense and on that level I can say this movie is fairly decent enough.  It gives fine scares here and there and it has a really crackerjack ending that will have some people talking, but in the end of the movie, do we care about the lot of the characters?  Director Amenabar gives good detail to the period and to the shocks, but the plot could've used some work.  B+",7,0,2,15 August 2001
Troy," A good job by Peterson and his cast and crew, could've been better, could've been worse...
","Wolfgang Peterson and David Benioff's adaptation of Homer's Illiad story, about the battles and people beneath one of the greatest wars in human history, is like a 2nd place science fair project by a kid in middle school. You're impressed, but there's still some things that keep it from the prize.  Troy is loaded with CGI visuals carried over in tradition from Gladiator and LOTR, has wonderful cinematography by Roger Pratt, and certain scenes and performances are near perfect (Peter O'Toole in particular).  But that doesn't mean Peterson's vision doesn't carry with it some flaws.Some of the visual effects, though intricate and vast, are a little much at times.  In a sense they work well for the production, but I thought the film might've benefited from more extras, much like a big-scale production from the Golden age of Hollywood.  Stars like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom are more or less capable to hold up the film, with Pitt creating conflict and poise in his Achilles where it sometimes isn't needed, Bana creating a directness with what's around him, and Bloom giving some over-acting (or under-acting) for his Paris.  The female characters aren't of much praise and speculation except that their main part in the film is to discourage the men from fighting.  This, as well as the score by James Horner with a single female singing voice in most battle scenes, gets a little much as well.It seems as though Peterson is fond of dramatic excess in this film, and it serves as both an asset and a crutch.  For example, in the fight scene between Achilles and Hector, there are repeated cut-aways to close-ups with the royal family looking on.  This would be fine if it wasn't interferring so much with the action going on.  This same focus on the fights and battle sequences also gets diverted with the score and cut-aways.  But the good side to this is that this stylized, glossy, and occasionally brutal action gets pumped up.  That's how I felt overall about this picture- it's exciting, interesting summer fare, but it won't be a big contender against the epics of the past, or even the other action films due this summer and year.

Brokeback Mountain," turns out to be a touching story without forcing it; good direction, perfectly subdued performances
","Ang Lee is brilliant, for the most part, at controlling the mood of scenes. Some might think its detached, but it really isn't. By building up the story, and then letting the conflict build under the seams, when it comes time for the conflict to come to a head, it really does become touching. That's because Brokeback Mountain, putting aside all of the media's hoopla about it, works best because of Lee's trust in the great screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and a few very good performances. To say that the film might be a tad overlong in a couple of spots (maybe it might drag to some, maybe not, the pace picks up where need be) is not a harsh criticism, just an observation. Because aside from that, I couldn't really find much fault in the film. Aside from the 'issue' that's been created that it's a 'gay cowboy movie' (more like a modern gay western, ala out of the Sundance channel gone Hollywood), it's best at being a naturalistic drama.Lee's eye for vistas and the environments around these characters is fascinating, but that for me wasn't what drew me into the film. What drew me in, and what does draw me into good movies, is the script. McMurtry (a seasoned veteran of dozens of novels set in the west involving sometimes awkward states of reality) and Ossana make the story be all the more real by its structure, and how the dialog goes for the characters. There is barely a false note within the wording of the scenes, even trickier ones to handle like the few, forceful arguments between the characters. And when the climax comes, which will be an emotional one for many (I was even moved, mostly by the subtlety and lack of hope), it doesn't feel compromised like something out of a TV movie. That it's taken from a 50 page short story and turned into a 2+ hour film is quite an achievement. Come Oscar time, it should be them to get a sure-fire nomination, among the other obvious ones (and like the film or not, it's getting its noms).Heath Ledger, in fact, is more of the central character of this film, as his Ennis meets Jack Twist (Jake Ghylenhaal) while sheep herding in 1963 out on the mountain of the title. One thing leads to another, and then over the course of almost twenty years they see each other on and off to go 'fishing' even as they get married elsewhere and have kids. Each actor, be it the two main males or their wives (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, both very good in un-characteristic performances), play it just as it is in the script. Ledger, despite not always being the most clear-spoken actor (if you might not understand a few sentences it's just the way he speaks), gives one of the best performances of his career thus far. The subtlety he displays at times, the innate tendency of his character to hold back, is sometimes staggering. And Ghyllenhaal deserves some equal praise, even as his character isn't nearly as fleshed out or dimensional as the counterpart.Did I think Brokeback Mountain was a groundbreaking masterpiece. No, probably not. The same issues dealt with in this film have also been dealt with in at least a dozen other films, however more in the independent film world, sometimes even better. And Lee, while talented, isn't my favorite sort of director for these kinds of love stories. But it is a film that grabs your attention, that doesn't hit you over the head with out-right 'messages', and just shows these characters fates as so, over a lifespan that goes on as secret love goes on in the shadows of the mountain. It's well-done, even if it isn't one of my favorite films of the year. A-",9,16,21,6 January 2006
Ed Wood," one of the best films of 1994
","Here is an example of film-making elements coming wonderfully together, in a package that can entertain the usual moviegoers and give the movie-geek his or her money's worth. That it is also perhaps the most well-rounded of Tim Burton's films, with enough does of comedy, drama, and movie-within-movie stylings, to fit two movies is an added plus. He tells the story of Edward D. Wood Jr (Johnny Depp), who may or may not be the most well-known bad filmmaker ever to exist with enough humanity and care to not make it at all parody, even if there is comedy interspersed. His story is one that is actually quite the same of most filmmakers, who want to make it somehow and have big dreams and lofty visions. Though taking into account Wood's preclivaty of wearing women's clothes (particularly the angora sweaters), hanging out with transvestites and other undesirables, and his best friend is a thought to be dead ex-horror icon (Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi, in a richly deserved Oscar turn) addicted to methadone, the path of his story is rather unconventional to say the least.But the style of the film is quite ingenious, with rich and cool black and white photography, a finely moving and appropriate score (though not by Danny Elfman), and touting an all around best-in-show cast. Depp especially has a lot of fun playing this man, who may or may not be close to how he was in real life (from what I've read about him it's a fairly close depiction), and his portrayal of Wood is not at all cheating and is, in some scenes, really touching. The ones that stick out for me are the ones with Landau at his house, and filming his one scene from Plan 9 From Outer Space, but the ones with him on his 'sets', filming such drek with the passion and ambition of the greats, is really refreshing to see. Ed Wood is quite the biopic, showcasing Burton in another maturer form outside of films like Pee Wee and Batman, but with the same knack for entertainment. After all, how can you dislike a film with Tor Johnson, Elvira, and Bill Murray desiring a sex-change operation?",10,10,12,8 April 2006
Chicken Run," Great. one of the best animated kid films in years
","Chicken Run is a film that has come from Aardman studios, which has made some classic (Oscar winning) shorts, including Wallace and Gromit.  Now, after a 5 year absence, they return with a actual full length feature. What's so amazing:  It's entirely claymation, which means each shot had to take time to move each character and so on. The film itself is great.  The plot tells the story of Tweedy's farm, which holds some very anxious chickens, who want to escape before Tweedy (voiced by Miranda Richardson) makes them all into pies.  But, a lone rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson) comes to they're rescue in a hilarious tale of freedom and chickens.  Great fun, mainly for the kids, but parents will also like the puns that come along.  Amazing animation makes me wonder if their should be a Oscar category for best animated film (and if this is this years prize winner).  A+",8,3,4,18 June 2000
Orphan," starts of finteresting, but then comes Esther....
","Orphan opens with one of those truly mortifying scenes that can actually go beyond typical horror into something else, that visceral terror that comes with a catastrophic event. This being the death of a baby, as Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) is about to give birth, sees blood under her gown waiting in the hospital, and is told her child has died before even giving birth. Then it gets more and more disturbing: her husband John is filming this devastating scene with his camcorder, and he presents the dead baby to her as she's sobbing in tears. It's safe to say this and The Descent's opening scene are top them all when it comes to the worst scenes that involve personal, familial horror with children (in the most gratifying way imaginable, if that make sense, when it comes to filming it).And then the rest of the plot unfolds... and it never matches up to that, and if anything becomes sillier and more predictable, a Lifetime movie in Omen-skin or Good Son clothing. While early on we get a moving scene with Kate and her little girl Max and how she reads to her at night even though she's deaf, and we get the sense this will be well acted, then comes a scene that turns everything else that will happen in the movie. Esther, from the moment she appears on screen, has not a shred of subtlety about her, nor in Isabelle Fuhrman's performance. You know from her oh-so sweet little speech to her soon-to-be stepfather that this is just trouble. A big part of it, I think, is that her character is European (thought to be Russian for at least most of the movie) and so she's like Natasha Fatale in miniature form and pigtails. To say she's unbelievable is an understatement, even if once or twice among the DOZENS of times she's hiding behind a corner or behind a door listening it gets creepy.But boy oh boy is this movie silly. You get sucked into the story, and it's entertaining, but it's also ultimately about as substantial as a daytime soap opera with the big TWIST so preposterous that you'll be laughing about it long after the movie ends (not to mention a few questions about, you know, the difference between little girls and adult women). It relies on clichés eventually, and it's sad since Vera Farmiga and Stellan Sarsgaard are trying their best to give genuine dramatic performances. They aren't anything to laugh at, at least too much, but it's the script that wears it down, those situations and scenes where Esther ratchets up her evil-bitch-meter or kills another hapless person who may 'rat' on her. It ends up being a great audience movie, but also so stupid and without much worth or for anything we've heard (i.e. the lesson is, I guess, don't adopt any child from Russia or whatever-stan, or that two is sometimes enough), and the violence compounds the silliness.",6,2,6,3 August 2009
Home Alone," A well done family comedy
","This type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges.  Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.  B+",9,49,65,4 November 2000
The Hustler," 'Anything can be great... if he knows what he's doing and why'
","I almost don't know where to begin with Robert Rossen's The Hustler, about the ups and downs (mostly downs) for 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) as he faces off against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleeson), meets and falls in love with a 'lame' girl (Piper Laurie), and gets attached to a gambler/manager (Scott) who may run him ragged. The simplest thing is that this is a cool, expressive, massively engaging drama that treats its audience like they're adults. The script not only never fails the actors, but Rossen and his co-writer give them scene after scene to showcase pain and anguish and trying to find a way through the dark corners of life... but also that RUSH for going for 'it' - the thrill of the game, win or lose.Paul Newman is electrifying, no two ways about it - and one can firmly argue, as I might, his finest work on screen. I have to seriously wonder if one extra speech, which was apparently cut though I couldn't tell from where, would've bumped him up to full Oscar status (this was by the way) where Scott's animosity to the AMPAS began with his loss to Riff from West Side Story) - and the main cast is uniformly excellent.But I'm tempted to say that Piper Laurie may be my favorite performance of the bunch. Sarah has been used and doesn't always like that, but she is always in constant conflict about it; amid the trials Eddie goes through, she seems to go through her own, while falling in serious, non-kidding love with this guy. She has all of the layers to play here, and there are a few moments where I wondered if it would become less a 'Sports' movie (and this is as much a sports movie as Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta connection) than Days of Wine and Roses - and this is, if 'About' anything, addiction and personality disorders. She makes such a tormented character feel raw and real and vulnerable and strong and charming and just everything that you want out of a movie character. Her final scene is also shocking, though I still didn't expect what would happen next.And Jackie Gleeson. I half expected him at one or two points, following a Fast Eddie clip, to go 'We got a Weisenheimer, Alice!' He was part of the 'coolness' of this picture of me, super tough, possibly dangerous but, in his way, kind of like that old-bad*ss knight (or gunslinger, and when Eddie re-enters the bar for the climax it has that feel too of a saloon in the Old West) who gets challenged and goes toe-to-toe with another upstart knight or something.George C. Scott... When he exclaims in that final scene 'You owe me MONEY!' I let out a laugh, not as it was funny exactly but it was so unexpected and charged. He the tough, a-hole Capitalistic shark of the movie, as Eddie (yes even as Newman was 35 when this was made) is young with that go-gettem spirit but with heart and all that jazz. Scott plays this guy as someone who, in other hands, could be the hammy villain of the movie, whereas with him he also makes him almost a tragic character. Almost.Oh, and the filmmaking is crisp and innovative in parts - those montages, so captivating - and knowing, along with Dede Allen, when to leave the camera going without a cut, or to keep the cuts smooth and good for a conversation (Sarah's breakdown at the party the former, when she and Eddie meet at the bar the latter).Bottom line, a sort of 'guy' movie that owes more to film-noir than sport movie clichés. I'm not sure what I was expecting - the Color of Money is the good but still, it-can't-be-helped, inferior follow-up - but I got a minor masterpiece.",10,3,5,18 April 2015
Spotlight," script and performances is all, and that's enough
","With a movie like Spotlight, the one thing you can say against it is that it's not particularly showy. We won't remember the movie this year let alone years from now for its cinematography (though perhaps its lack of being 'showy' or really darkly lit or stark in contrasts is its own visual statement). This isn't to say that Tom McCarthy doesn't so his job as a director in an elemental sense; he does get some good shots (there's one where the camera simply backs up as a crucial statistic is laid out by the ex-priest turned therapist who gives the Spotlight reporters what they need to move forward into the bigger picture of their story, and it works beautifully). But what he does is put together the best cast possible - Keaton, Ruffalo, John Slattery (as Ben Bradley Jr, which I'll touch on in a moment), Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, and even Richard Jenkins as the voice on the phone - and makes sure that they're all on a level where no one ever upstages another. The story is all here.It's a subject that carries with it some exposition - you got to know the facts of this case, and there are times you get a lot of information, not unlike say Law & Order SVU - but it's all in service of a narrative that makes it welcome and exciting. This is about what it means to craft a story and to get it right, but what 'right' even means in the grand scheme of things, which here being the sort of Court of Public Opinion. If you don't get the facts right, or have enough 'deep cover' to back things up, things can be poked through, especially in the context of this story being in Boston and the Catholic church. While pederasty wasn't unheard of in 2001 with the priests and organization in general, it was seen as more-so isolated incidents. The key to Spotlight being so compelling is to draw the viewer in the same way the reporters do: the stakes here are so high.It's easy to compare this to All the President's Men for a number of reasons; one thing I saw as an interesting coincidence was two generations of Ben Bradleys here, with Robards as the Senior in 'Presidents' at the Washington Post and the Junior played by a no-BS Slattery, similar level of sarcasm in the midst of professional talk by the way. What it comes down to is how much do performances and the search for information against a super-powerful institution (one the branches of government and conspiracy of the Executive level, the other an institution that 'thinks in centuries' as notes in the film) elevate the material? I think just as with the Pakula film, this does it exceptionally well. While it may not have the same sort of effect of that 76 film (no Gordon Willis, as I said it's not a particularly stand-out film as far as the look), Spotlight really has some deep things to address about faith and trust, and it doesn't shy away from making these reporters real people in the midst of their search. Ruffalo and Keaton may stand out the most for people, chiefly as they get (I think, I could be wrong) more impactful screen time as they are each looking for precious information (the former with his connection to Tucci's lawyer, who handles cases involving pedophilia and the church and in the screwed up legal system, the latter with the 'source' he has and his own background growing up in Boston and the Church). But I was very impressed by the screen time being evenly laid out; Ruffalo and Keaton may get the Oscar attention, but Schreiber has a number of remarkable scenes, such as an awkward/polite conversation with Cardinal Law, and McAdams as she knocks on doors and has the most startling scene involving a conversation with a priest who reveals, remarkably, candidly, that he didn't really see what he did as rape (he should know, he says, as he was raped).If you like seeing a cast keeping things grounded and realistic, and yet have moments of powerful drama and conflict that cuts at a lot of corners of society (especially, also, involving class as this is also a class issue involving low-income families having kids who were molested/raped), this is a film to see. It doesn't exactly leave you feeling all that 'good', but it does celebrate what journalism can do in an unfussy, unsentimental way that is refreshing too.",10,13,26,7 December 2015
Terminator Salvation," you are a soldier, now how about the soul?
","Terminator Salvation is what people looking for some a few gritty and nifty action scenes will salivate for. This is because McG takes this as his specialty; he came up through music videos and commercials, so his eye is on the visual, specifically effects and trying to get his look for the film to be (perhaps quite contradictorily in this case) super slick and super grimy. The only problem is he leaves his actors fending for themselves. The plot is tended to up to a point, though it's one that will only make sense to those who are familiar with the Terminator franchise. This is at best what the Wolverine aspired to and falled flat on its face trying to be; it's a fan-boy movie made for the fan-boys of *2009*, as opposed to any year like, say, the 80s and early 90s, with tons of cash to spare.This may mean you'll have a difficult time explaining what the story is to someone who has limited knowledge of the chronology. It's set in the future in time-line, so it's a sequel, but it's also a prequel, sort of, since the film is about John Connor, defacto leader of the resistance against Skynet and the machines programmed to kill (almost) on sight, *and* about his father, Kyle Reese, as a slightly younger man (here played by double-duty young-role filler Anton Yelchin after his Chekov appearance in Star Trek two weeks ago). It's about, in a nutshell, how Connor has to contend with his battle with Skynet's robot army on top of the emergence of a more curious cyborg would-be threat: Marcus (Worthington), a man who submitted himself to some sort of 'test' while in death row in 2003, and in exchange turns up in 2018 not knowing where he is but *thinking* he's still human when he very much isn't. It's past vs. future vs. past vs. present in a smoothie blender that will keep you trying to puzzle out certain things... if you think about them.McG's film starts a little sluggish, actually, and for at least the first half everything feels and looks a little too re-cooked in the genre blender. Not just with in-jokes, although there's plenty of them, such as, young Reese: 'Come with me if you want to live'; Guns n Roses 'You Could be Mine' popping up in a convenient moment; cameo from the original model 101 himself Schwarzenegger. There's also the little kid tagging along with Reese and Marcus as they venture along to seek out John Connor and quasi safe haven with the resistance (thankfully he doesn't talk, which may have been a worse move, but it's still a little irksome as the precocious tyke who seems to be a lucky charm when script needs), or the predictable lines and character moves when it comes to just simple dialog exchanges or methods of action. It's really only in the last third, when the stakes are raised and Marcus has to go back to Skynet to find out what the hell happened to him, with Connor tracking him and going it along to rescue the hundreds of prisoners Skynet's claimed for some reason or another, that it gets interesting.If only, because, Worthington is such a pleasant find as a new leading male. As Marcus he compels more emotional response than any other actor in the film - Christian Bale included who, sadly, doesn't do a whole lot with what he's given as far as being a barely 2-dimensional 'Lead-machine' - as the first character in the series to be a cyborg who we can sort of sympathize with, as a character given a second chance in a world that is about crushing them if at all possible (i.e. traveling back in time, Skynet's 100th attempt to stop the Connor family tree from spreading). I might almost want to rank the film on a higher plane if everything else around Worthington was just so... average. It's certainly a step up from the corniness of Rise of the Machines, aka TALK TO THE HAND. But McG doesn't really step up to the bat except for delivering a few cool robots and some ragged action bits.To be sure, there's some fun to be has as a *summer blockbuster* with some cleverly shot chases and fights, and as a fan it's hard not to get wrapped up in a mano-a-machino match as the climax between Connor and his former nemesis in skeleton form. As a dark sci-fi spectacle of A- budget proportions on a B-movie story scale it's not bad at all. But as with Rise of the Machines the problem, at least for me, is the lack of shelf-life. If the films James Cameron directed pop up on TV at any time of day I can stop and watch at least a few if not fifteen or twenty or the whole rest of minutes of running time that's left. They have a sustainable appeal as pieces of pop-art, of a strong story coupled with the action. For McG, it's all about the look, not the substance. We can leave Skynet for that.",4,7,15,21 May 2009
Insomnia," It is always the darkest in the light
","(Possible spoilers ahead)Ok, that might sound like a cliche line for Insomnia, a remake here of the 1997 foreign version with Stellan Skarsgard, but why not once in a blue moon.  Anyway, this is indeed a topper for Christopher Nolan, over his 2001 independent backwards episode Memento, and brings his storytelling skills to a thriller set in Alaska.  Thus, Al Pacino plays the cop, a usual part to be sure, yet here brings an excellent feeling of desperation to try and find a way out of the muck of lies and torment that are in his life.  And for once, Alaska is shown as it truly is, either all night or all day (there are so many movies that get this wrong it's too lengthy to explain here) and how either one can drive the particular person crazed.  Here it is the constant shining of a itty bit of sunlight into his room at 3:30 AM.Pacino is on the case of a killer (Robin Williams) who's victim is a teenage girl.  This is handled in a good way, by turning it into not a cops and and bad guys movie, but more of a moral movie, one about getting caught in the most stressful of situations in dealing with control over life and the responsibility it follows.  It is not just the acting, which is above par, but also just the downright craft that drags you into the predominately first person dilemma (although Williams brings up some interesting points among his blackmail).  One more note: Williams has done something this year to me I'm not sure he's ever done- he has two movies from this year that are both grand dramatic, crazed performances and among his flops and utter misdemeanors (including another one he did this year, Death to Smoochy) there is a bit of praise for the guy.  As for the thriller here, one of the years best in conclusion. A+",10,0,1,24 May 2002
My Neighbor Totoro," My Neighbor Totoro turned me into a little squish-ball, and I mean that as a compliment
","That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the 'King' Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasn't annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.If anything might be lacking in the film it's a 'plot' or sorts, as there really isn't any- a story it does have, however loose with what goes on. It's a pure kind of feel-good story about two young girls who have moved into a new house with their father so they can be closer to their mother who's at a hospital. After finding their house might be haunted, the younger of the two Mei searches around a gigantic tree to find Totoro and his buddies, who help make things grow in nature and are generally just there to act like fuzz-balls. Aside from a bit of trouble that arises in the third act, which does hold some overall significance to the implicit message in the film, it's really got nothing on its agenda except to give the little kids a big smile and some laughs in some of the cuter, odder moments. If some American kids might not get it or latch on to it like the homegrown animation of late, it might still work for their parents probably watching it with them.And this message I mentioned- which is also connected with Winnie the Pooh on some fundamental level- is that its essential to have this kind of lively dream-life for children, to have a section of the world just for them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through. But, like Miyazaki's other films, this isn't a message crammed down the kids throats. It's also for me (damned if I'll say it as a guy who's usually into more mature dramas and such) one of the most charming and cute pieces of animation to ever come out of Japan, and I would give it such a recommendation that the Pooh movies meant for me- as a first movie for a little one to see and maybe get addicted to.",10,3,4,11 June 2006
500 Days of Summer," imperfect, but it's more alive than 500+ romantic comedies
","Too often in American movies with romance and comedy, sometimes not in that order and sometimes (if not enough at all) take the romance and personal consequences of a relationship seriously, we're made to feel as an audience by the BS of Hollywood formulas that we should like the characters even when they're wrong or stupid or, on more than one occasion, sociopaths. The pleasure of (500) Days of Summer is that it doesn't tell us how to think or feel about this couple, Tom and Summer. Indeed it would be quite unfair to make us just automatically like a guy who has had the 'first-love-forever' notion since childhood and the girl being one without any real solid core of emotions that one can really connect to. It's much to complex, and by the end we simply understand the both of them, which is all that a movie about two people in a relationship- well, let's not 'label' it, I guess- should try to accomplish.But more than that, (500) Days of Summer is one of those rare contemporary movies that taps into the ups and downs of a heart-breaker. One could compare it to that other masterful/somber 'hipster' opus (must use quotes since I can't verify it for sure) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While the latter had a genius at the helm in Michel Gondry, the director here, Marc Webb, is not one to scoff at, either, at least as a real formidable creative talent whom I can't wait to see more of. He and his co-writer develop this story of Tom and Summer in a manner that one can see the whole 'what-went-wrong' thing in their relationship. But it's pretty clear, actually, from the start: Tom is very interested, probably more than just as a friend, while Summer says 'let's not label things' and just be friends. This is code, to be sure, but Tom doesn't read it, and why should he? It is, at least for him, walking on sunshine with Summer... at least, for the first couple hundred days or so.It's imaginative storytelling and solid character development. These are the bedrocks that make this film so impressive. All one can ask for are two characters who can engage us, in every moment that one would want for a three-dimensional picture. It's been argued already that since the film is mostly (save for a couple of third-person narrator bits) from Tom's point of view, we don't really get to know Summer on the same level. This isn't really true, it's just that they're different people to tap into, but also have been established at the start of the film like comic-book characters with their powers: Tom watched the Graduate as a kid and got the wrong idea by the ending, while Summer kept cutting her hair and wondering why it didn't hurt. One is love-sick and twisted by the promise of fate, and the other is pleasant and fun on the shallow surface and underneath is cold and bottled up and without much one can see of anything of a real connection (a key scene is when Tom and Summer go to see the Graduate together, and Summer sobs at the end with Benjamin and Elaine on the bus- ponder over it when the movie ends).But, aside from all of those ponderous and inquisitive beats about the nature of connectedness with people, of liking or loving or just realizing what one does with their lives as meaningless or with meaning, it's a superbly entertaining piece of pop excitement. It's not a full-on laugh out loud affair, but it doesn't need to be. We already have the characters, and their non-linear track of things as they come, and the filmmakers go for an approach to heighten whatever moods are on display. Take the truly awesome and hilarious 'musical' number with Tom dancing in the street with a whole squad behind him to Hall & Oates. Or, on a more personal-taste level (my favorite scene in the movie as a comedy), when Tom goes to the movie on his own and sees the French New Wave scene merge into the parodies of Persona and Seventh Seal.And, on top of this, the style, which could be dubbed as 'quirky' by those who can't find a better word like 'inventive' or 'smart' or forbid 'wonderful', is Webb's attentiveness to the style as reflects a scene with the camera and editing. This goes beyond just some cheeky-clever student film thing. When we see, for example, when Tom goes to the party that (ex) Summer invites Tom to, very unfairly indeed, and we see the split-screen of the Fantasy and the Reality of the scene, with a movement of the camera to fill the whole frame when the reveal in Reality comes crashing down for Tom (it's a twist that isn't a big spoiler since it's at the start of the film), it's not one of those gimmicks unearned. (500) Days of Summer is a fresh blast that is thoughtful and endearing, and never for a second spoon-feeds the audience. It doesn't give us characters to always like, but its honesty makes us feel for them (even Summer) more than any other rom-com this season. Autumn, on the other hand...",9,4,8,3 August 2009
Juno," indie-movie preggers, yey!
","Juno is an adorable sort of movie because, for the most part following its first third (which is 'hip' on parade), the genuine impulses of the characters come out without contrivance. As this and Knocked Up have shown us in 2007, a movie where its main character gets pregnant is, for the writer and/or director, like a Western in approaching the form: you know where it will lead (duh, waa, waa, it's a fill-in-the-blank), but the fun is filling in the blanks of the characters and sharp dialog and story points.While, as will be quite arguable with some, Knocked Up might have a better hold on its tone from start to finish, writer Diablo Cody is a sharp cookie, with a sense of wit that knows no bounds, as if someone dug into the latest indie kid at a high school and learned all the little ins and outs of what is really cool in what should be usually the outcast (which, by the way, is what ends up being 'hip' in that Ghost World kind of way). Her script starts off with scenes and dialog that, actually, don't ring entirely true as reality, but it is fun to hear the actors say such dialog that would give Daria a run for her money, some of it even laugh-out-loud funny ('oo, Woody Allen!') But as the film goes along, particularly in its last third, it really deepens in the sense of the weight of the situation at hand- there's a baby, hello parents! What starts off as genuinely (and please I mean this as a compliment) quirky stuff turns into sweet and tragic-comic. Reitman ends up striking it out of Cody's material with a similar freshness he brought to Thank You for Smoking (there's one little scene involving the 'type' of girl some guy likes that Juno points out, and it's just like his quick style from the former film). He's a good chip off the old block, as it were.But lets get to acting, which most have raved about a lot in the press and online. Ellen Page is, indeed, the breakout actress of, well, the moment I guess. She just clicks with this character, as she did (maybe more frustratingly so) in Hard Candy, and through Juno's slings of comebacks and pop culture references she's never misses a beat- by the time we see her layers peeled away as a scared, frightened pregnant teen, she's perfectly vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bateman breaks out after a string of bad comedies, Michael Cera stretches his legs (so to speak) pretty well, and JK Simmons and Alison Janney steal any scene they're in, bar-none, with Simmons especially playing one of the most realistic dads in any teenage comedy I've ever seen.It's huggable at times, and endless with its 'indie' appeal- hence the cute songs from Kimya Dawson- and had Cody just tightened the reins on that first third, where she goes for broke in trying to impress anyone who's to read her script, she'd have a really great genre-bending hit. As it stands, however, it's really, really fun, and did I mention huggable? Preggers rock, woo! 8.5/10",8,8,23,27 December 2007
L.A. Confidential," One of Spacey's, and the years, best films
","Curtis Hanson's In L.A. Confidential, it reaches great heights by having a great sense of structure and plot, and great acting.  Sure this film has great acting besides Kevin Spacey (Including Kim Basinger's Oscar winning performance and Russel Crowe, Danny DeVito and Guy Pearce's performances are also good) but Spacey is just terrific in this film.  He plays a corrupt cop in the 1950's with a few others, including Crowe in a exceptional role and James Cromwell as another guy.  Guy Pearce is also very good as the cop who tries to act good in all the slime, but It is difficult.  Quite a compelling film indeed.  One of the best films of 1997 also.  Oscar winner for best adapted screenplay (Hanson and Brian Hegeland).  A",9,2,3,30 August 2000
The Jungle Book," should likely appeal to kids right now, and adults grew up with it
","The Jungle Book was of a nice crop of Disney films I would watch numerous times as a kid, to the point where I would have not even the songs, but full passages of dialog, memorized to heart. It's the last film Walt Disney himself was involved in, and it shows, sort of. But it also shows Disney moving along on its legs into its quiet, and under-appreciated, period of films in the immediately post-Disney's death world of the 70's. If you read the book it's not much like this one aside from the same characters and some plot points. But what it is is a film that survives well on its own feats of strength- catchy songs (including the very popular 'Bare Necessities, though Louis Prima's song is the best of the bunch and the Vulture's song the funniest), and a lot of fun action thrown in with some good, everlasting pathos. Obviously, kids wont need to take lessons on how to escape from the monkeys or from a Bengal Tiger. It does carry enough of parts from real life that kids can take as piece of mind; the coming-of-age idea is in there with the 'man-village' to be sure. And throughout the film itself is a technical knockout, with great visuals and animation, colorful characters (in more ways than one), and spectacular voice talent that's rarely gotten this good in just pure ensemble form. I mean, where else will you get Clint Howard as a baby elephant and Sterling Holloway as a snake? Phil Harris is also indispensable and about as memorable as possibly can be here. Maybe its best quality is that it isn't too much stuck in its time and place (save for the vultures being like the Beatles crosses with Marty- 'what do you wanna do'). It's all in an exuberant, only-out-to-entertain-you style and in solid storytelling that the film is successful, as a family film and as just a terrific piece of entertainment in and of itself. Probably among the best in that crossover period of Disney's from the traditional '9 Old Men' animation period and its later renaissance.",10,2,5,1 May 2006
Concussion," A terribly important subject in just an OK movie
","Actually, Will Smith as Dr. Bennett Owalu, who discovered CTE as a pathologist working on a football star in Pittsburgh and went further to discover it as a major issue in the sport, is more than OK here, and I was glad to see him pulling out some dramatic work that was him constantly trying (and usually succeeding) in elevating about the restraints of the script and basic goodness of the character. It's a shame the script and director are kind of ho-hum; after Spotlight and The Big Short this past year, which took on incredibly major topics and gave them stories and characters that had wide breadth and interest, here it's just kind of eh seconds. We may care about what this character goes through, but just on the level of straight movie drama he's only given so much dimension, and his love interest/wife is rather underwritten.Again, Concussion is not really bad; aside from Smith there's some solid supporting work from Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin, and a number of scenes are good (albeit a few others seem to be trying to make sure they don't offend American football fans, with comparisons to Shakespeare with the sport, which makes things a bit confused, like saying that cigarettes are still so good to have in The Insider or something). But ultimately there's no reason to not just save your money and just watch the Frontline documentary about the entire CTE issue, or wait for TV as it's a fine option for that.It may be watching that that's given me the thought that this could have gone much deeper and perhaps given the subject more analysis and weight as opposed to what is a story that is in sort of conflict between doing a straight-forward biopic on a not very interesting man and an expose on one of the great scandals of our time. If this was made in the 1960's it would be kind of the same movie except with Sidney Poitier in the lead.",6,2,5,2 January 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," a mixed bag of big clever epic tricks and plots convoluted
","At one point, after Captain Jack Sparrow has escaped from the ship of the Lord Beckett, one of the officers says about Sparrow 'Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?' Much can be said about the bulk of (or maybe just all) of the third and possibly final installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The script, in actuality, wasn't finished before filming started, and it shows: the screenwriters, or Verbinski, or Bruckheimer or whomever it was, have here a picture where pretty much not one character of significant note doesn't have some sort of personal vendetta, or double-cross, or triple cross, or some kind of love interest that has to be existent only through massive circumstances of trouble and fate, or that they're just one-note argh pirates or corrupt British officers. At the same time, there are nuggets here that mark as being sublime and utterly riotously funny, and even mark as being some of the best scenes that the series has to offer. But there's so much to get through to get to the worthwhile bits that it's not worth it- not for the 11 bucks for a ticket anyway.It will be a subjective thing of note on whether or not the movie will work based on the universe that the POTC movies rest in- which is when 'up is down', and the Pirates vs British dynamics. But it ends up being, for me anyway, having to find the scenes and moments that do work versus what doesn't, which are the weighty scenes of exposition (eg characters stand around explaining the plot, which maybe is part of the ironic twist from the filmmakers), set-up, re-set-up, and still MORE exposition during what should be the most intense sequences. Basically, we get introduced to Calypso- a much frightened myth of Pirate lore who once had a love, or maybe not totally a love per-say, and is locked away in someone's soul by Pirate mandate. There's also Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat, who actually doesn't show much here except for the excess grimacing and gestures proclaiming 'I'm a bad-ass Asian dude too good to stroke his beard), and his floggle of Singapore pirates. Then there's the whole committee of pirates. Then the dynamics of Barbosa vs Sparrow, Sparrow and Barbosa vs Davy Jones, Will Turner vs Davy Jones (to get to his father, who is 'part of the ship'). Then Elizabeth becomes a pirate captain and Calypso is released, and so on and so forth.The idea of charting the course of action leading to war between the royal British fleet and the league of extraordinary pirates sounds interesting, but it doesn't come off that way. Even when the climax comes, there's still goofy and corny bits thrown in (and not of the good kind ala 'oh, a monkey shot out of a cannon, so rich'), including marriage during a big battle scene (not as bad as the monkey, but the kiss between Turner and Swann is a true Bruckheimer cringe moment). Now, this all being said, it isn't necessarily a completely worthless enterprise. Far from it, there is a chunk of the near three hour running time- say, 15 to 20 minutes- that are near perfect and actually unconventional without trying to go out of its way to mask its shallowness. Jack Sparrow, as played by the ever so versatile, crafty and wackily engaging Johnny Depp, is stuck in Davy Jones's locker when he first appears, and it's something that one might expect out of Jodorowsky as opposed to a huge summer blockbuster: multiple Sparrows going nutty, rocks turning into crabs, Sparrow trying to pull the ship, which starts to move on its own, all starting with a peanut. It's a sheer act of surrealistic bravura film-making, aside from Depp's comedic brilliance, and it's maybe my favorite single sequence from any of the Pirates movies (at least a contender with the best skeleton pirates from the first film). When Sparrow ends up seeing his fellow 'selves', at one point coming out of his ear, it's equally uproarious, if still a little shallow, and it leads up to the exceptional appearance of Keith Richards Sparrow's Pirate King father.This, plus the usual allotment of visually eye-catching visual effects, albeit with not much new that wasn't seen character-wise in the second entry (and all the big energy in that department is saved for the big climax in the ocean, which goes on for almost half an hour more or less), do mark At Worlds End at containing the inspired craziness and exciting pleasures of the first film. But all the same, as it goes on and on, and on, you almost need a chart to count down who betrays who or who does what to the other; this would be all well and good if one could give a darn about the emotional stakes at hand, but it's a case of not a lot of 'there' being there, not assisted by (aside from Depp, Rush and sometimes Nighy) one-note performances and even wooden turns (Tom Hollander).",6,3,7,30 May 2007
X-Men," Good, not great, but good
","I thought this film couldve been a little more developed (even for a assumed prequel) considering the circumstances of it being a movie based on one of the best comic books ever.  Still, there are many things to like in this film.  The action, the characters, the visual and special fx and someother things.  It is a must see, but fans of the comic book might be a little confused of the characters being kinda young (Rogue in this film is a teen and in the comic book series she is an adult) and being under-developed. Note- look for Ray Park (Darth Maul) as Toad.  A-",7,2,4,26 July 2000
Spider-Man 3," nearly the best, or at least most overall satisfying, of the franchise; has terrific (and gleefully corny) humor, big action, and superb characterizations
","Sam Raimi knows what he's doing with the Spider-Man franchise. Some will come away from this third installment and disagree, that he's put out an over-long, angry/sad/delirious blockbuster that doesn't reach into the same levels that the first two films did. For me, if anything, Raimi has gone further in the best possible ways: he's made the kind of grand entertainment that he's been working for since the last two films. One thing to remember, of course, is that the Spider-Man movies are each rides unto themselves, with lots of emotional twists meant to get the audience sucked in by its complex human characters and the wild new villains. But this time there's a darker element to it- something that could be comparable to the Star Wars movies- where the old key Spider-Man concept (power=responsibility) is really put to the test. It comes in the form of a black gooey parasite-whatever that comes out of the remains of a small comet that's hit Earth. How it got there or why it does what it does isn't so much the issue as what it does to that which it connects to: it brings out what's easier to have as a person, vengeance, lust, greed, and above all a lack of conscience. It's an agent of cinematic contrivance, to be sure, but it's a crucial one for the series as Peter Parker has to come to terms with this other choice- and he's not the only one.There is a good deal going on in Spider-Man 3, no argument about that. There's three foes of Peter/Spider-Man: Harry has gone fully into being a chip off the old block by taking on his late father's technical gear to get his own vengeance; Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), escapee from prison, who is really the one responsible for Uncle Ben's death, and succumbs to a particle-changing mechanism and becomes Sandman; Eddie Brock (a surprise, Topher Grace), who's not so much a foe as a kind of cocky annoyance to Peter, and who doesn't really become much of a threat until the third act when aforementioned back gooey stuff comes into the picture. And there's some added girl drama with Gwen Stacy (Howard), who comes in as an unintentional block in the way of Peter and Mary Jane's happiness, albeit as not the main block. There's layers this time to the Parker/Spider-Man saga in that this is the first time we see Spider-Man as the hero of the city, or cheered on as such, and so this time Peter/Spider-Man is in the power position, which then goes on to affect his relationship with MJ. Then there's another line with Harry, who gets short-term memory loss after a fight, and what this brings out between the three of them (Peter and MJ that is).Add on to this the black suit, and its own immense connotation. This is where Raimi has some of his most devilish fun as a filmmaker in years, but at the same time gets out of it on the whole some of those especially poignant and morally questioning points out of comic-books that many take for granted. Of course, it's hard not to laugh as we see the 'bad-boy' Peter, with his hair ala Flock of Seagulls and attitude to spare. Yet it brings to question what Peter, not just Spider-Man, needs to be for those closest to him as much as with those in the city. And even more than the second film, Raimi and his cast get to some fascinating dimensions with the villains. These aren't just simplemutants or miscreants; they've got incredible, massively damaging powers, to one degree or another (Sandman can destroy the most and make the biggest impression, but Venom is the black suit personified as a real monster, and Harry has got only one real nemesis), and deep down are damaged themselves with how they've dealt with the real world and personal trauma. Even when Spider-Man 3 edges onto its most cliché and corny material (including one shot with Spider-Man behind an American flag in his flight), it's a sort of earned corniness because it doesn't fail to be amusing, if only in recognizable ways (recognizable in that we're all used to and respond emotionally to the characters), and leads up to somewhere satisfying on a mass-appeal scale.And one more note should be made to the visual effects, which are par for the course spectacular (what else will one do with millions and millions and millions of dollars?) and expansive for the villains- the incredible detail with Sandman- as well as in general what isn't noticed during the fight and action scenes. But to me it's all the more impressive that Raimi and company uses all of these tools to his advantage by not letting them overpower the story at hand. Even during its moments of pure pop-opera and put-on magisterial effect, there's substance that's rewarding and a lot deeper that many in the audience might take for granted. By the end, nevertheless, it's a Raimi picture through and through, loaded with tongue-in-cheek bits and action-packed, high-flying theatrics, and ending on a note that makes the series feel all the more complete.....",9,22,53,4 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," a director totally in sync with his cast - one of the funniest movies of the YEAR, nevermind MCU
","In brief: this was a damn space craft full of fun. Thor Ragnarok is Douglas Adams by way of Jack 'King' Kirby, both from his Thor run and other (MANY) space fantasy comics in look and brawny, iconic feel (and this time, maybe the first time, Larry Lieber gets a screen credit!) Waititi is stupendous with his actors and they give back in kind.If only the action wasn't so been-there-done-that (or maybe it's the CGI being so overwhelming that it consumed the actors in some shots). That said, this continues the goofy-but-serious space-operatic look from the Guardians movies, and it ups the stakes from the previous Thor movies - it's *easily* the superior of the three, the most human and with a more interesting villain(ess), though I wish Blanchett were in it a wee bit more, not to mention Waititi himself playing a rock monster with a droll sensibility - so it stands out from the pack very easily. Even Thor gets an arc this time, which was fairly typical if there at all, and I don't even know if there was one in The Dark World (that movie was so forgettable I didn't recall what happened to Odin at the end of that story.Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner gets fun stuff to do throughout (he gets to talk, a lot, this Hulk, so take that what you will), and everyone gets a moment to shine, from Tessa Thompson to Karl Urban (mostly his arc is serious, but he starts off the movie with a terrific jokey scene), to even the whoever-she-is that has to work as the Grandmaster's secretary. It's not as emotionally full of depth as the Guardians series, but I did also appreciate where the movie ends up as far as the fate of Asgard; even if it's a small way, it felt like Marvel taking a real chance - the first time they did something like that since Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin, and like that it works - and while, again I must stress, much of the action doesn't carry much consequence, as a comedy with that spirit of Adams (from Hitchhiker's Guide AND Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, I almost forgot till a friend reminded me Odin and Thor and Loki were in that), it's firing on as many cylinders as the other MCU movies this year. It's a breezy, wild space adventure. It knows its audience, and it gives winks and nods to how silly it all may be, but when it needs to be serious it can do that too (or at the least, Cate Blanchett gets to chew on some scenery, but not all of it, if you catch my drift - she knows what she's in and is having the time of her life in a way I haven't seen since Crystal Skull).",8,3,7,2 November 2017
Match Point," a serious channeling of Dostoyevsky via infidelity drama by Woody Allen
","Match Point is my favorite American-directed film of 2005. Woody Allen, coming off of hitting his stride again with Melinda and Melinda, goes back to his darker, dramatic side, and makes a story that may seem a little familiar, though not to his discredit. Woody borrows (some may say steal) elements from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, one of the great novels of the 19th century (some may say ever written, I have read his work though not this yet), and transfuses it with subject matter that he's more than well acquainted with- the relationship drama. But un-like Love and Death, which was Allen's way of parodying the work of the author, this time he takes the work seriously, plunging the audience into the mind, conflicts, and outcome of the protagonist. That the performances by the actors involved, particularly the three main leads are top notch (Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johnasson in one of her best) brings full blood and flesh to Woody's strong skeleton of a film.The story starts slow. Chris Wilton (Rhys-Myers) is an Irishman in London, a tennis instructor who could've gone pro. He meets Chloe (Mortimer) through her brother Tom (Matthew Goode) and they soon become close, close enough for marriage. Basically, he marries into an upper-class family where he's coaxed into becoming a businessman for the family. But during this he also meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling American actress, who's engaged to Tom. One thing leads to another, yada-yada, and Chris winds up in a big pickle as he's in a love-triangle between Chloe and Nola. Allen handles this dilemma with a powerful precision, by building up the relationships Chris has with each girl, and how there is not unbelievability in the set-ups. Nola is sensible and intelligent, if not altogether, while Chloe is caring and decent, if maybe too picture perfect for Chris. The dynamics are set-up so well, it leaves room for ample drama and suspense.Allen, who has also been a playwright for decades, knows the way people interact like so, and how not to rush the situations and use tact with delicate scenes. There is also the element of Opera, which Chris sees with Chloe's family often, and the element of tennis. The analogies that both produce could possibly be very trite or cliché. It's not to say a couple of scenes are even cliché (ladies, you know you've seen quite a few movies with passionate kissing in the rain), but I even bought into those scenes. There is perhaps a certain manipulation that goes into these kinds of love stories, how much the audience can go with the inner conflict of our main character. But as the protagonist goes into a frame of mind that most may not be able to identify with, we're still with him all the way. And, perhaps, it's also because I love a good, solid infidelity story. Allen has here not only his best film in several years, but also likely his most suspenseful one.Those who may not go with the sympathies &/or empathy for the characters may not like the film as much. Some have even criticized minor gripes with the film, like Rhys-Myers's unconvincing accent, or the over-usage of London's most famous landmarks. As an American, perhaps, I didn't mind certain things like these. When a filmmaker has this much trust in his script (and Woody, pushing 70 in making this, is not amateur), and has the right cast, it just takes off from there. To say I was on the edge of my seat through a good chunk of the third act is an under-statement and, at the core, was even cathartic in a way. It's the kind of film I would love to tell more people about, even if they think Woody is washed up after years of arguably less-than-great pictures. For some it might not even 'feel' like a Woody Allen movie, that at times it's a little 'slick'. It still is, however the work of an artist reaching further into his grab-bag with younger, exciting actors, and an interesting use of a (finally) new city.",10,98,146,7 January 2006
Zodiac," not your typical serial killer movie; it's mystery about mystery, and with plot not as paramount as character and mood
","David Fincher is back in action after a five year wait that is, at least for me, well worth the gap. Zodiac tests the boundaries of what can really be done in a genre that by now- and ironically by Fincher's own doing with Se7ven being such a huge success- has almost run its course. He reinvigorates it in a very deliberate, powerful manner by making this true story, like JFK, about what it is to investigate, and how investigating something like a murder (or in this case murders) has to be unraveled in a way to get one not even enveloped as to the end result but the process. It's epic length, or at least at 156 minutes really feels epic in scope, and it was the right decision not cut too much more out than Fincher did. But with this time given he is able to pay in many a suspenseful scene, and- to make another famous cinematic comparison- like Lang's M really becomes more fascinated by the process of how to make a criminal investigation a purely cinematic endeavor. It's also one of the year's best films.One of the things, for example, that had me impressed was the structure, of how plot itself was meant to be intricate and with all of the points of a case made to be important- hence all of the 'two days later' or 'twelve hours later' or 'a year and a half later'. We're getting the bulletin points, sure, but its a specific choice in how to follow the two sides, those at the San Francisco Chronicle (with the primary leads being Jake Gyllenhall's Robert Graysmith and Robert Downey Jr's Paul Avery) and with the police department (Mark Ruffalo's Detective Toschi), and how they interconnect and lead off into making this one big puzzle. It becomes a puzzle to which Graysmith, who ended up writing a book about the murders that never really got a person convicted for the crimes, becomes absorbed to the point of blocking everything else out of his life. This happens actually four years after the last main batch of letters were sent by the zodiac killer to the press, but this too adds to the intrigue and possible futility of Graysmith's personal investigation. He's not a reporter, but it's not about getting the main even exactly caught, but to, as he says, 'look him the guy in the eye'. It goes without saying that everything evidence-wise in the case, of course, is circumstantial.Aside from being top-notch in the realm of intelligent police procedurals, as well as a story of investigative journalism gone awry, Fincher puts on his a-game visually as well. It might not have the overload of visual tricks and inventive gags that Fight Club had, but within what Fincher needs he makes the picture as strong a directorial feat as he's ever done, maybe even his second best. The control of mis-en-scene is one aspect, and it's appropriate to note the usage of the opening studio logos like the 60s/70s logos, as it sometimes feels like watching one of those movies, while, of course, commenting on them as well (i.e. Dirty Harry movie scene). And also the little shots that stick in your mind, like the aerial view on top of the Golden Gate bridge, or those shots with the zodiac's handwriting super-imposed montage style over the scenes. His control is ever present, but not making it unbearable either; it's all about the story here, and character, and he keeps the darkness in close, precise check, and makes it maybe even more effectively 'moody' as a noirish thriller than Se7en.Now, as for Graysmith, he's the one that ends up bringing out what is for Zodiac that center of making it about the 'journey instead of the destination' as the saying goes. That cliché shouldn't be something to snort at, however, as it's a journey where since we already know what will come at the very end suspense has to come out of situations, and out of the finding, losing, and possibly attainable commodity of information. It's almost one big comment on those results-oriented police pictures, and I often felt more gripped and interested in individual scenes, moments. Two of my favorite are when Ruffalo's detective and Koetas's officer interrogate Leigh, where you think you know conventionally 'this is the killer, this is him', but it is not...or is it? Fincher keeps one guessing, as well as in another scene where Graysmith visits the former organ player at the silent theater Rick Marshall, who may or may not be the killer, was the projectionist (when they go into the basement especially is a classically charged scene).And there are other factors that make it sensational as well. It's another turn by Downey Jr where there's subtleties that only he can bring to a character like the flawed Avary. Gyllenhall's also a perfect choice for Graysmith, where naive ambition and interest get conveyed well early on, and then equally believable as the one-track-minded private investigator who pushes buttons but gets results. And the soundtrack is especially a keeper, with 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' used to awesome effect for the opening July 4th scene and in the last scene (it might even send chills down some people's spines). It's never too slick but always an inviting trip, and it questions what it is that a serial killer mystery should be while giving it flair and a personal mark of distinction as a work in and of itself. Who is zodiac? A form of evil, perhaps, and a form of evil that one might just want a glimpse of, if only, as opposed to the whole found and captured result.",10,8,17,4 March 2007
Milk," Sean Penn shines as Harvey Milk in a very, very good (if not masterpiece) docu-drama
","Sean Penn rarely plays genuinely likable people, and maybe rightfully so; his career has so many people who aren't likable, who are villainous or corruptible or just really flawed beyond repair (Mystic River and Sweet and Lowdown come to mind), that it's slightly a niche to see him in that mold. But Milk breaks it, to a small degree: we know he can play likable or genuinely good people, but it takes a role like Harvey Milk and subsequently as good a movie as Milk turns out to be to remind us how amazing he can be as one. And Harvey Milk, while not a perfect person or without one or two minor flaws (he is a politician at heart so it's impossible not to), is one of those truly heroic figures that blazed trails and formed a real community out of Castro street and San Francisco and, eventually, across the country, got a lot of people who were in the closet and were afraid to come out to rise up to the challenge of gay rights. The late Milk, 30 years later, gets the star and the movie he rightfully deserves.And better than anything is that the picture can be accessible to those who may not go right away to see the latest gay/lesbian film (if you decided deliberately to stay away from Brokeback Mountain, then this just isn't for you either, though you probably already know that and/or aren't even reading this). Even its weakest player, Diego Luna, is at least fascinating to watch, and the entire ensemble props up Penn's fantastic work here: James Franco, Emile Hirsch, and especially, most notably, Josh Brolin as Dan White, who was a fellow city supervisor with Harvey Milk and eventually killed Milk and the mayor over a 'junk-food' craze and is played by Brolin as perfectly uptight (likely closeted to boot) and who brings in a lot of nuance and subtlety to a role that could have been played in an overwrought tone or pull. Indeed, there was never a scene with Brolin that isn't less than amazing (and most of them show how well he goes head-to-head with the likes of Penn).While my one minor complaint about the movie might be some of the broad strokes painted over Harvey's love life(s) with Franco and mainly Luna's characters (the latter especially is very two-dimensional, if that, which maybe can be blamed more on the script than the acting or direction), it doesn't make Milk any less of a must-see. Van Sant, as director, pulls out what is a comeback from the years of unadulterated art-house experimental films (some great, some not) into what is closest for him for being mainstream. He connects with the material and the subject matter so strongly, and not just as a given for being homosexual; he embraces the 'inspiring political saga' story and does very well mixing together the heartfelt dramatization with the real footage on the news of monsters like Anita Bryant and the coverage on the news.Another director might have made a good bio-pic out of this, but Van Sant, after navigating through a first half which is always interesting if slightly rushed, crafts most of all a very powerful, incendiary docu-drama that has obvious relevance for the current events (Prop 8 in California), but is never less than immediate anyway. The homosexual community needs a movie like Milk just as much as they needed the man, a voice in the 'machine' for their concerns and problems. It's an important, if imperfect, piece of American 'issue' film-making.",8,2,7,7 December 2008
The Prestige," a basic tale of one-up-manship, but done in a great fashion of professional storytelling and acting
","The Prestige is like a machine of tricks and wonders, and it ends up pulling off a lot more than it might have not been able to chew. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture, and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters, and the people focused around them, that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through, in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat, because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the magicians, who start out as partners under the tutelage of Michael Caine's Cutter, who perform acts of not-totally-simple 'magic', which follow three main principles which are listed by Cutter at the start and end of the picture. After a tragedy that befalls their assistant (Piper Perablo), the rivalry and, more crucially, the aims and wills of each side is put into play. On one side is Bale's Borden, who is, according to Jackman's Angier, living his entire life as a trick, which may not be far from the truth (hope that doesn't spoil things). On the other is Angier, who becomes involved with the burgeoning technology of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, who is one of the lesser factors of actors in the film), who may be able to figure out how to make something truly unbelievable. Their fates become entangled in each side's pursuit to out-do the other in the public eye, with Cutter and the change-around mistress (Scarlet Johanssen, in a spiffy English accent that works), on the sidelines.What makes a lot of this more compelling that it almost has a right to be is how much we're steeped into the mind-sets of these characters, who they get fractured by their own separate ambitions amid their skills. One is a better magician, while the other is a better showman, and each can't stand the other's talents in the midst of being somewhat intrigued and drawn to a kind of madness. And yet at the same time the personal also finds its way into the trickery of the film, and actually grounds things- seemingly of course- particularly with Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall, one of the best in the film acting-wise) who feels betrayed by the pack of lies and secrecy. The fates then of both characters becomes that of dealing with mortality, and how one can cheat death or not, or again, and again. Towards the end it does teeter much on becoming one extra ending that might not be needed, or a couple of minutes that feel packed in too tight.But all the while Jackman and Bale are constantly compelling, with little things they have in their characters that make them very much real for us, and then makes the final twist not too unworthy of what led up to it. It's like a twist mountain, or rather, a prestige. It might not be the best kind of 'prestige' I've seen, yet I still highly recommend it as a cool treat of splendid storytelling in a story that teeters on leaving the audience with too much of a gasp in the extraordinary, and has just enough to pull back and have a few good surprises. It's one of the best productions to come out this season.",9,3,6,29 October 2006
The Terminator," still an action movie classic, or a 'Tech-Noir' if you will
","The Terminator - ripped from the pages of Harlan Ellison (literally ripped-off at first until a lawsuit came around for screen credit) and out of the imagination of James Cameron, it's an action movie that MOVES, fast, after a 20 minute set-up with only little bits to pause and reflect or give exposition or have a quintessential love scene. It's also the reason that Arnold Schwarzenegger got work for so many years after as a star, with a performance that oddly enough features only a handful of lines of dialog. One wonders today the T-800, Cyberdine model 101, is still (Anton Chigurh be damned) the true quiet-killer in modern cinema.The set-up is simple, so simple a child or senile old person can watch and know what's going on: Kyle Reese, soldier, sent back over 40 years into the past to stop the T-800 from killing Sarah Conner, mother of the resistance-against-the-machines leader John. That's about it. There's some more, of course, including a glimpse into the future (the term 'Tecnh-Noir' is most apt even with the rampant violence throughout), but mostly it's a chase movie, a cat-and-mouse game where the lines are drawn straight and from there on in James Cameron propells the characters and action down without a mark missed. It's the kind of movie that if you really like it the first time you'll rewatch it whenever it's on TV and love it more. It's smart, fun, ruthless contemporary film-making.'Look at it this way, in 100 years, who's gonna care?'",10,3,6,30 April 2000
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," a reminder of the joy in fantasy movies as much as good-old comic-book fun
","I don't know what goes on in director Guillermo del-Toro's head, but whatever it is it'd be a sad day when it stops churning away. He's a fantasist in the purest and most enjoyable tradition, where he's so passionate and in love with these characters in worlds like Hellboy and his masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth that one has to believe in his belief of this world, and not in any naive sensibility either. In his imagination, as let loose onto film with the vibrancy of legend and the truth of a docu-drama (as with Hellboy creator Mike Mignola), it's more about the power of myth than just simple mindless comic-book blockbuster fun.And in the case of the Hellboy 2, he's got more creative control than in the first film, and a handle on the reins of the various technical and special effects and make-up and creature and etc etc departments that has been mastered further following Pan's Labyrith. It's hard for me to figure on it being any less than the predecessor; on the contrary he's made it with a level of ridiculous impact in the regular action-movie sensibility, and with touches of romance and humor that are staggeringly good and entertaining. And as an extra kicker, it's highly recommendable for those who had such a LACK of interest that they didn't even bother with the first Hellboy or the comics. It's that damn good.But with all of the advancements that del-Toro has vs. four or five years ago, and all of the added creatures and creations from the 'German' Johann Krauss, to the Troll city, to those delightfully vicious 'tooth-fairies', to the one mystical being in the Ireland rock that looks resembles a cousin-relation to the 'Pan' universe, the 'forest' monster who's demise springs a surprisingly wonderful result, and the immense Golden army itself and how all of this is combines with a genius level of 'old-fashioned' special effects and CGI, the story comes first. And in this there's just a little more at stake, a little more for Hellboy (and Abe Sapien too) to worry about and protect, and of course all of that the-world-is-in-danger stuff comes with the package. There's even a touching, cruel twist with the main villain, an evil Prince who wants control over the 70x70-large Golden army, being connected by mind and body and spirit to the Princess, who is kinder and wiser and becomes a love interest to a character.While it may not be too much of a spoiler to say whom, I won't for the sake of the present review. Suffice to say that romantic entanglement isn't nearly as engrossing as the one continuing and growing between Hellboy (the always bad-ass Ron Perelman) and Liz (sexy and actually good actress Selma Blair). All of the strands, however, work pretty much all in sync with the high-voltage of emotions working in and around the main narrative, which isn't too complex in truth.Bottom line, it's a fun time at the movies, with the laughs many and often big (a line about a certain 'baby' brought down the house at my screening), and relying on the great personalities on the actors and characters, and featuring some real slam-banging action of the summer AND of the year. This filmmaker knows what he's doing, and it's thrilling to see him work his, for lack of a better word, magic.",10,6,14,11 July 2008
Cloverfield," a contradiction that works, up to a point: big Hollywood blockbuster/monster movie meets (stylized) subjective POV
","JJ Abrams is very clever at delivering projects that drive up the hype machine like some kind of crazy storm, which can either go off smashingly (Lost) or not so much (Felicity). Cloverfield is an experiment that needed some clever marketing - hence the 'what the ?' trailer that came out last summer with people partying in a video camera viewpoint, and then looking out at a big explosion over New York City. What the film is is a bit different from the mystery surrounding the buzz on it, though the director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard (the former's first movie since The Pallbearer, the latter his first feature script after years of television), end up delivering some clever ideas and some good scares, even surprisingly juicy metaphors, while also making the audience suspend an incredible amount of disbelief.And it's this amount of disbelief that had me personally feeling very mixed about the picture when it ended. I knew I had seen some good entertainment in the sense of delivering the shocks and thrills that a good monster movie can provide (some of it, arguably, reminds one of the recent film the Mist). But there's more than just the ambiguity around where the huge would-kick-Godzilla's-toosh monster that reigns havoc all over midtown Manhattan, though that's a part of it. There's a specific purpose in having the characters Reeves and Goddard have in the picture, who are shallow, self-obsessed twenty-something cretins that look like a cross between your suburban Abercrombie acquaintances and rejects from MTV reality shows. The filmmakers bring the audience early on- and in increases steadily as the story goes on- to despising these people, not simply for their actions (have any of these people heard of the phrase 'every man for himself and huge f***ing creature against all?'), but for doing the stupid things that happen in most horror films.And yet, at the same time, the filmmakers have something special going on here, aside from the technique, which is of course part of the message (medium-message yada yada). The monster and its minions, for these kids as well as everyone else in the city, is like what philosophers call 'the big other'. Look at the scene where looters rush into an electronics store, and on TV there's news footage of the monster ripping apart the city. All the looters stop dead in their tracks, and for Rob and Lily and especially Hud the creature is like some unfathomable presence that can't be stopped, and despite being right where they can see it is something they can't totally grasp their collective consciousness around. That, plus some (slightly obvious) allusions to 9/11, and a slight tip of the hat to Japan (the kid going off to Japan, almost clever by half I'd say), make this a movie that does have some good metaphors going for it under the surface.This being said, there's something about the aforementioned characters that sort of bugged me, startling early on with the twenty minute lot of scenes with the party, and trickling down as the film went along. The style is meant to convey something specific, that we're right along with the viewer as they go through an extremely chaotic situation that is inconceivable (at least, unless, you haven't seen your share of Godzilla movies). Which, in its own way, treks back to the legacy left by Blair Witch Project, where one cared about what would happen to the trio as their defenses whittled down to a nub in the midst of the dark woods. In the case of Cloverfield, however, we're put in a situation where the subjective point of view is intense, a way of revealing a creature that is designed like out of some weird graphic novel. This part, of revealing the horror elements, works fine and effectively (particularly the spiders in the subway)...And at the same time the characters don't quite follow the reality that would be for most people. It's good to see a movie like Cloverfield with an audience (especially, if you're lucky, in Manhattan itself) to see the kind of response it gets, which to me seemed like a collective form of stretching the suspension of disbelief. Aside from the character Marlena, who is arguably the most sympathetic (or just least 'what the ?' of the characters in what they do or say or act), they're like most characters we see in many a horror movie, following a logic that is more based on getting through the points that will lead the story through its harrowing end. I'll be able to suspend disbelief even in the sorts of things one has to go with in Cloverfield. But it takes some identification, some sympathy with the characters, to make it really worthwhile. I didn't get that from the picture, adding to it a muddled (if slightly exciting) climax.In the end, Cloverfield left me with mixed feelings, and I'm not sure when I would watch it again. But as the biggest hit so far in 2008, it's hard not to want to see what it has to offer, as a tip of the hat to old classic monster-destroys-city movie while trying a different approach. Least I can say is Abrams fans wont be too dissatisfied.",7,3,11,26 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," One of the Best Films of the Year
","I have just seen Sleepy Hollow and I think it is not only one of the best (and most imaginative) films of 1999, but definately Tim Burton's milestone film.  All of his past films have done alot in filmaking, but this new version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' had me speechless with it's dazzling acting, effects, art direction and action (not to mention an unbilled appearence by Christopher Walken.The story has Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp in a very deep acting role, as a constable from New York sent up to the superstitious town of Sleepy Hollow.  Where a ghostly figure named The Headless Horseman rides in the night be-heading people on his steed without mercy in his pursuit.  It gets better after that with a mystery unfolding in a manner only suited for Burton.Despite some story changes from the original Sleepy Hollow story by Irving (and a usual ending as such in these type of movies) it never stopped to amaze me with its good ensemble cast, dazzling set designs, and visual effects.  This deserves to be at the top of the scary films league (though as a horror film, it only makes it prudent with its head severing). A+",8,1,2,19 November 1999
The Hateful Eight," 'Oh, a Haberdashery, it's a joke.'
","I had the suspicion watching this again that this could become like another JACKIE BROWN for Tarantino - a film that is somewhat (not altogether but somewhat) under-appreciated and will gain in following and status over time. It's a difficult film to embrace, and yet watching it again I don't know if I can call it completely 'nihilistic'. That's the belief that everything is meaningless, in nothing. I think that these characters, or some of them, want to believe in *something* - hell, even Daisy has a family, right, that has some meaning to it - but it's really about the *FAILING* of meaning, how meaning is screwed up by the promises and hopes of the American dream.The Lincoln letter, the leaders of the confederacy and the 'Renegade Army' and of course what slavery did and continues to do, so that even those who are 'free' like Marquis Warren are never really free, not in their own life time (and if you read in-between the lines this is much more of an ex-slave getting revenge than Django, who was ready to go on his merry way once he got his bride), these are all things that poison and distort the truth of things.So in a way it's actually an extremely moral film - well, EXTREME and MORAL as a film put together when you think about it - and that it's all acted by the gathered performers without a missed note (seeing it again the depth to which Madsen gives Joe Gage sticks out a little more, the image of the 'Cowpoke' who is a twisted nightmarish killer), and while I don't think Tarantino is an overtly political filmmaker he's certainly seen his rather large fair share of spaghetti westerns and many of those were very political, plus he is not untouched by the world around him so in a way this reflects the country we're in far more than anything else I can think of in the past couple of years. Not to mention the direction, seeing as this is all shot on gigantic 70mm cameras and there's no space for things like hand-held shots or zooms like on other films, he has to shoot much of this straight on. We can't look away from these mother****ers, QT may be saying, and with the way he frames shots it makes a stark, delicious contrast: often exquisite cinematography (not only the shots of the bitterly cold wilderness, an ideal backdrop for this story where nothing green or natural grows, but those details in the confining Haberdashery), and the subjects themselves are mostly rotten (except for Warren who is my favorite character, bar none, and Jackson makes him vivid and awe-inspiring and yet very human and vulnerable by the last act ).Also, it does have a lot of stuff Tarantino's done before - theatrical 'acting' to win over other characters' trust, verbiage that almost goes on too long but hey, hell with it, he can do it better than anyone and every word feels like it should be there (cut out one and it might start to unravel), and some gruesome violence (though on repeat viewing it's not THAT gruesome - I'd say it's about on par with Pulp Fiction on the scale, so much less than the Kill Bills or Django or Basterds, so if there are a lot of bodies that hit the floor and blood that flows in the 2nd half, it stands out because of how we've come to this.... okay, the throwing up of blood is still sick, but hilarious) - but when it's Tarantino and I love his stuff, I can't complain.good times, QT salad.",10,2,6,24 May 2016
Catch-22," a seriously funny movie about insane reality
","In 1970, MASH and Catch-22 were the main contenders in the unofficial bout of military satire movies, and while MASH ended up making far more at the box office and keeping its acclaim so high that Robert Altman had a sweet career in the 70s (and, arguably, made far greater films), I might be in that minority that prefers Mike Nichols' funny but dark and pretty frightening adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel. I can't say with certainty if it reaches up to the reputation of Heller's work (I would imagine it's probably better and with more detail and further wit), but director Nichols and screenwriter Buck Henry nail what is by now the obvious and continually horrifying fact that the nature of wartime brings on such an insane situation that the sanest one is the one who wants to prove to the nut-house that he's the loon. As in Dr. Strangelove, Catch-22 is populated by eccentrics and crackpots and just strange people, but there's a reality t it that keeps it from going too far into farce.The difference for Nichols, I think, was Vietnam. There's that underlying current of that war being even more maddening and pointless than WW2, and there's many scenes where the humor just evaporates and we're left with Yosarrian (Alan Arkin) completely bewildered by a military command that is chaotic by design. When we see a character like Bob Newhart's 'Captain' Major or Jon Voight's character's chocolate cotton (not cotton candy, cotton) or Perkins walking in on Martin Balsam on the toilet, it's funny or amusing or, as in Yosarrian's thing for acting 'weird' and going nude for a medal or just for the hell of it, hilarious in that deadpan manner one expects from the director of the Graduate. But the tone shifts, not suddenly but with a good jolt, when the pilot shops the guy in half and then flies into the mountainside. Not to mention the whole final third of the picture, which becomes darker and more troubling; the satire turns from nutty and sometimes dream-like (i.e. recurring vision of 'saving' the guy dying in the plane) to tragic and ugly. In fact, this is no less an important depiction of the macabre nature of the beast that is war than Apocalypse Now.If it's not really a totally great film or a masterpiece, it's almost one. It starts a little shaky with its tone, I should note, as one has to adjust to some of the rhythm of the dialog like the first mess-hall scene with Martin Sheen and Art Garfunkel, or just the tone of the film-making which goes to creative lengths to make cinematic the tone of picture, sometimes in just one shot (the best being when Voight and Balsam walk and talk, and the plane crashes down without the characters flinching). There's touches of real brilliance to the direction and the writing and certain set pieces like the medal awarding or the ending. But at the same time Nichols is also best as an actor's director, and he's assembled a host of familiar faces to film buffs, or just casual moviegoers: Arkin gives a genuine pathos to the protagonist Yosarrian; Sheen and Voight and Charles Grodin and Bob Balaban and Anthony Perkins and Balsam fit great into their supporting roles, filling them with equal parts grounded reality and wackiness that verges on that line of serious and parody; Orson Welles, for his two scenes, almost steals the show from the large cast.It's a mostly superb and underrated work by a director off and running early in his career, working from a highly regarded work of black comedy to as honest an extent as possible (or, rather, it doesn't feel cheating to what would be an adaptation), and it puts you into a whole other perspective of that 'Great' war, with foreshadowing to contractor-profiteers and fake missions on civilians and power-hungry brass with total immunity. Maybe nothing very new, sure, but it's rarely so entertaining and powerful.",9,2,5,17 November 2008
"I, Tonya"," or as the judges would say: 5.6(?)
","I, Tonya is that frustrating good movie that should or could be better. Not much of any fault can be found on the actors, and while they're all quite good it's Robie and Janney's movie (sometimes Stan's too as he effectively shows he can do more outside of Bucky). And the direction is absolutely acceptable as far as how Craig Gillespie moves the camera and knows how to hold on a shot when he must - certainly at an absolutely crucial moment, without music and only Robie's face as she goes back and forth from tears to smiles in a mirror, is that moment - and getting this work with the actors had to take some deep work. No, everything problematic is the script and the music, and it's not so much what is there as what isn't and/or what could have been.I didnt know much at all about the Harding/Kerrigan story outside of the general basics of the 'Incident' as all of the characters in I, Tonya call it, but as much as I might get out of the repeated abuse that Tonya received as a daughter and a spouse may make her more sympathetic (the connection of her physical, as well as mental, abuse to that she received from the media in 94), but I wondered if they could have shown other things to make the story more complicated. Of course there's the bungled crime plot part of it - maybe this screenwriter is a big Coen fan along with Scorsese, and make no mistake this is down-the-line Diet Scorsese, which ill expound on in a moment - and yet Tonya had, from what the movie tells us, a connection *to Nancy Kerrigan as a friend.*As the audience, what do we get to see with that? Tonya saying it one line and then we see them giggling on a bed. That's it. What is that bond that happened there? Why was Tonya friends with someone who was much more beloved and maybe/maybe not had the hard existence that Tonya had it? I have to think Robie when presented with the script likely responded to the potential in getting deeper into what is underneath when Tonya talks to us (4th wall is broken not only by fake documentary style but by characters doing it mid scene) and is beaten up and fights back and then accepts whats happened and then in reverse the joy of being on the ice. Did she actually respond to the plot mechanics? Because those... I dunno.None of it is actively bad exactly. If you are looking for straight entertainment that goes for an invigorating 'we're fuck ups but we're human beings look beyond the media depictions' take, that is there. But Gillespie or the producers or whomever missed out on what could have been more... *showing* us Harding's existence instead of flat *telling* us. That is where they try for Scorsese first, as far as showing us a group of unlike able but honestly depicted characters (and among them Tonya is by FAR the easiest to understand, everyone else is a pathetic creeper or abuser or, well, okay Janney is outstanding as always and I will take her total conviction over exact depth), but it falls flat because the narration isn't necessary for that purpose, it's not original enough to stand out. It is just... There. The second part is the music.Just... Please, music supervisors, and I shall assume this had the same hack as Suicide Squad (the Robie connection coincidental. Maybe), listen to some of the deeper cuts on a CD or your iTunes, it is certainly possible to get something else than the same dozen 70s and 80s classic rock tracks to show us 'yes, hard rocking 70s times!' A shame since I like most of the songs in and of themselves, and could see some value in a couple of them (the ZZ Top track which may/may not have been there when Tonya was skating early on is a good example and a deeper track that fits the scene). But like the script the songs spell things out to nearly comic degrees; Janney's mother has 4 year old Tonya on the ice, how about 'Devil Woman'? Theres another drive away 'for good' from a mega blowout fight between Robie and Stan? How about 'Goodbye Stranger' by Supertramp? It eventually is overkill too, but the bigger problem is that it accents the scenes and doesnt do scenes dramatic service. It tells us how to feel before we can get a handle or trust what's already there.I know this sounds like a dumping on on all of I, Tonya, but that may be in part an expectations thing. I thought if it was going to Goodfellas or maybe Wolf of Wall st lengths it might take a satirical view on this uncanny sports saga - the trailer leads one on that direction too, a great trailer I should add - but it is more like an inverted Raging Bull. What if we got the woman's take on being in seemingly endless cycles of abuse, and you cant take what happens off the ice on it either (except maybe to uh prove the abusers wrong?) and yet it is .... not that kind of story either because we do get a lot more of an indication of where the abuse comes from. It's an experience where I absolutely adore everything the actors are doing, I could go on and on about how much Robie owns even (especially even) the smaller scenes that need to be quieter like with Julianne Nicholson (unrecognizable as always), and at the same time they had richer material and a less hackneyed attitude to certain parts of the style.Oh, and last thing that may be a nitpick, but... It is really distracting at times how obvious it isn't Robie's face on the body during some of the skating moves. Just get a good double people! Dont make me get the club on you VFX slackers!",7,3,8,23 December 2017
We Were Soldiers," Contains too many war cliches to be easily enjoyed, but the battle scenes are quite good.
","Randall Wallace, screenwriter of the great Braveheart, fair The Man In the Iron Mask and the horrible Pearl Harbor makes his directorial debut (I think) in this Vietnam war film that takes a different approach to the Vietnam war film- showing the first real battle over there back in late 1965.  Mel Gibson, who once directed and starred in Wallace's Braveheart, stars as Col. Moore, who is chosen to lead the 1st and 7th Cavalry divison of the army into the 'Valley of Death' in Vietnam danger zone.  Other supporting characters include Greg Kinnear as a smart and efficient pilot with a knickname which would be censored here, Chris Klein who is always with a clean shave and little if no dirt during the battle scenes and honestly looks too womanly to be in such a army, and Barry Pepper as a war journalist dropped during the battle and witnesses first hand the horror that ensues.There are too many cliches to be considered totally realistic and in the early scenes, while interesting and even amusing, make Gibson seem a little softer than he should appear.  Yet, for those in the mood for a different war picture that eerily tries to balance 40's and 50's like corniness with graphic war violence and gives a good story in the mix won't be dissapointed.

Ocean's Twelve," Has its moments, but overall it was a bit too much (though I liked it better on repeat viewings)
","...Steven Soderbergh, with his cast returning (and then some) from the first film, can create results that show how talented they are. Ocean's Eleven was a fun, fresh kind of heist picture, that worked off a good story on good characters, and had enough wit with comedy to balance out the more dramatic elements. Ocean's Twelve, on the other hand, juggles with the story like Tarantino on whip-its. I understood the premise pretty well from the trailers (Benedict, played by Garcia, wants all of his money back, or all eleven will be dead, so they high-tail it to Europe for a couple of prime heists). What sometimes boggled me were how the double crosses were handled, or how certain character knew others and so on and so forth. Adding to this confusion- or rather, not so much confusion as not really investing much interest in the story- Soderbergh fuses the film with his camera-work that is stylish, but overly so. It's one thing to be expressive with the camera, as Soderbergh can be (Traffic works very well off of the hand-held usage and filters). It's another thing to draw attention to the technical side while the story jump-ropes.On top of this, the actors, while sometimes on the money (in particular Vincent Cassell in what could be his American breakthrough role as the 'night-fox'), can also be a little too thin to deal with. I understand it's a silly caper comedy, but I should be able to invest my emotions with these people, and about two-thirds into the movie I didn't care much about them. Take Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, playing a cop who once had a fling with Rusty (Pitt). Are we supposed to not like her, or like her, or kinda go back and forth. She's gorgeous to look at, but she's not given the kind of one-liners the others get. By the time the third act rolls around, the scenes seem like they've been filmed improv style (not a total downer), but without much coherence to where the story to go.Basically, I knew I didn't totally despise Ocean's Twelve, however the sense of over-load made me say to myself a few times 'ok, so what's the point?' I respect that the actors had fun making the film, as it is a lot better than being miserable through the shoot. But when it starts to distract from the focus of the scenes there's trouble (I could see smirks on them in some scenes where they could of had more of a better grip on what was really going on). Now, this is not to say I don't enjoy it when a director implements a crazy kind of style- Kill Bill vol. 1 is a triumph for that very reason- as long as it doesn't try and compensate for something wrong with the material. To put it another way, Ocean's Twelve is like an art-film that's struggling to break away from the hackneyed, conventional Hollywood 'hip' kind of standard, and the result is an equal amount of boredom, fascination, and slight indifference. There's also a sweet, if occasionally tiresome, jazz score that rings of 70's TV. C+ (6/10)",7,3,6,11 December 2004
Crash," well-shot and often well-acted, but it's so subject heavy...
","I had heard so much about Crash over these past months in 2005, seen it pop up repeatedly on top 10 lists, and only heard a couple of reviews from friends or critics saying it was a bad movie. After finally seeing it, I feel like I've seen a film in conflict with itself, which is for better or worse depending on who is watching it. The stories in the film revolve around several characters (ensemble style), including cops, gangsters, foreigners, upper-class types, lower-class types, who get in such conflicts with each other, practically all by racial attitudes and bigotry. It's a tough call for me as a viewer, because I respect the effort that has been put into it, the initial ambition to track the kinds of racial boundaries that make things with people on edge all over America, not just Los Angeles. And performances by the likes of Sandra Bullock (her best since Miss Congeniality 2...just kidding, really top notch), Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton, Matt Dillon, and even Brendan Fraser, go above expectations. The problem I see lies in the script. Writer/director Paul Haggis, who scored some points for his script of Million Dollar Baby (an adaptation, but one that did have a level of simplicity that helped), sometimes confuses making bold statements by these assorted types as being perfectly modulated alongside the style. The funny thing is, the photography is quite interesting, in its hand-held, quasi-Traffic style, however even under the surface I almost felt there was a kind of TV-movie feel to it that I couldn't shake. Un-like a real masterpiece about racism in America, Do The Right Thing, there aren't many any sidebars (or little details) to the characters really that break up the more tense moments. And it's not just the pile of coincidences that one has to take fully into account, or that many scenes seem like rushed climaxes, but that even when things get dramatically correct and strong (later in the film, when not too melodramatic) it isn't as real as it should be. Maybe I'm missing something, or maybe it's that the movie isn't very subtle, but it's no great film to me. It is good, sometimes provocative, and not in totally in the league of other non-linear films that have come out in the past decade. Grade: B",6,8,16,6 November 2005
Snatch," Still a clone, but a good one
","Thinking in the back of my head that Guy Ritchie's Snatch is just another clone of the Tarantino era flicks and also enormously fashioned after Ritchie's freshman effort Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, I didn't think Snatch wouldn't be that great.  But like how Ritchie's first film surprised me, so did this film, which does the best it can and succeeds, mostly.  The plot is pretty tangled and even though the premise deals with a stolen diamond, there are side stories.  Many funny moments, however Brad Pitt (with dialogue that makes Adam Sandler's inner voice sound coherent) and a squeaking dog steal the show.  A-",8,4,10,19 January 2001
Spider-Man: Homecoming," does a lot as a friendly neighborhood mega-franchise; one of the better 'reboots'
","For the most part, if you were among those that saw Spider-Man/Peter Parker appear in Civil War and found him entertaining and, more to the point, *right* as that character and icon, then you will like him all the more in his first movie in this iteration. It's amazing to think that this is the sixth Spider-Man movies in 15 years, and yet this is the first in over a decade that understands this character, in large part making close to the comic books (I haven't read them religiously, but it seems to follow pretty close to the Ultimate run at the least, if not others). I don't know if every action scene is terribly original, but every one has massive stakes for Parker, and yet at the same time they're not the usual apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenarios that sometimes can make a super-hero movie feel too big, even if the stakes are still strong. Everything is down to the personal here with Parker, and even more than the Raimi movies these get right the high school, awkward teenager part of Parker down pat.Now, was this all even necessary? I don't know, and that may be cause for debate among people for a long time. I got to look at what's put in front of me to say whether it works or not as its own thing; the previous try by Sony to get Spider-Man back into theaters after getting rid of Raimi, Amazing Spider-Man, felt tired and had its moments amid a very spotty story. I'm not even sure if it's necessarily that Marvel Studios *solely* could have brought Parker et al back, or then some, to former glory, but I think with Civil War being the dipping of the toes into the pool and this being the big dive and 1000-meter lap, that they got it right as they could. It all comes down to what makes any of these gigantic corporate products work, regardless of if it's Marvel or DC or whoever: are the actors convincing enough to bring the characters to life, and does the writing do right by them with a story that makes sense and characters that give them something to do? Holland found just the right note in Civil War as like a half of the time innocent-looking puppy of a teenager, the kind that we almost don't want to see get hurt, vulnerable and caring and showing the conflicts so perfectly that Parker has to deal with everyday in his balance as just a regular kid in extraordinary circumstances... but, other half of the time, he can certainly mouth-off and be convincing in that way that Spider-Man just was int the comics (that doesn't mean the comics are sacrosanct or anything, that they *had* to do that to get it right, it's merely to point that this Parker is a wise-ass but funny as hell at doing it, even down to a moment in a montage early on when he stops a guy stealing a bike). Meanwhile, the writers give Parker a best-friend/comic relief, a tired trope that feels totally revitalized here because a) the kid he's paired with is wonderfully dead-pan and yet excitable (kudos to Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds getting it right), and b) he proves himself useful... maybe oddly, a lot, conveniently useful for a teenager, but I can suspend disbelief for a little while.And then there's Keaton; is he used properly, given how damn talented he is? Yes, but only up to a point. There's some moments, like a very tense exchange with the hero in a car, that have a crisp intensity that Keaton can just turn on as if it's nothing. Other times, he's having to work more in what the plot requires, and under his Vulture get-up - obviously, without question, right, a meta-comment in an ironic way regarding BIRDMAN - we don't get to see as much of it. It's in the third act he gets to flex his chops the most, without saying exactly why it's a wonderful twist that we don't see coming but makes sense. Even when he is in the midst of certain story continuity things (an 8 year jump is a bit odd, but again, we try to let it go on q first watch), he is... Michael Keaton. He's a lot of fun to watch.It's hard I think for me to fully analyze this right away as some profound work of art that may have more depth that needs a dive in. That may be all good now for the Raimi movies, but that's looking back over a decade. This is still too fresh, and the only thing I can say is that the writing of the story if 90% of it all tight and gives Parker and Spider-Man a solid, if a little predictable, arc as far as his hero's journey, and the dialog is consistently comedic. I found myself laughing far more than in any previous Spider-Man entry, and that's the key to its success: it knows it's silly in a way, or at least Parker recognizes it, and while the MCU is known for doing that (this year with GotG most of all), this feels even sillier. It knows it. We are let in on the fun. Despite any nitpicks and misgivings, and there are more I won't mention (one involving a character reveal that is right out of, of all things, Dark Knight Rises), it's among the better summer blockbusters in years because of that. 8.5/10",8,17,29,8 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick takes a whack at comedy- and the cold war
","Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie he does, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and best dark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones (who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). It turns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting by Peter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facial expressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast of crazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these being the incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. It contains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption and pig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all in those with the most power. It's almost worth it just for the opening credits and end sequence with 'we'll meet again'.",10,108,190,13 February 2000
The Beach," Good drama
","Danny Boyle's The Beach is well done because it showcases a pacifist anarchist society (to me that means that its a society that gets along and does whatever they want to do) enclosed in a beautiful beach.  It shows what happens in the society, how paradise can be achieved, and how Leonardo DiCaprio is OK after all.  DiCaprio gives his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and though I have never been much of a fan of DiCaprio's (AT ALL) I found his teaming up with Trainspotting director Boyle was a good bet.  With a slick cameo by Robert Carlyle, this film gets good in my book by skipping all the drama Titanc had, and going straight to the good old fashioned crazy drama.",4,15,34,8 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Not the best, but still fun
","Return of the Jedi is the last of the series (episode 6) and it may not be the best of the series, but like the other films, it still is all in good fun (and the Flash Gordon matinae serials).  The story brings Luke Skywalker to confront his father for the second time with Emperor Palpatine helping along.  Also, a group of freedom fighters (led by Han Solo), try to shut down a power base on the moon Endor that is controling the second Death Star.  By the way, don't forget the first half hour of the movie which shows the gang freeing Han from Jabba the Hutt.  This story is just the beginning of a fun, entertaining and important film that goes just right with the other six (or three) sagas.",8,4,12,21 February 2000
The Expendables," for a dumb, 80's-inspired ULTRA-violent action movie... it could be better
","You'll get what you expect when you go see The Expendables. It's just one of those movies: if you're expecting it to be a non-stop action extravaganza with (almost) every big action dude, large or small, from the past thirty years, you'd get that, but if you're expecting it to be a big steaming pile of stupid action movie-ness taking from the dumbest of 80's action movies (at least in 'plot'), you'll get that. For me, and I don't think I'm entirely alone- you may think different looking at the message board and whatnot online, but just look closer- it's in the middle. It's neither a triumph nor a failure. It has such a cast that it makes it impossible to dislike, if only on guilty pleasure grounds. But it also doesn't really have the kind of gusto to take its BIG status and do something really interesting with it.The Expendables rides on its mega-action, which includes much ULTRA-violence, but really the people who will be most psyched will be those wanting to see the cast blow ***t up real good. There is some of that... maybe TOO much of that, but hey, what can you do when Rambo: First Blood Part 2 and Commando are the main influences. But the movie, as enjoyable as it can be, has its share of problems. For one thing, the villain(s) can't rise to the occasion. One of them, Eric Roberts, is a slimy guy who can't grow poppy on the ground that the General/Dictator of a small island in the Gulf controls- that other guy (David Zayas of Dexter) is also a kind of good-bad guy. You get the sense if the Expendables didn't come back to kick ass and, uh, kick more ass and blow ***t up real good, the two villains would take care of themselves, regardless of the factor of the General/Dictator's daughter.But yeah, cardboard plot: Expendables get assigned to take out a General on an island, his daughter is the contact, they get spotted and need to leave, she stays, Stallone feels guilt leaving her behind, brings back the guys to get her back. Beat for beat, this is just the story, with a few surprise appearances (Schwarzenegger, Willis) - that is, if you haven't seen the torrent of TV commercials that hype up Ah-nuld to be the main star with Stallone, when it's simply a walk-on. Sadly, his scene is one of the highlights in an otherwise decent but lacking action picture. There is bang for the buck, but it's such a cartoonish-numbing buck. The combination of drama and action that one saw so strong, at one time, in Rocky or First Blood, is much more diluted, much more concerned with such frenetic action - to the point, I should add, that it dulls the senses. The fast editing is far from the kind of pacing, yes, from even those 80's action movies. It's more Bourne than Cobra.Again, the actors, when they're effective, do do what they can. Dolph Lundgren, of all people, gets to shine in a character that, as written, is kind of confused as to his allegiance. Mickey Rourke gets a couple of great scenes, even if he doesn't get full camera-eye-line. But for the most part other supporting actor people, like Terry Crews, who one has really admired as of late, get only a few moments here and there. Oddly enough Stallone's character is given the least to do, except to sort of reprise his last conflict in 2008-Rambo (going back to save the girl, yada-yada). Statham has a quirk with his girl, and Jet Li is short. Randy Couture (yeah, does okay with little as the one least-known in the cast) has some ear tick. And Stone Cold Steve Austin (yes, Stone Cold) is just a heavy.I really did go into the Expendables hoping to have a good time. Up to a point, I did. I had some laughs. I felt like cheering once or twice. Other times I just got annoyed by, oddly enough for a movie assuming to be ambitious with its cast, how lax it is. Its one big BANG is to keep the violence and explosions going for twenty minutes at the end. Dumb action movie violence is dandy, even if it's repetitive and unimaginative after so long (hey, again the 80's). However, bad CGI blood plus bad editing plus no plot and dialog that is just barely puncho and overly macho, turns into something that is kind of unpleasant. It met somewhat the expectations, and at the same time I wonder how long it will linger in the mind. 5.5/10",5,7,14,21 August 2010
Scary Movie 2," Recycled jokes, but good ones
","Keenan Ivory Wayans' Scary Movie 2, a somewhat pale sequel to it's predecesor triumph Scary Movie, has some of the old characters back in a story resembling the Haunting and other spooky haunted house pictures.  
As far as gags go, once again the film dishes out lurid and often distasteful (however quite funny) batches of them.  Some are actually ones that were used in the last film (I guess Miramax thought you can't go wrong with semen and genitals), but while some might say that's a bad thing, I guess if the shoe fits, and can make you cringe as well, it's good.  Worthy summer gross out comedy, although not as potent as the original.  The best scenes- the first exorcist scene with James Woods and Andy Richter as the old priest and young priest, and the Beetlejuice in the brain gag.

MASH," clever in some ways, with a formidable cast, but it doesn't hold up as well for me as others
","I have to credit Robert Altman's breakthrough film MASH for at least one thing- it's one of the few films from the 70's to look at those in war not as overly anxious and gung-ho military types, but average shlubs working a particular kind of job. In this world of the military medical sidelines, where soldiers get the help they need after battle, the camaraderie is never too false, and the cast assembled is the first prime example of Altman's policy of casting being 80% of the job. The film is put together in a piece-meal kind of way, with about as loose a plot as dialog construction, where the sense of humor from the main male characters (i.e. Elliot Gould and Donald Sutherland) is the kind of juvenile, sarcastic humor associated with its time. This is likely the kind of film that John Landis must have seen at least a few times before making Animal House.But the problem for me, aside from the film's strength in breaking conventions and having such a varied cast (Sally Kellerman and Robert Duvall in the same movie, not to mention Tom Skerritt and Bud Cort), is in it working as a comedy. As a comedy in and of itself its just, well, alright. The humor and jokes in the film are a big step above the television show's lot that followed in the 70's (then again, I'm not a fan of the show anyway), but the attitudes of the characters, and the little understated bits that happen, miss marks of satire I would've liked to have seen. There's some of the human comedy that Altman's obviously been influenced by Renoir to showcase, yet I wasn't laughing at it as much as paying attention to what the conversations were going on. It's a kind of high-brow/low-brow concoction that has its moments, and then does not at the same time. Perhaps I was expecting a little more than I ended up getting from the Golden Palm winneing, smash-hit film that jump-started the prolific director's career. And it is a good movie, no argument about that, it's got fun and shenanigans and a winning cast, and it has been created and performed enough skill and enjoyment that marks as important for all the actors involved. I just don't think it's a masterpiece.",7,6,11,24 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," One of the best fairy tales for adults I've ever seen
","Guillermo Del-Toro goes into full bloom with a real feat of cinematic strength with Pan's Labyrinth, the kind of film that builds more and more with momentum until one's left in a total engrossment in the storytelling and the fates of the characters (mainly the little girl of the story, Ivana Baquero's Ofelia). Del-Toro knows that since his movie is mainly more for adults than the kids (I wouldn't not recommend it to kids, but the younger ones would definitely get freaked out by the more gruesomely violent moments), it should really be provocative by way of showing how a child has no other choice but to go into the realm of one's fantasies. But on further introspection about the movie, what makes it even more fascinating is how, in a strange way, it's not escapism in the sense that the girl retreats to the dreamworld. If anything the dreamworld retreats to her, or rather each side of fantasy and reality have an equal pertinence here, unlike another film from this past year, the (underlooked) Terry Gilliam film Tideland, where a little girl also had to escape under no other recourse to which it transformed her own world-view to a great degree. Pan's Labyrinth blends together a unique form of magical realism that grows more potent and aborbing on a repeat viewing, and it's actually stronger by showing how the fantastical can be contrasted with what's really terrifying and cruel in the world.In this case it comes in the form of fascism and a kind of rule-by-law/fear, and in the form of the little girl's step-father, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, formerly of With a Friend Like Harry). His is one of the great antagonist performances I've seen in recent memory, though mostly because of Del-Toro making him such a force of domination and cruelty on anyone who doesn't fit into his obedience and world-view. He and his troops are facing off against the rebels in the area circa 1940s Franco-run Spain, and has no tolerance for anyone in his midst who won't go under his form of justice (there's an immediate form of repulsion by what he does, graphically, to father and son peasants who only were in the woods after rabbits). The stakes become raised, however, when his troops capture one of the rebels alive, and after torture, there's recognition among some of the caretakers in his home, like the good doctor- who is there really to take care of the Captain's very pregnant wife and mother of Ofelia- and the head maid of the household (the great Maribel Verdu as Mercedes), and suddenly Ofelia finds herself pit against this man that she could never stand to begin with, but now sees as a true threat to what she has to accomplish.And what she has to accomplish is the more fantastical portion of the picture, a very strange but completely illuminating set of scenes where we find that Ofelia really has the spirit of an underworld princess in her, and a faun (er, 'Pan'), gets her to complete tasks in order to set the spirit free. But in the face of the Captain, and her own mother's weakened spirit (which leads to a very sad state of affairs), it becomes the greatest struggle of Ofelia's life, and all in the midst of a political conflict settled in this environment with guns and overwrought bloodshed that she couldn't even begin to understand. Hence, the escapism. But part of the greatness in Pan's Labyrinth- aside from the tremendous technical accomplishments on all fronts (cinematography, production and creature design, special/visual effects, the attention to detail with both the historical and more fairy-tale aspects)- is that we really care about Ofelia's struggle, as she's really in a dire situation when she has to snap back from her time with the insects/fairies and meetings with the faun. Through the bleakness that surrounds her, one can see how the fantasy is not just a sweet desire, but a necessity in youth- however one might want it as an adult as well.Filled with heart and ideas, a climax that really becomes moving and captivating without becoming too sentimental, and with some individual scenes that rank with the best in the decade (Lopez's scene where he stitches back his own face- and then takes a drink of alcohol- is priceless, ditto for when Ofelia has to get the dagger from the banquet hall), this is a real marvel of 'magical realism', as it's been dubbed, and is surely Del-Toro's triumph so far as a filmmaker (and, like Gilliam, visionary to boot).",10,6,13,5 January 2007
Blade II," A sequel that does everything in it's power to top the original and it comes to being as good.
","Blade 2 takes what made the first Blade film good and transforms it into a different country with different characters (outside of Blade and Whistler) and a possibly deeper feel, and it works without going into the bad sequel range.This time, the vampires Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been hunting down for so many years want to make a truce so that he can help them kill a new breed of monsters called reapers, which if you want a brief description are creatures that look like half vampires half zombies and half, whatever, with a chin that opens up a big damn mouth that before attacking it's prey could resemble a mini-sarlac pit (star wars reference).  Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong.Overall, Blade 2, for the fans of the first one, will not dissapoint them. It contains enough imaginativeness and gore effects to brighten the most down of horror film and comic book enthusiasts.  The film also contains some of the best makeup I've seen in a while in a horror movie. A-",8,60,102,22 March 2002
Knocked Up," a guide to having a baby, with stoners, and E! news
","My first reaction at the end of the film was probably too simplistic a comparison: Harold and Kumar meets Nine Months (yes, the Hugh Grant/Julianne Moore pregnancy comedy from 95). But the film actually carries off how so few romantic comedies know how- to actually give us a man and a woman to actually give a damn about. More than that, Apatow has matched extraordinarily well the shlubby but funny and down-to-earth skills of Seth Rogan with the vibrant, uncertain but ultimately believably conflicted personality in Katherine Heigl. It's a tough sell with it's premise, to be sure, that a very attractive E! news reporter like Allison (Heigl) and a total stoner almost-bum like Ben (Rogan) could hook up over less than 12 hours and suddenly procreate, but there you have it. It's a premise that actually had me avoiding the film, even with the immense hype from critics as well as friends and family, because the footage shown in the trailer didn't seem to be that much to write home about.The actual finished product, however, is certainly the funniest American movie out so far in 2007, pointed at the age variant of around 18 to, um, 37 maybe, with all of the supporting characters, as well as Rogan and co-star Paul Rudd as Heigel's brother-in-law via sister played by Leslie Mann, very sharp with levels of sarcastic wit and pop-culture references. At the same time Apatow gets some really amazing one-liners regarding Ben's friends joking on each other (the bearded guy provides the most fodder, but the general attitude is 'hey, f*** it, lets get stoned'), but doesn't lose track of what he's trying to do, successfully. He's out to criticize as well as embrace a culture where responsibility for one's self has to do with how the other in the relationship is comfortable or dissatisfied with the other. And Apatow makes the Rudd/Mann relationship a kind of bittersweet (much more bitter really) counterpoint to the rocky start to Ben and Allison's 'shot-gun' romance.There's silly one liners ('I live in your phone!'), goofy caricatures (the gynecologists), smart aleck kids who know a lot of 'bad' words that provides for some wicked laughs, and the usual mayhem in the delivery room an actual winner in terms of making it partly true and partly farce (albeit Judd doesn't seem to understand, despite having three kids, what a woman is like *throughout* the labor process, as reconciliations don't usually happen aside from script contrivances). Yet all the while, it's a sincere film, with the relationships shown not as cardboard cut-outs but where the people actually have to deal, if eventually, with the lots in life they've got themselves into. What is it to balance love and commitment, Apatow is asking. There's even one shot that provides a note of discomfort with the characters of Ben and Allison as they have a bad argument in the car, the view being outside of the car in traffic, a distance kept because, and it's a credit to Apatow as a storyteller, we do care about what will happen in this situation.In fact, that's probably one of the best things to say about Knocked Up. Too often in movies, especially of the cineplex fare, the situation is more-so told than an actual story. This is one of those rare cases where the situation, a tricky one to surpass as it's been done (the 'situation' of pregnancy, not so much the one-nite-stand part), unfolds more as a story, and by the time the 'happy' ending comes, it's not a cop-out or cheat. And this goes without saying that the actors, as well as the filmmaker, are totally assured with their comic skills, be they subtle (the dazed look of the bearded 'Martin Scorsese on cocaine' friend, even Rudd to a degree can be staggeringly subtle), or big (the 'second' sex scene between the main couple). Quite simply, it's THE rom-com sleeper of the past few years.",9,3,9,6 June 2007
Alien," Well,
","Ridley Scott's Alien is good, but to be honest, I found the sequel a tad better (James Cameron knows how to give fun).  This first enstallment in the Alien saga is quite creepy.  In this original (one good thing is the original though inspired by It! the Terror Beyond Space) tale, a group is summoned to a planet by a distress signal and a creature comes on board that starts to kill off the crew one by one.  As a thriller, this film only packs it in small doses, unlike its sequel.  But, as a sci-fi epic that tries to grab us with memorable scenes (alien out of stomach is my fav) it works. Scott makes a good effort here, but it can't be helped by It's acting, just by it's amazing (for it's time) effects and Alien design (famous HR Giger provided).  A",10,1,9,28 April 2000
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," about the juiciest, bloodiest good/sad musical time you'll have this year
","With Sweeney Todd, one of the most notorious (and acclaimed) stories to come out of 19th century London England, and later as a much more acclaimed musical from Stephen Soundheim, Tim Burton crafts a masterpiece of the macabre, a work full of harsh, visceral drama, a sinister look to the picture which only once or twice takes an escape to brighter (more elusive) pastures, and even pitch-black humor, the kind that isn't fit for the gallows but a slice of a razor to a horrible demise at the meat-grinder. It's also a sad film, a deep sorrow that pulses in nearly every frame that Johnny Depp occupies as Benjamin Barker-turned-Sweeney Todd which pervades the wretched vengeance that he seeks following his inexcusable detachment from his wife and daughter via Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Burton here, more than ever I might wager, deals with punishment and evil, as well as what it means to be an anti-hero (if one could call a 'Demon Barber' as such), and as well what a real cold-blooded villain is.The latter might be considered, more-so than Mr. T, in the form of Mrs. Lovett, who runs the place below where Mr. Barker used to run his barbershop, featuring the 'Worst Meat-Pies in London.' Following a savage, quick death of a character, she comes up with the idea to hide the body, and thus also continue a lucrative profit- take the bodies that Todd slices open whilst getting their shave, and grinding them into meat pies for a whole new cult of a crowd, who end up flocking to for such bloody-good (some pun intended) culinary delights. Meantime there's a subplot involving the Judge, Todd's long lost daughter Joanna, and a young man who has fallen in love with her- and her with him- from behind the prison of her betrothed. And there's also a child, Toby (talented young Ed Sanders), who becomes quasi-orphaned and starts to work at the meat-pie establishment. Innocence, of course, is something so fragile it can break in an instant.Almost 80% of the film, I should mention, is sung by the actors. And while not in a kind of complete and utter show-stopping manner that is more common for Broadway, they take the completely superb songs, devilish, pondering, contemplating, scheming, and full of longing (there's much more in the lyrics than one would expect) and make them their own. It's a given the young Joanna and Anthony get the conventional song of young, forbidden love, but aside from that Soundheim breaks open the vein, so to speak, of the melodrama inherent in a horror story like the one here. There's even a bleak streak of humor to the proceedings, be it an extended song that distracts Pirelli (perfect comic timing by Sascha Baron Cohen as an Italian with a secret), or the juxtaposition of Todd's various killings and a touching tune, or just Mrs. Lovett's descriptions of which people to take for the kill. With music and word Soundheim's tale of tragic mayhem is not without a whole lot of entertainment value, more than one not familiar with the stage version would expect. I tapped my fingers whilst blood flowed and dark looks gleamed through the dark color palette.Now, taking into account Burton's knack at surprise (and precise) casting choices- Depp exceeds greatly in his first musical role, giving moments of subtly in just the deadened expression on his eyes while his two-dimensional frame consumes him; Carter has the best role to fill in the main lot of characters, as someone seemingly pleasant in her dirty Dickens way but also far more evil than she'll let on; Rickman, for ever little word he utters, is savage in having whatever he can by hook or by crook- it should be noted how superlative Burton matches technique with the source material. It's such good directing where, as with Nightmare Before Christmas (only here arguably more operatic), we get wrapped up in what should be an escapist experience of a musical with vast sets and beautifully grungy 19th century costumes and (typically) Gothic makeup. It's a twisted time and place of the slums of London, and Burton and his DP supplant that look of despair, where we'll see for an instant (satirically of course) a look at paradise on a beach in the future, or a glimpse into the past. But there's also a fully rounded human experience going on too, where it all fits in the context where it's set: realistic it isn't entirely, but everything emotionally feels on-target.One more note of the obvious, if you've already heard from critics: it contains the most graphic bloodshed of any musical I've ever seen, or even in Burton's oeuvre (and this is from countless beheaded folk in Sleepy Hollow talking). It flows as if Alexander de Large from Clockwork Orange were in charge of special neck F/X. And it's certainly not for the kiddies who flocked to Charlie and the Cholocate Factory or Pee Wee. Sweeney Todd is gruesome, but with a purpose: Burton and Soundheim have made a testament to the inescapable wrath of vengeance unyielded, where figures from the past, no matter how close, will get in the path of destruction, and terror is always up behind you, cleaning your face, giving one quick swipe as if by catharsis. I loved it.",10,12,21,25 December 2007
Blades of Glory," a comedy working from used parts, never gets off the tracks of being just a ludicrously stupid farce
","Blades of Glory is in part a spoof on the trashy romantic ice-skating drama The Cutting Edge, only this time playing off more-so on the homosexual subtexts of men in ice skating and in the utter lack of shame in Will Ferrell. It also co-stars Jon Heder, but aside from one or two big moments (like his scene in the toilet stall, or in some of his happy-go-lucky bits of dialog) it's really Ferrell's show here as comic impresario. Somehow, Ferrell's shtick doesn't get too tiresome, at least just yet, because of how much effort he puts into being a stupid louse. But a stupid louse that has a level of intelligence, because as one could see from past Ferrell movies his level of comic timing, with the emphasis on the immature and the inane in verbal terms as well as on top of the physical stuff (just seeing his body is a crack-up, especially here with his multiple tattoos), it somehow works for the end goal of the filmmakers. There's so many goofy bits here that one may overlook how anything story-wise has been used more times than I'd care to think about with sports movies- which is part of the point of the lampooning.Ferrell and Heder are competitive ice-skaters, banned due to a fight during their equal gold-medal awards, and only get back into the competitions by going as a duo, which raises some obvious eyebrows. Then there's the whole rift between the dastardly brother/sister team (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), the grueling training sessions where their trainer (an underrated comic actor in Craig T Nelson) prompts them on impossible North Korean skating moves of death, and a love interest in an assistant/sibling to the villains for Heder's character. Nothing to get excited about on that front, the actors then base everything for laughs on attitude (how the skaters do their 'acts' during skating), facial expressions (Ferrell drunk during the kiddie ice-skating show), the go-for-broke gay jokes at the expense of the stars (an Aerosmith song has been rarely used to such an effect), and just other off-the-wall humor. It's all very obvious, but the wink and the nod doesn't disappoint. It might for some; by now Ferrell's been in more than one sport-spoof, and he's likely to be in more of them. But it also allows for him, as well as Heder and others, some ample comic opportunities. One of the funniest bits for my money is in a chase on skates between Arnet and Ferrell that leads them to the arena- but still on skates.It's goofiness completely for the sake of the audience, and though it doesn't spark up really remarkable comedy moments like in Anchorman and Talladega Nights, it's good to take the edge off on a Sunday afternoon; it's the kind of comedy that will work best with a bunch of friends anticipating that within the PG-13 range anything goes.",7,4,8,1 April 2007
The Doors," 'Nothing to touch the earth, not to see the sun, nothing left to do but run, run, run, let's run.'
","This is just a sampling of the lyrics that singer/writer Jim Morrison contributed to his group The Doors, and just this, as part of his epic piece 'The Celebration of the Lizard' shows his skill as a master of the written word. He is shown in Oliver Stone's The Doors as a shy, though often obnoxious and crude, persona who self describes himself in one scene: 'I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being, but with the soul of a clown that forces me to blow it at the most crucial of moments.' He may have blown it in the end, but it makes for a fascinating story.As being a Doors fan, the music and words are the best character of the movie- the songs represent feelings and emotions, desires and hatreds, and other facets of life in the late 60's, are indispensable gems of rock and blues. While the Doors recorded only six albums together (not counting American Prayer, Morrison's awesome feat of an album) each one is still transfixed into the minds of people all over the world. It's thirty-two years since the king died, but in another thirty-two he will still be remembered. And that is a fact that Stone plays with like Travis Bickle in front of the mirror with his guns in Taxi Driver. He reveals only Morrison's known persona, and not the quiet moments. The concert recreations are grand, but there isn't more of the sweet Jim (one glimpse of such a Jim is seen at a birthday party when he gives out gifts as 'Chief Mojo Risin)What is shown is splendid enough for his abilities- he paints a vivid picture of Los Angeles 1965 onward, with Val Kilmer in the second best acting job of 1991 (deserved of an Oscar nomination), and puts Jim in the middle. He is a man who is fascinated with death, with man's wills to power, and how life gets painful without the chemicals top open the mind. Kilmer gets so much into your head in this film that by the end you'll love him, hate him, or feel wonder about him. I felt wonder about him, wonder why he looked to heroes who gave him such ideas about the love of death, wonder why he felt the need to take it to the limits. But his desires are Stone's as well, and while this isn't a perfect film, it's one that isn't easily forgotten. A+",10,53,77,26 April 2003
The Polar Express," a little creepy in some unexpected ways, though should be a delight for kids
","Maybe seeing The Polar Express would benefit from seeing it again on a big IMAX screen like Robert Zemeckis intended (it's been playing steadily the past few years in limited holiday IMAX runs with good results). But this isn't, if memory serves me, really one of his best films. It does contain that cheerful, strange holiday spirit that's associated with many seminal works (and like Christmas Carol there is a level of much needed darkness, like with the side-character the hero boy runs into on the train who looks like he's been slumming it in coal). There's even some suspense thrown in for good measure at times, like when the polar express comes into the city, but meanwhile our main kid characters are going underground and trying to find another way out to get to all the excitement up above. And it's a daunting task from Zemeckis and Hanks to pull all this off anyway, so as a technical marvel of animation and innovation it stands right alongside Who Framed Roger Rabbit as a grand achievement. But I'd be lying if I thought it wasn't just a wee bit creepy too.The motion-capture technique which makes up the spine of the picture is sometimes stilted and a little, um, just weird for me, though maybe some kids will gravitate to it more than I. The songs are also a downer, as high-flying as they get in spots (the conductors' song on the train), seeing Steven Tyler was painful in this situation, and the sappy song thrown in at one point reminded me of the lesser songs I heard in animated movies as a kid. And yet, even with the problems I had with the Polar Express, it achieves what it sets out to do with enough confidence to make it a 'treat for the family', as the cliché goes, and may attract them even more than I or repel them even more-so. It has its moments of ingenuity, and a great chase bit on the train involving lots of ice on the tracks. That it's less than the sum of its parts isn't unimaginable either.",6,2,4,12 February 2007
Malcolm X," superior craftsmanship, Washington's performance, and a sobering mixture of history and drama
","Malcolm X is many things to many people, but one can never say he didn't make a significant mark on his time and for 'his' people, as he and the Nation of Islam defined it. But 'his' was contingent on his religion, his experience growing up and being an 'Afro-American' in the United States, and as it turned out it was not set in stone. What Spike Lee's film does so compellingly is shine light on the history of the man and his place in a country with one of the most disturbing, racist histories in the world, and not make it too dogmatic or beyond reproach. On the contrary, this is one of Lee's most commercial works, made in epic form and imbued with his style at the top of his game. Only Do the Right Thing, in terms of his non-documentary features, tops this for sheer directorial virtuosity and intelligence with the subject matter.How much it sticks true to the autobiography of Malcolm X (as told to Alex Haley) I can't say yet, having not read the book. But for what it's worth, on its own terms, Lee crafts his story with the grandiosity appropriate to the character and the circumstances. Malcolm (Washington) is born to a religious man, but one who's killed by white people. He's denied his dream of being a lawyer and forced into labor. He becomes a criminal and is sentenced to 10 years for multiple counts of theft. And then in prison is changed around by Baines (Albert Hall), who converts him to the Nation of Islam and its teachings. It's mind-opening because, for the first time for him, his perception comes clearer than ever regarding the black experience- and what are really their rights, which have been few since the abolishment of slavery- and he becomes the big cultural figure he's remembered as.Even if one doesn't agree with all of the philosophy and speeches from Malcolm- and it's not hard to see why Malcolm had so many enemies, even from his own fold- it absorbs one not terribly familiar with what he was about in thought and practice and deed, and it gets the audience thinking one way or another about the nature of racism and race and separation in America. And past all that, it's directed with nerve and pizazz, while not going too far off into avant-garde. For all of Lee's success here as a storyteller, it wouldn't be quite the same without the star; oddly enough once he's off the screen- for the final ten minutes which becomes a long eulogy that drags on longer than necessary in nearing pomposity- it doesn't work as well. Every moment he's on camera, whether in the early years in Boston and Harlem as a thug or as X himself in full public figure mode on stage and behind closed doors, it's a reminder why he's the star he is. It's simply one of his very best performances, full of subtlety and wit and bigger-than-life bravura moments that usually (though not this time get Oscars.It's a period piece, it's a history lesson, it's a biography, and a testament to the possibility for a person to change. But above all else, Malcolm X works as a movie, and it's watchable in that big-movie-event kind of way without the usual drawbacks.",10,7,15,30 July 2008
Black Mass," Depp is scary (and scary great) in this mostly-ensemble crime drama
","There's a scene in Black Mass where James Bulger (aka Whitey, though you just call him Jimmy, of course) wants to find out what's wrong with John Connolly's wife. He's over for dinner and she's upstairs the whole time, supposedly not feeling well (in reality, she hates his guts, and is growingly resentful of her husband for associating with him). He goes up the stairs and knocks on her door - she's reading The Exorcist, by the way, probably unintentionally getting her in the mood for something frightening - and she opens to door to Jimmy. He touches John's wife's face, holds her neck (or, rather, just barely misses choking her) in checking to see if she's warm or hot or whatever. And it's in a moment like this, not the only one but clear as day, that Depp's performance as Bulger turns into something out of a horror movie: his Bulger is scary as f***, and what's most scary is the seeming lack of anything human outside of the darkness of the soul.It doesn't happen like that form the start, however; Bulger's darkness deepens as the film goes on - in this version of events, going from about 1975 to maybe the mid 90's or the late 80's - due to the deaths of two of his family members. One of them hits him harder than the other, but with each one he smiles less and less (as one of the informants being interviewed - one of the connecting glues of the narrative is the voice-over testimony of those who built up the Bulger case, only the IRA makes him happy), and he even has the look of Nosferatu. The contact lenses, the flaky white skin, the hair pulled back - this is Depp immersing himself and creating a different kind of crime lord.While he starts off as a guy we've seen in other movies, as the man who won't take s*** from any low-lifes and has no compunction about beating a guy's head in or shooting a man in broad daylight in a parking lot, somehow his presence grows more ominous in Black Mass. Even the title evokes something that Mario Bava might've made in the 1960's, with only a vague connection to religion. To put it another way, at one point he's lying back, resting with his eyes closed, and his arms and hands over his chest give the impression of a vampire inside of a coffin.This is a crime epic, however, so he is not the only character of note. On the contrary, it may actually be more FBI agent John Connolly's story, here played by Joel Edgerton, as he is the one who is really having to give some more subtle acting here. OK, maybe not all the time - it's often a nervous, forceful performance, and Edgerton, as he's shown in Great Gatsby and (the best parts of) Exodus, has that to spare - but he is a person who starts off trying to use a connection to his advantage. He's know Bulger, and his brother (a local politician played by Cumberbatch), since they were kids, and there's a kind of street-level-South-Boston loyalty there. Also the fact of, you know, not wanting to p-off a volcanic force like Whitey Bulger. So an 'alliance' is made (not to be confused, were told more than once by Connolly, of 'informant'-like procedure) and a plan is hatched that his department reluctantly agrees to: Bulger gives the FBI info on Italian mob gangs and families, they leave Bulger alone.It's certain the filmmakers had to leave some details out - it's a two hour film covering decades of criminal activity and rocky investigations - and there are one or two moments things get conflated for dramatic effect, like when Kevin Bacon's FBI chief is about to throw out the whole case and at this exact moment a wire-tap with crucial information on the Italians comes through. But what's impressive to me about Black Mass is that director Scott Cooper and his writers are able to make a possibly convoluted story accessible and exciting and absorbing; only a section in the middle, about a scheme involving Jai-Alai, needs some close attention paid (and even there the presence of Peter Sarsgaard as a drug-addled killer makes things pop and entertaining). But with Connolly, there's an emotional core and conflict that helps to offset the hellish backdrop that comes with Bulger; do we feel sorry for this man, or perhaps enjoy his downfall, which we know will come? Edgerton makes him a little more sympathetic, or just understandable in his actions, than if it had been by another actor, though he's one of a piece of what makes the film work well.Black Mass, with its brutal killings and violence and deaths that come not unexpectedly but not less in a grisly style, doesn't reach greatness overall, but there's a lot of great things that come about it, individual scenes. Watch as Jimmy and his girlfriend argue as to what to do about their son (Dakota Johnson in a small but pivotal performance, like, good God she can act THIS well), or how Bulger taunts an impressionable Agent Moore at a table with a 'joke' over a family secret recipe. Depp is acting his tail off here - surely his best work since Sweeney Todd - but the rest of the cast is so strong that most of the conventional elements or directing decisions can be overlooked. 7.5/10",7,2,7,1 October 2015
Closer," the acting, writing, and direction are creative, skilled, cold as ice picks
","Closer is a British-American relationship drama about people that really are not too likable, but that it is part of what might be a kind of working thesis for the film should be taken into account. The four principles- Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen- are like amalgamations of all of the lesser characteristics of those in post-modern relationship plays and films, where the love and goodness in them is subdued under their lack of connections to one another. That it all doesn't work as well as, for prime example, Nichol's own Carnal Knowledge, may be because of the script more than anything. What is successful from Marber's work- of showing four characters who find what they are looking for, then go into complete and utter disillusionment- it really has to walk a fine line of having these people talking truthfully, honestly not just in the context of their characters but how MOST people do talk in relationships. Sometimes its quite believable, and sometimes not, and when it's not the script lends itself more to the basis of 'hip' language, like Kevin Smith if he substituted pop-culture references for rough innuendo and hurt. It's a hit or miss script from a play that may or may not have been better for the stage where it's necessarily a dialog-driven medium. And because of the time lapses and twists and turns given to the characters over the course of however many years pass in the film, it's as much worth to do for the filmmakers as it is a possible liability.This all being said, Nichols does give all four characters the proper actors for what they're required for. Even the lesser two of the four (from my point of view), Roberts and Law, have little fascinating moments amid their shallow and flawed sides (and this is from someone who can hardly stand most Roberts movies). Owen, meanwhile, is so good and precise and with flair and directness that it does practically impede on the others to keep up with how much he's into his character's cold, reaching psychology. Portman is actually just as good though, and proves once again her stamina for dramatic scenes, and even for the steamier ones; the scene in the strip club between Owen and Portman is probably the best 'sexy' kind of scene the actors and Nichols have been involved with. As all four reach into a revelatory- and if you're looking into it almost obvious- conclusion, one has to admire the depths that are being plunged here, however lacking some of the more darker realities of the world. It's a story of affluent, ranging middle-class types who are far from stupid, but also have some harsh problems with one another when seeming to have what they want. It doesn't have the exemplary power and theatrical grace of a Bergman theatrical drama, but it is a nifty example on its own for those very familiar with the actors. One more thing, the opening and end credits song, for lack of a better word, comes close to killing the mood big time for me. 7.5/10",7,3,4,18 June 2006
Suicide Squad," a barely fresh 'Tomato', but fresh nonetheless (READ the review first please!)
","Call it the Rule of Very Low Expectations, but by this rule I had a good time with this movie. It's not the Fantastic Four level disaster you've heard. Is it nihilistic? A little, though not anywhere near some other films this year (not to say it's as good as those, i.e. Deadpool), and the fact that this was green-lit and conceived in the shadow of Guardians of the Galaxy is painfully obvious (i.e. Killer Croc = Groot, more or less). But David Ayer as a director AND writer, coming from a gnarly, south LA cops-and-criminals kind of cinematic background (remember his breakthrough was Training Day), creates his own playground to work in, and though Batman from the Goddamn Synder-verse appears it's really his own making this time - it's a colorful film to look at (not as 'artistic' as the other neon film by Refn, but close), and while it's an ensemble it gets two really fantastic actors and anti-hero/villain characters: Deadshot (Will Smith, in the best I've seen him in almost ten years, fully entertaining in his Will Smith but grungier, more cynical, and he is fully acting here and giving it his all even when the script lets him down), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robibie, who I assume was created because she's one of those people the camera just loves, and she loves this character and it shows).They're the driving force here amid a group of motley characters and actors - some better than others, i.e. it was impossible not to think of Jai Courtney, having fun much as he is, as a discount Tom Hardy since he dropped out of the role, and Jay Hernandez who brings a lot to a character that is basically Fire Hulk - and that helps when it becomes clear that when this Squad that's been assembled, with a mostly entertaining series of backstories in the opening act, are put into a fairly generic and problematic plot that climaxes with (uh, spoilers?) the actual homage to Ghostbusters 84 for this summer(!) I think if I looked at the disappointments to have with the film they would be there, like how Cara Delvegine (sic) carries some real screen presence as the villain but she is just another in a long line of comic book movie villains that want to take over/destroy the world for mystifying-stupid reasons, and the Joker is surprisingly completely ancillary to the plot (and Leto makes me pine for Ledger's good but overrated performance as the Joker - like, I really miss him now he's so snarly and ugly and his-heart-isn't-in-this performance). But thinking about the movie some hours after, I find more to like about it than I don't: a lot of it comes down to the potential that is here with these characters and their powers, how they play off of one another, their energy and how they appear (Killer Croc is... NOT a CGI creation, yes, it's possible!) and how sometimes the plot flashbacks work (again with Diablo, the Jay Hernandez character, I felt Ayer coming through the most via his South LA filmmaking roots, and that's a good thing here).So I can nitpick this and it's probably a mixed bag. But I was not actively annoyed or bored - climax the one exception - and it provides its actors some strong moments to shine. It's not actively brooding or trying to be DARK in some hamfisted way that doesn't work. Its flaws are not from some terrible 'moments-driven' vision like a Snyder, nor is it talky-philosophical like a Nolan film. It's as acceptable today as it would be if it had come out circa 2002, which is about right. In other words, it's a decent dark-light refitting of the 'GotG' formula, and it's adequate! In this summer of deathly bombs and other BS that's fine.",5,4,13,4 August 2016
Battleship Potemkin," Like Citizen Kane it's almost been TOO analyzed and cherished as a landmark, but still not without good reason
","If you're a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent-film pioneers like Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as commonplace as Griffith's) and Murnau, has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted. The reason I bring up the film student part is because at some point, whether you'd like it or not, your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the 'Odessa Stairs' sequence of this film. It's hard to say if it's even the 'best' part of the film's several sequences dealing with the (at the time current) times of the Russian revolution. But it does leave the most impact, and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense, or just plain montage (The Untouchables' climax comes to mind).Montage, which was not just Eistenstein's knack but also his life's blood early in his career, is often misused in the present cinema, or if not misused then in an improper context for the story. Sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency, the passion(s), and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and place. Even if one doesn't see all of Eisenstein's narrative or traditional 'story' ideas to have much grounding (Kubrick has said this), one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns. Some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20's; it has that power like the Passion of Joan of Arc to over-pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion.Of course, one could go on for books (which have been written hundreds of times over, not the least of which by Eisenstein himself). On the film in and of itself, Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the great sequences in film, as a mutiny is plotted against the Captain and other head-ups of a certain Ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; montage is used here as well, but in spurts of energy that capture the eye. Other times Eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers grow weary without food and water. He isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story; he is, of course, very much early 20th century Russian, but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style, and that is what wins over in the end.Some may want to check it outside of film-school, as the 'Stairs' sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film, displaying the ugly side of revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the more 'accessible' silent-film directors, but if montage, detail in the frame, non-actors, and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime.",10,92,106,15 September 2005
Elf," Not a bad Christmas comedy at all, though nothing great
","Jon Favreu and Will Ferrel as a director/star combo is a good premise and execution here in Elf, as they create a film that assuredly works for the whole family.  This is because the film is as much directed towards fans of Ferrel from Saturday Night Live (which ranges with both sexes from little kids to people in their middle ages) as it is towards those looking for the holiday spirit.  Bottom line is, he makes the movie fun to watch, among a cast of well knowns (the likes of Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Artie Lange, and Andy Richter pop up, and James Caan has a better than average supporting role).  Here, Ferrel plays Buddy, a man who's grown up adopted in the North Pole.  Raised by Elves, it pains him to find out that he isn't one, and that his father didn't even make Santa's 'Nice' list this year.  He decides to seek him out in New York, and has a brief stint working in a department store, followed by the mailroom of his father's office in the Empire state building.From what I described of the plot it sounds a little routine, and it is, but there are some things in the story that are inspired, though most of the joy in the film comes from Ferrel's Buddy.  Some might take his performance as over the top or lame, however I think he finds just the right bit of gleeful un-awareness at what he does, good and not so good, and there are a few real howlers too.  Best scene- Buddy confronts the department store Santa in front of the children (this is a near draw with the scene in the recent Bad Santa where Billy Bob beats down the plastic reindeer in the store).  Only the last part of the film, the Christmas Night bit, doesn't work at all.  A nice little Christmas comedy, which can be seen after the Holidays too. B+",7,2,3,25 December 2003
Taxi Driver," A Disturbing and Powerful Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a riveting, disturbing and powerful masterpiece of a film that gives new meaning to the word 'snapped'.  The scenes, quotes and characters are legendary and so is this film giving breakthrough performances to Albert Brooks, Jodie Foster, and of course, Robert De Niro.De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a disturbed taxi driver who drives his taxi all around new York City going crazier every day.  He also meets Iris (AKA Easy) played by Foster who is also disturbed, but in a not as good way.  And what the story leads up to is one of the most memorable pieces of cinema ever. The film is great, the score by Bernard Hermann (his last) is excellent, and the feeling, and atmosphere is perfect.  So, 'are you talking to me'?",10,7,15,13 February 2000
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," 'This isn't freedom - this is fear'
","So in short, this is what happens when you get Ed Brubaker to write the story (If not the script in full) to a Marvel movie, especially one he started on - you get the finest story and plot for a Marvel Avengers movie yet.You may notice I don't say best; I'll get to my nitpicks later. In this story, we get one of those pleasurable superhero comic book movies that is so enjoyable and engaging because it's ABOUT something, and in this case it's the Captain America movie for our times. Where the first film was a good old flag waving salute to world war two, and perhaps would be best seen in that context, Winter Soldier is for the America of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden, a time when secrets are being unveiled left and right and the NSA is probably everywhere and reading as I type out this review right now. And as a story I preferred only the first half of the first avenger more for its socio-political context before it became a two dimensional portrait of heroism - but here socio-political is the name of the game.What happens in the film is fairly complex to go into spoilers which... ah screw it, its Hydra. they're back, they're really the 'I was the one-armed man all along' sort of thing, and the conflict, what really gets the story to be so impactful, is the large scope of trust. Who do you trust, who do you become paranoid of (especially when there is already suspicion, following what happened with New York), and what happens when the Good American super soldier has to be surrounded by complete uncertainty ? And more than that, what if a certain winter soldier who appears to be a super assassin (his equal in fighting prowess and cleverly is designed and costumed like the dark side version of Cap all in black with dirty black hair and guns), is someone else entirely as well. Stakes stakes stakes.That's all I hope to get in the substance of these movies, and I've gotten it more often than not in these marvel studios movies (even last year in the somewhat maligned iron man 3 we got a wickedly funny look at media manipulation). On top of this is clever casting - Also spoiler, Robert Redford is not who he appears either, and its using him in such a role that makes the film enjoyable as well. Here is a guy who is an icon of 70s politic thrillers, ie days of the condor And the candidate and all the presidents men - and his image is upsided but just perfect for a movie ABOUT America in uncertain times.Its surprising for me too as I didn't think I cared too much about Sap after the first film, where he was the least interesting of the Avengers bunch; Steve Rogers seemed before to work best in the context of others, interacting with the other Avengers and the 'straight' guy. here that contrast gets amplified in a very compelling way, even against a character like Natasha Romanoff, who knows where she stands and tries to stay human - let's make a joke about a kiss at least - amid the chaos.Another good thing as a side note, though it's a Captain America movie, it's also a Nick fury movie in some part and there it's also successful as you're never sure about this man in charge. What secrets does he hide, who is he protecting? needless to say as the audience you can't ever totally trust your own eyes. A question posed online recently was it this is the Best Marvel Movie Yet (in caps, pun intended). to answer this, if I still don't rank it completely on par with the two gold standard movies as far as just being great entertainments - the first Iron Man and the Avengers - it's some of the action from the Russo brothers that irked me.Not ALL of it, and they're not as egregious as some of the offenders of quick cut/closely shot films. but as a personal preference I just didn't care for some of the fights and action set pieces (again, not all of them, I would love to watch the nick fury car chase/shootout in the streets of DC as it is intense and decent to follow (and even to compare to the slightly similar chase in the dark knight). In some scenes and shots at times I just couldn't tell what was going on as say a winter soldier and other gunmen attack the heroes.But I can easily look past that enough to say this is a winner, a film that has something to say about the world we are currently living in, how times have really changed in 70 years and what happens when a man of total conviction as Steve Rogers is up against it (as well as some old revived villains). Its almost close to being a work, if one can see it as such, that could make people look twice and go 'maybe things should change when it comes to our government'. Oh, and it's a fun goddamn kick ads spy movie thriller as well where the story points feel organic and there's even pathos near the end for characters we haven't seen too much time together with but enough for it to count.And Garry shandling as a senator!!",9,2,6,28 April 2014
Capote," an actor's film- all the director has to do is stand back and not get in the way (much)
","A film like Capote works due to two things- the credibility of the story, and it's casting. The director doesn't have to do THAT much, though for what it's worth Bennet Miller does a good job setting up a dark mood for much of the film, with maybe a little much hand-held camera-work to add the 'indie' touch, but some chilling music as well. But, as Robert Altman once said, 85% of the director's job is usually in the casting, and it's here that Miller scores his points. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the likely pick for the Oscar, and while it's of course un-fair to ever pick a definite winner over other good performances, Hoffman here scores a nifty triumph into his catalog of character-actor parts. He creates a pure dimension in this character of Truman Capote, who in real life had a lot of hubris with his writing, though also had enough sensitivity and observance of the truth, however grisly. His book 'In Cold Blood' I have not yet read, though from the story presented from the facts in this film, it's definitely quite the intriguing one, especially when we get introduced into the mind-set of Perry Smith.Truman, with author Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, a good though not brilliant performance as more of a smaller character than anything), goes to investigate four killings in Kansas in 1959. Perry Smith and his partner in crime Dick Hickock get a quick trial and sentenced to death, but over the years of appeals, Capote keeps visiting Smith in his jail cell- in between his elite social engagements and drinks (and writing, of course)- trying to get the ultimate truth about November 14th of 59. It's in these scenes, between Hoffman and Clifton Collins Jr as Perry Smith, that the film becomes totally, can't-leave-eyes-from-the-screen watchable film-making. The cinematography by Adam Kimmel is effective in its use of shadows and bits of light, and the shocking part of the sort of 'revelation' in the final cell meeting to Capote is very shocking. Miller, who's only other credit is a documentary film from years back, doesn't hold back on that flashback.It's in the scenes when Capote finally becomes vulnerable, and breaks his hubris in his moral conflict, that Hoffman strikes some rich ground. His is a character that is highly respected among is peers, admired almost to the heavens as the 'inventor of the non-fiction novel'. In some of these scenes it actually isn't all that strong, however necessary they are for the story. It's when it comes down to this kind of intense, duplicitous kind of investigating and connection between the writer and the killer that the drama runs high. And it is well worth to note that although acting all around in the film is top notch, Collins Jr is in a true breakout performance here, as a person with a lot of deep wounds and terrible vibes behind his 'sensitive side'. It almost becomes a tad manipulative on the director, though it's through getting in the first hour- which almost rushes through the kind of procedure of researching and writing a book of this sort- for the good stuff. Anyone who's interested in film acting would do well to see at least the crucial parts of this film, as it has some of the best contained in any film of 2005.",8,1,2,4 February 2006
Over the Top," about what I expected, which was... a crappy Stallone 'kid' flick
","Over the Top should not, I repeat, should NOT inspire the kind of hopefulness that the film will be like Shoot em Up, where the title indicates what the movie will be and the final product lives up to the title and then some. No, this is not an over-the-top vehicle for Stallone, which should be easy enough. It's instead an estranged father/son story about a trucker who arm wrestles for extra cake. Um, should I go on? It's not very over the top, since the title instead refers to the term used when an arm wrestler is about to pin another guy who has the other guy's arm pinned down during the match, hence going OVER the TOP of the uh, something.The movie provides us with a story that is about as hackneyed and idiotic as one can imagine, with sappy twists like a dead mom and a muddled custody battle between Stallone and Robert Loggia, who has almost nothing to work with here (I might mention the actor playing the son but it would give too much credit, though since this is a mention already I should say that he's a terrible actor, not the worst in the children lot but enough to make most others cringe reciting the dialog). Basically none of the characters are much likable, even for Stallone he's a dead-beat dad who somehow is given a slight break since his ex-wife is a total B-word and her father is a rich control freak with hired goons and private jets and wont let go of his grandson until.... Stallone wins a big arm-wrestling match in Vegas? Part of the reason I wanted to check out Over the Top, directed by one of the Golan-Globus guys (you know, the ones who actually agreed to produce that disaster King Lear by Godard, among other 80s hit or misses, mostly misses), was that it was about arm wrestling. This isn't a sport at all, though one of the half-crazy half-dumbass things about the movie is that it portrays it as if it has a gigantic and rabid fan-base (frankly I'd think cockfighting would get bigger crowds). At the least it's sort of interesting to watch as an activity, and even fun to do with equally strong or even weak armed friends. In the hands of Stallone and company it's as equally dumb as the plot and characters; one laughable bit, amid a bunch of 'interviews' done in documentary style (!) with the arm wrestlers is when Stallone's Hawk(s) says that turning his hat around backwards somehow gives him special powers in the matches! If there were more things like that, or that one Stalloney bit where he smashes Terry Funk through the window or crashes his truck all through Loggia's property with no real consequences, it might have been a lot more so-bad-it's-fun super-80's material. As it is, it's just mind-bogglingly stupid, with its few respites of guilty pleasure overwhelmed by the terrible writing (the guy who did In the Heat of the Night wrote this!) and terrible direction.",3,2,7,11 April 2009
Ocean's Thirteen," simply a fun escapist heist movie
","Ocean's Thirteen unfolds not in an excellent great-movie way but how subversive heist movies should- being entertaining while also showing some chutzpah on the part of the filmmaker. Although not reaching the level of tense joy of the original, it does go past the tedious self-consciousness of the second film to be, well, still self-conscious, but in that way that puts Soderbergh to task as someone who can make lots and lots of exposition into the equivalent of a great drink in a pricey bar. From the title cards to the angles that reveal even the smallest angles the characters are playing at (or maybe are not playing at, or are again), to the big $ numbers over the heads of everyone in the casino in the climax, and to how he gets such Hollywood Lotharios into bad wigs and mustaches and noses, it's a minor master's class in being hip and accessible for the mall crowd while still being splendid for simple genre admirers.This time, as well, it's not so much a tale of a heist for the sake of simply putting many millions into the pockets of the thieves, but as a matter of pride (a shake of Sinatra's hand is a point of merit for the older characters in this world, and it is sort of a world, of Las Vegas). Reuben (Gould) gets a heart attack after finding out he's been screwed over by Bank (Pacino), who is some-pun-intended an insanely wealthy man who's opening a new casino Reuben was supposed to be partner on. The Ocean gang decide to strike back at him the worst- letting the house lose, big time, for all the high rollers in attendance on opening night. This time, even more than the first and second films, the heist is elaborate, maybe too elaborate; there's a whole sub-plot devoted to Mexican factory workers who get riled up by Virgil and Turk to rise up against their bosses, despite the fact that they need to keep working to send the fake dice to the casino. Every side is covered, or almost every one, and there are no spots open in this one for romantic entanglements or much else. The element of Reuben bed-stricken is at the heart of the film, and everything else is, simply put, guilty pleasure hijinks of the subtlest kind.And, naturally, each character has their moments to shine. The aforementioned nose bit from Linus is one of the funniest gags in the whole trilogy, as obvious as it is. Don Cheadle gets to break out of his singularly English bit as Basher to go into daredevil garb to act as a pure distraction to Pacino. On the flip-side, Reiner becomes a prissy English high-roller. Some outsider running gags come in with David Paymer as a board member put into a purposeful bad luck blender. Even Pitt and Clooney get in on the fun, with Rusty donning a ridiculous get-up as a concerned seismologist. Overall, Ocean's Thirteen doesn't make for a very substantial dramatic feat, or even a very great comedy (Bernie Mac isn't as up to snuff as in the first film, and the moments with Oprah are more touching, ironically, than anything laugh-out-loud), but it is in its own superficial and too-cool-for-school way a must-see. 7.5/10",7,1,4,13 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Murray and Johansson are a fine pair in a good movie- B+
","Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation isn't a film that moves at a particularly speedy pace, and I suppose I should've expected that. A lot of times her characters seem to be enclosed within the city of Tokyo, the buildings and Asian ambiance shining onto the American characters like some kind of alien presence they're not used to. I liked her usage of the atmosphere of the city, and how she took time to tell the story.  Although at times some of the conversations between the characters either a) weren't too interesting or b) the answers to the questions they asked each other were sort of self-explanatory when we see the characters by themselves within their hotel rooms for stretches of time. While she didn't make a great movie, she did do a competent enough job as a director to let her two leads, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson, give off the some of the most touching performances of the year.In fact, this is a film that Bill Murray fans have been waiting a while for (his best work at getting inside a role since 98's Rushmore): a character who is has humor, yet only because it helps him (as well as us) feel comfortable around such odd people. He plays Bob Harris, an actor who can't get work in the states and, like other real life actors, goes to appear in advertisements in other countries. In the hotel bar, drinking the whiskey he helps to sell (regretfully, we learn, as he wants to act in plays), he meets a complete stranger names Charlotte (Johansson), who is tagging along, more or less, with her celebrity photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi). They befriend each other, hang around each other out of something between boredom and loneliness, and the film chronicles their encounters, a small event or two that would be expected to come out of real life, and it's done without romance one would expect in any conventional story. There is humor in the film, which helps ease the feeling that the film lingers longer than it should here and there, but it's executed with a sweetness, a reality that proves again what makes Murray one of the best of the post-SNL actors. For example, there's a scene where Charlotte goes to get a black toe examined, and Bob waits in the waiting room next to a weird little Japanese guy who's just smiling. He starts to talk to Bob, giving a gesture with his finger to point out something about the world, and Bob follows along imitatively bringing out some earned laughs not at the little guy, but with him like Bob does. Such moments could've made Lost in Translation a great movie, and in terms of film acting it nearly is. Maybe I just saw too many moments where there was pandering, or lingering for the next good scene.",7,2,5,30 September 2003
Barry Lyndon," an excellent, rewarding on multiple viewings kind of masterwork
","Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon was a film that upon first experience was a little sluggish, and compared to the bizarre nature of many of his other masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, the Shining) is lacking. But this was years ago, when I perhaps didn't quite have the patience and attention to underlying emotions the film asks. Upon a few more viewings up until now, I find that this really is a remarkable, deliberately paced film about a man trying to find the cues and the ways into this upper class world. This man, played convincingly by Ryan O'Neil, is like the total con-man in the guise of the perfect gentleman (in a sense, of course less violently and less ambitious, the character has a little in common with Alex from Clockwork Orange). Aside from the characterizations, which do become richer in multiple viewings, the compositions are truly unique, and ask of a viewer more than most can handle. Barry Lyndon is the kind of film that, if nothing else, shows that Kubrick wasn't only this madman director of these satires and totally visual experiences (which he was terrific at), but also could do a tender, expressive, and period-perfect film about a world that most of us know from looking at paintings in museums, which is precisely what Kubrick was going for. Deservedly winning of four academy awards (unfortunately not for Kubrick), it also boasts a fine soundtrack of classic works of music.",10,14,20,13 February 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick at war with how we see war usually
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Ohe could write about how startling a film this is even the 10th or 11th or 15th time you've seen it, like I have up to now (as with most of Kubrick's films I've lost count how many times I've seen on a television screen, in the theater is another matter); how chilling it is to see once again the same method previously experienced in Clockwork Orange of rip-roaring, abyss-black satire blending together with a sense of tragedy and horror that is ever so rare in cinema (i.e. going from a vicious combat scene to the song 'Bird is the Word' played over more combat, or just the general serio-comic attitude between Hartman and Pyle); how the ending brings to a head a fresh concern in the war film that is still as depressing, if not as authentically tear-jerky, as Paths of Glory; how any image seen on a big screen from Kubrick is Solid Gold, or how, admittedly, one or two scenes don't quite work that great (i.e. the 'documentary' interviews the soldiers give to the camera crew).But since that's been written, might as well just sign the Mickey Mouse Club scene and go on with your day.",10,6,11,13 January 2000
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Do the Right Thing in Ebbing, Missouri
","It takes not only a considerable amount of skill to match deep-dark- heartbreaking dramatic storytelling and characters with a pitchðŸ˜¨black comic edge; to go the extra mile one should hopefully have a voice. Martin McDonaugh may be mistaken too quickly as having made a Coen brothers film - Frances McDormand being there doesn't help assuage that argument - yet through In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths he's shown his acidic, no bullish*t, I see clichÃ©s for what they are and raise you a subversion original voice in writing and an assured hand in direction. He also casts his movies like nobody's business and from McDormand down to Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell's mom to the actress as Angela Hayes having one scene, he has everyone with fresh, Thanksgiving-buffet-plate meat to chew on. While it's one of the best films of the year, I'm sure if I try, more or less, I can find some nitpick or even flaws - the daughter Hayes scene could be one simply for the final two lines mother and daughter have, I understand the point but it's too far on the nose, especially for this artist; another could be how quickly 'f***head' Rockwell comes around to a kind-of-sort-of-maybe redemption in the third act - but all of this is overshadowed by the giant moral and social-political-emotional scope of everything else. Mildred Hayes is one of those movie characters that, male or female (but especially make), stays with you for not so much how balls they are but how marvelled they are by their own ballsiness.McDormand has such a command of the character in the big moments - those trailer bits that, if ones been going to the movies this year, has been overplayed (though luckily practically all of the major story points aren't revealed) - one may miss a moment like when Mildred realizes a character did something horrible that she punished someone else for, or how she looks after a tough a-hole comes into her shop coming face to face with a threatening countenance. She's played so many people who carry an ocean of complexity but whats appealing is how she carries a lot of it without needing to show much. Hell, one beat where she has her two animal slippers on their feet talk in bold violent terms is among the great acting moments of the year. So how relevant is it to now? I mention Do the Right Thing because not so much it having the same dramatic build up so much as it has a similar anger - no sorry not true, boiling, scornful rage - at how segments of our country have been, are and may always be (the mother of Rockwell is one such character who inspires such rage at least for me, and she is just your average white-bread matriarch. Also like Lee's film it shows a community who are inextricably linked, and at times the stark racism is almost like a bad joke (Rockwell's cop being a torturer of black inmates, if not more than one, is almost a goof; he's akin to the John Tururro type in DtRT, a man who just is what he is and it's too late to change now, so everyone looks at Mildred in this story and her whole billboards 'thing' closer to something like a basic acting-out in grief than a howl for justice. And then when it comes time for a new man to come in to the town's police force, and I won't say how or why, and id rather you just see it than me put in the spoiler marker, it is like a cold bath of irony: the genuinely tough, decent, on top of it older black man. This is as towering a script as we may get in American cinema this year, and if it has imperfections it shouldn't matter much. The central idea here is such: if you don't bring a light on stark injustice, people wont do much if nothing else because it's not on their mind or (frankly) in their own interests. Willoughby says at one point the billboards are a 'chess move.' What is the 'king' to take then? The ending of the film may seem to leave things too open-ended for some, and I get that. To me, the end is that there's never an ending when it comes to looking at rape (which is assault) and other violence (which is more directly assault) there is no clear ending. You can kill yourself, sure, but that doesn't solve much for those who have to live in total pain. I love this!",10,14,33,24 November 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," one of the most unsentimental films of the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood, possibly Ford's best
","For a motion-picture made in 1940, this one gets the depression probably more on-target than I have seen in any American work (Bound for Glory might be a short bit behind). This is due to two factors, one a little more obvious than the other. Steinbeck's book (still, sadly, unread by me, though other works like the Pearl are amazing on their own) is called the definitive account of the poverty-stricken mid-American experience in the depression, and it probably is. It allows for a very literary sensibility to form about such an American family like the Joads, who are the kind of folk that you'd think, if there wasn't immediate cynicism to be had with the like, politicians would be addressing first and foremost in speeches as the 'working man' and 'American family'. Sadly ironic then that the film had controversy for depicting some of California as corrupt, and that years later there would be charges on John Ford and Steinbeck of being un-American/communist for their respective work. Steibeck knew what he was doing, that's the short of it.The second part is that Ford and David O. Selznick had such faith and dedication to the material in making it so straightforward that none of the possible melodramatic fat would be noticeable. This is so pure a work of American familial drama that any sense of sentimentality seems to be stripped away (as opposed to sentiment, there is a difference, as also noted by Scorsese re: Paths of Glory). Considering the cast, such as stars Henry Fonda and John Carradine- plus the quietly scene-stealing performance of Jane Darwell- it almost has the feel here and there of (pre) neo-realism, at least as far as Hollywood could take it. There's such a matter-of-factness to the turns that are taken with the Joads on their journey across the southwest to California- the bulldozers, Tom coming home after killing a man, the deaths of grandpa and grandma (the latter just in time to see California), and the subsequent trials and tribulations of working on near slave wages, that it builds the drama unexpectedly. You want the Joads to keep on going because they've earned the emotional investment honestly.Only towards the very end, perhaps, does a tinge of the alleged communist &/or socialist stuff leak in, but it's not without some reason. By the time Tom Joad (Fonda) has gone through what's happened, his eyes have grown more empathetic than ever for those around him. His final speech, however full of the low-key gusto that calls out for attention, is effective because of what it means for the character, not even so much for the society at large. What's preceded this spirit for the working man has been very simple, the kind of style that many fans of the movies love Ford's work. It's a road movie essentially, and the story keeps on moving along to point after point that hits home what the Joads, and for that matter other families who've ventured out to California, have to deal with. And while there are some scenes where Ford and his DP Greg Toland move the story along in some stylistic flourishes (i.e. the montage of signs and roads, and the bulldozers in the flashback), the script doesn't allot for any time to take any more breathing room than necessary.And as far as an adaptation- even without reading the book- it's quite wonderful, particularly where one can see that a scene or a moment that probably had profundity in the wording is given an equal amount of emotional weight by what isn't said (the example I'd give is before the Joads leave Oklahoma, the night before, as Ma is in the house by herself, the somber accordion music in the background, as she looks at old pieces of memories and throwing them bit by bit into the fire- all around it's a masterful scene). And on top of there being a sense of truth in the source to screen (with, of course, the necessary cuts and omissions for 1940 production code standards), the performances are golden. Fonda was rarely better, exemplifying all that was good naturally to him as a persona into his character (this and 12 Angry Men his quintessential socially conscious 'Average-joe' performances); Darwell, as mentioned, takes up the screen in her role of a career; Carradine skates between being truly dramatic and campy, and comes off as, simply, intense.It's a gripping saga, and it may even surprise those who are expecting it to be an 'old-fashioned' tale of dust-bowl suffering during the depression. It is actually old-fashioned, in the most honorable way a picture from the period can be. A++",10,2,5,5 April 2008
Pacific Rim," Robots, Monsters, and a lot of heart and soul and creative design
","It was a curious thing being on line for certain Hollywood programmers in summer 2013, mediocre stuff like 2 Guns or White House Down that neither impressed nor offended too much, and then the split in hearing some other folks talking about Pacific Rim and how awful it looked.Perhaps I came to it with a small chip on the shoulder – this is THE Guillermo mother-flipping del Toro, after all, a man who has created dark, supremely designed imaginations with Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies, and here he is getting to take on stuff he loves in a completely B-movie landscape: gnarly monsters, giant robots, comic-book stakes, and action with some substance. And Pacific Rim, for what it set out to accomplish as a sensational blockbuster, reached its aims for what I wanted. When taken in total, it may not have much more or less action than a Man of Steel, but it is much smarter, or just more creative and skilled and knowing of its audience, in layering out its action set pieces, and even in the broad strokes it takes as, basically, a B-level Saturday matinée flick. Del Toro cares about these characters, or at least tries to, deep down, and can show some of that like with the Asian pilot Mako Maori.Is any of this deep? I'm still not sure. Does it need to be an artistic meditation on the cancelling of the apocalypse? Maybe another watch or two of five - because there will always be a part of me that can keep a hold on to an inner 13 year old - will bring that into focus. And aside from the monsters-and-robot work, which contains such good sights to behold, weight and depth to the designs, and the know-how to pace the action and to let us see it – in 2D, anyway, I didn't bother with 3D so I can't speak to that experience – there's some just good fun dialog (Charlie Day! Ron Perlman!!) and a sense that, 'Yes, this is a Godzilla experience, but we can still make it EXCITING'. So much of what I wanted this summer and only got in smaller doses (look at the end of the article for a bit on that) was in full-bloom in this production, which had a 190 million budget and the money looked like it was up on the screen, and not just in the CG but in the big sets and technology, and a story told by a Big Kid that would only hope the rest of the audience can genuinely feel like Big Kids if they aren't young already.In other words, the director accomplished what Michael Bay has, over and over again, failed to do: inspire wonder, and put some basic thought into the process itself, in story and craft, and without a large dollop of cynicism.",9,2,3,8 November 2014
Empire of the Sun," an episodic story laced with David Lean influence, impressive sights, though not enough
","Empire of the Sun must have been something that made Steven Spielberg all the more excited to work on being that, before each film he directs, he watches four specific films- The Searchers, Seven Samurai, It's a Wonderful Life, and Lawrence of Arabia- the latter of those four, and the fact that Lean originally intended to direct this film, indicate how he wanted to go with the style, the sprawling and epic tone. But if in the end I didn't feel as totally satisfied as I thought I should (it's been called one of the most underrated films of Spielberg/the 80's), it might be that parts become more interesting and worth watching than for the whole. Acting-wise the two main forces in the film, one a young, brilliant-as-a-child actor Christian Bale embodies Jamie/Jim as a kid who does go through a transformation, the typical 'coming-of-age' where he loses more than just his parents in the chaos but part of himself. The other is John Malkovich, who plays the surrogate/friend during war-time to the boy, a more hard-edged but sharp guy who's out for himself but not completely shut-off from others.And as with any given Spielberg film, at least one or two visuals will strike up as being pretty close to what could be called 'pure cinema', where you feel a kind of rush on the back of your neck at what can be done with color, light, composition, people (optional), and music. One of these might be in the first hour of the film- maybe my favorite chunk for just consistency- as Jamie first goes through the toughest part, put into the disillusionment of his fantasies of aircrafts and flying and out on his own. Jamie gets lost from his parents in a massive sea of a crowd in the city, and it's a reminder how astounding Spielberg can be with the control of it all, and how every detail adds up to an emotional toll. Once Ballard's original story (based on truth, how much I don't know) reaches into the prison camp, it becomes spotty; sometimes parts of the story work, and sometimes they don't and become a little dramatically inert. Never does Spielberg completely lose his craftsmanship, but there's something not there. Part of it might be the excision of the main chunk of war years (1941 right to 1945 in a fade), but another part of it might be somethings that just ring a little more to the sentimental than Spielberg might realize. When Jim, for example, sees the Japanese fliers on the airfield in some minor ceremony, and he starts to sing his old choir-boy song, it just didn't seem right after such better, smaller scenes between Malkovich and Bale. Still, through this Spielberg does provide another point of great cinema, in the shot that inspired the poster of the towering sun with the plane flying across it. It's little rousing moments like this that do make the film worth seeing, but if you're coming into it after already seeing many of his great works (Schindler, Private Ryan, Munich), the real devastation from being in this situation is never as fully realized as past some kind of brighter nostalgia. There are some darker moments, but it never adds up, and certainly not from the point of view of a conflicted boy who goes through this experience of Japanese internment like Lawrence in a small way- he's a little mad, though courageous. But through Spielberg's own epic ambitions, there's something lost with really making it entertaining. It's bound to find more viewers as the years go on, and it was unfairly maligned upon its original release. Yet the irony doesn't escape me that it is sort of a minor work for the director, working on a huge canvas of locales, extras, and actors both Western and Eastern.",6,15,29,4 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The final fight is worth it, but it may be the real underrated Star Wars movie
","I say that comment in full understanding that this film isn't perfect; the love story at times reminded me of something out of a Hallmark love movie, and Hayden Christensen as the padewan Anakin shows how the right looks and attitudes still need some better acting choices to make it work right. Yet, after viewing it in an almost packed theater, and a few times since at home, I am assured it is a return to form after the very good but lacking TPM. Director/Co-writer George Lucas returns to the vivacity and great visual splendor he had in his original trilogy, and thank goodness, Jar Jar Binks was kept very minimal here. This time there's room for some new creations, though more than anything it's more of a mystery movie than anything else- also one of loss.I know I shouldn't give away spoilers, and the one line summary might give away enough, but I will say that it was a better idea than I expected to see Yoda in computer animation. Oz's original puppetry can't be touched, but with all things considered the animation team and designers matched up to the work that was cut out for them. Whether you view this movie in regular projection or digital or in a full-screen TV cut is irrelevant. Lucas just filmed it in digital film to give those in digital theaters a bit more of a kick and if you see it on a regular screen won't matter in difference. Bottom line, if you felt a little cheated from Phantom Menace, this will bring back the believer in you that a story can be told in absorbing and cool fashion while delivering awesome graphics and action, not to mention a fantastic lot of new visuals that help tell a basically good story. That it still has a couple of acting ticks should try to be overlooked",4,0,7,16 May 2002
Corpse Bride," Filled with the trademark visual plethora to expect from Burton, with the laughs, very good movie
","Although I might not say Corpse Bride is a great film on the level of Nightmare Before Christmas (there are some things involved with the characters of Corpse Bride that aren't as realized as in Nightmare, and the songs aren't as instantly classic, arguable I'm sure), I would not tell you not see this film if you are the least bit a fan of Tim Burton's work or of his previous stop-motion film. This time the story brings a torn to-be married gent named Victor (Johnny Depp voices, thankfully not too recognizable) who is in that uncomfortable point as in other movies where he can't take having to marry someone he barely knows, Victoria (Emily Watson), and her money-hungry parents. So, as a lark, he places his engagement ring on a tree, and within a minute he's taken down unwittingly to the land of the dead- as the corpse bride's husband. Things get complicated then within this sort of quasi love triangle, where the terrific horror clichés (and others) of old lay the framework for a really sweet, neo-classical love story.For the sheer visual marvels that Burton, co-director Mike Johnson, and their genius team (creating more than 100 MILLION frames for each second of animated film), it gets a high recommendation from me. Any reservations I have at all with the film (as I said, not as strong character connections, in particular Victor doesn't hold up like Jack Skellington did with inner conflicts) should not be held too much in comparison with the previous effort from the director. Much of the humor that is brought into the film, which involves about a couple of dozen (at least) puns and gags at old horror films (dancing skeletons and a Peter Lorre inspired earthworm give it two or three points out of the ten automatically), is key and makes the film's more serious elements some balance. It would be one thing if this was all romantic melodrama, but by making it also a sly comedy of (un-dead) manners, it doesn't sell anybody short seeing the film.Kids (maybe not the wee little ones, like 5 and up) will love the wildness of the film, of the kind of awe that Burton tries to bring out in most of his films; adults will find the gags and some punchlines very funny, and there is one animated song/sequence- I forget it's name but it involves the multiple skeletons, the second song in the film- that ranks up there with 'Pink Elephants' in Dumbo for creating such an array of wonders that it practically doesn't matter what the characters are singing about. At the least, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a complete triumph of style (not quite) over substance, and at best it delivers more for the eye than any other animated film has this year.",8,6,11,2 October 2005
Romeo + Juliet," it's not a terrible movie, it's just..... huh?
","I remember seeing Romeo + Juliet in a high school English class... or at least I'd like to pretend I did. If anything, I probably remember reading the actual play more, or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version. Bored one day (very bored, though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person), I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it. It's not as bad I've heard from some, which is that it's one of the worst films ever made. It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments. Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack, that much is completely certain, he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored. This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge, for better or worse, the significant achievement it was. But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all: casting.And I don't mean that in the sense of 'oh, casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and, uh, John Leguizamo I guess', that notion is a given. Watching the film today, after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general, the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances. Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves. And as for the two stars, Di Caprio and Danes, they are pretty to look at, but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material. Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that 'oh, I'll cast them for this look and that', but of simple things like rehearsal. I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world, the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles, all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover.So in short, there is a vision here, but its squandered when the human elements are left beside. Some bits are worthwhile, like Pete Posthlethwaie (sic) s the priest, but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances. It's shiny and goes fast and crazy, but there's not a lot of substance much... at all. That being said, it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music, as cheesy as it can get.",5,1,2,14 January 2009
Forrest Gump," One of the best films of the 90's
","Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas. And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves.  Well done, well acted, and well directed to pythagorean procision. A++",10,157,240,1 April 2000
The Passion of Joan of Arc," an incredible directorial vision, and a devastating lead in Falconetti, make this one of the greatest achievements in all celluloid
","Carl Th. Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.And it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It's all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.There have been many before me who have praised Falconetti's performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must've felt watching Theron in the recent 'Monster'. I didn't even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer's guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti's eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion. For me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That's the kind of effect that Dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I'm not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage. Love Joan or hate her, this is for keeps.",10,123,135,7 February 2004
Gone Baby Gone," a good, sturdy directorial debut for Affleck; brother Casey comes into his own playing a tough Shamus
","Gone Baby Gone is only the second adaptation of a Dennis Lehane novel, and while it's going to probably be the consensus for most (including myself) that the first, Mystic River, is much better. But it might be a bit hasty to compare a film like Eastwood's to one like Ben Affleck's, as it's also his first time at the director's chair for a feature. On the terms Affleck sets it up though it's a more than credible effort. His film takes the story of an investigation into the disappearance/murder of a little Bostonian girl, and the troubles of a Detective (Casey Affleck) who can't seem to wrap his head around the holes in the story as it unfolds- the little cracks that don't make sense. It's gripping mostly as a procedural, and mostly as a revelatory look at the corruptibility of men holding on to power. And it's also interesting in that the mother of the child, played in one of the best turns from the actors by Amy Ryan, isn't some helpless victim but is a druggie and, very likely, an unfit mother. Though not to spoil much in the film, this adds just the right hint of moral complexity to the end of the film, albeit in some contrivance.In fact, it's little moments, both stylistically and substantively, that slightly hamper Gone Baby Gone. How many times, for example, have we seen the grainy flashback-montages of past events suddenly reconstructed (it might be a change not to see this but to have the audience think these bits out). And the factor of the character Angie is almost irrelevant, which is strange as- from what I've heard of the books- she's supposed to be much more stronger and on-par with Affleck's character, here reduced to either a weepy girlfriend or an underused detective's partner. Plus, the masked-bar robbery and the immediate aftermath is a little far-fetched. Still, these criticisms shouldn't stop anyone interested in the premise or the cast to see the film, in the theater especially. I liked seeing the urban sprawl and the seedier joints (and people, can't forget that), as Affleck goes a step further than Eastwood, and probably even Scorsese, in showcasing the nature of the city the events take place, more akin to noir than anything else.And Affleck's little brother, Casey, does a lot with what should be a typical gumshoe part. He plays tough for about 90% of the film, but rarely this year has there been a performance so compelling with emotions and focus so set dead-on. Going from a part like in Ocean's Thirteen to Gone Baby Gone is not an easy stretch, as the aimless quality of humor turns to the stark quality of a guy who straddles the line of everyman to bad-ass without missing a beat. For whatever slip-ups Affleck encounters as director, his cast (his brother, and particularly Harris, Freeman gets back to shape after repeatedly playing God), and his sense of place and time, make Gone Baby Gone a small slice of sublime dark drama, neo-noir with a twist of attitude and pathos.",7,3,10,28 October 2007
"Monsters, Inc."," Entertaining and imaginative 4th film from Pixar
","Monsters Inc., another fine animated movie from the folks at Pixar takes a turn from toys and bugs and goes for something most kids and adults can identify with (adults may have to reach back in time though for that one), being afraid of what's behind the closet at night.  It turns out, in this film, that monsters do lurk behind the closet, and they scare kids as a power resource to give electricity to Monstropolis where the monsters live. 2 of the scarers include Sully (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), who have it good in their job until a mishap occurs- a little child crawls through to the other side and creates a different type of adventure for the two monsters.Incredibly imaginative and colorful computer-animated, Moster Inc. is definitely one of the best family films of the year by giving genuine entertainment to kids and adults (an added incentive for adults to see the movie: Crystal does a little of his old stand-up near the end) just like the past pixar movies.  The biggest liability: the plot seems structured in the same way as Bug's Life and the Toy Story pics and seems typical for the genre.  Otherwise, quite the see.  Other voices include James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Bonnie Hunt and Frank Oz. A-",7,1,2,2 November 2001
Southpaw," phenomenal cast in a lackluster script
","Southpaw has noble enough ambitions: a story of a man who is on top (but probably, just more than a bit, arrogant at his current position) with a wife and kid who love him and he right back, and (no) thanks to a very tragic accident (wife dies) he finds himself at rock bottom and has to crawl back up to the top, on his own terms. Oh, and it's a boxing movie, so it has the rags to riches then back to rags and maybe some riches again type of arc, 'and with the sort of vibe that comes from the 'streets'. I put that in quotes as I can't say for sure whether it fully represents it or not; I have to think it does, being that Southpaw was originally meant as a vehicle for Eminem (who now has the theme song 'Phenomenon', which is kind of obnoxious frankly) and is directed by Antoine Fuqua, who made one of the superb 'street' thrillers several years back with Training Day.What you get as the most positive thing with Southpaw are the performances. Every actor here is putting in more than their work-load, from Rachel McAdams to her one act (from the poster you might think she'll be in it longer, but the trailer gives it away and it's not so much a twist as it is just that sudden turn to the story's conflicts), to Oona Lawrence as Billy (Jake Gyllenhaal) Hope's daughter - she is a seriously wonderful child actress, on par with all of her fellow actors, and really delivering on what she is asked to do, but giving a little something extra. And of course there's the Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker playing the role of the beleaguered no-BS-not-quite-but-really-Mickey-from-Rocky trailer. They're all good here. Hell, even 50 Cent has some good scenes.What you get as not so good is the script. I know a lot of passion went into this project, and I have to think Kurt Sutter went into this with his heart hanging out in the air. Unfortunately his book-of-clichés gets laid bare as well; we know where this train is headed the moment that Billy Hope actually wins the first fight in the movie; he is clearly TOO much at an advantage, though clearly flawed as a fighter, as well, in some small part as a father. Again, the actors help fill in some of the gaps, but I never felt or saw like these characters really had interesting lives outside of what the plot was requiring them to do. It doesn't help that Billy Hope is kind of just Aggression-Times-Ten... until he isn't, but by then he still doesn't have much in the way of his main purpose: get my daughter back, get back my dignity as a fighter, period, end of case.For some, this may be enough. I heard some cheering in the final fight (hey, that's not a spoiler either, you KNOW it's coming, what boxing movie wouldn't have it, let alone one as bare-bonedly-conventional as this one). And the acting may help show up some stuff. It's also notable as one of James Horner's final scores - albeit, and damn me for criticizing the recently departed, some of that is forced as the script is too, though not always. But ultimately, Southpaw feels weighed down by what it's required to go through in the steps of Making The Audience Feel Something, and is a case in point that a director and cast can only do so much with a lacking script. If this had a lessor cast, it might be unwatchable.",6,3,6,26 July 2015
Ant-Man," a fun, well-made B movie from Marvel
","Ant-Man delivers much of the fun, good (if silly) stretches of the comedy, and the wacky comic-book science fiction stuff that many of us come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's also a movie that caused some movie people to raise their eyebrows when the original director Edgar Wright parted ways with Marvel over some 'creative differences'. What was it exactly, we may never know, though there's been speculation about the studio and producers like Kevin Feige forcing on the other aspects of the MCU onto what is an origin story mostly unto itself about Dr. Hank Pym restarting his Ant-Man design with thief Scott Lang (Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd, both cast by Wright). Whatever the case, we now have the movie we have in front of us. For me, I saw little things that did indicate it was still Wright's work (and he shares script and story credit with Joe Cornish, along with Rudd and Adam McKay), while still being basically a fairly safe comic-book movie.What I mean by comic-book movie isn't meant to be a put-down, though with the deluge we've been getting in theaters (or it feels like that due to the over-marketing of them) there's always the possibility of fatigue from all of the explosions and daring-do. At the heart of Ant-Man is lots of goofy science that is explained in the way that it is through these kinds of movies, not just of the Marvel kind but just of any goofy sci-fi flick (atoms, and things becoming Sub-Atomic as well, which I'll get to later). At the same time it's also a father-daughter story, as both Pym and Lang are fathers who have to do right by them - it's what drives them both, and the scenes between Douglas and Evangeline Lilly feel strong enough in that regard (her mother, Hank's wife and the original Wasp we learn, died due to an accident in the 80's).We only see so much of Rudd and his daughter, and for me that was kind of perfunctory for the story: his drive to do right by his daughter is mentioned repeatedly, not least of which by his ex-wife and the girl's new father (Bobby Cannavale, always a welcome presence), but we only see so much of that bond between them, given that Lang's just gotten out of jail. But it's fine - the desire to see her will, I guess, drive him to have better control over his ant army (no kidding) to get into places and 'steal stuff' as the trailer says. And for what he's asked for, Rudd makes this a fun, likable anti-turned-real hero, and delivers the quips and one-liners given with the comic umph that they're needed.The action moves swiftly enough and is directed competently. I mention 'competently' not to make Peyton Reed seem like some kind of hired hack - hired, though he was, he shows some visual flair, most notably when a character finally becomes 'Sub-Atomic', which is as much a credit to the VFX wizards at Marvel studios, but is probably the highlight of the movie for me, when things story-wise get most desperate too - but is it missing its original director? This could be a good example to show in film schools down the line of how a script can have solid comic beats and unexpected moments for characters (primarily the wildest and funniest lines are given to Lang's co-horts in crime, most especially Michael Pena), while still missing a real visual edge. Again, this isn't badly directed exactly, and I'm sure things like the Thomas the Tank Engine gag, and not just what you see in the trailer but everything else, could have been screwed up in even more incapable hands.But maybe there could've been more to the villain. Here we get Corey Stoll as Cross, a pretty terrific actor (Midnight in Paris, House of Cards especially) and here we know who this character is - Pym's former protégé gone corporate criminal mastermind - from minute one, without any ambiguity. But it didn't make him very interesting, and I felt kind of sorry for such a guy as good as he is to be given a character who is at best two dimension if not less ('I saw too much of me in you,' Hank basically says to Cross to explain to the audience why he is the way he is, the bad parts magnified). There's also some science with the character and the Yellow-Jacket suit that get rushed in the third act, but really it is another example of a Marvel villain getting the short-shrift; maybe not to the extent of Ronen in 'Guardians', but close enough.Still, the heroic side is what is most often strong in these MCU movies, and Rudd and Lilly deliver for the characters solid acting chops, and you care (up to a point at least) about the conflicts. Douglas does too, and maybe gives the most... most character, I guess (interesting, captivating, troubled, you pick). Pym has so much that has happened in his life, much heart-break, lost scientific dreams either stolen away from him or, worse, it went to his head. It makes me want to see an Ant-Man pre-origin movie, albeit with another actor (and no more weird CGI to make actors look younger, like in the opening scene of this - weird).He's the kind of star a film like this needs alongside the other capable and ready-to-do-this players, and makes Ant-Man a fun experience with its complex heist involving (yes) a fleet of ants, and the ability of the hero to shrink and grow large with the push of a button. A cool power, which I hope to see more of in these movies. But top tier for this studio? Not quite.",7,1,10,17 July 2015
21 Jump Street," one of the pleasant surprises of 2012 for a few reasons
","A property like 21 Jump Street was something I didn't have many expectations for: I didn't watch the show (despite young Johnny Depp as the star), and the prospect of another buddy-cop comedy is not something that is an instant hit. You need fresh ideas and a good sense of humor about what you're working with. And yet there were a number of people who came in and made it a real surprise. Watching just the trailer you get a sense of the comic timing and approach of total who gives a s*** irreverence from Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (and Ice Cube as well as the guy heading up their plot), and that this is fully self-aware. Part of this comes from the actors, but it also comes from the directors Lord and Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was where they showed everyone they could do it, while The LEGO movie two years later cemented their reputations as the new great comedy directing team).A lot of the jokes and lines and throw-away moments that just carry a lot of solid laughs come from the filmmakers trusting their actors to pull off some dumb jokes in smart ways, and visa-versa. I include Channing Tatum in this, and he surprised me the most in that before this movie I didn't think he was much of an actor (mostly from his dramas, where he just seemed weak or trying too hard). But in one year, between this movie and Magic Mike, he showed that he has real charm and screen presence, and knows how to find the way to play things both straight and funny when a dialog exchange is required. Of course here he's the more tough presence set against Jonah Hill, and yet there's plenty of jokes put at his expense that he plays like a... pro! There's some set pieces that revel in the action, and it comes close to running out of steam in the last third (until it reveals a couple of big cameos that shouldn't be big surprises, but they're still actors that suddenly give a shot of adrenaline to the comedy and action in the climax). For long stretches though 21 Jump Street leaps so high above what this could have been as a generic remake of a popular TV show; it's like actual clever ideas and gags on display, and a lot of it comes down to behavior as well, whether it's the main two actors or with Ice Cube, or Brie Larson as one of the supporting women set at the high school, (or Dave Franco of course), and there's plenty of times where it comes down to the actors saying one thing or another and finding just the right moment to make something funny.Not every single joke clicks, but so many do that 21 Jump Street makes the cop (undercover) comedy conceit fresh and fun. You see these guys just having pure fun with finding how to dig into what makes these clichés tic, and not simply with buddy/cop movies but just how buddies relate in a movie. It's got heart underneath when it takes a breath between things like stabbing Hill in the back at a party (no, don't worry, it's in the trailer, and it's as awesome as it seems).",8,0,0,30 November 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," One of the most charming romantic comedies in a while
","Bridget Jones's Diary actually gave some laughs, and for that alone gives this film reccomendation, since so few romantic comedies now adays (outside of the classic Woody Allen flick) deliver laughs WITH corny plot twists.Renee Zellwegger is as charming as she was in Jerry Maguire and Nurse Betty (though Nurse Betty has her best work) as a British woman who has some low self esteem about herself- she drinks, smokes, and eats too much, and has trouble staying away from bad boyfriends.  In the movie, it focuses on her relationships with Colin Firfth, a honest British lawyer, and Hugh Grant who is a coniving yet charming scoundrel.Some of the movie might be a tad too over-conventional for some tastes (at times it was for me), but the film delivers enough surprises and good feelings (lame for me to say that isn't it) that it should make for a good date movie that the guy might not hate with all his being.

The Godfather: Part II," One of the best sequels ever made
","The Godfather part 2 gets very close to the title for best sequel ever made, but not quite. Even so, I would rank this among the superior films to follow up on another and still be as strong and appealing and dramatically satisfying as the former. The structure of the film is also very important as it jumps back and forth between two stories of Corleone's without any disconnected feelings for the audience. Both could work as perfect single films on their own; together it's like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant. It's spectacular in many ways, masterpiece in fact, and has become as important as the first one (it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms) and the acting all around is well-knit (even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth), the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film, and most of the scene work is fantastic. One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film, as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando. If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him, as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s. Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times (the 'in my home' bit is priceless). John Cazale, by the way, is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that he'll be remembered for twenty years down the line (the other being Dog Day Afternoon). In short, it's just a very well done picture.",10,4,6,21 February 2000
The Bourne Ultimatum," it's not simply about the shaky camera that's the problem, in this tense but uneasy third Bourne film
","The Bourne trilogy has amassed a huge following of fans, particularly, it would seem, for the third film. I was a big fan of the first film, and found the second one- the first from director Paul Greengrass- to also work pretty well under the circumstances of a slightly lesser story. This time, with Ultimatum, it comes as something of a slight disappointment. Certain ingredients are still there and cooking well, such as the spectacularly well choreographed chase through the rooftops and windows of the Morroccan city, leading up to a really intense fight between Bourne and an assassin. As well as this there's some other elements added, like secrets and cover-ups within the NSA and CIA and whatnot, meant to bring up the charge of more to ponder about what is really going on with Bourne's original identity. But somehow it also feels a lot of the time like it hasn't been cooked well enough emotionally, or at least with enough ingenuity between the characters.Matt Damon said recently in an interview that it was a tough and not very good experience working on the film, aside from other personal pressures in his life, because of the erratic shooting schedule and a lack of cohesive directing from Greengrass (they shot the film, much like POTC: At World's End, without a finished script). It makes some sense then to see why it's not Damon's, or Greengrass's, best work by far, even as both try to do what they can. But the problem with the latter (Damon is just much too two-dimensional, if that, as he doesn't express much more than one or more emotions until his final scene with Albert Finney) is the nature of the shooting to the material. It's not that a shaky hand-held camera is always a negative or a cause for nausea, and in fact Greengrass's own United 93, with it shot mostly in hand-held, worked perfectly with the subject matter. This time however there's a lack of consistency: having it hand-held for every scene, even if it's just a shot of characters looking at documents, becomes rote after a while as opposed to naturalistic.It doesn't detract terribly from the action sequences, since they're still as in the other films very well choreographed in that non-stop chase kind of mode such as the NY chase scenes (which near the laughable as Damon almost becomes a superhero with the amount of damage he sustains with only, at one point, slightly bruised hands after the fight). But because the material itself has its own problems, such as the sort of typical cover-up plot that unfolds (and as there's some double-back crossing with a couple of other principle characters), the style sometimes gets in the way, as if its compensation to add edginess in close-ups. Then again the shaky-hand-held is almost pleasant when compared to the flashback first-person memory scenes, which are shot mostly as if through the eyes of someone on absinthe. The end results from 'Ultimatum' aren't completely grim, but there's not really too much of the unexpected, or a fully controlled approach to elevate it, even to having two more shots (an underwater moment) that follow what could have been a really terrific final shot. Neither the best nor worst of the summer 07 blockbusters",6,5,14,5 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," Not as bad as I expected
","I thought this film would be a typical teen-romance-comedy that centers around a romance that leads to the prom.  But, I was amazed, only this film (and American Pie) is the only good teen film of the year (if American Beauty doesn't count).  Why?  Because it is a replica (a good one at that) of Bill Shakespeare's Taming the Shrew.  So much in fact the names match (the two daughters are Bianca and Katerina like the play), and the story reads like the play, so I don't need to go into the plot.  Just know it is witty, and actually funny at times (Larry Miller is dead-pan funny as the worried dad).  A",7,3,7,14 May 2000
Fargo," Possibly the best film of 96
","The Coen brothers always come up with hits (for instance, Raising Arizona) but this time, they bring us to the deep north (North Dakota that is) to showcase a very well made movie with suspenseful scenes, interesting acting and many other things, ya know.The film plot involves a car salesman who is very insecure (played very well by Macy) and who wants to snuff his wife out.  So, he hires a duo to kidnap her (the duo is probably the best of the year by Steve Buscemi as a wisecracking killer, and Peter Stormare as a un-talkative killer) and eventually kill her.  But what he doens't know is that a pregnant police officer (played in an Oscar winning role by Frances McDormand) is on the case to find out what's going on.This is just the tip of the woodchipper in this creative, ingenious, and wonderful (though odd) murder mystery in Fargo, ND.  So, kudos to the Coen brothers for delivering what is most likely the best film of 1996.",10,2,5,26 February 2000
Predator," A quality Schwarzenegger flick
","John McTiernan's (first real film) Predator is quite a quality action flick that is a lot like James Francis Cameron's Aliens (though Aliens and Predator have little to do with each other besides being outer space) by having a story that might not be the greatest, but when the action starts it is a grabber.  Arnold and his team go into the jungle in this film as hired by USA and find themselves in the midst of beastly mayhem.  Quite a thriller indeed, and one of Arnold's better popcorn flicks.  Jesse 'The Body' Ventura stands out as a soldier with little patience for blood shed. A-",8,3,4,3 September 2000
Nightcrawler," a neo-noir on the surface - underneath, it's about... America, and Capitalism
","Let's start with Jake Gyllenhaal here. In a way, his performance can be criticized in the sense that it's one-dimensional. In almost every scene of the film (when he's not putting on a big, s***-eating grin, or yelling at a mirror), he comes wide-eyed, talking a SUPER game, and that game is how to get an opportunity and run with it, how to make the big deal. He has the same determined, crazed but leaning-on-'nice' fervor. And yet it's an actor giving it his all and it works. He finds the... is 'humanity' the word? He's not even really a person, is he - he's less like your common garden variety sociopath. He's relentless, he tries on emotions for what he needs, and can barely sleep. If the movie suddenly revealed itself as an alien or a serial killer, you might believe it. And there's never a moment where Lou Bloom doesn't show that. Gyllenhaal, with his gaunt (he lost weight) appearance, his stream-lined word-a-second performance, is on fire here. He makes this guy completely terrifying, yet recognizable at times, too. Could we see this guy in our everyday life? Or maybe leading a self-help/money-managing seminar? One of the wonderful things about Nightcrawler is how it appears as one thing, but it's about something else, or on top of it. When I mention that he's a sociopath, that's putting it lightly. He may talk in platitudes, in ways that, if you met this person in person you might wonder 'Is this for real? Is this guy just totally nuts?' But it's a metaphor - what would happen if the American Dream, the Horatio Alger situation, went completely to pot? We were told by the Supreme Court in America a few years back, in a matter of speaking, that a Corporation is a person, and that a Corporation should have the rights that any person has in the American process. What Gilroy is trying out here (perhaps akin to a documentary from years back called The Corporation): what happens when a person IS a corporation, that they are always climbing the ladder, always finding the way to make a deal, to make a profit, to get up to the Next Level (in caps)? Everything is seen as status, and damn it all if Lou is going to see his profit margin go down, or a loss to happen, whether it's with his news footage that he's selling to the local station, or if he spots a security guard with his 'fake' uniform. And, more to the point, when other, actual corporations (like, say, a news network) face such a being. Nightcrawler has a main character as a villain - or, as I've called it (ala Walter White) an anti-villain. He's diabolical, you don't like this guy, he actually may make you sick to your stomach. But he's the 'hero' still. And like a sort of 'arch' villain he's got all his information together on so many things - thanks, Internet - and other people around him, like Rene Russo's news director, or his assistant, who is desperate and has to take this man with his slick-back hair at his word. Indeed the scenes with Russo, for me, almost verge on becoming incredulous; how much will she, who seems to be a more sane person, can take with this guy? But he throws his challenges at her, there's rebuffs, and... she needs him.Gilroy's script is sharp and intense, finding a strong plot to hang it on (it's still a neo-noir ultimately, with crimes on going on at LA at night, shot with a strong eye by Robert Elswit), and yet, for me, it works best as a character study. By the very end it almost becomes TOO much. Can we believe this? Maybe it's the point - he's gone to this point because... he can. Or people let him, or don't catch him, or whatever. There are holes you can try to find here. It's not about that. Like Gone Girl, it's a satire that looks at media with the sickening perspective it possibly deserves. It's a movie that challenges the viewer to go where this character does, to squirm, to recognize what is in this person as being something in the real world.Nightcrawler takes a risk to show this character - a cross perhaps between Daniel Plainview and Rupert Pupkin - and explore what happens when Capitalistic ambitions (and on a more we've-seen-this-before level 'if it bleeds it leads' critical pieces) go to/past their limits. It's incisive, it's stimulating, and self-conscious. 9.5/10",9,13,21,13 November 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," don't forget to do the Donkey Roll!
","This is a silly gut-busting delight, the kind of movie that I'd see with my dad if I saw more movies with him - it's basically what I'd call 'Son of Spinal Tap' and like when you got the 'Son of' movies of old (Song of Kong, Son of Frankenstein, whatever) it's not up to par with that, but then that's among the funniest comedies of all time. The 'Lonely Island' team may take on some targets who are almost so obscenely ridiculous in real life - ie Justin Bieber's comments after leaving the Anne Frank house - but they have an excellent instinct for taking on these targets in the pop music world of today, which is just about unlistenable in many respects, and throwing on the silliness and vulgarity but the vulgarity works because it's from a place that's not really mean.The main character of Samberg's, 'Connor 4-Real', is one of those lovable self-obsessed idiots of the movies who works because he is so unaware of how dickish he acts to people around him. There are times where the improv approach as it's an Apatow production by the way goes on a bit too long, mostly in the second half of the movie (the first half fires on all cylinders and largely in part due to the songs and music videos with themes like 'I'm so Humble' and f***ing a woman as if it was killing Bin Laden!) But on the whole I found a lot of really sharp actors around Samberg - Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Justin Timberlake, and many other 'real' people (and a helluva running cameo from Will Arnett, the highlight of the movie for me as a 'CMZ' chief editor ala TMZ) - that makes it consistently funny.And it's the kind of dopey modern satire I like if it has to be done this way at a big studio level: keep the gags and jokes coming, even if they involve penises (and this movie has one of the better ones), and if there's a gag that falls flat there's one in a minute that will keep the pace back up, whether it has to do with '10 seconds to Mars' (it's a band, not a fact) or unexpected celebrities like Seal and the Rza. Call it a semi-guilty pleasure but I had a lot of laughs here, and more than some other SNL movies I can think of.",8,3,9,8 June 2016
The Aviator," A truly smashing, psychologically bound blockbuster
","Martin Scorsese strikes again with a powerful cast and expert crew, but the subject matter is what really got me into the grip of The Aviator. Scorsese and writer John Logan focus, of course, on the prime of the life of Howard Hughes, a kind of c.f. Kane with airplanes and movies substituting for the newspapers. While Scorsese dives right into his technical mastery, Logan dives into the private life of Hughes as well as the public. As a kind of 'golden-age of Hollywood' production the film hearkens back to the greatness from the old days, but also taking on a subject that is a tough one to take on- Hughes' obsessive compulsive nature. On the outside to the public he does go like this to a degree- spending millions on his air epic Hell's Angels, going past the limit of what to spend on planes for the second world war (and 'the Hercules' which the press dubbed the 'Spruce Goose'), and with women. But on the inside, he gradually became a full-blown germaphobe, repeating words, and locking himself in a room at one point and not coming out (this would later be what many remembered him for, the notoriously reclusive Billionair hermit of the 20th century).With Scorsese's outstanding cinematographer Robert Richardson, experimenting with different touches of light and composition, and with his veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker (partly responsible for the immediately recognizable pace and style in Scorsese's films), they get into the mind of someone like Hughes better than any other film I may have ever seen. It's often kinetic, focusing on the smallest things, and going (appropriately) sometimes like an Olver Stone film. Although Gangs of New York, Scorsese's previous epic, contained a good pace, I may have not seen one as intense and effective since Casino. Adding to this is Dante Ferreti, one of the greatest of all production designers, giving life to all of the locations in the film.Most surprising, and satisfying, is that the acting is better than expected, or at least topping expectations. Di Caprio, who was the originator of bringing Hughes' life to the screen (he also has an executive producer credit), dashes off any minor doubts I had that he could pull it off. He can be a superb actor, engaging fully a character (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Gangs, and Basketball Diaries being good examples), and sometimes not (Titanic, Catch Me if You Can). This time, he hits it right on the head, giving (though it's never a big deal for me who wins or loses) an Oscar caliber performance. By the time the story and Hughes swing deeper into his disease, before and following a tragic, heart-racing plane accident, he finds all of the touches to make Hughes believable, flaws and all. It certainly is, along with it being the convincing take on o.c.d. technically, the finest portrayal of someone with it. But even greater is that he finds the notes when with his co-stars.There is Cate Blanchett (as if not more terrific than Di Caprio) as Katherine Hepburn, Hughes' love interest for about ten years. Something of an eccentric character herself, but also very down to earth, Blanchett doesn't skip a beat in finding her own voice within the star. There are also parts like John C. Reilly, Hughes' financial adviser (and part father-figure), Alan Alda, a senator who brings Hughes forward to be questioned in a public committee, Alec Baldwin as Hughes' 'foe' Juan Trippe, and so on. Even for an actress like Kate Beckinsale, who I feared would be hardly worthy to fill a role like Ava Gardner, the environment Scorsese gives to them is very natural considering the Hollywood backdrop.It's always tricky calling one film the best of the year. Many other films that came out this year were big contenders for such a somewhat pretentious title. It could be appropriate for one to say that The Aviator, while not one of Scorsese's best, is one of the best Hollywood productions of the year. At the least, if only from my perspective, it delivers a Scorsese film where he takes a risk at a subject he doesn't know too much about (aviation, though he didn't know much about boxing either for Raging Bull) and runs with the people in the film, reaching for a height some might feel he can't really take.

Léon: The Professional," A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date
","I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.",9,42,54,20 March 2005
Oblivion," I dunno
","Maybe I've seen too many science fiction movies.What this movie cribs, which is putting it generously... WALL-E (top of the list), 2001, Planet of the Apes, Logan's Run, The Island (I think, though maybe that cribbed Logan's Run too), Solaris, Blade Runner (WITH THE AWFUL NARRATION), and Um... lots of other stuff I'm sure I thought of watching it.Derivative is the name of the game, ladies and gentlemen, but lord knows the production designers, special effects teams (no joke, it is gorgeous to look at... until it's same ol' stuff), and Tom Cruise - all of them, and that includes Andrea Risborough - are trying. But really, this is the sort of film that gives 'homage' a bad name.Indeed I would posit that any of the negative criticisms directed at Tarantino the past several years, about being too much into homage and reference (or his whole career depending on POV) should be directed here instead. Despite all of the strengths cosmetically speaking, the story posturing for something deeper, it doesn't feel ashamed to borrow from the best (it might've been better had it outright stolen it, it tries to be its own thing but it always has the air of influence but without its own heart).",6,0,2,11 November 2014
American Pie," 1999's equivalent of There's Something About Mary
","American Pie is a teenage comedy that works on a level and then does not on conservative levels.  And that can be summed up by one word as does not not work for conservatives- Pie.  This film has many teen stars that will probably make it as good actors (New Jersey native Jason Biggs is in 2000's Loser already).  Also, this film is the best for teenagers looking for a laugh after Austin Powers 2.  The story is simple, but the scenes are expanded.  The plot involves 4 seniors who want to lose their virginity by the end of the school year. What ensues is a journey that makes Dumb and Dumber look like The Winslow Boy.  Pastry sex, lacetive dumps, premature ejaculation, the sex books and Eugene Levy provide the best parts of the film, and the romance provides the parts when we can pause from laughing.

Burn After Reading," 'So, what have we learned?' well, the Coens know convoluted/cracked comedy for one
","And casting, let's not forget that. The Coen brothers, usually writing with specific actors in mind, have placed some of Hollywood's biggest and some of the plain best actors around in parts in Burn After Reading that test them to how far they can take the material before it spontaneously combusts. Maybe it does. While their film does start a little slow, if not too much so, their plot soon requires all of the actors- some Coen regulars big and small, some new- to act stupid, angry, confused, wacko, desperate, going nuts, and generally in characteristic form of a Coen comedy, which is far and beyond a distinct step above a lot of other zany/dark comedies. Thankfully, they all meet the challenge.Burn After Reading is about as convoluted as Alfred Hitchcock lost in a jungle-jim screaming for Mommy while the spiked edges of the metal scrape his noggin. And like Hitchcock, they use star George Clooney for great use as their own quasi-Cary Grant (a friend mentioned that Grant never died, he just became Clooney) as a treasury agent who is having not only an affair with a (now) ex-analyst John Malkovich's wife Tilda Swinton, but with internet-date seeker Frances McDormand. And yet, this is just a small part of the screwy-relationships angle of the picture that unfolds, which includes divorce and not-secret longing and even a home-built chair with a springy dildo.The Coens main concern here, as with Big Lebowski, is just tossing in a plot thread that is about as true a MacGuffin as possible: Malkovich's ex-analyst character starts up his memoirs, and they somehow get on a disc and wind up in the gym locker room at the Hardbodies fitness center, and McDormand and Brad Pitt's dim-witted 'good Samaritan' character devise a scheme to muck with Malkovich's documents. From here it becomes a 'cluter-fuck' as one character says (or maybe more than one), and there's a string of paranoia running throughout for Clooney, McDormand, and even Malkovich. And without spoiling anything, mayhem and violence ensue.That last line could also apply to the Coens previous No Country for Old Men, only this time (and not-too-oddly enough this was written off-and-on while that written), in Burn After Reading we soak up all of this with a kind of permission-slip to laugh our heads off. Sometimes it's very dark and nihilistic, and just darn right unexpected- one death especially had me and everyone I was seeing the movie with slack-jawed for a few seconds before suddenly going hysteric for five minutes- but it never really strays from being true to the wacky formula the Coens are used to. This doesn't mean every second will be totally crazy like Raising Arizona, but as it builds it becomes clear it's one of the best of the brothers' comedies, loaded with inspired and cleverly insipid dialog (once again Clooney's character, as in O'Brother, has one certain obsession-tic), and some fine outrageousness. Did I also mention its the funniest work Pitt's done in who knows how long, or that you'll have to stay through the end credits just to be able to laugh at the song?",10,18,32,13 September 2008
Watchmen," the super comic-book movie event exists - and it's a near perfect film
","It was called the classic 'unfilmable' line, but Alan Moore and David Gibbons' Watchmen was film-able, and oddly enough after over 20 years of directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Aronofsky to Paul Greengrass taking the possible helm the most commercial choice imaginable, Zack Snyder, made it film-able, and indeed a very, very good movie. How he accomplishes this is fairly straightforward: compress as much as possible of a 12-issue comic book series into a 2 1/2 hour running time, cut off certain pieces of fat (most notably the Black Freighter story which will be on DVD soon anyway as a bonus), and keep the structure and character development and stories 90% of the same. Also, make it about as accessible as possible to a mainstream audience without, possibly, insulting intelligences much.Indeed this is an incredibly faithful adaptation all things considered - 'things' being the fact that after reading the book, still (and I'll sound cliché like many others) the most compelling and daring and magnum-opus-of-all-time works from Moore and in the medium itself, largely of the details save for a reasonably crucial bit in the climax were left intact. Snyder knew to not get too much in the way of the story and characters would be a wise move, and it is in the sense that if a work is as rich and satirical and dark and violent and sometimes warped sometimes lucid and fairly tragic like the Watchmen it's best not to get in its way as it goes along.For what it's worth, this is the best Watchmen film that we can expect from Zack Snyder, touted as a 'visionary' in the ads based on two good but definitely not great films Dawn of the Dead and 300. Because when he does not let the story well enough alone and puts his 'signature' directorial touches on the proceedings, which is mostly slow motion, sometimes in annoying quick bursts that don't add anything of worth to the hyper-realism portrayed, it screams *much*! But, again, this thankfully doesn't happen with the kind of regularity and overbearing force of 300, and he can actually direct action and even dramatic tension really forcefully (this may come into fuller light on a repeat viewing or the director's cut). I'd even go as far as to say he's improved as a filmmaker, mounting such an impressive production with a cast of primarily character actors (matter of fact no real BIG stars), by taking the story where it needs to go both for those familiar and/or in love with the book, and for those looking for some solid entertainment.I haven't described the plot yet. Here it is in a sentence, if I can try: it's 1985, Richard Nixon is still president (and Vietnam was a victory), America is at a close possible WW3 scenario with Russia, and superheroes are outlawed - and one of them, the Comedian, has been bumped off possibly, as masked psycho/bad-ass Rorscach thinks, by a killer of superheroes, leading to an investigation by him and other drama unfolding with the actual 'American Superman' Dr. Manhattan and his sort of love interest Silk Spectre. If that's barely scratching the surface of it all then so be it, since this is even in the framework of the film (and I mean this as a compliment) dense with detail and motivation and dramas of the personal and big-time Earth scale.Since the storytelling itself, with some of the exceptions I mentioned up before (another being a different twist done from the book for Veidt's plan), is solid and cunning and even featuring a more-than decent selection of songs, what about the cast? It's a mixed bag, frankly, but one that is at the least inoffensive and at best truly inspired, if perhaps as givens. Jackie Earl Haley, Billy Crudup and Jeffrey Dean Morgan go totally into their characters of Rorscah, Dr. Manhattan and the Comedian, making us feel for them just as we did in reading the text. Outside of that, for non-readers of the book, they're still fabulous performances, particularly for Crudup's very subtle touches in inflection (perfectly near-noticeable) and Haley as a tortured soul who sees fit to strike fear into anyone that might cut him down just a single peg (and, unlike Bale's Batman, I really believed Haley doing a super grunty voice for his character).If nothing else, the back-stories with Manhattan (Crudup) and Rorscach (a hopeful Oscar nom for Haley), and to a slightly lesser extent Comedian (Morgan), are little masterpiece shorts in the midst of the epic running time, and are supported by these actors bringing their characters full of life and sorrow and so-black-it-stings humor. Goode and Wilson are not quite as good, and Akerman maybe just falls totally flat as perhaps the point but still nowhere near as convincing as the three big guns. Even an unreasonably funny scene like Night Owl and Spectre making love isn't totally convincing because of the acting.In closing... Watchmen, worth seeing? Yes, very much so, especially if you're a fan already, but maybe so as well if going in blind. A masterpiece of a blockbuster? Not really. It's got some problems in a few scenes such as with the BAM BAM kind of style that if I were a crankier old critic I'd use as an example of the music video age destroying movies (it doesn't bother that much, but it still does subjectively). It was, happy to say, worth the tremendous hype. This being said, if you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and read it first. Then see the movie. It's an excellent movie to talk about. 9.5/10",8,8,18,6 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Jason Bourne...is dead
","Doug Liamn's The Bourne Identity, from a novel by Robert Ludlum, is intriguing, has plenty of tense/energetic scenes, and also, slower paced ones made to create a keen semi-spy effect- has originality too, which you wouldn't expect from a thriller from the Hollywood gene pool of late.Damon is Bourne, or was Bourne, before he was found floating in the ocean and picked up by a fishing boat where he has a couple of bullets in his back and, more importantly, a Swiss bank account in his hip.  This is useful, since the man has Amnesia, can't remember who he is, but can remember all of the old tactics from his past in instinct fashion.  This then sets him off on his mission to Paris, along with gypsy Potente, and the CIA, following his moves.  You might sport familiar material, but Liman counter-acts with a structure, scene for scene, that keeps constant exhiliration.  Add to that, Damon gives off persistance of character that pays off all the way to the last scene.  A full out action movie that works on kinetic and thinking levels; either 10-15 or possibly 5-10 on my best of the year list.  Grade: (strong) A",7,0,3,16 June 2002
The Killing Fields," intense and moving, full of brutal violence but also about the good in people
","In the Killing Fields, there may be some things politically that you'll either not be fully aware of going in, or need to be brought up to speed on. The short of it that I know for sure is that the Vietnam war didn't stay completely within its borders, but rather spilled over into Cambodia, with the kind of guerilla warfare being raged, but more crucially (along with Nixon's own butchery intentions) rival gangs and groups were looking to gain control - and all of this at the cost of thousands of lives, mainly civilians' lives. What's good about the film politically is that it doesn't ask you necessarily to take a big side on one or the other in the Cambodian conflict, except as far as Pol Pot making madness and chaos even more extreme, and that the violence of these street gangs made into larger forms was horrible. But what's even better is that the emotional core, the pathos, is strong: this is a movie about friendship (writer Bruce Robinson, coincidentally, would make another key movie about friendship in the 80's in Withinail & I, on a totally different context of course).The friends - one might almost say lovers in the non-romantic, heterosexual sense - is author Sidney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Hang S Ngor, who won a deserved Oscar for his acting, which often feels very raw and wholly convincing, basically as though he was/is there). Sidney is there in Cambodia to get the scoop as a New York Times reporter, and not only won't soft-pedal anything, he despises the reporters sent/allowed in who will. Pran is nominally his translator, but he is a reporter as well (we don't see much of that aspect, but it's not difficult to see his serious intentions to get things down as they are). The two of them finds that they're stuck in the country as things become even more harried; the greatest tension and suspense of the film isn't even about being under the barrel of guns held by certain guerilla soldiers (though that's part of it) - it's simply how to get Pran out of the country.One may ask why Sidney just didn't get Pran out when he does, in fact, get Pran's family out. Maybe there was just more work to do. Maybe it was simpler that way and for Pran to stay it was necessary for the very on-the-street-on-the-run reporting that Sidney was looking for. But whatever the motivation, the centerpiece of the film for me all comes down to a photograph - this is what's needed for Pran to get a passport and go along with the Americans and French out of the country (it is explained why Cambodians can't leave, but it's not completely clear, or at much as it could've been for me). We see how Malkovich, as a photojournalist, takes the painstaking task of taking pictures on a beat-up, nearly broken camera, and has to develop the film in a very cramped bathroom with unlikely chemicals. It's not totally a spoiler to say it doesn't end up working - for half of the film, Pran is in a prison camp and it then becomes a 'how-does-he-escape' scenario - but this section is for me the most effective: trumping the violence of the world through the process of photography (if not art, then close enough), and just seeing the moment-by-moment events of that sequence is staggering.Of course, there's much violence here, and in a way this was a nice antidote to the barrage of mindless, at best usually guilty-pleasure action fare of the 1980's. Instead of something like Rambo 2, where one man goes in and single-handedly takes on the entire Vietnamese army, this is more like 'hey, you really have to be very, very careful here, because the one wrong thing said or done can get you shot in the head, immediately, or, if in prison, worse via torture'.Some of the events in the first act move rather quickly, but the important thing is that we get to learn who these people are, especially Sidney and Pran, and this is crucial for the emotional stakes: will they be torn apart, and if they are, can they reunite again? I kind of wish I hadn't looked up the trivia for the film ahead of time as I got in a way spoiled as the ultimate outcome (one hopes for the 'happy ending', though here that's especially relative). The tension mounts so well in the second half because we know, as capable as Pran is at thinking on his toes and acting quickly, he's up against a truly formidable, horrifying presence in these soldiers, all trained to the gills for brutal executions.If there is a political message it comes in a rather operatic moment: Sidney is back in New York and watching what looks like a primitive version of a VHS tape of some old news broadcast; it talks about Nixon's message to the American people about what the plan was for Cambodia, and how it was not the bill of goods he was selling. One almost gets the sense that had Nixon really had his way, Pran could've been wiped out by a barrage of bombs. But, again, The Killing Fields is interested in politics only up to a point: the power of the film comes from its male bond, and its depiction of survival and how one can keep a head when surrounded by death and destruction. A very good film of its time, and it holds up extremely well.",9,1,1,19 September 2015
The Italian Job," See the preview to know the story, see the film out of curiosity...
","This remake of the 1969 caper film (I haven't seen the original) is the kind of movie you watch on a night by yourself when nothing else is on TV.  You know you could watch better, or pop in a DVD, but since it's on you might as well see it through till it's pre-ordained climax.   If anything, it has its moments, notably from a A-list cast.After a successful heist in Venice, Sutherland's character wants to call it quits, or at least take a break.  But when Norton's character sets the crew up (which includes Wahlberg, Green, Def, and Statham) and kills off Sutherland, it puts the old crew into a shattered state.   Cut ahead months later and Wahlberg and Theron decide to get back at the conniving Norton, who has his own bit of wealth in Los Angeles, and assemble the old crew.Despite the obvious story, there are aspects of the Italian Job that kept me entertained, if not entirely excited or enthralled at the turns of the film. The supporting work from Green and Statham gets some laughs, and Norton delivers some fine work as well (though another heist film he co-starred in, The Score, is much better), and the action set-pieces remind the audience that Gray is a competent director.   Bottom line, this is one of those blockbuster-typos that came out during last summer and gave a just enough of a squeeze of popcorn-fun to compete with the other blockbusters.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best fantasy films of the new millenium
","Co-writer and producer/director Peter Jackson has masterfully transferred J.R.R. Tolkien's first chronical in his infamous trilogy into an absorbing, interesting and above all awesome picture.  It is quite long, which is the film's only downside, but then in order to tell Tolkien's tale properly as many details would be necessary, thus it is never boring. 
This first epic starts off Frodo Biggins (Elijah Wood) on his dangerous yet crucial quest along with others like Gandolf (Ian McKellan) and Strider (Viggo Mortensen) to bring the rings back to which the fire it came from. The plot is important, but that isn't the key thing about the film that will intrigue most non-fans on Tolkien (fans of Tolkien make this a must see by the way).  The picture has so much visual splendor matched with constant (yet not too constant) suspense, action and battles that it is hard to complain about the few lulls.  Not the best epic fantasy I've, but it could be up there.  Big props go to McKellan by the way for giving one of his best performances to date with Gandolf, though the other performances are also noteworthy. A",9,7,11,20 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Simply there were things I liked and things I didn't like- arguably 'Revolutions' is the least in the Matrix films
","SPOILER WARNINGAndy and Larry Wachowski still get credit from me for their last installment in their Matrix movies - Revolutions (this following the well-intentioned if imperfect Reloaded and excellent first one) - in terms of storytelling. The one thing that kept me awake through much of this film was that I knew they were taking me to somewhere where I wasn't entirely certain. However, that was the only thing that made this installment worthwhile for my money.
There are two other elements that I wish to address: the visual effects and action sequences, while technically complex and detailed, didn't HOLD me on to my seat, so to speak, like in the last two films. The first Matrix was a breakthrough in its own visual style and technique, and Reloaded admirably tried to push it a little further. However I sensed in Revolutions that there was no where remarkable to go in the area. For example, the climax scenes- the battle for Zion and Neo's 'inevitable' fight with Smith- didn't have anything that had me, well, compelled. Much like the characters, the scenes with the CGI effects and digital animation have become less involving as a film and more involving if it was a video game. It's not to undermine the painstaking work it must've been must've been on films like the original Star Wars trilogy where practically everything had to be built from scratch instead of on a hard-drive), but the whole feeling behind it seemed strained.Now, I understand that the first two installments weren't exactly flowing with eloquent dialog and in-depth characters, but at least in those the writer/directors and actors made an effort to keep it slightly above the satisfactory level for the genre. In Revolutions, the words spoken and acting felt wooden, stale, and perhaps far over-used. For example, there is a character that is introduced into the film midway through who is a sixteen year-old wanting to fight against the machines despite his age being too young. Unless you've never seen a sci-fi action film, or are too dense to know where this character fits in a film like this, it's a given to the audience how important this 'minor' character will be in that battle for Zion. And, indeed there were a couple of scenes towards the end where I felt like the filmmakers were treating me like a complete idiot. That the acting is reminiscent of a bad series or movie-of-the-week on the sci-fi channel doesn't help things (even Smith is a little un-Smith like at times). True, fans of these movies and of the genre don't go to these movies for great and original conversing and acting ability, but, come on...All that being said, when I left Revolutions, I didn't feel as if I had left seeing a failure. There were certain things; scenes that I saw and felt that were OK. As mentioned earlier, the story that unfolded in this one made more sense this time around that in the Reloaded, where some points in the story were kept elusive. Even the character of Bane (Ian Bliss), who is apart of the cliché wheel, was a nice touch to the proceedings. Maybe The Matrix Revolutions is, from my perspective, just another one of the final installments in trilogy history that remain the drop-off from the last two (The Godfather trilogy and the Living-Dead trilogy come to mind). In all, this trilogy is a noteworthy one in film history, certainly in its genre, and I was glad I saw it. Yet, it was a disappointment in more ways than it should've been.

Man of Steel," like sex that starts strong and finishes weakly (or with too much, ahem, jackhammering)
","Man of Steel is smart and dumb, subtle and overbearing, up its own butt and trying to find the line as to what a comic book SUPER hero is supposed to be and represent in society... and then it does away with that for mind-numbing action. It has a script that is problematic, intriguing, and gives us a hint as to what could have made for a mind-blowingly weird and self-serious (but campy) world on Krypton from the opening 15 minutes. It's a story that is all about how Clark Kent (aka Kal-El) doesn't know what his place is in the world and has to find it out, while also combating a rather p-o'd presence from his past that has found him. Oh, and there's Lois Lane in it and she does things the plot requires her to do, which includes falling for Superman. It's probably Henry Cavill's dimpled chin, right, chicks love the chin.This is Snyder by some collaboration with Christopher Nolan (because Warner brothers couldn't let go of that Nolan comic book dark-and-brooding mojo I guess) making a new mythology for a character who most Americans, whether they follow graphic novels or not, know and some love. It's a film that tries for an alternate viewpoint that is not bad necessarily or wrong-headed, but as the sort of 'definite' new view for a franchise to rise out from it's not much fun. Sure, you can philosophically pick this apart and find a lot there, maybe some dime-store Nieztsche and other things, but the problem comes when people don't have actual conversations with one another. You want to show that Clark and Lois become closer? Fine, have them talk about something that isn't just him giving googly-eyes explaining what the 'S' on his suit means. Or make Perry White (a very good Fishburne, far as it can go) say things that aren't just orders and declarations.In the first half of the movie I found the structure the pivotal thing: here we bounce from the present time of Kent wandering around like a super-hobo or something (why he gets into s*** with people I'm not sure), and we see his young years. The most troubling part comes with Jonathan Kent (Costner plays him with appropriate and solid aplomb and is fine at being serious in this tone), especially with how his part in the story, uh, wraps up. But even as the structure and imagery drew me in, I kept thinking that 'hmm, maybe a little less telling and more showing, like the bus scene, that makes me feel something, almost, sort of'. But there's little time for that since by the halfway point Clark finds his deeper Kal-El roots, sees Russell Crowe in hologram form, and is told about the 'Great things' he will do. And for all the misgivings it's hard to not feel something when he flies high.If this sounds like a mixed review it's because it is. I was with the movie, up to a point, for about the first hour, 80 minutes or so, despite some issues with Goyer's dialog. But by a certain point, once Zod has to get into his whole plot to destroy earth (and to be fair Shannon gives him some degree of bad-guy gravitas that helps off-set some of Cavill's blandness), then you got to watch lots and lots and lots of CGI pummeling. It's not even *bad*, it's more like a dull repetitive thud, where the color palette is washed out and gray and brown, and the hand-held camera-work, which fits the first part of the movie that's attempting (in an honestly admirable way) a more independent-feeling feature, turns into a nightmare of camera-work. And then the ending... it's less something to get angry about (though I could easily be) than just a 'wait... that's it?' I saw this movie once in 2013 in the theater and it didn't necessarily register quite how much damage was being done to the city. That's contrary to how much people lost their collective minds over what happens in this climactic rumble in Metropolis, that Superman would try to fins another way. I think what bothered me wasn't that so much - that's de-rigur in a number of movies (though Avengers did a better job of attempting to get civilians out) - what bothered me was just shoddy action direction; Snyder is obsessed with getting COOL looking images, but it becomes chaotic and the CGI lacks any real depth. It turns into something that is less about capturing something close to photo-realism than as a cartoon with the brooding nature of 1985's Come & See. I mean, come on.It's not without its merits, but its a work of popular art that loses any potential before it even gets going. When Michael Shannon shouting 'HERESY!' and 'I WILL FIND HIM!' are your most memorable moments (along with a notorious death scene), you got problems.",5,1,4,25 March 2016
The Caine Mutiny," powerful, slightly flawed drama, with unfortunate parallels to today
","Digression, first of all.Look, I can't help but see a film sometimes and see parallels to current events and certain men elevated to power. I'm not intentionally looking for it, and with The Caine Mutiny I happened to have this film to watch as it was part of a list I was checking off and near the end of. But after the first three weeks (and before that, eighteen months in campaign/president-elect mode) of Trump's time in office, it's impossible to not see the parallels with him and Captain Queeg (though I'd say at least Queeg didn't seem to come from a life of privilege and yes men).And at first it wasn't readily apparent - Queeg comes off in his first scenes like a tough taskmaster, but perhaps nothing out of the ordinary for hard-case Captains in the navy or army and so on - but as one notices the decisions he makes, or doesn't make, or what he focuses his attention on (all men having their shirts tucked in is one thing, but during a ship maneuver that requires his attention, or the whole 'strawberry' incidence) and then quickly dismisses the reality around him as hogwash and act like the ship was in a poor state that had to be completely overhauled (and it didn't, and his aims to make it better just come off as... strange somehow). Well.... do you get the idea yet? How about ignoring or dismissing the council or advice of personnel that may, just may, arguably, know better? What do you do with someone in charge who has mental illness? Would Queeg win in an election (just barely)? Okay, so where is this whole train of thought taking me to? Does it accomplish much? Probably not in anything that can change anything, but as someone who writes and thinks critically about such things it's curious to see such patterns repeating themselves in history. But besides all of that, and whatever it can do, I should be here to tell you whether the movie is good or not. It is at times an excellent picture, with some caveats that I'll get to, and most of all the reasons to see it are for the screenplay, which is a wonderful adaptation by Stanley Roberts of the Woulk novel, and Humphrey Bogart.Though he isn't the only notable performance of the film - Van Johnson does a lot with a character that isn't the brightest guy but knows right from wrong, and in his whole career this should be marked as one of Fred MacMurray's major accomplishments, in the subtlety of what he does - Bogart brings a vulnerability to this man, a sense that there's something mixed up even in the moments when he's in command and the men respect him. He never overplays a thing, and because it's Bogart at first as the audience we want to give him the benefit of the doubt... about what, it becomes clear, is hard to tell. But he also sells on the eventual reality of the mental instability of Queeg, like with the rattling of the balls in his hand, but at the same time we don't misunderstand him. How he got to this point even has a small ring of tragedy: was he always this untrusting and paranoid and mentally unstable? Surely being in the navy for eight years he was competent and a good officer. So there's a small ring of tragedy amid the rest of the drama.What makes the script stand out is that it gets better, more compelling, as the movie goes along. In the first twenty minutes it's watchable, but it doesn't feel like much in the way of conflict is going to happen, as the direction from Dymytryk is standard - competent but nothing to remark upon - and he lays in too much of the score (not a bad one by Steiner by any means, but 'too much' can be a problem when a scene should only have dialog), and the performance from Robert Francis, as it is through a lot of the film, is stiff and too basic (although it occurred to me, aside from it being his debut as an actor, it was part of the point to have one guy who was a straight-arrow officer, but even with this he lacks any personality to sell anything, which includes the bits with his girlfriend May Wynn, who is also only okay).But once Queeg comes on the ship the picture takes off in a clearer direction and becomes engrossing simply by the nature of this man - his unpredictability, his lack of responsibility in key moments or ignoring things told to him (those mess hall guys ate the strawberries! rats!) What will be the tipping point and then, after this, how is the court martial going to proceed? This last section is anchored by EG Marshall on one side and Jose Ferrer on the other, and is chock-a-block with dialog (later Altman would make a TV movie out of a play called the Caine Mutiny Court Martial), and all of it comes off from these actors in excellent ways. What does law and order mean in such a situation? Though not all of the acting is great, and near the very end a scene with Jose Ferrer seems to be there to spell out a lot of things that could have been handled with less melodrama, there's a wonderful morality and questioning of power to this story, about taking a long hard look at what happens when it's 'The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way, and my way.' It can be applied to a lot of things in real life, which is what makes it stick in the mind... probably too well now...",8,1,3,9 February 2017
The Color of Money," Mainstream Scorsese work isn't one of his best, but is a really good picture overall
","Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money is a well structured, crafted piece with performances giving a pretty pig boost in this story of Fast Eddie Felson (Newman, reprising a role from 25 years back and garnering an Oscar in the process) who takes under his wing a promising pool player (Cruise) and along with his girlfriend (Mastrianno) go on the road. But the question is, will Eddie return to pool again?Color of Money lacks some of the important and incredible qualities that went with Scorsese's best pictures, and those looking for his trademark themes might be a bit disapointed, but if your not interested in that and just want to see an entertaining drama with some slick moments, this is reccomended.

28 Weeks Later," terrific as a balls-to-the-wall act of scary, nihilistic horror/action
","Juan Carlos Fresnadillo may not be Danny Boyle as far as re-inventors of a sub-genre- the plagued civilization horror movie- but considering it's only his second feature it's pretty damn impressive. He's carved out a sequel that doesn't skimp on heavy moral, and even political, implications on the subject matter, and has a hell of a time getting his masses of crowds and main characters running for their lives. 28 Weeks Later is stylized in some similar ways to its predecessor- even if, as mentioned, Boyle and his crew still has the upper hand at being a master at crafting a perpetually doomed atmosphere through production design, music, editing and cinematography- and provides some chilling scenarios to be played out in claustrophobic environments, wide-open spaces, and decaying streets. As the title suggests, we see that now London has been cleared of the infected, who've starved off, and now re-population will soon begin; soon, because there is still a process to bring people back into the fold.Enter Robert Carlyle's character, who at the beginning of the film escaped from a horde of infected- leaving his wife behind in a farmhouse- who now has much security now (this is never explained, not the only unnecessary ambiguity or fault in story logic)- and is reunited with his kids. The kids, however, go out into the emptied London city, find their house, and lo and behold, their mother, who they were told by their father was gone, is there. But this leads to something much worse, leading to the three steps of 'code red' enacted. Meaning, basically, all bets are off, by the way of the military's 'shoot to kill' scenario enacted for infected *and* uninfected, leaving the two kids on their own, almost. Fresnadillo sets up the characters well enough, and like the Romero zombie movies (maybe not quite as much as the predecessor but close) sets up a personal edge to the movie; the audience can imagine themselves in a situation like this, to the extent that morality would have to be 100% compromised. How this is also dealt with in an intriguing way- which may open up some room for exploration in the sequel- is the factor of a 'carrier', who can be bitten but not completely absorbed by the virus. This ambiguity works much better, and the open-ended ending adds a good dosage of irony that won't be lost on much viewers even as the last big national monument comes into view.Fresnadillo as director, meanwhile, does something that I usually dislike in movies, which is that ultra-frantic, hyper-active use of the camera and editing machine where everything is rapid fire in action scenes. It comes about a hair's edge at being the trashy side of Tony Scott, but somehow the filmmakers keep it very tight in execution, making things always on the verge of danger and dread for the characters. Only sometimes are there fully engrossing angles or set-ups like in the original, but nevertheless a sequence like the breakout of the quarantine- where all of the lights are off except for lighters and flashlights as infected swarm over a hundred people trapped in a basement- and the sequence that follows with the extermination out in the court via snipers, are staggering displays of tension and ture, fist-clenching horror. The many scenes of running, and more running, as chases go on and more infected spread, and bodies become torn in pieces, are still engrossing, but it's when Fresnadillo and company get in the close-confined areas, the dark tunnel with green sniper-vision as example, that are reminiscent of not just the best parts of 28 Days Later, but are some of the scariest scenes of the decade.So why not a masterpiece? It may be for some, especially die-hard genre fans. The characters, being children, do edge off into the conventions that become irksome, though that will have to be a given in order to continue onward. The kids, however, are pretty good at their parts, and as the script hurdles them through one big cluster-f*** after another they stay firm in what is in the subtext quite the wretched coming-of-age story for them. Overall, 28 Weeks Later is a rough but rewarding large-scale plague movie with keen craftsmanship and is better than most of what's called 'horror' today.",9,29,56,11 May 2007
Cast Away," Amazing performance shines through
","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.  Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)?  Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).  That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs.  The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance.  If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances.

The Thing," the most professionally astute horror film of the 80's, very entertaining
","In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.",10,19,27,31 December 2005
Lilo & Stitch," In a word, cute
","Lilo and Stitch is basically nothing special from my view; the alien Stitch is a cool character and having a setting in Hawaii is sharp, but this could also be the type of cartoon that if it didn't have the clout to be from Disney would be on during the day on Cartoon Network or other. Incidentally towards the end things in the movie get really inevitable, and almost sets it up for a follow-up to come on a TV series.  And yet, I liked the movie, and for the most part it kept me (a late teen just right out of seeing Minority Report) entertained which means it will be pitch perfect for kids and might envelop their parents with its humor (Elvis, MIB part 1, Godzilla and part of Jaws are referenced).

Armageddon," how time changes things
","I'm looking back at this review I wrote back when I seemed to not know any better, and I guess its one of those times as a movie critic your position HAS to change. When I first saw Armageddon, I liked it, I liked its energy and its sense of humor, and the kind of Michael Bay style theatricality that went with it. That was when I was 14. Since then I've seen the film a couple more times, and each time I saw it again I wondered how I could've given such high marks to a film that is really of low quality. Armageddon is popcorn entertainment incarnate, but it brings more of the lesser qualities than the better- cheesy, overwrought acting style (could someone please tell Ben Affleck to never cry again?), over-stylized special effects, and a sense of humor that is always the same- a little weak and PG-13 predictable in the guise of wit. There's romance, but its never as long as one might like. The ground control scenes with Thornton, maybe at times the only bits of good in the film, are also weak and over-produced. I guess as I get older and see more films stuff like this just isn't as entertaining anymore.",3,3,7,5 May 2000
The Village," The curse of the damned legend- a film worthy of both Oscars and Razzies
","Make no mistake, M. Night Shyamalan, the filmmaker behind The Village as well as the hits Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, has carved a niche in Hollywood that will still be relevant after his latest.  His style as a director is unmistakable, as he lays on the dread and suspense for the audience with his stories of the supernatural and citizens at the mercy of outside forces.  One problem though with Shyamalan's series of films since his monumental success with 6th Sense, is that either the audience expects a good twist or two in the third acts and Shyamalan sticks to this ideology, or he feels that he has to do it to keep the audience on edge.While it may be coarse to suggest that The Village would be more terrifying in its third act as something of an exploitation horror film, the way it turns out The Village becomes, well, sort of silly.  It's the kind of third act that tries to get the audience thinking deeper past the realm of a super-natural suspense thriller, but the logic behind it doesn't work.  To me, the screenplay is deserved of a razzie nomination.  On the other hand, at least half of the performances are better than expected by the main cast. Though some of them might seem to be over-acting (i.e. William Hurt), under-acting (Joaquin Phoenix), and only finding the balance in here and there (Adrian Brody's performance will disappoint those expecting him to astound as in The Pianist), at least one comes out with a slight breakthrough (Ron Howard's daughter Bryce, playing a blind character, with the only flaw in the performance being it's not always believable that she's blind).Shyamalan gives us these characters, some of them rather archetypal, and they all live in a Village that keeps everything hidden and darkened by the elders.  When one of them (Howard) has to leave, it leads to the climax, and the twists.  But the best side to the film, outside of the flaws in the story and acting, is the look of the film, the way the images are presented and cut together.  Even if Shyamalan doesn't have every bit of himself as he has before in the script, he does seem to have a distinct, intriguing style via the marvelous Roger Deakins and editor Christopher Tellefson.  Indeed, it was that end alone that kept me in my seat, and occasionally gave me some goose-bumps.  And yet, by the end of the film, I felt more cheated than surprised and ecstatic at what came as the finishing touch.  The Village is a mixed bag, worth checking out but not at the same time.

21," want to take a gamble? this movie STINKS!
","Robert Luketic, director of 21, doesn't have as his major folly to change the characters from the book (which I have not read but heard a bit about) from an all Asian group of card counters in Las Vegas to a more 'mixed' lot (i.e. about 1/4 are Asian now). Nor is it even his casting of his lead actor (Jim Sturgess probably brings more charm to the two-dimensional part than one would've thought was possible). His biggest folly was not questioning as he went through the motions of making a silly, contrived, hyper-slick-music-video-shot-in-Jiminy-Jilikers-High-def if there was anything to change up on an audience who knows such motions through and through. The only thing that might differentiate this movie from a whole host of smart-guy-in-a-new-dirty-pond flicks (and I can't name them all but the likes of Rounders is a masterpiece compared to this) is that the characters turn into models from GQ and Maxim by the time they hit it big in Vegas. Not expecting much from 21 is just about right, or even worse.And don't get me started on Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey. It's a paycheck day once again for these two very good- sometimes even fabulous- thespians, who slum their roles as a would-be-DeNiro-in-Casino and a shady MIT professor who by the looks of the movie should be characterized as team-leader-Satan respectively. They too understand what is going on in 21, which is an ol' fish-out-of-water fable about smart people doing stupid things with lots of money at stake as an MIT kid (Srugess) with aspirations for Harvard med joins a group that goes to Vegas and stakes out hundreds of thousands per weekend by counting cards and hustling from table to table. I guess, in a way, I don't blame them for not doing much at all with their roles. But one would hope that there would be something, ANYTHING, that would make this as something for them to distinguish, that the director &/or the script would give them something to do aside from filling in pat performances from at least a good few other parts they've played.As mentioned, Sturgess at least brings a little bit of interest to a character carved out of some sympathy as kid who gets in way over his head. There's not much else with supporting players either. Kate Bosworth is the kind of actress whom you think can sort of act, or at least knows how to *pretend* to really act. But there's also something just not there clicking, something when she puts on the 'concerned' face that just screams so bland that you can't even take it. The writers also plug in clichés of yester-year (and not long enough): Jacob Pitts as the snotty side character in the group who is just too jealous and stubborn to stay in the group long once Benn arrives; the old nerdy friends from before Ben's trip into blackjack land, who are there as a function and not as any real character 'base'. And then there is the script in and of itself- giving us such forlorn twists and turns in its final reels that I want to choke on my popcorn- and the direction as well, which pumps up the volume for the kids while making sure to completely sanitize a real Vegas experience for college-aged younguns (and, of course, the shallowest of all, the two hot male and female leads have to hook up, without much connection whatsoever).Maybe you could give it a couple of quick peeks, maybe five minutes, when it's on TNT in a couple of years. But as far as giving any substantial money to this enterprise? The house wins, Johnny, that's the way it is.",4,4,7,2 April 2008
He Got Game," contrived but powerful and mostly well crafted religious (yes, religious) fable
","It's not only that He Got Game's young main character is named Jesus- though that is a very obvious point writer/director Spike Lee puts out there just to nail it (no pun intended) across- but just the entire scope of the picture, individual scenes, that paint this as a kind of modern religious fable. God isn't exactly present throughout the picture (surely the sex scenes and 'bad' language don't make it very holy for many audiences), but Lee's tale, however contrived to fit around the premise of a convict (Denzel Washington) being released for a week to try and lock-down his estranged son into a college the governor wants, strikes a chord almost in spite of its limitations. It's about forgiveness on a base level, about resisting temptations on all fronts, about reconciliation, and about not becoming holier than thou. In a strange way having the character named Jesus deflects the whole point: Jake, Jesus's father, named him for a *former* NBA player nicknamed Jesus, a sweet irony unto itself.What's most surprising for me is that within the set boundaries of the contrivances, both in the grand piece of the premise and in little occurrences like Jake being situated right next door to a beat up prostitute, Spike Lee has created a work of fiery passion and care and detail. It's a good script first and foremost as just a morality tale played out as realistically as imaginable (or as realistically in a Joint of his) and then elevated through his steadfast direction and the performances. No accident then that basketball is both the main focus of the trials and tribulations of the characters of Jake and Jesus in the story AND Spike Lee's main joy aside from film-making. It goes without saying there are still pieces of social commentary throughout, not least of which from a character named 'Big Time' who rolls around Coney Island pontificating about 'life on the streets' or more obviously by the traps of fame and fortune in pro-basketball in colleges. It's how Lee works in the real personal issues, of the more intimate scenes (and not the ones you think are intimate, not sex scenes save for a brief one between Jovovich and Washington), that makes it work.So, amid the high-flying camera shots and subliminal editing and specific usage of colors and filters as metaphors and the slow-motion shots of the basketball flying through the air as if out in space and lost in time, with taking aside Lee's firm strengths here as a filmmaker, the acting shines out better than expected. In his one real performance (he's appeared in one other film that may or may not have been smaller), Ray Allen plays Jesus without pretension and without ever sounding much of a false note. It could come off as weak to some as he occasionally tries to rise up to the challenge of getting to that level of his fellow actors emotionally. Some may say that, which is fine. But with the scenes he had with the likes of Denzel Washington he held his own wonderfully, with his older quasi-counterpart delivering another great turn in a Lee picture. While it also goes without saying the two of them are stuck in a manipulative 'uplifting' ending with the ball flying over one wall into the court, they're actors made for this kind of story and characters- they also play a mean game of ball to boot in a (pleasantly) uncharacteristic one-on-one climax game.He Got Game has its clichés, its sentimental bits, and its characters brought over from other sports-related dramas. It's also wiser than other crude Hollywood product, it's got sharper and nearly quintessential Spike Lee dialog, and it even features a perfect semblance of rousing score from Aaron Copeland and very cool songs from Public Enemy. And if it delivers a message that isn't too hackneyed under the circumstances, that's fine too, and with everything against it via its premise Lee's made one of his better pictures- good even if you're not big into the sport. 8.5/10",8,1,3,30 August 2008
Bridge of Spies," carries a spirit of all-American-ism without being too preachy, keeping a wit about it and Tom Hanks
","One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ('Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters' echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.",9,97,167,8 October 2015
Pitch Black," Another one, but not too bad
","Unlike Mission to Mars, which had people who go to a planet and have to worry about things on it.  While that film had idiocy mixed in with spectacularly inept drama, this film is a hardcore sci-fi/action popcorn flick that hits the target pretty close if not perfectly.  The film has a group of space flighters, including a convict (played by Vin Diesel in his least performance on the chain, but only because the other ones in Saving Private Ryan, Iron Giant and Boiler Room were classics)  and a muslim (Keith David) and a woman (Randha Mitchell).  On the planet, things are quiet in light, pretty barron, but in the dark, things come out.  Like a bat story, this film has it's share of scares and scores points, but may only be brought down by some lame dialogue and some dumb plot twists.  Still a feast for the eyes in spots.

Split," The most entertaining BAD movie in years. It's certainly never boring, but...
","Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to 'The Beast', the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!' To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them.",6,22,51,27 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," no longer just for kids; a dark adult-fantasy movie with a couple of lulls
","As Harry and Ron and Hermoine and everyone else has grown up, so have the audiences with the Potter franchise. So it should make some sense that by the time the seventh book has come around that it's coming down to the wire: the big showdown between Harry and the Man-We-Don't-Speak- His-Name, oh, whatever, Voldemort. It's usually that the mid-point movie (i.e. Empire Strikes Back) is the darkest one, but there was a quasi-dark ending to Half-Blood Prince, so it makes more sense that the filmmakers take Rowling's Deathly Hallows and turn it into what it should be: a ripping good apocalypse yarn.I kid a little, but it is a movie with a lot of black contours and desolation, as the trio might be walking through the British version of The Road minus some of the gray-scale photography. That, and the main 'plot' being that Harry has to find the horcruxes, which are items that could be used by Voldemort for very evil purposes. But then the next problem comes as how to destroy them? It's this section of the film, after a very entertaining section where the three go in disguise as full-grown-ups (a funny and intense scene in the Ministry of Magic), that it gets into a rhythm that is not what one would expect in a big- budget holiday blockbuster. A lot of it is sitting around contemplating, waiting, trying to figure things out, and if the audience gets impatient it's not due to the filmmaker's making it bungled but because the characters are having trouble figuring it out too, and we feel for them. Talking with my wife about the books in relation to the movies, I'm told that book seven is meant to be a character piece for a large part of it when they're in the woods (indeed it's something like a hundred pages of these woods scenes with the three, or sometimes two, of them frustrated in figuring out the symbols and suspense of running from the gestapo- like figures of the Dark Lord). But is Rowling as good at characters as she is at clever plots and intricate details of magic? Yes and no. Yes in that she makes good characters that we want to be around (for the most part, sometimes Ron gets on ones nerves), and no in that they are at best two dimensional figures, even with Harry, and there's only so much character to explore. But there are instances where one can excuse the tedium of some of these woods scenes. A moment where Harry and Hermoine have a levity pause and dance to music could be seen as extraneousness, but when it has the music of Nick Cave signing sad blues, why carp?David Yates' direction has found after a few of these movies- Order of the Phoenix still the best of his efforts but not far ahead of this one- and he has a classical style as far as big-budget high-action-adventure movies go in Hollywood. He can let an actor's rhythm speak for itself, and he has a really wonderful scene for a whole mess of top-tier British talent (i.e. Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter et all) in the opening scene at Voldermort's castle. When it's exciting such as a fast-paced chase in the sky, it's exciting, and when it needs to slow down there's still attention to be paid to what's going down. Only a few points that a non-book reader such as myself such as a wedding scene for a minor character from movies past and a few points of reference for a couple of items or characters get lost on me.This is the kind of production that has great attributes and only a couple of damning liabilities, though the former outweighs the latter. There's a sequence where the story of the Deathly Hallows- how the three men who made deals with death for items and things- is told with a unique animation style that has silhouettes and figures that look like a Tim Burton special. It's one of the most breathtaking passages in any Potter movie, sophisticated to the point of impressing any serious fan of fable-storytelling. But the downsides... well, again, some of the pacing in those woods scenes are less than great. But more than that is a kind of curious aspect to the climax, which without spoiling much involves a character who we've only seen in one other Potter movie (I leave this non-spoiler for those who haven't read the books - those that do know what I mean already), and it's a tragic fate for the character. It's a fine moment of drama, but it lacks the punch that was likely there in the book as it's a character who is barely in the film itself and will need some memory-digging for the character's significance before.But as far as movies where artistic integrity takes place over dumb-loud action and is able to weave visual fx with the practical side of sets and costumes and things with the CGI is very commendable. It's no wonder that Guillermo del-Toro came close to directing this movie, as it appeals to a sensibility that reads the fantastical and supernatural as part of the world, even if one can't see it quite at first. Oh, and the other downside I almost neglected... it's the first part of a two-part finale. It's like getting a half slice of a BIG epic movie, so it's still big, but half-big. But as far as half-slice epics go, it's one of the best in the franchise.",8,4,6,22 November 2010
The Hills Have Eyes," shows what can be good- and not so good- about a remake
","Maybe I shouldn't be looking to making overt comparisons to the Wes Craven 1977 cult film The Hills Have Eyes, of which this Alejandre Aja filmed remake has done over Hollywood style, and just look at it on terms of just being a horror film in and of itself. But even on its own I found this film to just not work for me, even as I recognized things that I admired about it. And maybe it's because I decided to watch the 1977 original earlier this week that that film is so fresh in my mind that I can't help but make comparisons. However, when you are remaking a film that already has a flaw or two, you can either improve, be on par, or just not be as good as that film, or just be so-so on its own terms. Co-writer/director Aja has a film here that does work for its target audience- the young teen horror fan crowd looking for a quick fix of gore and cheap scares done in a somewhat shaky-hand held camera style. But the problem for me was a little more elemental.For all of Craven's film's shortcomings- mostly by budget and time- was made up for by being a sharply entertaining exploitation flick, building on both the good and evil sides of the characters. This time, Aja is content with making a decent enough set-up for the first half hour or so, and then just plunging the viewer into a kind of checklist horror movie kind of layout. This is not to say he doesn't use the big-studio backup for some good; the makeup by Greg Nicotero on the deformed mutant villains is very cool and creative; the gore factor (not that I was necessarily relying on it for scares, which it didn't really) was very high and well laid out; the performances by the family, for the first half of the film, are believable enough with the dialog. But the problem for me lies in that the second half of the film, where Aja could make this good versus evil struggle scary and intense, into being slightly boring.Not withstanding the fact that 80% of the original is transplanted (sometimes seemingly with the same shots and angles) into the remake, the new ideas put into the film also aren't launched off with enough to really engage. And then there are the action/bloody horror scenes, where Aja has his fun pitting these quasi super-mutants against our can't-be-beat heroes (one of which seems to survive and fight back with an incredible suspension of disbelief for one), but its not really that per say. So yes, there's more gore than the first go-around, yes, there are some added disturbing elements (i.e. a rape scene, not as disturbing as in some films but gruesome enough), and yes, the twist factor is turned up to 10. But with the turns of the horror-film screw, I just didn't get involved, even in separating myself from the original. And the fact that the mutants are very robotic-like in their pursuit of their semi fish-in-a-barrel takes some of the jump out of some of the could-be scares. It will please many, and if you are just a general horror film fan (and R-rated I mean, it doesn't cheap out on that end) you'll want to check it out). But it's a 'meh' in terms of it being engaging film-making.",5,7,12,17 March 2006
Cold Mountain," One of those kinds of pictures practically budgeted to get Oscar nominations
","Anthony Minghella, responsible for such films as The English Patient (which I did not like despite the acclaim) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (which I liked), returns with another adaptation- Cold Mountain, which entails the romance-during-civil war scenario passed down by the Gone with the Wind movie gods. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play two people, Inman and Ada, who've barely known each other before Law goes off to fight in the War, but they write (Kidman contributes voice-overs that more often than not don't work or aren't needed for the story) to one another, that is until he witnesses a terrible battle years later. He becomes a deserter, as he travels across wild parts of the South on her way back to her. During this time Ada's father dies, and she's all alone until a girl from the mountains who's also lost her father, Ruby (Renee Zellweger), comes down to help on the farm. It doesn't take this reviewer to tell where the story is headed, and that's probably how Minghella liked it set up (from Charles Frazier's book). There's much that I liked about Cold Mountain: the strong, period-perfect production design by Dante Ferretti, an entertaining battle sequence near the beginning, and an all-star cast that, though mostly supporting, does it's job well. And among the Oscar nominations the film is bound to receive (from my perspective this film follows in the tradition that Miramax puts out at least one film every year around this time to garner some space in the audience at the show), I'd say that Zellweger could perhaps get her's. What I didn't think was all that great about the movie, and what makes it over-rated, is that it's a story that makes itself too clear that this will happen now, and this will happen in the next scene, and in a few minutes we can expect this, and so on. The presence of confederate soldiers, always on the look out for traitors around Ada's region, makes it all too by-the-books, so to speak. A couple of minutes could've been chopped off as well. Is it a well made movie? yes, but maybe it's TOO well made for its own good.",7,1,4,26 December 2003
American Psycho," One of the Best films of the year
","American Psycho is a terrific film.  I got a lot more than I expected from a horror film.  It turns out to be a satire about a narcasistic businessman who has a hobby for killing.  I wathced as Christian Bale gave his best performance yet, and I realized his vanity in the film was enough to be a psycho.  I guess the killings justify the means.  Still, the way I saw his life made me feel a little bit better because he is a maniac in a tie (what other killer would talk about Sting, Whitney Houston or Huey Louis and the News before ending their life-span).  Still, his antics are mesmerizing, entertaining, and sometimes even humorous (in a demented way).  One of the best of the year.  A++",10,8,20,15 April 2000
Little Miss Sunshine," definitely worth seeing, it's dark, quirky, and well acted in equal measure
","Sometimes I feel pretty uneasy about putting a certain label or name that might be attributed to independent comedy/dramas. But if there's any that can be used for Little Miss Sunshine, directed by husband/wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris- it's quirky. This is not necessarily a bad thing to say, and in fact this is a good tragic-comedy. But it also puts some limits on what can be done with the material. The script by Michael Ardnt creates his characters to fit into a kind of box that gives the actors playing them to give it some juice, though it's also only so much. There's some decent, sometimes very funny, comedy mined here, but it's actually the more dramatic, sadder points that ring truer in the material. The directors don't get in the way much of what the script/actors do, and it turns out to not be anything very special, but it has the charms that would not be found in most other Hollywood fare.It's probably the cast anyway, not the story, and the possibilities in the roles that make it worthwhile. Alan Arkin as the crude, foul-mouthed, drug addicted grandfather possibly is my favorite, as he gives his funniest performance in a long time, probably to rank with his best. And Steve Carell gives more to add to his current streak of becoming more than just a great comic talent- his acting is the best side of the dramatic coin as the anguished gay ex-professor who tried u-successfully to commit suicide. Some of his scenes ring the harshest in the film. But also there's Greg Kinnear as the driven, un-yielding father of the house who has his '9-step' program but still can't get his life together. Only little Olive (the talented young Abigail Breslin) and her mute-by-choice angsty-teen brother (Paul Dano), have real goals they want to achieve. But by the end of their journey, all things wont quite be the same again (as case may be with this kind of indie quasi-formula).In fact Little Miss Sunshine could be the true independent-film equivalent of National Lampoon's Vacation. The same vulgar humor here is not totally absent, but given a more realistic coating with the wacky antics that befall them (i.e. a certain dead body, a mission to reach at all costs, a rickety, dangerous car, etc). It's a shame then that there is only so much that the actors can do with the material. The script is content enough to assign each character a particular, interesting trait, and only so much is done to make each character really rounded. Some of this really does click, like Dwayne's breakdown on the side of the road, or the final performance from Olive contrasted with the rest of the beauty pageant. Good points are made, but there's always a certain sense of un-reality working too. It's hard to explain, and it will definitely be a subjective call for anyone checking it out. It might reach some more, like as if it's this year's American Beauty. For me, Little Miss Sunshine is a welcome addition for this month's crop of movies, and as a family drama it has some memorable scenes.",8,3,11,11 August 2006
North by Northwest," a big collection of classic Hitchcock sequences, strung together by red herrings, plus Cary Grant
","Although I wouldn't rank North by Northwest in the highest pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces- it won't ever get as deep or revelatory or demanding of repeat viewings as Psycho or Vertigo or Rope- it's got enough crackling, dry-sharp wit and incorrigible suspense sequences for an excellent time. One can tell that Hitchcock might be reaching at times to get commercial appeal, even more than usual with his films of the 50s (and after Vertigo and before Psycho, he's trying to make up for what he thought of as lost ground at the box office frankly). But it's all the same a ballsy commercial entertainment that still hails high above the ranks of today's proficient but soulless demonstrations of panache with archetypal heroes and villains in double-cross moves. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising man who gets the typical-Hitchcock 'wrong-man' scenario, and as typical too involving a) spies, b) government espionage with the all-popular 'MacGuffin', and c) a blonde leading lady with her own issues to deal with in the middle of the men. The villains in this case are the very calm and collected James Mason and his leering henchman Martin Landau, as a quasi-chase develops across the country all over George Kaplan- who, by the way, doesn't really exist.The plot, to be sure, is cobbled together under Ernest Lehman's attempts to put together something that Hitchcock would respond to and, more crucially, afford him his two favorite pastimes: first is the witty, very knowing, practically self-conscious dialog meant exclusively to lighten potentially clichéd territory and give grins to others; the scenes with Grant and Saint in the train car, trading off innuendo, is one scene that over-steps the problematic territory, in general their chemistry is elevated thanks to Lehamn's snappy, amusing words. There's even a great bit provided by Thornhill's mother, played by Jessie Royce Landis, as one of Hitchcock's older who smirk things like 'You gentlemen aren't REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?' The other pastime are absurd but completely wonderful sequences where a character or characters get pitted against larger-than-life odds. The hallmark crop-duster scene was the one I had seen even before the whole film, in a class where the sequence was broken down; this, along with Psycho's shower scene, make up some of the most accomplished executions of storyboarding, and how timing and details of the figures in a shot, and the intensity or lack thereof, that Hitchcock's ever done. The Mount Rushmore climax- save for what happens to Grant and Saint following the cliffhanger moment, which is my least favorite part of the movie- is also stellar, including what precedes it in the hideout.North by Northwest is essential viewing, but is it really a completely devastating triumph like Hitchcock at the peak of his powers? Not exactly, as there's some moments where it feels like Hitchcock on auto-pilot with some of the twists and preposterous turns, and he's really more into his suspense scenes and getting Grant perfect in these scenes more than anything else. There's also not much depth to the whole process, yet that's part of its appeal as a yarn of an adventure story. But as a suspense-comedy, it's a work of big-studio success, as Grant comes off on note in every scene he's in, and helps make even the smaller, supporting actors seem important in the grand scheme of the story. In a way it's a great Hitchcock film in the sense that you can just curb the usual logic at the door and just hop along for the ride, and it's in this that North by Northwest should always be remembered (alongside the Bernard Herrmann score, one of his best).",10,1,4,24 February 2007
Knowing," one word can describe this movie for non Bible-thumpers: cracked
","Attending a Saturday night screening for Knowing in its second weekend of release I noticed that the theater was fully packed. My first thought was that since it is a Nicolas Cage movie and from the commercials and previews looks to be pretty blockbuster-action style stuff happening that it might make for a good weekend night viewing. But as the movie went into its last couple of reels I had to wonder: did these folks really know what they were getting into here? Did they realize beforehand, and approve, of how much Knowing takes its BIG plot points and some of its themes from Revelations and Genesis? Or that for most of the running time what's going on takes such a giant leap from science-fiction into conspiracy-nut territory? It's hard not to talk about what happens in the ending, but I may have to by the end of this review. First a summary: a widowed MIT professor (Nicolas Cage, a usually good actor looking faker every movie with his cropped plant hair and plastic surgery) looks at a page that his son got from an 'unearthing' of a Time Capsule that an elementary school left underground for 50 years to be discovered in present day. The page is just numbers, but there's a pattern. It's freaky: the numbers signal catastrophes (i.e. 9/11 with 2996 people dead), and it leads to other possibilities, such as what the other numbers that seem to not pose any kind of meaning at all mean - and it leads, eventually, to Cage discovering what it all leads to...Yup, you guessed it, end of the world. Not just Earth but all planets in the our solar system. The frustrating thing though in Knowing is that for at least a short while there is some promise in the material. Sure, it's kooky to see Cage going through all those numbers like a nut - it makes the Number 23 look almost reasonable in comparison - but Alex Proyas, the director, makes things tense and strange and possibly leading to something complex. In fact the first half contains a relatively awesome sequence: Cage is stuck in traffic and an airplane crashes right across the highway, and he runs through the wreckage with people burning and flailing about and it's all in one shot. Some may not notice that it is all in one shot, which makes it all the more remarkable a feat of direction (the visual FX are compelling too); it's practically Children of Men amazement in terms of a single visual demonstration of a nightmare on film.But then as more of the plot unfolds - it would appear as if the grown-up kids from Twilight are after Cage's son, not a good actor at all I should add, for some reason and even give him a vision of hell that is half nifty and half bat-s*** crazy, and it also involves a small black stone - it becomes silly in some part (it doesn't help that Cage has moments of total calamity as an actor like when he's swinging the bat wildly or is totally bland in quieter scenes), and in large part just... I don't know what. It's leading to something that should be either a wild revelation or so preposterous that it makes the last four or five of Cage's movies (i.e. Wicker Man, Ghost Rider, Bangkok Dangerous) look sane and easy in comparison. Turns out, you'll either be in awe- and you know who you are (i.e. Christian wackos, Rogert Ebert)- or scratching your head.I was in the latter, but there's some sliver of me that wishes I wasn't just nearly losing it, laughing in my seat while everyone else was calm and accepting what was going on in front of them. There is some potential here to become a camp hit, something that would give the Mystery Science Theater guys a run for their money with the commentary. But it takes itself so seriously, and also has some scenes and sequences of actual good, intelligent direction from Proyas and his FX crew, that it turns into what it is: another Nic Cage movie mess that ends on such a note to make both Danny Boyle and Darren Aronofsky raise up their pitchforks and scream ENOUGH! LEAVE THE SUN AND THE TREE OF LIFE ALONE! If you're looking for it to be something totally wild and unhinged at least for the last quarter you'll get your money's worth. If you're looking for another masterpiece from the director of the Crow and Dark City (or for that matter Cage's big-budget comeback), look elsewhere.",5,14,28,28 March 2009
Hugo," nothing less than marvelous
","Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Brian Selznick's inspired novel (which itself was like a pop-up-graphic-regular-novel hybrid, which is the first clue as to why 3D was appropriate) is in just one word: wonderful. It has a lot of drama to it, and not just because it deals with deceased fathers, or supposed deceased father figures, and yet the film also carries the wonder of invention, for things seemingly fantastical (an 'automaton' that is kind of like a robot only with a specific task to be carried out), and overtly fantastical as cinema and the process of invention itself. It ostensibly follows its young hero, Hugo Cabret (a very talented young actor Asa Butterfield), as he hides in the clock- tower of a train station in Paris circa 1933, and how he slowly bonds with a crotchety old shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley) via his much younger relative (Chloe Moretz), and a discovery is made about who this 'Papa Georges' really is. Nothing less than beautiful as a 'kids' movie (in quotes since it can be for anyone that just happens to have two kids as its main characters) and as an ode to film- how precious is it, how important artists are, and what the medium is possible for. In fact, this is what makes the 3D not only impressive - it is essential to the craft of the film; where usually 3D is a gimmick used for cheap effect, or when filmmakers don't understand proper visual spacial relations or what depth of field is, Scorsese and the superlative DP Robert Richardson does. Remarkably as well in scenes that showcase what 'Papa Georges' did with his film sets as the director Georges Melies created fantasy realms. Scorsese is one of the only filmmakers - maybe, arguably, the ONLY filmmaker - to understand how to use 3D to his advantage with the space he has. As the man who coined the phrase 'Cinema is about what's in the frame and what's out', he takes this gimmick - and it still is a gimmick - and gives it a kick in the ass. And yet it's not just the technique that's impressive here, it serves as the tool for the story, which is about something precious and dear: the old and the new, and being able to make room for both equally. There are other factors that come into play as well, for why Georges Melies wasn't celebrated throughout time and space (and of course sound in cinema and WW1 did a lot for that), but it's really about how to find wonderment in art and life, how the two are more than compatible, they compliment each other. Art feeds life. And ultimately a filmmaker in his 60's like Scorsese connects strongly with the young hero, a figure who finds some comfort in the world of fantasy of the automaton and cinema, and in Papa Georges (not to mention the Michael Stuhlbarg character, who is a film preservationist in the days when film nitrate was the used to make women's shoes).I also neglect to mention some other things in the film, such as Sacha Baron Cohen playing a quasi-bumbling police officer at the train station who with his big dog has a penchant for carting off stray kids to the orphanage. His parts are the stuff of the 'B-plotline', but it's still entertaining stuff, and gives a little time to spare between the tragedy that is Hugo's early life (the death of his father played by Jude Law) and the tragedy of Papa Georges' life (when Stuhlbarg shows the surviving film reels to Hugo and others, it's a bittersweet, touching moment, so rare in films these days in general). Overall, it turns into a magical *cinematic* experience, and a deeply emotional one. Thankfully amid the clock-towers and sweeping crane shots and the (swoon) dream-within-dream sequences, there's heart and human beings, and one of Ben Kingsley's most affecting performances in years. There's spectacle in the vision, grace in the action set-pieces (few but significant as they are), and the colors rich and textured in grades of blue, green, red, gold and white. Go see this one.",10,5,10,30 November 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arnold rules, but where's Cameron?
","After leaving T3, and viewing T2 again over the holiday weekend, I realized the key thing that gives T1 and 2 the edge over this recent blockbuster. James Cameron, co-writer and director of those first two, knew right away how to do the action sequences, how to make them exciting, and even how to top himself in the sequel.  But what he was keen on was the story, the characters- for a world such so hard-edged and desolate as in these films, the overall humanity has to be all the more noticeable in order to feel for the main players.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was made without anything to do with Mr. Cameron, and because of that there is a slight feeling of aloof, even as Jonathan Mostow and his writers try their best to make an impact on the saga of John Connor and the Machines.
Here's the good news- the action in this film is still exciting, in the sort of dumbdy-dumb dumb flow of this season of movies, and one of the pleasures of seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in nearly all of his films is that he can bring a laugh and a grin at the most dire of sequences, not to mention his catch phrases (some are corny 'She'll be back', others are amusing 'Talk to the hand').  And the new Terminator (T-X), played in a strikingly impervious and sensual efficiency by Kristina Lokken, is a good counterpart for the model 101.The bad news is that there isn't as much to take in as far as interesting new roles and situations and such, the dialogue revels in cliches instead of juggling around with them as in the other 2, and the actors who play them aren't the wiser- Claire Danes as Kathryn Brewster is convincing to a point, pushing the thankless boundaries of the helpless maiden; Nick Stahl's Connor looks and acts as much like Edward Furlong as Jodie Foster looks and acts like Julianne Moore, and the purpose for Earl Boen's Dr. Silbermen is purely for gag value at this point.The story-line takes us in this chapter as that this is the new Judgment Day, with Sky-Net on a roll to domination.  Fair enough, but the writers don't overcome any of the subtle, and not so subtle plot-holes.  For instance(s), after the Terminator goes out of the funeral parlor with the casket, gets shot at by bullets that don't leave a mark on him (which did in the last films), he shoots back and explodes some cop cars and then reading on his monitor that there wasn't one human casualty.  The reasoning for the Terminator not committing any human casualties worked in part 2 since young John Connor made him swear not to kill anyone, and in this one it isn't the same Terminator as in that one, so why is he still an 'anti-terminator terminator'?  For an R-rating there is something fishy about Arnold as a semi-pacifist trapped inside of a cybornetic organism.  And Sarah Connor dying of leukemia in 1997 will be a bit of a contradiction as to what's mentioned in the T2 book.And yet, these I suppose are my problems with such a film, and I can guess I am probably not the only one with them.  Indeed even the most shallow of movie-goers will see this is the least effective of the three in the now Terminator trilogy.  But for this summer's crowd of movie-goers, being fed the assembly line of sequels and re-fashionings of part efforts, it's certainly not indigestible, and it may keep some hoping for a part 4.  As Mr. Connor says in the film, 'there is no fate but what we make of it'. Grade: B",6,1,4,7 July 2003
Doctor Zhivago," very good, but not great
","This is a very good movie despite it not always being much interesting. It's like a big expansive painting stretching across the wall where you can admire and even love certain small things about it - Rod Steiger's electrifying performance, Klaus Kinski's ten minutes locked on a train using nothing but his eyes, a scene with Alec Guiness' narration that is like narration having a conversation with a character in a room (when he's talking to his half-brother, or reminiscing about it) which I found really fascinating, and some of the photography is wonderful - though on the whole it's lacking a certain something.Doctor Zhivago is pretty to look at, of course, and yet a little dull at its core (a love triangle should have just a little more 'umph' to it. And maybe it does, but I didn't feel it on the first viewing). Not to mention since its release the also epic 'Reds' by Warren Beatty took on history and romance in a much more fascinating package. If you're in the right romantic mood it may hit just the right spot (certainly that love theme by Maurice Jarre, purportedly inspired by a weekend of love-making the composer had with his wife). But among the director's works, it's not one of his best.",8,0,3,28 November 2011
U-571," Great sub action
","U-571 has great war action, but it needs a good story to back it up to be really a blockbuster, and I don't see the best story here (not as good as Das Boot anyway).  The story is a true one (switched from Britain to America as the heroes) in which a group of navy sub men need to find a stranded sub with a machine that will help them in the war.  Once they get to the ship and take over it though, teh Americans loose their sub and must board the Germans sub.  This is giving grave danger to them because they do not know what everything is in the sub, and everybody (Germans and Britains) will be looking for them.  Heart racing action and good stars (Matthew McConaghey, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi and Bill Paxton) bring this film to high hights, but the story is very thin under It's main plot, and I didn't find it all that interesting.  My pick for best sound and visual effects (if nothing else comes along) of the year.  A-",7,1,3,29 April 2000
The Shining," The Horror From Kubrick
","The Shining for Kubrick is about the mystery of places and people. The people staying at the Overlook, the Torrances, but also the Overlook and the sense of ghosts who perhaps know all too well their accursed fate. It's also a work of mad genius, cribbing King's book (which was scary and moody on its own if heavy on exposition) for the sake of giving a viewer a sense of total and unnerving dread. It's perhaps also a really great 'ordinary people are not what they seem' saga. And about writing and Jack Nicholson.With Nicholson's performance, by the way, it's meant to be such a GIANT performance, and it either gets to you or it doesn't. This is a BIG performance that ranks with the likes of a Noh theater production, as if Nicholson had a touch of Mifune in Throne of Blood surrounded by those ghosts of Macbeth. We only gets hints about this man's sanity early on, then his growing boredom, and then a sense of, really, what the hell is going on with this guy. In the book it's made much more explicit: the hotel's gotten to him, it's in fact taken him over, in order to get to the boy. In the movie you can't be sure of it, because Kubrick and Nicholson keep you guessing, even as what you see is what you think you got.Also, Shelley Duvall is underrated here; it's a performance that's perhaps not as great as Nicholson's, but that's because she's Wendy isn't the one the hotel gets to, at least in the same way it does for Jack Torrance. It's an exagerration of what one would expect a normal everyday mother- who also happens to live with and brush aside domestic abuse and alcoholism, or try to bear with is as she can- to react in this environment. It was said Kubrick pushed Duvall quite hard during the production, and it shows for all the best effect. In fact the Shining film wouldn't be so great if it weren't for pushing hard against what is possible. It taps into the soul of the book but translates for a medium that needs spatial sense, the thread of ambiguity (which can be a no-no for some filmmakers but for Kubrick is nothing short of mandatory) while presenting us with really disturbing things.It's not particularly a film to show to a nine year old, but I saw it when I was nine anyway, and was moved, confused, running-out-of-the-house freaked-out (woman in bathtub, seriously), and knowing deep down I was experiencing some visceral thing here. The camera, the little girls, the music, the 'all work and no play', the hedge maze, Nicholson, all of it comes together in one of those ultimate tales that makes perfect sense and no sense at all. It also gives the chance to ask questions, which the book, as amazing as it is, didn't let you do. Film as a medium gets a brooding kick in the nuts by the Shining.",10,6,13,13 January 2000
American Beauty," A GREAT movie
","American Beauty has a lot of things.  Combined, it makes one hell of a tragic comedy.  The performances are exquisite, which helps out a lot in the movie. Kevin Spacey turns out his best performance (better than his academy award winning 'The Usual Suspects)as a father in an enfatuation that gets him in a rebellious mood.  Annette Benning is also scathingly funny as a mother with more problems than meets the eye.  And finally, the passion of the daughter, Jane, with the guy next door, Spacey's passion for his angel (and Jane's best friend) Angela.  There is a lot of funny moments, tragedy, and beauty. It is like a upper- middle class version of a Shakespeare Play.  With everything working in this movie, it is a direct hit. But if you don't trust this, look closer.",10,2,10,26 September 1999
BASEketball," I laughed, and laughed
","David Zucker's BASEketball is a zany and hilarious look at sports in the creation of a new one (combining baseball and basketball).  But it isn't just the movie and it's zany plot, but also It's stars.  South Park creators and stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone as the creators of this game are great together as they are on the show and in other movies.  They bring to the screen weirdness (the penis scene in the locker room left me ihn stitches) that wasn't beenb scene since Dumb and Dumber.

Wanted," style over substance. not exactly a triumph, but it's over it
","Timur Bekmambetov's first American film isn't that far removed from the kinetic, hyperactive and sometimes just plain f***ing batty movies Night Watch and Day Watch. It's about the 'Fraternity of Assassins', who get their missions from clues hidden in a giant quilt, I guess, and it's also about Wesley (James McAvoy), a regular white-collar worker, and his strange, dark adventure of self-discovery in this fraternity of who he really is- an instinctual, almost-mutant killing machine, meant for revenge by his mentor Morgan Freeman (who, thankfully, is a villain for once in a great while).What is there to say about this then.... well, it's never boring. At least as far as I could tell I never did nod off. That being said, it makes last year's Shoot em Up look like a documentary in comparison. And this isn't necessarily a good thing; a movie might be totally crazy with the over-the-top manners of killing people (in this one we get bullets that curve, bullets that hit one another, heart rates reaching 400 BPS, and rats who bomb the joint, reminding one of the armed penguins in Batman Returns), but does it make it a really good movie?Not in this case I'm afraid. This is a shame since James McAvoy is a very good actor, one who's very convincing, funny, and believable even when put in the most unbelievable circumstances. He practically carries the first third of the film on his own, this despite him being put in a totally crazy car chase that continues some of the ready-to-break rules set up here by Bekmambetov. And there's even some good star power with Jolie, acting like BIG ACTION STAR Angelina Jolie, and Freeman in a part too easily readable for his own good. But by the end we're given a plot and choice in technical style that knocks off Matrix, Fight Club, La Femme Nikita, a slew of John Woo movies, two turtle doves and a pear tree un-partriaged, and the last quarter of the film is just escalating, laugh-out-loud madness that skids the line between suspenseful and totally ludicrous, and eventually falls over the latter side.Would I recommend Wanted? No, I wouldn't, at least if you're paying for yourself. But if you're invited, go along and take a chance. You'll leave a little shell-shocked, but you might not be totally sorry you went.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," surpasses the original
","Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or, rather, the 'Bad' Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean, DAMN, it still looks great, and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more, for me, impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable, of course, that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people, incidentally, or, you know, all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but, hey, 'He'll live' is enough.But if Cameron is 'soft' at all here, it doesn't show too much... well, okay, Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms 'No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc', and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best, annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold, in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn, and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced, he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress, at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. She can never be completely hard, though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her, so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World, she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past, which is a cousin of this flick, gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad, but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero, one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So, blast your Guns N Roses, say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him, right, Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight, like the voice-over, it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie, which the first Terminator just was).",10,264,340,30 April 2000
Heartbreak Ridge," straightforward war pic and damn proud (and good) of it
","For anyone thinking of checking out John Wayne's the Green Berets... don't. Instead, go to Heartbreak Ridge. You might ask if it will have the same kind of action, since one is Grenada (where it took all of about a day or two, give or take a few minutes) and the other is Vietnam (which, you know the story). Doesn't really matter, since it all comes down to taste and execution. Perhaps if you're a hardcore John Wayne fan you'll dig that piece of military propaganda, but even casual Clint Eastwood fans will find something enjoyable about Heartbreak Ridge, which embraces the Marines while also taking a good long snap at bureaucratic BS and people who get in the way of someone who is perpetually a hard-ass who gets everything right in his place. Or, to put it another way, Ridge provides us with the Dirty Harry of the Marine corp, which is enough to make it something interesting on its own.Why the comparison anyway? Because they're two examples of gung-ho military Americana made for the masses. But, and this is the biggest but, Eastwood is the more confident filmmaker and star, and with his film as a star vehicle as well as straightforward Recon-man-whips-men-into-shape-for-battle story he takes charge with plenty of good, witty lines and a sense of camaraderie with the male characters. Hightower is Eastwood's character, someone who must have been somewhat easy to play but also a lot of fun, the only real conflict for him coming in trying to recconect with his former girl (Mason) and in rubbing up against the even harder-ass Major. Around Hightower are a cast of near-classic misfits and complainers- chief among them the 'Ayatollah of Rock-and-rolla' played with total glee by Mario Van Peebles in one of his best roles- and off they go in getting ready for a battle which takes place so quickly it fits just neatly (and awesomely) enough into the last half hour of the film.It's a given to see much of Eastwood's style as no nonsense. The most we get from Eastwood trying to 'show-off' as it were would be a tracking shot following two guys, or maybe a close-up or too. It's so unfussy that one almost wishes Eastwood might try something that might POP off the screen or give the final battle something to chew on. But it is what it is and it's great to see it that way, since the technique doesn't change what's already worth while in the script. While the story itself isn't without a couple of flaws- the romantic relationship subplot doesn't really work well past the 'hey, we have problems that go way back... and it starts to get better just because it's convenient to the plot' deal- anything with Eastwood barking and quipping lines at and with his men, just some of Eastwood's classic facial expressions we know and have seen many times, make Heartbreak Ridge a fine achievement for him.It's not as devastating a portrait of the marines as say Full Metal Jacket or Jarhead, but it doesn't need to be. For Eastwood this is a chance to make a Clint Eastwood picture out of the marine corp, and it's very entertaining to see him do when it's at its best. And, unlike the Green Berets, it doesn't paint *way* unrealistically what it's like to go into the 'LZ'. In fact, there may be a few watching who might want to join up just because someone like Clint may be a Recon leader. Crazy to say? Just watch.",8,2,5,2 February 2009
Salt," it gets more and more preposterous, but it's always with craft and competency
","Salt continues the very long and tried & true legacy of US vs Russia spy films (continuing even after the Cold War), and this one reminds one of films like Telefon and Three Days of the Condor. Who is this agent, Salt? Was she trained in Russia since her childhood to assassinate the Russian president, or worse? How skillful is she? Is it all just second nature? The real kick with Salt is that after a while her skills and fighting ability and way of sneaking around basements and corridors and sides of buildings and jumping from truck to truck, she goes from being superspy to superhero. If the film wasn't based on a graphic novel, it will probably spur on a couple of others.I could go on about the plot more, but it's really a kind of plot that needs to be just taken in as it goes. That the film becomes almost non-stop action after Salt is 'outed' as a Russian spy is part of this as well. We're mostly watching what comes of another Russian spy coming in and claiming she really works as part of an 'Something-X' program, the likes of which were made to assassinate JFK (conspiracy action, very fun montage). The fun then, and really what makes it more fun that it should be illegitimately, is the actors believing so much in what they do. Jolie is part of it, looking glamorous like a movie star and also can kick ass when she has to - which is a lot - and Liev Schrieber and Chiwetel Ejofor get some decent supporting roles to play with. And of course twists keep coming, and second-guessing being the name of the game in spy movies helps keep one interested.I was never bored through Salt, and that is really the biggest compliment I would want to pay it. It could have been directed with a level of professionalism and courtesy for the viewer's intelligence, but still also not very interesting. The careening-around plot, Jolie's screen presence and hints at deeper meaning, make it something a little more than it could have been. And by the end, we're hoping that there will be another Salt movie, perhaps with an even stronger plot. It's not a triumph, but a tightly constructed summer spy movie following long after the coat-tails of Bourne.",7,3,9,29 July 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," beat for beat, second for second, the funniest parody I've seen in years
","'...and remember it doesn't say Cox, unless I say it tastes like Cox.' This is an example of prime send-up, a parody that lovingly references everything in rock-music-bio-pics, from (the obvious centerpiece) Walk the Line, Ray, Don't Look Back, Elvis flicks, The Doors, and countless others, including a mention to Yellow Submarine and the eras of Motown, rockabilly, even punk (yes, more than a decade before there is punk a version of Walk Hard is played). Kasdan and Apatow get what it is to do a send up, which is to be knowing of all the conventions, clichés, and formulas that end up coming out of what are, actually, real-life stories already put into a simple context. It follows the tradition of the ZAZ team (Airplane and Naked Gun) by delivering a joke or gag or just something weird every other second, and it builds up into one of the funniest movies in years.A friend of mine said recently that it takes someone to actually really like and admire what they're spoofing in order for it to be pulled off. This helps, of course, as one can tell that Mel Brooks had a love for the theater and musicals for The Producers and horror movies with Frankenstein, and more recently Edgar Wright with action flicks and Hot Fuzz. But there's another component, I think, that separates a film like Walk Hard from the recent slew of 'Movies' (Date, Epic, the upcoming Meet the Spartans) is that the people working on Walk Hard are some of the funniest people working in Hollywood today, and knowing what makes fresh, vulgar send-up work. It's not simply about mashing up pop-culture references to make them stick, there has to be just something that clicks through the writing and acting.Walk Hard has that in spades- from the opening jokes (yes jokes, and they're running ones) about Dewey slicing his brother in half with a machete (with the brother still giving words of advice cut in half, and leading up to the also running gag 'The wrong kid died!' line), going into playing the blues as a little white kid, to being 14 (and played by Reilly, of course) marrying a 12 year old fan, to the sudden bolts of inspiration for songs in the middle of a scene- not to mention the lyrics- it's already apparent this will be good stuff. But then there's more: Hasidim music agents with names like Kvetch L'Chaim; drug scenes out of Ray 'You don't want to do this!'; the ups and downs and the meetings with other famous stars ('Hey, George Harrison'). I could go on and on about the little details as well, some of which are probably too much to even mention in this review.Suffice to say Reilly pops out of a shell that he's been in over the past decade or so. One of the superb character actors of his generation (yes, I'm sounding like a pompously sounding critic for now), he's fantastic as Dewey Cox, giving him a sensibility that goes past simple parody- we actually end up feeling for this drug-addicted adulterer who goes in and out of rehab and finally settles in with his few dozen children of various mixed ethnicities (the catching montage, by the way, is priceless). He gives the character that 'umph' that even makes him more human than Leslie Nielson's Frank Drebin, and he creates so many absurd moments that it's easy to miss some of his subtle charms and dramatic touches. Just seeing him talk to a ghost Jonah Hill as 'older ghost' brother Nate reveals his multi-faceted gifts.And like A Mighty Wind, Kasdan and Apatow and composer Michael Andrews make the songs legitimately good numbers amid some of the crudest innuendo in movie history (songs go between 'innocent' sexual acts to midgets and then to a huge orchestral number including countless tribes-people). Reilly also has the backup, acting-wise, of people from SNL (Meadows and Parnell), The Office (Fischer and Ed Helms) and of course past Apatow works (Rudd, Black, Long and Schwartzman give a movie-stealing scene as the Beatles in India). In the end, it's everything I love in a go-for-broke comedy that still sticks to the numerous predecessors it's imitating. And, if anything, it one-ups those movies as well as legitimate entertainment.So Walk Hard... Hard... to the movie theater!",10,10,21,24 December 2007
Duck Soup," 'What significance? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh'
","That was what Groucho Mark said when asked about the political nature of the picture Duck Soup, how much thought was put into its construction as the ultimate anarchic comedy. And it's not unfair to ask- though it's a perfectly reasonable and unpretentious answer- since Duck Soup seems to be such a work of insane brilliance that it defies explanation. Maybe it is best not to explain why things were done this way or that. The movie works almost like a cocktail of dreams and hallucinations on war (at least the last 20 minutes), and also features some of the best gags and jokes ever put to film. If you asked me where I took a breath from laughing I would be hard pressed. There's not a moment in this movie that is not at least a little clever, or awesomely bad-pun-esquire, and indeed there's many moments where I continued to laugh after a joke happened just in wondering 'how the holy moses did they come up with that?' Duck Soup is the epitome of the sound comedy (at the very least before color); no stone is unturned, no insult is not given out by Groucho, no word is twisted around for the sake of a big laugh by Chico, and no piece of, well, clothing or whatever is left un-snipped by Harpo's scissors. In the dissection of dictatorships and war as a function of the human condition (yes, I'm going there describing it like this), the Marx brothers take it down to a fundamental level: what makes all of this tick, and what makes it funny? Or what makes it so that one can see without any fog at how insane it already is? It's like the Marx brothers top the inherent insanity given in human beings who reach power over the people and can go to war with whomever they like, by just, frankly, being themselves. It's hopefully the greatest compliment to say that a lot of what happens in Duck Soup comes off so effortlessly by the three/four brothers.Then again, there must have been a lot of effort put in by the brothers and the writers, and whatever mess it may seem to turn into by the time the war stuff happens (or just that musical sequence in the courtroom right before they go to war, a possible high water mark as far as laugh-a-mili-second musical scenes go). So many quotable lines come from every direction (just to put two out there: 'Remember, you're fighting for this woman's honor, which is probably more than she ever did,' from Groucho and 'Mint? No, no, I no like a mint. Uh, what other flavor you got?' from Chico when asked about a job in the Mint) that it's hard to keep up, so hard that it probably demands repeat viewings. While it's given to say the mirror scene is classic, which it is, lest not forget a masterful near-pantomime with the hats at the peanut stand, or some 'tiny' gags like making a 'record' of events being a vinyl and tossed in the air to shoot.There's so much in the ether that it makes it an overwhelmingly rich experience comically, even in just 68 minutes. It's also always in the spirit of fun, or whatever can get a laugh, and that takes some guts. Screw a 'story', why not just have Harpo make a stop while doing his 'Paul Revere' at a woman taking a bath in a house and then winding up in the bathtub with the husband (?!) Why not have Groucho make his entrance the backward way down the pole to where everyone else is giving the GRAND entrance, as he holds out his cigar for, um, himself? Why not have the cavalcade of footage of 'reinforcements' near the end? Why not break out into a song or have a bunch of unrelated cultural gags ('Taxes!' 'Texas?' 'No, money, dollars!' 'Yeah, Dallas Texas!')? Why not just go completely bug-f*** nuts from time to time and make the audience not even sure what's exactly a joke or a gag or a goof or something ironic or (dare it happen) poignant? The Marx's answer: Why, OF COURSE! Duck Soup is a masterpiece, no if's ands or buts. HAIL FREEDONA!",10,2,4,19 March 2009
Apocalypse Now," In my top five favorite films ever made
","Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far 'up the river'.Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's.",10,24,34,6 January 2000
The Battle of Algiers," as fitting a tip-of-the-hat to Rossellini's post-WW2 work made in the 60's, and them some
","A couple of times here and there watching Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, winner of the 1966 Golden Lion at Venice, I thought off-handedly (maybe with a smidgen of sarcasm), 'this is probably one of the top 5 favorite films of like Rage Against the Machine or something'. It's not without saying though that once the film was over, and watching a bit more on the extra features on the DVD (with other directors shining light on their opinions on the film), that most of what I saw sunk in a little deeper. This is one of the best kinds of documentary-style dramas made in its time and place in the world, and goes a bit further in the right direction from Roberto Rossellini's post-war trilogy. While it's not unlikely to see Pontecorvo's own influence from the neorealist maverick, it's also likely to see how Pontecorvo takes this very emotionally charged, as-factual-as-possible story of Algiers versus France in the mid 1950s with an assured balance of pathos and style. It also works tremendously as a kind of 'statement' movie, without at all pushing it down the viewer's throats. It does have a viewpoint, as do most films, and here and there it definitely does drive home the point of the Algiers' need for freedom from the militant oppression of France.But what struck me most about how Pontecorvo and his collaborators (both screenwriter and producer as the latter of which had complete first hand contact with the events and plays an acting part), is how he approached violence and its effect on an urban climate. Through Pontecorvo's camera, we see the ugly side to both sides, even the one that we should be rooting for. France is the (supposedly unintentional) oppressor here, and in this time frame had made them a colonial power for decades, and in order to sustain order and track down their 'targets' in 1957 they go from complete militarization (shown quite starkly and simply, and like a good would-be neorealist 'as it is if we are right there') to torture tactics. Their acts of violence and brutality are however given the other side of the coin in the scenes where the lieutenant Colonel of the French troops Matthieu (played by the great Jean Martin) talks to the press or lays out his point of view in scenes. Then the other side of the Algiers, those who are fighting back early on in the film with guerrilla-like terrorist tactics go to lengths to make their messages clear through seemingly random but daunting acts of violence. Pontecorvo's point in showing both sides is almost complex while seeming simple- neither side is right when it comes to committing violence against one another in this situation. It's a very powerful statement made that doesn't cut corners, of the truth that still permeates of a first-world power, already very adept in their military powers from past (proud) military conflicts who can't seem to let up from giving the people they say they want to help and provide some leeway in establishing their own government and freedom despite the fervent opposition. Sound familiar?At any rate, the real success behind this message- which could've been done on the flip-side with a lot of pumped melodrama- is by making it a kind of hybrid of doc and fiction. Unlike Memories of Underdevelopment, which would come out 2 years after this in Cuba, it's never exactly certain when the footage is even dramatized or not. And there are two aspects to what Pontecorvo covers in his purely cinematic style that totally serves his content. One is how he deals with crowds, with the dirty city life of the Arab section of Algiers where all the madness, chaos, and just frustration takes place, in range from the scenes of people walking by in burkas to reveal themselves as the 'enemy' with guns, to those startling sequences of the revolutions and multi-militant post. The other one is how Pontecorvo deals with his 'subjects', as one might call them, as they are all save for one non-actors. Like directors before him (mentioned above) and after (like Fernando Meirelles) the filmmaker here is after the right look on people, and in going almost as a bystander at times getting these people. The guy playing La Pointe- the center of the film (an illiterate petty criminal turned major terrorist)- isn't particularly 'good', but he doesn't need to be. His face tells all. In maybe my favorite scene in the film, when a female from the Algiers section sneaks into a quasi-dance hall in the European section, we get various shots of the faces of the patrons as well as her own. None are professional, which obviously adds to the complexities of this scene. Who's innocent and who's guilty in this world? Sometimes there are some very brutal moments in the film, and then there are others that sometimes even work just as a usual, well, thriller. Here and there I almost felt like I was watching a more recent film without taking into account how it might have influenced a few directors over time. With one of his best early scores via Ennio Morricone, and some uncompromising details with the multiple deaths in the film, The Battle of Algiers does come quite close to being one of those 'essential' films of the 1960's, where a political attitude or need to put onto film a time and place in the world was captured. And if it has at least a little relevance for some military-style situations of the now (and I am not at all anti-US, but the comparisons could be made with bits in the film) its a credit to the filmmakers that its basically the film they wanted to make, with a freedom relatable to the doomed characters on the side of Algiers.",10,1,3,3 June 2006
The Patriot," Good, not great- melodramatic but tense and action filled.
","Roland Emmerich has been known to bring to the screen such films as Independence Day, Godzilla and The Thirteenth Floor. While these films are good in the sci-fi action sense, he has never done drama or war (I never thought he would do war). But he does here, and he brings a 18th century/revolutionary war film that hasn't been matched (in my eyes) since Barry Lyndon. Mel Gibson is the perfect choice in the role as Benjamin Martin (he has his second soldier role here, the 1st was in Braveheart) as he embodies drama, action and goodness in one big whollop. If you know history, you already know half the plot in this movie before even seeing it.The other half shows a veteran of the war in 1763 who doesn't want to be apart of the Revolution, but is pulled in by revenge and payback (and for the clause). Great entertainment, as another example of war and it's horrors is shown here. One of the better films of 2000. A-",7,0,6,29 June 2000
Edward Scissorhands," a sweet film that portrays the good and bad in suburban life with originality
","Every couple of years I sit and watch Edward Scissorhands when it's on TV, just as a reminder of how much Tim Burton can do so well storytelling on a kind of universal level. As the film is much like a fairy tale like the Ugly Duckling, it can work for young and old. But it would be just a very good children's film if not for Burton's iconoclastic kind of vision, which has its form here in one of its most pure sightings (as he rarely writes his own films, this is one of the few that mark as his completely). The characters are not complicated at all, and anything standing between the two who fall for one another- Johnny Depp's Edward and Winona Ryder's Kim- is just attitudes in a small town kind of atmosphere. It's actually a film even more based on behavior than actual plot, and despite the absurdity nature given to the look of the town and the obviously Gothic look of Vincent Price's Professor's castle, it's as much a tome of American drama as American Beauty is, in its way.Depp is in his breakout performance here, with the role that took him apart from his 21 Jump Street days as a character who could just as well work, if not better, as a silent-film character. In fact, the kind of Lon Chaney characteristic that's been applied to Depp in the past years is more than evident in this film, as his wounded Edward has a vulnerability that Depp rarely gets to play this well. The roundup of supporting actors is quite good too, with Dianne Weist as the housewife who finds him in the castle and takes him down to the town. Ryder too is in a good role too, especially when playing off of the very against type Anthony Michael Hall (yes, the Breakfast Club nerd) as a jock who becomes quite an antagonist. The little scenes of Edward acclamating to the small-town life, cutting and shaping hair and bushes his specialty, are interesting and amusing. But it's in the final fifteen to twenty minutes when the darker portion of this tale takes shape. And, it's likely, aside from scenes in Big Fish, the most affecting Burton's ever fashioned.One of the better films of 1990.",9,2,4,8 April 2006
The White Ribbon," about life and death in a small town, or anywhere
","There is a very important scene in Michael Haneke's new film The White Ribbon, which is on the surface about a series of crimes and deaths and strange occurrences in a small German town around 1913-14 before WW1. In fact it's one of those rare scenes in movies where it had me tearing up, almost without knowing entirely why until after the movie ended, from its existential significance. A little boy's father, a doctor, has been injured after being on a horse that was tripped over by a wire left mysteriously tied up. The woman taking care of him assures him he'll be alright, that he won't die or anything. Then the little boy asks her 'What is dead?' The boy is so innocent and unknowing of anything about death that she has to explain to him, holding back some tears, about death (specifically about his mother), and that she will die, just some time later. It puts him in a foul mood, to say the least.While I can't be sure if Haneke meant for this to be a key scene, it feels like one. A mystery is taking place where all of these things are being done (the horse-trip wire and doctor's injured, a woman is found dead, a barn is set on fire in the middle of the night, a retarded boy is beaten mercilessly and left in the woods), and by the end of the film it's really hard to say exactly who did it. We might believe the Schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) and his theory that it was some of the children who perpetrated these acts, as they were present at some of the occurrences, but, as with something like Zodiac, Haneke makes no claims and nothing is resolved. Which works fine, except that there is something that those in the town know and know perhaps all too well: death is a certainty, be it by disease or war or some other act. And as well, as Haneke also wants us to leave the theater knowing, evil is pervasive and starts at the dinner table or behind closed-doors.It's a bleak story, something that, maybe obviously, echoes some of the emotional dread conjured by Ingmar Bergman (there's one scene specifically, when the Doctor stops his midwife woman from trying to arouse him and berates her about how she looks, kicking her out of her job and his life, that looks especially cribbed from Bergman, lovingly of course). But it's really Haneke all the way, and anyone who has seen some of his solid previous works (Funny Games not included here though some might) know his attitude towards the evil in men, women and even children. It doesn't just spring out of nowhere, and bad deeds aren't just committed out of boredom. His message is strong on this point: in repressed societies, where punishment and brutality are an unspoken given, and sex and love is kept down (except, of course, for things like molestation as we find out in a shocking night-scene), and where people, ultimately, start to forget about these crimes after a time, it's very likely a Nazi regime could come about twenty years later (the mention of WW1 isn't subtle, though it is effective).The White Ribbon is, as they say, an 'art' film, but this is not a bad thing for Haneke. He paints with his camera in black and white a very cold and rural environment, often marked by dark rooms at night and shocking images like the barn burning at night or when a character discovers a suicide by hanging (listen to the audio there, by the way, for the irony in children playing in the distance). It's an unrelenting tale with multiple story lines that all feel crucial, especially the character of the Pastor who most of all comes from that 19th century time of being a 'tough-love' father, always with a cane by his side. And there's some fantastic acting throughout, and some really haunting-beautiful images conjured up in these scenes of silence, or a camera placed specifically at a door or at a dinner table. There's a lot going on here.If there is a criticism, however minor, it's on the narration. I found there to be just a little too much at times, too much explaining or telling the story in such a way that, while from the reminiscing of the teacher, didn't do much to add to what was on screen (it also may be covering up points as Haneke had planned this originally as a mini-series). It's not all bad, but it does get distracting, albeit usually done over shots of snow and fields and the town that bring out the emptiness and chill of the countryside. For those who are ready for Haneke's level of moral expurgation, of indicting humanity, not just Germany or modern-day Muslims (as he's been quoted saying, again repression), it's breathtaking and provocative. And if you leave knowing a little more about life and death, there's another point to take in favor of the film. It's a genuine article of classic cinema.",10,7,22,22 January 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," kids will find it to be like chocolate cotton candy in a silver platter. everyone else, it's a coin toss
","As a critic, or perhaps would-be one most days, when facing a movie like Monsters vs Aliens it's about context: I can recommend this movie about as highly as possible to anyone under the age of 12, because frankly, the producers and writers tried their hardest (and maybe succeeded) to create this movie in a lab so that it would reach that audience to the maximum. It's got bright and colorful monsters with singular personalities that keep kids entertained, including Insectosaurus who looks like a cross between Totoro and Godzilla and never utters a word, and some of those goofy gags and occasional physical bits of business that, from what I could hear seeing the movie with a nicely sized crowd, did the job well.As for everyone else- teens, young adults, kids' parents, the elderly, miscellaneous or other people I've forgotten to mention- it'll be hit or miss. This will depend on how many of these animated movies or sci-fi movie that the movie alludes to or just flagrantly rips off that tickle the funny bone. Sometimes, for me at least, they tried a little too hard. There's one joke in particular that is a perfect example, where the President (voiced by Stephen T. Colbert, who should be the best thing about the movie but isn't, a minor but significant disappointment) goes up to a keyboard to communicate with the aliens. This was funny if just for a moment because of the recognition of Close Encounters. It was a quick little gag that worked. But as though the filmmakers thought no one under the age of 20 would get it, they extended it, having the President go into playing a 'funky' version of the Beverly Hills Cop theme by Herbie Hancock. It doesn't matter that kids probably wouldn't know it either. It just goes on too long and is too knowing of its goofiness to actually be funny after a while.Again, this is for those who may actually get the references. For kids, this is silliness on an epic scale that will keep their jaws drooling with the laughs. At the least there's a very good voice cast assembled- aside from fairly straightforward leads like Reese Witherspoon there's Seth Rogen and Hugh Laurie as monsters and Rainn Wilson as the evil alien set to make clones of him/itself to take over Earth- and it does have wonderful animation. Following soon after Dreamworks' success last year with Kung fu Panda they kick it up another notch in terms of the quality of its style, its detail (even a burger, yes a burger, shown early in the picture is fairly incredible), and in how it whips along from one cool sight to another. If eye candy is your thing, this is the thing for the, uh, month I guess (I actually bucked the trend and saw it in 2D, and it didn't seem to lose much of its 'umph' in the regular format).Everything works on that surface level, but then when it comes to the characters and plot, whatever there is of it, it falls into some predictable things, or just ideas and motions that seem too familiar even as goofy homage. As comedy it doesn't come anywhere near Dreamworks' first big hits with Antz and Shrek, and as all-around entertainment it's a split decision. Parents wont be bored entirely, but they'll be the ones tugging their kids arms to see Pixar's Up! following the trailer more than the other way around.",6,2,5,12 April 2009
Save the Last Dance," Nothing really to save here
","Save the Last Dance is corniness, lameness and unfactual mish mash and if that's your thing, go for it, but I must say I was dissapointed with this new film from MTV.  While it is sometimes convincing with some moments, I just got tired of this whole formula.  Plus, how is it that the Sarah Johnson character (Julia Stiles plays her but isn't that great) who has lives in the midwest most of her life around white people can just come into a Chicago ghetto and in 2 days start being black?  I just can't follow the logic on this plus many of the other characters here.  Oh well. C",4,0,0,6 January 2001
Rocky IV," need a montage? look no further
","Rocky IV represents a time in American cinema that doesn't exist anymore. Even with the recent years bringing America's 'War on Terror', nothing really comes close to America's years of US vs the Russians propaganda. While John Wayne was still in his grave in 1985, Sylvester Stallone took up the mantel with two films that year that, to him at least, were created to galvanize the good ol' American spirit of kicking ass in foreign territory. Indeed, there isn't too much of a line of subtle difference to draw between Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV. Both feature Stallone's quintessential TOUGH stars, who have lots of conflict but, save for the first film in their respective franchises, aren't really very large and looming. But if you'd rather not have the rabid onslaught of senseless murder in Rambo, just go for the onslaught of senseless training montage and all-Americana vs *very* scary Russian imagery.Oh, this is such slanted stuff, the kind of material that is like the last flailing erection of an America reigned by the Regan administration. But why not have some fun with it? Rocky IV is so silly that it somehow is able to top the adrenaline-reigning montages of Rocky III (and that had 'Eye of the Tiger' so you know what you're getting into), and its silliness with Mr. T and Hulk Hogan, two non-boxers fighting in the ring. Rocky IV is all about the supposedly unstoppable Russian, propped up by a Russian government and society that looks to be the cinematic expression of one of those PSA's from the 1950s. And to compound this America vs Russia 'thing', at first Apollo Creed decides to fight Drago, only to tumble to his doom, under the limelight of James Brown's 'Living in America' no less! You'll be one of two audiences with Rocky IV: you'll either be, somehow, actually pumped up by all of this brawn vs brawn stuff, with Stallone's very unlikely run up a mountain (yes, a frigging mountain) contrasted with the kind of training regiment for Lundgren's big giant that it would make the Terminator wince, or you'll have a lot of laughs and bewildered exchanges with your friends or loved ones. I fall into the latter, but it doesn't necessarily make Rocky IV a 'bad' movie. It's sense of montage and hilariously stupid 80s songs are shoddy at times, specifically the first of many as Stallone drives in the car and sees clips of ALL of the past movies. But its heart is strong and fierce, and its sense of its one-sided stance of Americana (which even includes things like rich Americans having the right to have funny robots) turns into a guilty pleasure that's hard to ignore, if you're in the right mood.Then again, it is a good thing things like this aren't around really anymore... much. Even Stallone kept Rocky Balboa (2006's 'final' Rocky) more squared on the character and history than on politics, and even 2008's Rambo was more centered on a conflict in Burma that seemed ideal for a disillusioned outcast like old Rambo. But as a time capsule, it could be a lot worse. It could be Rocky V! And, thankfully, it is not.",6,0,2,26 July 2009
Dreamgirls," a disappointment, even if my expectations weren't high to begin with
","I should say it up front, I don't dislike the R&B of the period, as is given tribute via Dreamgirls. I liked hearing the harmonies of groups like the Supremes or other soul groups (I'm assuming Eddie Murphy's performance is inspired by a mix of James Brown and Otis Redding, or others I can't think of right now). I never heard of Dreamgirls before the movie came out. I decided against seeing the movie in the theaters, not because of any outright bias against the actors or the potential of the songs, but because of the trailer. Sometimes a theatrical trailer can sort of spell out, boldly, what the big picture will be. It was something that didn't appeal to me most of all because of the absolute, dreadful appearance of safe, conventional appeal. One might think the director of challenging efforts like Gods and Monsters and Kinsey might try and make a musical with more verve, more soul, more 'UMPH', if that's the word. And as a director, Condon did pretty much meet that expectation.What I didn't expect, and what ended up annoying me about Dreamgirls, is how much the performances, with maybe the slightest exception, fell flat on itself. It's a subjective thing, of course; there's been praise to the sky for the work that Jennifer Hudson and others in the film have done in presenting the usual rags-to-riches-then-some-more-trials-and-tribulations musical story. Which is nothing I can really blame anyone on, as the film does appeal for a core audience that can't get enough of BIG vocals, BIG numbers, FLASHY personalities that pop and go into the, well, expected for 2-dimensional parts (if that). But, for the life of me, I could not stand most of the characters, or the actors playing them, in Dreamgirls.Jennifer Hudson has been praised most of all, given accolades as a new rising star following her stint on American Idol, and with vocals that, basically, go to a vocal *volume* that is impressive. But volume alone does not a good musical performance make! I never believed her as Effie, not once, except as, in a way, like some big near parody of one of these bigger-than-life and bigger-than-Pete's-sake-ego black women who are so stubborn that it's about as hard as hell to have any sympathy. The character of Effie is meant as the pivotal one, the one whom has the BIG personality, and ends up making a BIG mistake. But Hudson can't fill the shoes, as she just doesn't have the acting talent for it. She was chose for her singing skills, which for her means to belt out every number like she has to reach even the little guy in the back row in Giants Stadium. Aside from the fact, like everyone else, she has to sing such songs that have only so minimal a range with lyrics and tone (the most prominent number, in the 'break-up' scene in the middle of the film, stops the film in its tracks, and not in a good way). I'm in the minority, but she's one of the worst things about Dreamgirls.But on the flip-side, there's another actor, Jamie Foxx, who despite his actual talents, both at acting and as Ray showed singing, is probably just as ineffectual and, dare I say it in his own way, dull in the part of the domineering manager of the Dreamgirls. There's practically no range for this character for Foxx to play in, and has for 2/3 of the film the exact look on his face, as, through also fault in the script, goes through the motions as with every other bio-pic of a star group of the past. Only the ending tries to give any dimension, which by the end is far too late and even awkward. Beyonce and the other actress do maybe a little better, which is to say they're adequate in the parts. Only Eddie Murphy, who in a sense is just playing a sort of abstracted version of his egocentric self from many other movies he's been in (and better ones, ala Bowfinger, also speaking of himself in the third person), and for his musical numbers does add a bit of a lift to the proceedings. I almost expected from some of the early Murphy/Lightning scenes that the movie wouldn't be very much special, but at least could be easily watchable.Not a chance; as much as I would want to admire a movie with soul about the soul era's glory of the 60s and 70s, it lacks the passion that could make it a real contender in a time with so few musicals. The trailer also tempts that this will have some strong dramatic direction. Here, too, Condon falters where there needs to be a stronger vision, and he doesn't pull it off (the montages, for example, of the rising star variety for the Dreamgirls in the mid 60s, feels as shallow and empty as anything I could imagine in a summer blockbuster). Now, a lot of people will like this movie, a lot. Maybe I'm just not entirely in the demographic. But Dreamgirls, for me, makes a fatal flaw for a movie musical- the fun and spirit and melding of what works on the stage to the screen clicks off, and the chance for the unexpected is null and void. It made me feel depressed in its lack of respect for the viewer overwhelmed with clichés.",4,1,4,7 January 2008
In the Name of the Father," a son, a father, and the damning of the Irish (or any damned group)
","In the movie In the Name of the Father, we get a story involving injustice - people who are accused and found guilty of crimes they didn't commit - but why it works is centrally two things: even if you don't know a thing about the IRA (though it might help to know just a little) or the struggles in Belfast in the 1970's and how it involved the United Kingdom, people see injustice happening every day, with many races. If one were to put this on a double bill with the Burns doc The Central Park Five, the coincidences would be extraordinary: the rampant torture via police to the accused, the lack of any strong legal defense, and the tampering of evidence. There is that aspect, the US against THEM element, which is simple enough. But trickier, and what works greater, is the father son element of the story, where Daniel Day Lewis is Gerry Conlon is in prison for life along with his father (a very innocent man) Giuseppe, who is there for the simple reason of accused corroboration.In a way it's probably the most accessible film that has been made, that I can think of off the top of my head, about the controversies and 'war' of the IRA over the years. I don't see Sheridan taking sides either way exactly with the IRA except for the fact of the killing innocent people, those 'innocent bystanders' that die in that pub bombing, is very wrong. The context and framing of it is what counts; Conlon had no real political aspirations either way, and when we first see him, he's basically a young punk/hippie who gets chased by IRA guards as they think his stick is a sniper. He goes to London to cool off/find work/hang low, and it's actually in the scene where he first is going off - by the ship - that he and his father have the interaction that speaks to what will come: Giuseppe is a natural, loving father, maybe at worst a little awkward or 'normal', while Gerry is just a young, aimless youth, uncomfortable with any affection or care.The crime and arrest happen due to the sort of circumstances that happens with Wrong Man scenarios (not the Hitchcock sort, to be sure). The Wrong-Place-Wrong-Time thing, and it leads one of the most harrowing section of the film, where Conlon is interrogated. Day-Lewis here is explosive, charged, frightened, crying, under mental and physical abuse, but yet he keeps it all in check. Another actor might have gone over the top here, but somehow it always feels just right, calibrated even in the highly charged emotional range. Then he and the others are found guilty (oh darn that homeless alibi!) and sent off to prison.Apparently, according to Ebert's review, some facts were shuffled around to add to the drama - namely that the Conlon father/son shared a cell. Perhaps it is convenient dramatically speaking, and there's even a period in these years they're in there together, that Gerry spends less time with his dad, trying to escape through drugs and other (somehow friendly) prisoners. If there's one issue with this mid-section involving prison, it's that most everyone - with the exception perhaps until the other Irish man (no spoilers here) comes to prison - gets along and there's no real horror to go through. Maybe that's kind of refreshing in a sense, usually prison is shown in movies as a very rough place. If anything the political situation - the Conlons being innocent - makes it the most frenetic and harried for Gerry and his father.But, again, it's the tone of this personal side, just showing DDL and Postlethwaite together, that makes the film work so well. We may hope, and see it probably as conventional, that Gerry is set in these injustice-wheels and everything's spinning until he can get help (in the form here of Emma Thompson, in maybe the only one-dimensional role in the film, not that she is poor in any way acting-wise). But deep down, the bond between these two is what counts, and Gerry's own growth as a person is marked as he spends more time behind bars. So In the Name of the Father is successful on the fronts of what the story is about, but also how it's about it via its emotional stakes, especially in the third act when things become uncertain for the decent father. And if anything, as great as Lewis is (and that's a given, of course, look at his track record), Postlethwaite rises up to be his equal. In sort, an acting masters class in what is mostly a heavy film, with a lot of heart and (even once or twice, early on before the s*** goes down) a little light-heartedness.",9,0,0,1 June 2015
Being John Malkovich," The Best Film I Have Seen in a Decade.
","'Being John Malkovich' has it all.  Comedy, drama, romance, and a whole lot more.  But more importantly it is original.  And when I mean original I mean this film is the most original piece of work I've seen in decades.  Nothing like this has ever been made, and seeing how it's original, nothing like it will ever be made again.  And this is for three reasons:1: The acting, which is some of the best of the year and then some.  John Cusack in a warped role as the odd puppeteer, Cameron Diaz as his pet store working wife, Katherine Keener as the devilish office worker, and as himself in his best role ever, John Malkovich as the only person he could perfectly play- himself.2: The script, which is the most original funny and odd one in years to come around.  Who could've ever thought of a normal person going into the brain of an famous (Oscar nominated) actor- and coming out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike?!  And when Malkovich goes inside the portal into his own brain, he finds a whole restaurant full of himselfs.  I think that is weirder than anything you could see in you're entire life (when not on drugs)     and 3: The Director, Spike Jonze.  This is Spike Jonze's first adventure into feature films (he was and still is and actor and music video director) and it is probably what he will be most remembered for.  Unlike some other directors, Spike doesn't take a scene and go on to another, he actually expands on his ideas and works with them to their maximum potential.  
Along with a funny script, a surprise at every turn, and a hilarious cameo with Charlie Sheen, this film is definitely in my top ten of the year and the decade.  Magnefike.  A++",10,13,26,13 January 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," a healthy reminder that sex jokes can be well crafted; Carrell is genius
","Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of 'how is he going to tell her such and such' might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small.The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year.",8,115,174,21 August 2005
Face_Off," could be preposterous... actually, it is, but Woo,Travolta/Cage make it astounding and entertaining
","John Woo hit a high-point in his US film career in Face/Off, where he took the method of filming action scenes like mad operas (or the other way around) that he did in a film like Hard Target and put it in the context of an actually strong script. This doesn't mean that the concept that's presented - that a terrorist who knows where a gigantic bomb in LA will detonate, and is now in a coma, and whose face is ripped off and put on the secret agent who was tracking him for years so the agent can find out the bomb's whereabouts and then the terrorist wakes up from the coma and puts on the agent's face - is entirely plausible. Not for a second. The film was originally set in the future, which is easy to see, and in other hands (less capable ones) it could be a stupid sci-fi channel original movie.In John Woo he sees that the character set-ups and relationships are way too strong to ignore, and the line drawn between supposed good and bad can be blurred in the face of such an outrageous/clever premise. He hits new heights in filming his action sequences, from the gun battles (and boy there's a lot) to the big motor-boat chase that happens as the climax, to little but wild things like putting 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' for just a half a minute in a blazing gun battle scene. The action has that thrilling sensation of movement and dazzle that Woo had in his HK flicks; if any film comes closest to the relentless intensity of something like Hard Boiled, it's this one (and you know it's just shamelessly by its maker in that church scene, with the doves and the church and the guns and the Mexican stand-off and so on).I haven't mentioned the stars yet? This is a must to understand the appeal of Face/Off (or, for some, the lack thereof). Nicolas Cage and John Travolta get to have their cake and eat it, play the good but conflicted hero agent Archer (Travolta-cum-Cage) and the overly dastardly villain who just likes to have FUN in big capital letters (Cage-cum-Travolta). While the writing creates some subtext as to deeper levels of interpretation- I'm sure the film could easily be a Jungian thesis project- the actors just enjoy trying (and succeeding) to catch up to Woo's level of high-voltage action and mayhem. Both actors eat up scenery, or sometimes just let the double-level of meaning in the scene take over. When Cage dances in the Priest-frock and sings with the chorus, we know he's going to town, and when Travolta (as that character) smokes a cigarette the first time around his daughter ('Papa's got a brand new bag') we can feel the gleeful horror in the room.Sure, eventually the characters are put into a matter of just fists-on-fists, which seems to diminish what other variables of outcome these characters could get into. But then again, it's also a not-guilty pleasure of Hollywood popcorn movie-making, smart and effective in drawing out the characters' conflicts and what those around them have to come to realize (or not, as they may be dead sooner rather than later), and, more often than not, it's cheerfully funny in itself. It's like a comic-book concept brought to life and pumped with Woo-stylized bullets and octane - or, in another way, it's like what Michael Bay films try so hard to be and fall flat on their faces in chaos.",9,1,3,21 April 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," a Jedi feeling
","The Men Who Stare at Goats. Just look at that title for a moment. If you knew nothing at all about this movie- didn't know it was about psychic spies (aka 'The First Earth Battalion') who trained to use peaceful means against their enemies, or that it starred three of the finest American actors working (Clooney, Bridges, Spacey) and a Scottsman (McGregor), or that it was a comedy 'mostly based on truth believe it or not'- wouldn't the title just jut out at you? In a way the title is like many of the things that we as the audience come across as we're meant to be with McGregor's journalist character - there's something unbelievable going on, but we have to go along with it, just for a little while. And yet at the same time it's also silly, but it knows its silly. The Men Who Stare at Goats sounds equally official and like a new-wave 80's pop band parody, who may or may not actually stare at goats in order to stop their hearts with their minds.This is, for the most part, an astonishing comedy of the absurd told with a straight face. I was laughing through most of it in some part because of the performances (Clooney as an ex 'Jedi' who was one of the best and brightest of the First Earth Battalion is about as deadpan as we've ever seen him, and Bridges comes off like The Dude from the Big Lebowski with more spiritual discipline as a leader), how all of the major players worked off one another and made themselves truthful and honest even when saying or doing ridiculous things like yoga in a desert or gaining energy through the power of dance.But the other thing that makes the movie so brilliant is its style. This is a gonzo comedy, but it's in the subject matter. First time director Grant Heslov doesn't do anything too crazy with the style of the camera or editing (save maybe for Clooney 'projecting' himself through the sky while listening to Boston's 'More Than a Feeling'), so we see it with the same straight face that someone like Bob from Ann Arbor Michigan Press would see it. Or, for that matter, while reading the book, which is based on a real psychic squad of soldiers in a (now semi) secret program run by the US government. Whether or not the soldiers really could run through walls by focusing hard enough or see what was inside of metal containers or if Angela Lansbury knew where Noriega was or if a scrotum could... OK, perhaps I've said too much, what matters is just that they believed it, and it became more like religion than warfare.It's a farce loaded with dry and high wit, and infectious performances. There's some dark moments as well, like with Clooney's Lyn with his crisis of his being with killing that goat (i.e. how can he be redeemed and will he die from being touched with an ancient martial arts move, or something else I wouldn't spoil just for story sake), but its really about seeing these people in the nature of a subversive system within a system. It's got a touch of the Dr. Strangelove to it, not reaching its satirical heights but emulating it just enough to branch off and do its own thing. That, plus a fitting homage to those psychedelic B movies of the 60s where, as the climax, there's just lots and lots of tripping (again, seen through the camera with a clear eye and mind), makes it almost poignant. Almost, that is, if one weren't laughing their head off, which I did quite a lot. Overall, it's a minor riot, particularly if you can't get enough of Jedi 'jokes', uproarious running gag style, around a dumbfounded Ewan McGregor.",8,8,18,6 November 2009
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," more twists than a pretzel factory, but it's all about the set pieces
","One of the things that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie knows with his first big leap into a franchise such as M:I is this: sometimes you got to take from the best. Case in point is probably my favorite set piece in this movie - and needless to say, the set pieces are what makes it work ultimately, past the plot, which I may or may not get to later - in an opera house in Vienna. Everyone is seated watching this big opera going on, while Ethan Hunt (good ol' Mr. Cruise) is trying to track down an assassin who he saw in London and may try (or will) take out the Chancellor of Austria. There may be more than one assassin (indeed the entrance of this particular woman spy is as elegant as you'd expect, in a dress walking up a staircase, as one might expect in such a movie, but I digress). And there's another issue, which is that the clock is ticking to one point: the crescendo of a note to 'Tempo' (I think that's it, whatever) when a singer hits such a high point that an assassin can somehow shoot the Chancellor from afar and the performance can keep going on without interruption.Sound at all familiar? Hitchcock did almost the same sequence - a concert with the note as the tipping point for the killer - in The Man Who Knew Too Much (34 and 56), and I'd best my car and my apartment that McQuarrie's studied Hitchcock like a doctor facing final exams. And yet he makes the sequence his own, making suspenseful moments building at every step, not to mention with Simon Pegg's tech-guy Benji on the laptop, as a fight ensues, the targets get aimed up, and then the fall out to try to escape. There may be moments during this and other times in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation where one credits the logic of how things are unfolding; why there aren't more guards at this opera, for example, or better surveillance or better controls over this and that. But McQuarrie also knows, for the worldwide audience for this kind of movie, your logic has to only take it so far while watching it.There are MANY things that happen in Rogue Nation, and there are so many plot points and twists and turns - allegiances one questions, motives that are difficult to pin-point, and did I mention logic - that it'd be too much to sum it up in an IMDb comment. All you need to know is: Hunt's group, the IMF (not the International Monetary Fund.. I think, anyway) has been compromised and dismantled, and folded into the CIA (which doesn't seem to do much, don't they have operatives, again, questions I ask now leaving the theater). Now there's a 'Syndicate' that is like the Anti-IMF, dismantling major financial organizations, killing leaders, and so on. Only Hunt can face this 'Syndicate' and its head, Lane, a very sinister-ly performed by Sean Harris, who is another in a long line of villains who have cold blood running through veins and minds like reinforced-titanium traps. Or something.In other words, tension and suspense for the heroes, and another character here, like Renner in the previous movie (Ghost Protocl), who is hard to trust, played by Rebecca Ferguson. There were so many twists and turns in this story, as I said, that it neared the point of ludicrousness. How much can one take not knowing who to trust or what the British really want or who set up what organization? Well, a lot, as it turns out. Though I reached a point in the third act where I thought, 'Alright, I give up, I don't know where this is going and it's kind of dumb', I was never really THAT confused, and I have to give credit to McQuarrie and his team for keeping things moving slickly and with a kind of intelligence about the improbability (no, uh, 'Impossible'-ity, and the word of the title is literally used in the movie at one point.An example of that is the set piece involving a free-swim to change an entire hard-drive, under-water, for Pegg to get information for this and that and the other thing. How does this really work out? Does oxygen really work that way? Didn't I see this kind of mission years ago in a Ninja Turtles Nintendo game, with the same 'Oxygen' bar? But, hey, whatever, it's a ride, and just flippin' go with it. Though this will be a blockbuster that has a fairly indestructible hero, the fun really seems to be, after five movies it's more than clear enough, how he doesn't completely break after certain violent and hazardous scenarios. Hell, the movie starts off with the scene everyone sees in the trailer, with Hunt hanging off the side of a plane mid-air, asking with some impatience for Benji to open the door.So, all in all, McQuarrie paying a kind of Hitchcock-on-steroids tribute with Rogue Nation, with a top shelf cast as always (Alec Baldwin for one) and as far as mindless Hollywood action tent-poles go with delirious chases and death-defying, nearly cartoonish levels of peril, it's better than most. And hey, at the least, the heroine remembers to run without her heels this time. 7.5/10",7,2,4,31 July 2015
Spider-Man," it's get better as time and viewings go on
","Sam Raimi to me didn't seem like not the wrong choice to direct Spiderman but the un-needed choice- at least at first. The screenplay would've fit any director whose a fan of Spiderman since it entails most of the clichés and knowledge that goes into a comic book adaptation. But after repeat viewings, and seeing Spider-Man 2 more as well, I've grown some more respect for a picture that I thought of at first as being as nothing more than something of Raimi going 'mega Hollywood' in telling the origin of Peter Parker. In this first installment, he fights the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe in a dual personality type role with Norman Osborne. Watching the movie, I liked the set up parts and the connection between Maguire and Dunst is there, but on the outset when I saw it early on I was not so much a fan of the action sequences, which compared to Raimi's grittier (and funnier to be sure) Evil Dead movies, are so fabricated they might as well have credited Pixar as one of the production companies. The work though shows a little better once settled further into the Parker saga, and the real skills come through better. And compared to others that have come out in more recent years, it is exciting in ways other action set pieces from other comic book movies aren't. I even dig the performances more too, especially Willem Dafoe as Osbourne/Green Goblin, who puts as much gnarly relish into his performance that it ranks up there with his best work. Maybe part of it too is accepting Maguire as Parker/Spiderman, as he has an awkwardness early on that's uncanny. But it fits, and it perhaps grows in the sequel(s), and seeing it again I appreciate what he's doing in the character. In short, it's fun, and that's all we can really ask for. B+",8,7,20,25 May 2002
Jarhead," a movie, like it's lead character, in inner conflict
","I can't deny that Sam Mendes's new film Jarhead has some power to it- that he and his director of photography (Roger Deakins) create some immensely evocative images, or that there isn't a little thought stirring around within the context of the story and premise. But my problem with it was in something that has kept other war films of years past afloat (though this time more a film about the Marines than any sort of 'war')- there's some sense of emotional connection with the characters. There's something sort of, well, empty at times with the film's situations and details and characters. I can't say either that 'not a lot happens', because in the sense of it being a character study there is...though on the other hand, there isn't. It's like there is a great film stirring around inside of the film's core, but Mendes is more often than not here going for amazement with the lens as opposed with characters that one can really care about. I'm not saying others won't, in a way it has the makings of a true 'cult' movie (not unlike one of its main influences, Full Metal Jacket- almost disgustingly so). On the one hand I think that things like atmosphere, composition, style especially in some bursts (there is one scene where the soldiers come upon a 'burnt' scene that is the most staggering in the film, maybe the best overall), maybe even Oscar-worthy. However, from a director who's past two films were far more engaging on their stories and characters, this is a bit disappointing.As I said, I didn't dislike the film, in fact at times some of the acting tried to suffice (and sometimes not). Jake Gyllenhaal's Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford is a performance of some brilliance, if some over-doing. He's come a bit of ways since his Donnie Darko days, though one wishes that he could tap a little more into Swoff, with his Camus fascination and its projection onto the arid, boring desert life of Saudi Arabia. Stellan Saarsgard as his 'friend' Troy, a fellow 'bad-ass' kind of Marine, gives maybe the better of the performances of the main crop, adding a certain tenderness (or vulnerability) to the part, behind his mostly rough exterior. Jamie Foxx plays himself, only with a Sergeant frame of mind this time. And there is an assortment of supporting players rounding up the lot, with a mix that ranges from being fascinating to odd to downright conventional. There are times when the actors do try and make things entertaining, and it is (the 'interviews' sequence is funny, if again a FMJ take-off). It's just the 'heavy-ness' that gets it down in the end. I would see this movie again, and I was glad I saw it, but I can't recommend it as highly as I wish I could.",8,3,5,17 November 2005
Collateral," constantly re-watchable with entertaining storytelling, a good serious neo-noir
","Michael Mann's skills as storyteller, stylist, and controller of mood and psychology of characters is in one of its finest forms in Collateral, a summer blockbuster that's with equal measure of excitement and thought, dark humor and tough moments of violence and suspense. It's also one of only a handful of times in Tom Cruise's career where taking a chance dramatically with a complex character pays off. It's a 100 million dollar+ grossing movie, but its story could just as well be one set in the noirs of the 40s and 50s- a cabbie with some aspirations for his own business (and for a girl he picks up at the start of the film) gets taken over by a hit-man who's doing his rounds of murders all in one night. There's also cops on the trail, as well as FBI, but it's really more than anything about these two guys and the very stark, expected but still compelling climax. After the set-up gets underway, the film is as much character study as a typical crime thriller, and it's one of those splendid examples of style matching substance, where both contain some unconventional bits in what could have been a lesser film.Along with a good script by Stuart Beattie, and Mann's perfectly nuanced digital night-time photography (more suitable and exacting for the mood than the recent Miami Vice), there's the acting. First, of course, are the stars with Cruise in a turn-around role as the antagonist, who spouts out little bits of Darwin and I-Ching, but for the most part is a stone-cold sociopath. Cruise, wonderfully uncharacteristic for what he usually does in his star vehicles, is more low-key, ominous, and at the end quite dangerous. Jamie Foxx, too, in his real deserved Oscar-nominated turn, is also unconventional here as a common guy who's put between a rock and a hard place. Maybe his best scene, or at least the one I would show as him being a much better actor than he sometimes gets credit for, is when he has to meet Felix (Javier Bardem) to get a new 'list' of people for Vincent. That and a few other scenes are both tense and with an undercurrent of cynical, harsh humor that helps balance out the dark nature of the events.Collateral is also pretty re-watchable for a fan of this kind of picture, with a great score/soundtrack, great locations, and a couple of interesting ending images.",9,3,6,28 July 2006
Dark City," (director's cut review) This is what it's like to have a dream of cinema...
","Dark City is one of those films that I remember only seeing bits and pieces of over the years; I'd be changing a channel and come upon Dark City and watch maybe a scene, a minute or two, and feel like I was being let in on some secret, or some disturbing dream that I had long ago that stayed in my subconscious. So over the years when I would think back to the film I'd remember these little snatches I'd caught on cable, like Keifer Sutherland explaining something about how memories and time works while going on a rowboat, or some ugly white dudes in big black costumes all in formation. Seeing the film in full finally, I think this was oddly enough an ideal approach: like many of the characters in the film, I have these, well, 'funny' feelings like something is adrift and out of place, that this snatch of a dream of Dark City is something that seems too good to be true as a film. As it turns out, this is one of the richest cinematic experiences from the 1990's.Like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, at least on the surface, it combines genres and does something unique, and in both cases the film language or grammar, the mood and feeling of film-noir (and film-noir may be more of a mood than a 'genre' of course, they stretch from being straight thrillers to psychological horror and even comedies and so on). But with Dark City instead of cartoon comedy we get science fiction. And I don't mean any run of the mill sci-fi, I'm talking sci-fi that's so hard that you can barely break it with a steel brick. The set up seems almost iniquitous as far as film noir tropes go: a man wakes up in a strange place (a hotel, always the best for seedy milieu) and can't remember anything, sees a dead body by the bed, and has to run from the cops and find his identity and what the hell has happened; his wife is a lounge-club singer (cut to lounge and sultry 40's style song); and there's a straight-shooting, curious but hard-liner detective on the case (Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connolly and William Hurt are these roles respectively, and ideally cast).When we start to sort of cross the line with sci-fi, though it could still be in film-noir, is with a peculiar doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland (maybe his greatest role, I dare say, certainly the one he gets to have... fun in an odd way) who goes around with a needs and pricks people's heads for... what? And what's with these white bald guys in the black cloaks and trenchcoats? What about that little kid? All of course, we can assume, will be revealed in good time, and from the opening minutes I knew I was in the hands of a confident storyteller, though there was also a part of me that though 'hmm, could Proyas and his writers be laying on the noir tropes a bit thick? Could this be like a Sin City where it's all style with only a modicum of substance?' Not that the style is off at all, don't get me wrong, it's almost TOO good. And lo and behold, about 35/40 minutes into the movie, we learn why.That moment of discovering what's going on - without saying too much, not to spoil per-say just so you can get the excitement of discovery for yourself - somehow time stops all at once... all except for our hero, John Murdoch, who can't seem to understand why time has stopped. But it's at this moment that I fell in love with Dark City, and felt in sync with what it was going for and trying to do. It's a unique vision but it certainly is inspired by films of the past - Metropolis being one (remember the whole head/heart separation, which is part of the villains' master-plan, Blade Runner to an extent), and maybe even going into comic books there's a pulpy (but smart) sensibility that perhaps is why I also thought of Sin City. Why I fell in love with it is that the whole 'Style' portion, and I keep using that word but it's for good reason, is due to the substance, it's inter-connected with it, can't have one without the other.And as we follow John on this trip of self-discovery it's really a wholly philosophical film, about finding what it means to be us and how it connects back into why we would want to watch ANY movie in the first place, to be connected to others and have that empathic connection. So while Proyas and his stellar production team have this world for us to see (one seemingly always at night but not without good reason!) and with this cast that knocks it out of the park, we get to see a little more and more behind the thematic curtains that come with tales drenched on dark city streets and in nightclubs and backrooms and with dames and cops and criminals... and also in the realm of beings from another dimension or something with their chamber of horrors.Some of the over-stylization may work better for some than others, and by the time it gets to the conclusion things become so wild that it verges into almost being comical (the cgi nears being dated but I'll take it). It's certainly not a movie to watch if you're not ready to engage with it, but it's really among only a handful of movies I can think of (Eraserhead being one) where I felt like I was seeing a motion picture experience that approximated a nightmare.",10,3,5,12 May 2016
Cross of Iron," a little spotty, some acting flaws, but it's still got the verve and punch of a harrowing anti-war classic
","There are reasons I could not recommend Cross of Iron, but they're mostly surrounding little things that strike as being a little more 'ordinary' or just conventional. There's some moralizing from the perspective of the German side, there's a little acting that doesn't quite click (mostly due to accents that are a little forced), and there's only so much character development to keep the story moving. But those facets are tolerable, even sometimes compelling. What does make the movie *highly* recommendable, however, is that as with every film he made, to one degree or another, it's a Sam Peckinpah movie.What you see from Peckinpah is what you get, and this time it's in the form of a war movie. It fits that he would make a war movie; the iconic scenes of the Wild Bunch where Peckinpah lets loose in his style of slow-mo violence on its western heroes, it's like it's ripped out of an operatic battle scene. So is the case with Cross of Iron that Peckinpah is phenomenally successful in portraying war as chaos, as battles rage and it becomes part of the narrative that we don't know who's fighting who.It's in the editing, and in the (occassionally overwrought) slow-motion speed, not to mention the various squibs, that make Cross of Iron hit so harshly. On a low-budget, Peckinpah makes the most of his resources, and relies on montage and the inherent idea that war, especially when on he point of view of the side that will lose, is the most horrible concept realized by men in power. And sometimes Peckinpah, also in tune with his usual idiosyncratic method of editing in other scenes as cut-aways, drives the point home on a psychological level. Steiner (James Coburn) is a good soldier, a very professional one, who will lead his platoon despite the fact, as he tells James Mason's Captain, that he hates the uniform, hates officers, hates himself in his own skin. And sometimes he'll flash to a moment, a visual, that makes his journey all the more personal. Coburn brings it out in his personality, a kind of look that's intense, thoughtful, and always on edge. He plays this dangerous but ethical man to his logical conclusion, leading up to the ending where he finally breaks out in a desperate, maniacal laughter at the absurdity he's in.As said, it's not a great film. It shows that Peckinpah was working with independent financiers that gave him only so much to work with. But it's hard to look away at times from what Peckinpah gives with what he's got. There's one of the most interesting scenes of any war movie here, not in a battle, but in a sort of 'filler' scene- Steiner's platoon comes upon a Russian house full of women, some soldiers, after crossing over a protected bridge. There's a sense of peril in this scene, of multiple rapes about to occur. But then there's a morality here that's expressed too, with an unexpected moment with a sex act, and a naked woman bathing in a barrel. The acting here is some of the best in the movie, where all of the looks from the actors, many of them likely non-professionals, tell all there needs to be said about the smaller tragedies, the ones that get overlooked when looking at the big battles and strategies ala Stalingrad. Peckinpah gets so much right with scenes like these, with taut editing and a graphic vibe, as he does in other portions of the picture, that it's forgivable for what he gets wrong. It's a balancing act he, thanks to Coburn, pulls off excitingly.",8,2,5,5 January 2008
The Machinist," almost in spite of, or despite, the shabby been-there-done-that script, and a near gimmick of weight loss, Bale makes it watchable
","The Machinist is kind of like intellectual counterfeit money, and with a few twists meant to keep some interested and some keeping far as possible away. The more one thinks about the Machinist, the more it's irksome by the cluttered screenplay (Scott Kosar, with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror remakes to his credit), which reveals no surprise, or much suspense, in the mental downfall of one-year insomniac Trevor Reznik (mega-gaunt Christian Bale, even more-so than in the recent, more worthy cause Rescue Dawn) as he keeps seeing a portly bald guy named Ivan who may or may not work at the factory he's a machinist at, and may or may not be dating a prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh), AND who may or may not have taken a little boy Trevor sort of knows as hostage.By the time the obvious twist comes along- the kind that my girlfriend points out about a third of the way through the movie, aw-hell!- there's a feeling of being cheated from the smug retread of better post-modern psycho-twister fables (i.e. Fight Club). That Kosar does 'clever' tricks like putting in Dostoyevsky hints, without ever making much light about why they're there, compounds some of the BS. It's a shame, too, because he sometimes gives these characters some believable dialog (mostly with the machinists and in some of Reznik's talk), without trying to take into account a conceit that is used: an insomniac for a year is, practically, not possible, hence there has to be a catch at some point or another. It's almost like a battle that wages on the creative side of things between director Anderson's very good compositions and (typical-for-this-stuff) lighting, and the script.Meanwhile, Bale holds up, even if after the fact it's a wonder why he went to such extreme lengths for a character like this (i.e. would losing 40 pounds be any different than the whole 60). Bale remains totally captivating, immersing as always in service of the character like the most method m-fer since De Niro, though in the reverse here. Because it is such an extreme transformation- unlike the more gradual turn in Herzog's film- we're called attention to it at times, which is unnerving, and works to a much greater effect as a sign of his deterioration than that of the script providing the mental faculties. But Bale does his best to fill in some emotional blanks, and to his credit makes the Machinist at least a passable effort. That being said, it's hard for me to see myself watching this all the way through again.",6,4,7,23 March 2008
The Intouchables," it's hearts in the right place and never bad, it's just too... safe for me
","I don't doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very much/loving this film to the point where it became one of France's biggest hits in years and then, not surprising in the least, became a Weinstein Company release in the USA. The Intouchables is the epitome of a 'feel-good' buddy movie, the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your 90 year old grandmother and she'll take a liking to it as well (unless they have an aversion to, say, pot or Faberge eggs). It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.Other stuff happens as well, but suffice it to say there's no surprises in this movie. That may not be an issue for most out there. For me, as the movie went along, it was just a little too... safe. That may be a word that doesn't really give much critical credence to what's here, and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy keep things at a good, even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and (sometimes) dismay. Sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a super-typical 'magical negro' stereotype and not let us forget he's from a slightly less educated background (and a little rougher - see his comments about the rich man's adopted daughter when she mouths off). So on the acting front it's perfectly fine and in the first half I was interested in where this would be going.When I say 'safe' I mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters. Any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins (it almost seem,s like Driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts, or those with his sorta-brother, and then come back). Even with the overriding emotional beat of Philippe's correspondent-love-interest, I never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end; there's one little bump in this road, maybe two, though it's only with the sense that 'hey, I'm quadriplegic, can't let her see that'. I get that it's something to make us feel for him, that he needs to overcome his fears. But I think a big part of it is an overall 'light' touch; yes, Driss may have a criminal background, and yes he has a big family to support in the projects (not that we see much of them, which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this), and sure Philippe has seemingly all the money in the world (where does he get it from, who knows, rich family, they never say).So in other words, there are stakes here, but given that this man can't walk or move, or that Driss has an upward climb in life, it all comes back to just... silly jokes in a lot of scenes, playful flirting between Driss and a woman in the main house not having it, life lessons learned in montage. It's a movie that has a heart in a good place, I can't question that, and being that it's based on a true story (and boy does the ending remind you!) it's hard to say this wasn't credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way. It may be a certain feeling like it's running through things I could see in a lessor TV movie, the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even (again the teenage girl plot, where she never feels like a character, just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward). Even the moment where the third act gets into gear, a little conflict as Driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits, it's just... OK.If you love this movie, I'm happy for you. For me, it just didn't win me over completely - not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings (though it tries at times), just an overall feeling like it's missing some things that could make it FEEL more important, more substantive.",6,1,5,5 November 2015
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Cuaron and company rise this to the level of near pop-art; Harry Potter moving on up in style and substance
","After the first two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus waived his director's seat and after some searing Alfonso Cuaron stepped in. It's an interesting choice, as he had only done one 'family-friendly' film before (A Little Princess), and had just finished an NC-17 film the excellent Y Tu Mama Tambien. Although I've yet to read 'Azkaban' or any of the books, from what I've heard from those that have it's a book that doesn't seem to be really progressing too much in terms of a 100% engaging 'plot'. We're only learning so much about Potter's lineage, and mostly through the element of Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban prison and has his sights set after Potter to avenge the 'dark lord.' But through this set-up, Cuaron does the most extraordinary things, surpassing Columbus's big-epic aspirations and making it...still epic, yes, but with a more ambitious scop in directorial style. Even when things get at their most conventional, there's a full sense of balancing whimsy and true dark intonations. I loved how he and the visual effects crew dealt with the Dementors, the shape shifters who act as a double-edged sword with Hogwarts and Potter. I haven't seen the film in a while, but I still remember so clearly many scenes and shots, and how the filmmaker this time really brings on a strong presence that actually, if anything, enriches the material of the book.There's other small pleasures as well: Emma Thompson wonderfully plays a scatter-shot professor who looks like she could get lost in a grocery store; the beginning scenes, where the pig-headed family that's taken in Harry all this time getting their just desserts; the Quiddich battle, which ends up being a little unexpected in some ways, and is actually much ahead in suspense than in even the first film, which introduced the whole bloody concept; the acting by David Thewlis, usually known for more idiosyncratic character roles in movies indie and mainstream, who despite all appearances is also ambiguous. Best of all is Oldman as Sirius Black, and for the brief moments he's on screen (and, to be sure, how sentimental the dialog veers towards when he and Potter sit down for a talk on the roof), the screen does the clichéd move of 'lighting up'. Just the poster image alone, with 'have you seen this man' is ominous, even as there is almost the feeling that he isn't quite as evil as might be let on. The levels of darkness in the film are upped a bit- this is the first time that the Harry Potter series has to get a little more mature, even still on 'family-friendly' terms- and cast and crew are up completely to the challenge.In fact, this might still be my favorite of the Potter films (Order of Phoenix close second), as it does capture the levels of wonder at such a concept that a wizard school offers, and expands further into the crevices of the psychologies of the characters and the possibilities of the identity of evil or good or what might be mixed around. 8.5/10",9,2,5,15 July 2007
Ratatouille," truly devilish fun and mind-blowingly entertaining as classic cartoon style, but also very successful in storytelling- magnifique!
","It's pretty easy to make little rodents charming and fun characters (just ask Disney himself, to a clichéd extent), but it's even harder to make them work in such a way that's original and exciting as comedy in conventional ways for today's audiences. But Brad Bird shouldn't be lumped into the group of today's CGI animators. He doesn't really think in those terms, but rather in how to make things look real, and yet at the same time keeping in full mind that it's a cartoon, not reality. This goes not simply for the rats themselves- the funniest, probably even funnier, that Disney's remotely had to market since the Great Mouse Detective- but the human characters too, who have their own distinct shapes and qualities based on personality and relevance to the story (whether they're good or bad, or maybe even more complex too). He places the designs for the characters right up there with the rest of the atmosphere, and then also adds in just the right way to make that wonderfully formulaic Pixar storyline- you know a lot of what may unfold, though not everything, and you know that you're in excellent hands because of the levels of detail and nuance in the comedy chaos at times. It'll be hard to beat this (to put it in a corny phrase) 'gourmet selection' as the best animated film of the year, and certainly the best that Pixar's done since, um, the last Brad Bird movie! The story is the fish out of water, or in this case rat, where a little rodent named Remy, who is totally immersed in the style of Augustus Gusteau, a famous French chef who dies, and who's position is filled by a lowly garbageman named Linguini. He can't cook, of course, but somehow Remy, separated from his rat family, cooks something up on the spot as a not-quite accident, sending Linguini as the one who supposedly made it. On the fluke, he becomes the new chef at Gusteau's...only, the chef's a rat, literally, hilariously pulling Linguini's hair to make him a cooking puppet (early on this makes for some of the best physical comedy of any Pixar movie). This fluke becomes the start of the usual ball of string unraveled bit by bit, involving an heir to Gusteau's fortune, a love interest in aggressive chef Colette, and Remy's reconnection and estrangement from his huge rat clan and his father. All the while Bird throws in such dangerous and downright devilish comedy for a *G* rated animated movie. And there's morales to be learned too, or sort of taken away, I guess, only this time in the true Disney form instead of Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, it's Remy and the, well, illusion of Gusteau's ghost appearing to him as a quasi-conscious.What makes Ratatouille stand out of the pack from the fellow summer far of the moment, particularly 4th of July fare, is how there's such deft to Bird and his team navigating along the lines of making the comedy work to its excessive lengths while always keeping a firm grip on which turn the story will take next (the moments I didn't quite expect- the whole heir angle involving Linguini, and the climactic scenes with the rats preparing the restaurant's dinners, all washed before going to work, and keeping 'under wraps' the health inspector at the same time!). I probably laughed just as much during this film as I would at something much raunchier like Knocked Up or Grindhouse, to give recent examples, but as mentioned there's a riskiness to Bird's style here.One scene I particularly loved is when Remy is training linguini to command the muscle-controlled hair pulling scheme at his home, and there's a build-up to what seems like a knife going to cut into his fingers while he's chopping vegetables (up to this point he's been hopeless in his training), but at this very point where we should expect the worst, which is funny unto itself, it starts to level out and he's sort of under control. Sort of in that he'll still be naturally clumsy enough to spill the wine on his own head. Same goes for little things like the quite silhouetted bit Remy passes by with the lover about to shoot the other and then falling into full embrace, or the actual fellow employees at Gusteau's, one of who has the wildest thumb ever shown in a movie, least of all a 'family' movie, that I can remember (albeit Bird does come out of working on the Simpsons).So many masterstrokes of comedy go on that it's almost neglected to note how exciting a lot of the film is too, the run-around Remy has in the kitchen first time he comes in or the chase through Paris between the crooked head cook Skinner and Remy, and how seamless voice-work and the (now highly expected) advances in Pixar's technical innovations go together. It was a good guessing game who was the voice of Ego (it's O'Toole, but then it could be any given old regal British person), and to pick out that it's Ian Holm or Garofolo voicing some of the other parts, but it's not something that is immediately meant to be stand-out like in other CGI movies where it's being sold mostly on celebrity voice talent. It's almost like a lot of this comes quite naturally to Bird and his team, and yet because it isn't it reverts to becoming all the more remarkable. Ratatouille is simply an exceptionally fun picture, loaded with sight gags and puns and slips of behavior, and never overbearing with any of the usual messages that come pre-packaged for kids in these movies, all the more remarkable as it comes nearer to Pixar reusing previous ones.",10,13,19,29 June 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," it's okay, no more no less (depending on your point of view)
","Once again we get the origin story of Peter Parker becoming the Spider-Man. Once again we get Gwen Stacy, though this time its a substantial character (something that even I'll say, as one of a handful of big fans, was a problem in Spider-Man 3). Once again we get a scientist who meddles too much into his own business and finds that what it changes him into is a living nightmare. And once again we have a teenager who can throw out the occasional quip - though Garfield's Parker is more jerkish in some of his comments than Maguire ever was - while taking out the bad guys, whomever they are. Oh, and of course we get to see (spoiler? no, not a spoiler, screw you, this is 50+ years old now) Uncle Ben dies. Derp.As I recall from watching this movie, the (must qualify here) first 'reboot/remake' of the Spider-Man franchise from Sony, on DVD right after it came out - I skipped it in theaters, probably I was too busy working that summer or something, I can't remember - is that this wasn't any crime against humanity, and it was probably more watchable and understood its world a little better than, say, Trank's Fantastic Four or the majority of something like Batman v Superman). Webb, pun intended, does a competent job with the character stuff involving Garfield and Stone, albeit I'd rather see them as a couple in a totally different film, so that one can excuse the action from being rote.At the same time, this also solidified my belief that, if movies last this long, we can go another, oh, 55/60 years before needing another Uncle Ben death scene again. Or, for that matter, Peter Parker in a skateboarding slo-mo shot. It's too same-old to stand-out from the pack, but full of too much personality to be a train-wreck or a fun disaster. It's a perfectly eh-OK-ish blockbuster, and despite this rating and a lot of game supporting players (Sally Field, Irfan Khan, Rhys Ifans... got paid I guess). I'll never see it again intentionally.",6,1,3,9 July 2017
54," Trashy Drama
","54 is an Ok film cause it mixes Melrose Place with Mike Myers' character style.  The film showcases a twisted around version of the true story of the corruption of the studio 54 during the late 70's.  The performances are good, the script is OK, the style is great, but there is something missing here.  Maybe It's co-owner Ian Schrager (left out of the movie, though a co-owner of 54) who wasn't around to tell Myers to lay off his Jewish accent.  B+",7,0,1,30 March 2000
The Lego Movie," 'Make sure it's black, or really dark gray' - Batman
","A They Live for our times, but also with parts (or, ahem, 'blocks') of The Matrix, Kung-fu Panda, 1984 and every conceivable franchise that you and your kid would want to see in a LEGO movie. Innovative animation mixing stop-motion and CGI (where it stops and starts I don't know, that's the charm and wonder of the technique, like Robot Chicken if it had a budget, which one of the guys who does the show worked on the film so that makes sense), and almost non-stop comedy - even when it's not all huge laugh-out-loud laughs, there's endless cleverness but always with a goofy wink and slapstick. It's the Looney Tunes for our times. The ending isn't perfect - the message of everyone being 'special' I think gets muddled with 'everyone be creative', which aren't the same things though the directors try for both ways. But that's a nit-pick really; this is on the level of popular-innovative entertainment as Toy Story.",10,2,8,28 April 2014
Aliens," One of the best films of the 80's!
","James Francis Cameron's Aliens is his best film to date (besides a couple of Terminating exceptions).  It combines an original (though duplicated 6 years later) story with wam bam action that takes time to start, but once it does, it doesn't stop.  Cameron is a great director of action films, and this proves it.The tale is about Ripley- Sigourney Weaver (sole survivor of the ship that was attacked by an Alien) who after 57 years of laying dormant (she went into cryno-sleep) must go with a group of soldiers to investigate strange doings on the same planet with the gestating Alien.  But this time, there are many to go around, and once it starts, it just doesn't stop (including a startling ending).  Better than the first, this film co-written and directed by Jim Cameron is a great example of the sci-fi thriller and will hopefully stay around for a long time.'Get away from her you bitch!'  Damn right.  A++",10,2,4,22 March 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Great action and illogic make this a good B movie
","The Fast and the Furious star the always good Vin Diesel as a car racer- on the streets.  He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.  Then how come when the race in the streets scenes come up, you almost see no cars whatsoever on the streets (unless it's used for the plot or something)?  I have a feeling that even though this doesn't have much logic in it, at least it's better here than in New York, cause then it would be just plain ludicrous.  Anyway, like I said, It's a good action movie, though not a great one.  Kudos go to the director, stunt co-ordinators, drivers and Diesel.  B+",7,0,2,22 June 2001
The Exorcist," Stands the test of time, and then some - almost all imitators pale in its presence
","Alright, let's just be boring and say that The Exorcist is still f***ing chilling to the bone. Shots that William Friedkin designed from paintings (like the shot of Max von Sydow's Father coming to the house in silhouette and seeing the lone light beaming out from the bedroom window), and taking from some 'based on a true story' stuff from writer William Peter Blatty that the director shoots like a documentary is what sells it for me, for us, for the world. It could be said, argued, that after years of parodies like in the 'Scary Movie' movies that the effect of seeing a little girl spewing green puke and rancid curses in the voice or 70 year old chain smoker Mercedes McCambridge isn't scary as it used to be.But the (surprising) fun of the Exorcist, and the dread, is that Friedkin doesn't back down from taking this seriously, and with an intensity that is unshakable. The acting is so naturalistic, yet still the actors giving screen performances (and it's people like Ellen Burstyn and von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb, you can't go wrong there), and there is a bit of mythology too – in maybe the only slightly over-long sequence at the beginning where the older Father goes about old ruins in Iraq to find spooky things as they say, the devil's in the details. And this is still the film to beat when it comes to stories of demonic possession, by far.",10,5,9,29 September 2000
Captain America: Civil War," 'Have you seen that old movie, The Empire Strikes Back?'
","What are 'stakes' when it comes to super-heroes? How do they function when it comes to protecting people over the world and saving us from the enemies? What if there's destruction? How can people be trusted? Or, more philosophically, can the heroes trust themselves if they have to live with the deaths at their hands (or can they)? So many questions are at the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the sort of sequel-cum-culmination of a lot of plot threads and emotional stakes that have been set up since Iron Man 1 in 2008. It feels earned, and it's hard to not think of the immediate comparison of the other big super-hero beat-down of this year, Batman v Superman. Those comparisons could last all day, but I think it's also apt, even more-so, to think of this as a criticism of X-Men Last Stand, which was another film that had super-hero 'registration' as far as being under control and the different factions that pop up and sides taken as far as who is right and wrong and the grey areas.But where that film felt too cluttered by characters, Civil War is not. It very easily could've been, and it's easy to see it as not only are characters from the Iron Man and Captain America series here (Pepper Potts is out and Peggy Carter passes on early in this film, but that's fine, less potential clutter). But there are also additional characters from other movies (Ant-Man) and even a new character, a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens (you know him if you saw any images in the past month for even a nano-second, it's not as if the internet does a good job of keeping things on the low-down, it's Spider-Man), and yet everyone has a purpose, every character of some significance is given time to have a conversation and to talk about things so we know where they're coming from (i.e. Scarlet Witch and the Vision even do, which is a great couple of scenes), and so on.The Russo brothers do a fantastic job of keeping things emotionally speaking with Rogers and Stark clear and yet complicated; we know that the deaths of so many in an explosion at the start of the film weighs down on Rogers (though perhaps we don't see it as much), while for Stark it's thrown in his face every other moment of every day, and the turmoil is there on his face all the time (though Downey Jr is such a gifted actor as to show it just enough and to modulate the turmoil so that it comes at striking times, all of it in the eyes, it's really one of his best performances of his career). So as this goes on the plot keeps going as well, with Daniel Bruhl playing a variation on a character in the comics (who I'm not familiar with but it doesn't matter) named Zemo.This is an interesting villain and one of the better ones in the series (not Loki or Ultron level great but close), as he is *just a guy*. He's not some ultra criminal mastermind - though he certainly knows how to set up a mass explosion - but he is also someone who is another person who has the vast well of grief and vengeance from people he's lost (family but also just, as he says, 'everyone') from his home in Slovakia. It's a good performance from Bruhl too, not too over the top (close to it but more realistic), and it's a play on past conflicts from other MCU movies. Yet here it makes its mark more because, well, this time it's more about how to tear up the super-heroes by doing it from the inside, which itself is reflective of SHIELD being taken down by Hydra in Winter Soldier and the seeds of doubt already there in 'Ultron'. It's a pretty strong creation for this particular movie.This is a very operatic type of movie - The Empire Strikes Back gets name-checked and it almost feels like a bold statement, like 'really, did you just make that even in a jesting manner in this big bad-a** action sequence at this airport - but damn if it doesn't try and possibly does live up to that standard of blockbuster excellence. It's a lot of fun though, there's lightness and quips and jokes and moments visually, filmmaking wise, that makes this something that will entertain you if you're only looking for surface thrills. And at the same time I found a lot underneath, and what it all leads up to makes things devastating for the characters. It's not perfect - I have parts I can pick at as far as a particular character's fate following the battle, and a speech given at a funeral scene is so on the nose that there's barely a nose left to see - but it's about as good as mainstream action spectacle gets.",10,10,24,7 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find a Compelling Plot?
","A charitable rating because I like the beasts very much (albeit it'd be nice if this was the era of Jim Henson's Creature Shop instead of ALL CGI), and I even didn't actively dislike Eddie Redmayne here like in his performances last year (though he still has certain little tics and a wide-eyed profile that's not enormously likable). Basically anything to do with Newt Scamander's adventures along with Jacob the would-be baker (a funny if one and a half note Dan Fogler) and Kathleen Waterson is a fun time, and there's an element of Doctor Who I appreciated as far as a character going off into some new place with his police box (err, suitcase here), facing off with some gnarly creatures, and humans who are a variety of helpful and disastrous.But when it gets into the actual *plot* it becomes trickier to handle for Rowling as a (first-time?) screenwriter: there's darkness here that sometimes, not all the time, gets to be too dark, at least for what is being set up as a 'franchise' or whatever. In the Potter films there was a more gradual build up to darker themes and tones and scenes and kills. Here, it's just there, and despite finding Samantha Morton to be terrifying in a convincing way as the head of an anti-witch cult, and despite finding Colin Farrel to be sturdy as a villain, I didn't much care for the conflicts around the uh, Obscurus-what-have-you (sorry if I'm not good with names, it's a late-night review), and ultimately it's a lack of heart that makes me not care as much. To put it into perspective, I found more to engage in emotionally with Fogler than Redmayne, by a mile, and only hints (but not enough) with Waterson's backstory.What makes me want to give it an even lower rating is that the final act turns into what so many Hollywood movies from these studios out to be Legacyquel-McFranchise-villes is that it has to be some massive threat tearing ass through the city and the (super)heroes have to face off to stop it. There's actually one interesting facet to this that kinda-sorta is happening, where it's compassion or even something close to empathy, that Newt uses against the villainous force, however this gets put on the wayside for more action and special effects that are surface-cool but deep down empty and it all leads up to a reveal for an actor to come that made me throw out my hands like 'WHY!?!' There's derivative things to this movie that Rowling may have made intentional or not; aside from Doctor Who, I also thought of Men in Black with it featuring a Magic-Police-Special-Agency force, and X-Men in large part with Farrel's character (tell me you don't see Magneto there, especially near the end). I found a lot of creativity and some clever things to this - hell, a platypus obsessed with thievery is a highlight of any movie this *year* let alone this one - and just the idea that this is a hero not unlike a, uh, Charles Darwin but with magic. I went in with a lot of goodwill towards this, but didn't leave as satisfied as I had hoped given this writer and the world to work in. It's the sort of blockbuster that would have me, then lose me, have me then lose me, and so on (i.e. on one hand Ron Perlman cameo, and you'll know it when you see it; on the other hand... Ezra Miller).",6,8,13,3 December 2016
Gandhi," an intellectually engaging experience, with a moving central performance at the center
","With Mahatma Mohandas K Gandhi, a man who, in some ways, transformed how non-violent resistance has been practiced in the world for 100 years (basically in the modern era, and MLK was one of his big fans), it's hard to find someone to fill those shoes (or that white outfit he wore from a certain point till he died). Ben Kingsley is that man, and it's so magnetic a performance, so filled with empathy - or rather, he makes this man such a life-force of good, or always trying to be, or being stubborn in the face of insurmountable odds - he IS Gandhi, in a manner of speaking. All the more remarkable that, despite being from India, he is not of that skin color. Does it matter? Talent, heart, actual filling in a role to a point where color no longer matters, it's the kind of thing that helps to transcend the possibilities in movie acting.That may sound of high praise, though this is a good movie. Maybe not great, and I'll get to why for myself personally in a moment. What is impressive is that director Richard Attenborough engages the audience on a massive scale - this story takes place over a period of 50 years (it also starts at the end, with the assassination of the man in 1948). We see how he was put through racial discrimination and battery at the hands of British imperial forces in South Africa, and started off with his non-violent path of resistance all due to fingerprinting for citizens of India. Then of course it's just a matter of time from little rights like that to making the 'Alien' presence of the British go away. That of course is less easier said and even harder done.It's a struggle that takes place over decades and involves in large part Gandhi winning over an entire nation, piece by piece, speech by speech (at times like that opening act at a rock concert that people don't expect much of, and then wipes everyone else away with what he has to say), and appealing to the better angels of the nature of people. The idea is simple: show the barbarism and problems of the way that Imperial rule is done, and don't fight back. We see these historical events unfold, and Gandhi, via Kingsley, has to come in as a voice that is not always seen as reasonable. When some Indians on a protest march fight back against some soldiers and then kill a couple of them in a vengeful rage, Gandhi insists everyone, all over, stop the run-up to get things moving in the fight against the British. And, Gandhi being Gandhi, he hunger strikes until all marching for freedom stops (momentarily). It won't be the last time, either.There's a lot of rich historical moments going on in the film, and a lot of is engaging just on a historical-intellectual level; in a sense it's a good brother/cousin film to Lawrence of Arabia, also about a man's attempt (kind of successful really) at changing how literally the lines of the map are drawn in a part of the world, and what happens when those very people have to forge new identities. In Arabia it was the cutting-up of countries into what we see today as the Middle East, and in Gandhi it's India and Pakistan. There's intense conflict to mine here, and we see a lot of turmoil in the second half of the film on this level. I also found it remarkable, and the scene itself heartbreaking, that the film's first half ends right at the Intermission point of a gigantic tragedy: the slaughter of over a thousand Indian people by British Colonialists (many women and children). Normally the first half of a film will end on a high note (just the year before in Reds it's at the point where Russia gets its revolution and lovers reunite for good, for example). Here, it's somber, and it sets up the tremendous stakes in the second half for this man.What didn't totally connect with me though were those parts around Gandhi, on an emotional level. Kingsley is so good here, and there's a decent performance usually around the corner (Martin Sheen, Candace Bergen), but I wish there was just a little more about the man himself, on a personal level, than we see here. Sure, there is a really intense moment early on where Gandhi and his wife get into an argument - he almost throws her out of the house until she yells sense into him and he realizes what he's doing - and while I naturally didn't expect more of that, I was hoping to see just a little more of Gandhi as the man, on a personal level, than just as his cultural accomplishments. This is not to decry the film too much, but it just lacked a certain something to the pathos overall that kept it from being great.Of course there's exceptions to this - a scene where a hunger-stricken (near death really) Mahatma has to tell a man who thinks he's going to hell for killing someone what to do is awe-inspiring, especially how Kingsley is on such a low-energy level - but it's really about the sweep and scope of this story that makes Gandhi the film it is. If that's fine for you, have at it. Those looking to see the many flaws that have been pointed out about the man in certain history books (or in the negative/less satisfied comments on IMDb) may not get that. It's a big Oscar-winning biopic, and it does what it does - thankfully there's a performance at the center that is truly great and spectacular, and often for how Kingsley isn't giving big, manic speeches. He's often just talking softly, calmly in a meeting or a courtroom or starving, and it's just... wow.",8,1,1,29 September 2015
American History X," The Best masterpiece of it's time
","Tony Kaye's American History X is the most shocking film of the year (especially considering most of it is happening now).  It is violent, electrifying and sad.  But it also is terrific in it's acting, directing and photography.  Edward Norton is the highlight of this film (along with an Oscar Nom.) as the troubled Derek Vinyard, who after his father is killed by a group of blacks is drawn into the Neo-Nazi movement in Venice Beach.  The scenes depicting his time in the Nazi movement is startling, violent, and frustrating.  It really puts the zap on your head.  Anyway, after Derek is put in jail for double murder, he leaves only wanting to save his brother (played well by Edward Furlong) from the same movement that put him into jail.  All through the film, we never feel anything in this movie is less than perfect.  I certaintly didn't, and hopefully you won't either.  Best film of 1998. A++",9,4,13,19 March 2000
Saw III," I wasn't disappointed because I didn't expect much, but that doesn't mean you should expect much either
","It goes like this, either you somehow go for the Saw series' lot of super-duper camera tricks, its ever-so intricate plots and killing schemes, and the whole 'game'-ness of how the Jigsaw killer goes about his schemes and how the filmmakers create these bags of horror-movie gimmicks, or you don't. I don't. It's that simple. But somehow, even after watching and finding the first Saw movie to be one of the most idiotic horror movie clap-traps of the decade, I got drawn into this third part of the series (a friend filled in whatever convoluted gaps there were to fill, or whatever wasn't too damn confusing with the myriad of flashbacks, from part 2) just to see how stupid it could possibly get. This is a film directed at best with some professionalism and at worst like an epileptic marsupial who doesn't know how to let go of the color filters and the 'SO SCARY' editing touches like flashes and quick cuts that are more likely to make us go into seizure than frighten us.Let's face facts too, Jigsaw's entire plot here is about the most hackneyed ideal of redemption that can be possible in modern movies. He kidnaps a man and his wife (who, of course, happen to have a dysfunctional relationship) or other, places them in a mousetrap-style maze of hazards and booby-traps and notes left with guns and gigantic limb-twisting thingamabobs, and then big choices have to be made like if to save a man's life it's worth getting shot in the head by a trigger hooked up to a switch. Or something. There's also a brain tumor subplot with Jigsaw, as he has one and has his assistant or daughter or whatever drill into his head to remove it. In short, there are a lot of things that happen in Saw III, and they all amount to material that, more or less, appears like the image provided by a scene where a 'victim' is tied and sprayed by an onslaught of shredded hogs. How much of this can we take? Basically, the big problem this time around is not so much that all of the acting is terrible (though a lot of it is like from Shawnee Smith, even a somewhat skillful actor like Tobin Bell is reduced to monologuing from one spot and dribbling silly in his seat), or that the cinematography is over-saturated and made to look like washed-out pair of hippie jeans (though it is, with some exceptions), but with its attitude. This is the Saw that tries and makes us 'think' or at least come away with seeing something that, supposedly, deals with guilt and grief and natural human flaws as if in the realm of Biblical proportional philosophy. It's all about Jigsaw making the audience, as much as the people who tortures and kills, see the error of their ways as he rots away with his lovable old brain wart... not before, of course, making sure if he goes someone's head explodes to boot.It's also an excuse for a lot of irredeemable blood-letting, limb-tearing, head-blasting, and gut-churning that is just there for not much reason except for the fetishists for this kind of stuff (or, for that matter, those who appreciate it ironically, if that's possible). I wish there could be something else to this, or for that matter be scary or thought provoking. What it really is, in the end, is trash masquerading as a deep tale of revenge and other soap-opera tricks. And did I mention the flashbacks, like every other minute, taking up almost more than half of the running time? Couldn't they even get Donnie Wahlberg for more than one incredibly (unitentionally) funny scene with his torn feet beating a woman's head against a wall? Yikes against me for watching it and, hopefully, yikes against you too.",2,0,0,10 January 2009
Ocean's Eleven," A little predictable, but entertaining fare anyway, from Oscar winner Soderbergh
","Steven Soderbergh, a really good director who (deservedly) won for Traffic, comes back with a type of film sort of remenicent of Out of Sight (mainly in style and humor which is low key but cool) but also a remake of the 1960 caper film with Frank Sinatra.  Here, Clooney plays a recently released inmate who schemes with Pitt to gather up a crew total of 11 (it might seem more, I lost count) to rob three casinos in Las Vegas all owned by Garcia. It goes through the motions almost too easily, yet this movie shouldn't be taken totally seriously as how Soderbergh most likely intended.  A good, enjoyable flick, not as great The Score of even the recently released Heist, but still worthwhile.  Other cast members include Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliot Gould and Julia Roberts as Clooney's ex.  A-",9,4,7,10 December 2001
Spirited Away," An anime treat
","Spirited Away, the latest film from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki (a genius to Disney animators, such as to Toy Story director Lasseter who executive produced the film for the US), is a wonderful family film, that works on numerous levels for kids, not the least being the creative storyline, and for older kids and adults there are lavish backdrops and characters right out of, well, an anime movie. The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way. A bit at times reminiscent of a Wizard of Oz or Alice In Wonderland in Japanese anime fashion (perhaps building just on the fantasy elements as Miyazaki usually does) doesn't disappoint for a moment as a marvel of imagination. Even those strident fans of maturer (err extra violent) anime pictures will want to look, maybe more than once. Works on many levels and I recommend it of course, if maybe a mild mark under Miyazaki's best work Princess Mononoke. Grade: A (or 9.5/10)",9,1,3,27 September 2002
Pearl Harbor," One of the most manipulative movies I've seen in a real long time
","Pearl Harbor comes from that brought you Armageddon (which after further review is actually for me a lot lesser than what I once thought it was and shows what Fellini and Bergman can do to an under-developed mind) of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer.  And like that movie, they make the audience cry and automatically feel patriotism at no extra charge.  That is not fair in many respects, especially during Memorial day weekend.  For all those who think Spielberg and his company make manipulative films (which is arguable), you should take a gander at this piece of work.Harbor here takes a Titanic type of approach (bad idea) as for nearly an hour and a half before a torpedo is dropped  a tree sap filled love story submerges with 2 people falling in love (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale who deserve better than this) and then when the pilot Affleck supposedly dies (no one feels pity as thanks to the unimaginative innovation known as the trailer we know he's fighting at the big battle), she falls in love with his best friend, played in one of the lesser roles of the year by Josh Hartnett. But of course, this is all before (and sadly also partially after) the big attack by the Japanese on the Hawaiian base.Credit should be given where it's due and that's why this film isn't a complete failure- the battle and action sequences are excellently put together with visual effects helping a lot and chaos giving good tension to the film.  BUT, the droning other story of the bad love triangle is so distracting it might just be worth waiting for video (or DVD might be appropriate) and just singling out the fine bombing.  One of the lesser blockbusters ever made, and now along side it's co-companion Armageddon (but at least the Rock is still intact).Two little notes though: 1) this is to point out a pretty obvious flaw and goof.  Was it just me, or did it seem weird that several months after Beckinsale's character reveals she's pregnant that she's as thin as she was earlier in the movie?  I would think that Bay could've at least taken a couple of bucks from the 140 mill budget and supplied some stuffing or something.  2) Randall Wallace who wrote the outstanding Braveheart and good Man in the Iron Mask proves that even though a blockbuster doesn't need 10 writers, one can still botch things up.  Oh well, at least Shrek is still around.  C-",3,16,28,25 May 2001
The Conjuring 2," The Conjuring 2 builds up and up and gets you in its grip, which is what the best horror can hope to do.
","James Wan is a big fan of horror. It's not always a surefire thing when a creator is someone who is so connected with a form of entertainment (see also from this opening weekend Jones's Warcraft), but if a filmmaker is in tune with the material he's in love with and it works on all cylinders, there's few pleasures to match it in mainstream cinema. This is a major release (done on a 'medium' budget of 40 million) and it's done by someone who's clearly a geek for 70's horror, but in a way that is... classy. And scary as all hell; it's not often to use the almost DVD-cover level critic line but, really, The Conjuring 2, if you're open to it, will scare the s*** out of you.Wan's become so saavy with how to deal out suspense, and it comes down to how he paces things. This isn't a short movie, and it's longer than a lot of other movies of its genre at 134 minutes. This is to the film's benefit, as it gives a lot of time to build up the characterizations; Wan gives us the two narratives of this family in England, on poverty row basically, and how the 11 year old girl is traumatized repeatedly by this undead entity named Bill and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga's) own visions of a demon in a nun's outfit going after her and killing Ed (!) (this in part attached to that little known case in Amityville, NY). We get so much time with the both sides that by the time the Warren's come to England the movie's halfway in, and it's time to get to the meat of the story.A lot of what impresses me with The Conjuring 2 isn't so much the elements that we're familiar with by now when it comes to demonic-Christian-drenched horror: we know that the people will come in to the house with the crosses out to get the ghosts or demons or whatever-you-remember-from-The-Exorcist out, and that there will be characters flailing about in the air and objects flying across rooms and terrified characters. What matters is execution, and Wan and his cinematographer and production designer (this IS the 70's!) makes everything palpable and pop. When a little girl is hiding under the covers and Wan switches to a POV of the demonic entity coming in to the bedroom and towards her bed, it feels terrifying because of how all of the shots are paced and cut together and how much we believe this young actress (Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, outstanding especially in the quieter moments like on the swing with Lorraine when they meet).It's a terrifying trip into the darker recesses of the human soul, and it also comes down to how Wan makes sure to depict the people and places with a degree of honesty in the drama that is outside of the junk/baby food modern horror audiences are used to. It might be a lot sometimes to ask for quality acting, or a budget higher than 5 million, but it does make a difference, and here Wan takes his time with them and it's clear they had preparation before they stepped into a story that involves family and love at the core. I liked that part of it too, that it emphasizes the bond of a family, or a married couple, in the face of evil and demons and the afterlife. So while it deals in tropes of the genre - the audio recordings that reveal more than we first heard, the 'trick' video footage, the otherworldly inner 'voice' taking over a character (in a real, deeply troubling psychological sense than just the surface one too) - it doesn't cheapen what's happening to them.I felt invested in this family, which also features a compelling performance by Frances O'Connor as the mother of the family, and it pays off in set piece after set piece, paced out with wonderful bits for character development (including an acoustic Elvis performance by Patrick Wilson!), so that by the time the gigantic, thunderstorm climax comes we can still rock with the over-the-top punches that, of course, didn't happen in the 'based on a true story'. And yes, the climax is a little too long and features a CGI character that goes too far. But I can forgive these flaws because of the other 2 hours that came before it, which comes close to the likes of The Babadook and It Follows and even The Witch as far as digging deep into what makes people tic and drawing out the atmosphere of things like a room or a hallway or a flooded basement, and getting terror by simply holding on a shot sometimes for long enough for it to take on another meaning (i.e. Ed talking to 'Bill', back turned, in close-up with the ghost out of focus but still in sight).",8,1,3,12 June 2016
Jackie," goes beyond a 'biopic' and into the realm of epic, deeply-felt tragedy
","This may not be directed by Darren Aronofsky, only produced - kudos of course goes to Pablo Larrain - but it has the texture and 16mm feel of one of Aronofsky's low budget, hard-edged and cripplingly emotional gems, and Natalie Portman gives every ounce of EVERYTHING she's learned as an actress and puts it all into this performance. This is like Raging Bull great. You hear the term 'tour de force' bandied about by critics looking to wag themselves off, but this is legitimately one of those. It's also an acutely aware film about politics and perception, that even in the face of one of the massive national tragedies in the US history, it's important to remember what to (or not to) say to the press, to conform to an attire, to show or not show off the kids, and to hide the tears or let go when necessary.But more than that, this is a completely devastating study of hu,man grief and sudden, nerve-shattering and paralyzing loss, and what to do in the face of that when things have to get done and decisions made; in that sense this makes for the 'biopic' cousin of this year's Manchester by the Sea, though that's almost doing a disservice to use the 'b' word. The task that Larrain and Aronofsky and Portman have is simple but complex: strip away all of the cultural bark off the tree so we're left with human beings up there on the screen. Again, sounds like it should be obvious, but so many filmmaker pump up their characters full of importance so we can't see what is the real tragedies going on (for a comparison, watch something like 2006's Bobby and then come to this).It's not that the filmmakers don't point out the importance of Jackie Kennedy Onassis or the Kennedys in general, but actually it's that they do that AND comment on it in a genuinely intelligent way. It's seeing a woman, a mother, a wife, who has seen her husband's brains blasted out right next to her while in a car, having to deal with that which would be one thing (and man what a thing, like the most WTF thing in a lifetime), but then also having to be a figurehead of the WORLD and being in this big cavernous place like the White House (history is often called into question, from Lincoln of course to the presidents killed that people seem to tend to forget like Garfield and McKinley). So Larrain and Oppenheim just make this a person, first and foremost, and Portman shows both Jackie's sharp intelligence, ability to quickly read a situation, with a little shallowness to image, which is not a complaint, it's to her advantage. So it becomes an intimate, uncomfortable at times (in a good way), deeply felt, sometimes too hard to take, look at what a person, any person, has to do when a loved one is taken away, while there can be little escape from the crushing public image (this often brought into conflict with Bobby Kennedy, a also excellent Peter Sarsgard - he has one of the key scenes questioning what his brother actually *did* that people will remember, ala Lincoln, which, frankly, I sometimes think about myself, that is to say if, I dunno, what if JFK was... overrated perhaps?) This was a shocking and stunning dramatic experience, and the sort of turn from a major star that puts Portman past being a very good, often, terrific, actress and into arguably the major actors of her time. Seeing what she does here is one of the high-points of cinema in a decade - that's how bold this is.",10,15,29,18 December 2016
Duck You Sucker," One of the best westerns/war films made in the 70's: brutal, violent, funny, poetically tragic, etc...
","With Fistful of Dyanmite (a.k.a. 'Duck, You Sucker', a.k.a. 'Once Upon a Time in the Revolution', the second part of a 'trilogy'), legendary Sergio Leone puts together something experimental, even more so than the other films in his catalog. Here he now deals with war, but he still has the crime elements of his 'dollars' films; it somehow makes a very clear cut balance between bits of comedy within the tragedy worked in the story; it isn't very brutal, but it is graphic in the genre sense of the time. It's also one of his best films, if you happen to see it within its full running time (like most of Leone's films, this suffered drastic cuts in American versions, reducing critical character points and other Leone surprises).A Leone film, however, can only be as strong as the leads pushing it up, as in the dozens and dozens of westerns and other films that inspired Leone. Here he uses two character actors (for the most part of their careers), but indeed very good and astute ones at playing their parts. Rod Steiger, who has been in classic films like On the Waterfront and The Pawnbroker, here is slightly like a maturer version of Tuco from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: he's still a bandit, with pillaging and beating and raping his way across the countryside, but he's also got a family to look after, who within his anti-hero heart are the most important things to him. Steiger's Juan is usually either surprised, quietly delighted, or agitated off to certain degrees. He plays this for all it's worth, but he also finds the best notes in the moments when he brings out laughs, and in the more sorrowful moments later on in the film.There's also James Coburn, veteran of many, many films, given one of the great themes of any character in a Leone film by composer Ennio Morricone (there's some sort of instrument or distortion of one in his theme that calls for complete, unusual attention on the viewer). Coburn's Sean (err, John, depending) is a character with some ghosts, perhaps, in his past, and who unlike Juan is more interested in 'other' interests. Although Juan tries not to notice it until the sequence at Mesa Verde (which I won't reveal), Sean has been through a revolution in Ireland, and understand more or less what happens with it. He brings in Juan, after a rather strange yet hilarious encounter, into his web of revolutionary fighters, which doesn't go over to well with him at first. As their story unravels, Coburn still plays it like a pro, being the straight character to Steiger's very theatrical-like performance. He doesn't quite have the mystery an Eastwood or Bronson had in the other Leone films, but he does carry a certain quality about him that puts him in a needed place in the Leone cannon.Speaking of which, one must not over-look how complex a film like this is in some ways. Leone was not originally the director (it went through the hands of Peter Bogdanovich and Sam Peckinpah before coming to him, coincidentally the opening scene with Juan is a cool homage to the Wild Bunch opening). Yet somehow he puts his stamp, and wonderful mark, on Fistful of Dynamite. This time more history is worked into the film- unlike the civil war acting like a harsh backdrop to the more 'fun' elements of the adventure in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the war in this film affects the main character, and adds a serious tone to an otherwise standard genre picture. The Steiger character, along with the audience, gets a look at a massive amount of death, or rather the images of the dead: a tower filled with soldiers blown at night, the powerful pans and camera moves across the bodies, real combat, and the suggestions of what goes into the revolution. But its not just the violence of battles that get into the film, its also the personal attitudes during the revolution- the bourgeois vs the peasants (one of Leone's masterstrokes at close-ups in montage is displayed when Juan is on the train with the near monstrous American wealthy early in the film). Leone manages to work in various and cinematic explosions, in-depth or testing close-ups, and sweeping long shots of soldiers, landscapes, and struggle.Coming back to Ennio Morricone's score- this time, Morricone experiments with some styles of his talents. As when Leone uses a funny, almost cartoon-like, image above Sean from Juans' eyes of a 'Banco' sign (akin the a 'dollar' sign above cartoon characters), Morricone adds a church organ and choir to go along with it. There are also the uses of themes throughout the film, as in Leone's other films, that act like striking, beautiful calling cards. The opening theme is pounding; Sean's flashbacks are given the sumptuous qualities that go with the best (and worst) nostalgia; the scenes with action and suspense, though almost a little standard, still work far better than many standard score of today. Fistful of Dynamite is entertainment on an epic scale, with a broader and somewhat deeper sub-text, and it comes out with flying colors. Some may not take to it; it could be argued that Steiger, much like Eli Wallach, isn't very convincing as a Mexican bandit, or that the shifting in tones is a little much, even conventional in a weird sense. But it's hard to argue the sense of control that Leone has over his environment in the film, the assuredness of style, and that at the least the parts are greater than the whole. For me, it's a film I've seen twice in one week (once to soak in and get more of the enjoyment, the second time to get even more out of it, and to notice the visual details), and I hope it gets better the next time around.",10,52,71,6 August 2005
Tropic Thunder," practically everything about this movie is uproarious; the satire/parody of the year!
","I read a review of Tropic Thunder that said it's satire, not parody, that there's a distinct difference and the film knows it. I'd agree that there is a difference, but I'd add that Stiller doesn't give a great big hoot about sticking to one or the other. Tropic Thunder does satirize its subjects: movie stars, movie moguls, 'dedictation' to the craft of acting, the crap that churns out in Hollywood, and the Vietnam war. But there's parody running throughout the picture, if only in the first half of the picture and particularly in those incredible trailers that open the movie (all of them are fall-down laughing, and even give certain laughs for certain movie fans). It's one of the most deft mixes of parody and satire, where they sometimes run along with one another through the jungle and full of blood and guts and awesome one-liners. To give a higher compliment- it's some of the best since Mel Brooks.It's simple to break down the premise, since it's right in the trailer: primadonna movie stars- one action, Tugg Speedman, aka 'Tuggernuts' (Stiller); one comedy, Jeff Portnoy (Black); one the 'acclaimed' method actor Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr)- are starring in a Vietnam war movie that is going haywire, and so the director (Coogan) gets tips from the military adviser/author of the book Tropic Thunder (Nolte) to send the stars out into the *real* jungle to film the movie. Then, of course, everything goes to hell, right even before they leave the drop point of where the helicopter drops them off (wont spoil it, but there's a great gag involving a severed head for a few minutes). Stiller goes close to overload as the movie goes on- mocking the brash studio executive (Tom Cruise- yes, Tom Cruise, and he's BALD!) and Speedman's puppy-dog agent (McConaughey), and the fact that the drug cartel who captures Speedman in the jungle are a HUGE fans of Stiller's 'retard' movie, Simple Jack.I might add, don't think because I put 'retard' in quotes that it's offensive. Stiller's aim here is to completely annihilate ALL of the self-indulgent and self-righteous movies, so there are no prisoners taken in the course of Tropic Thunder. This scores it extra points, but above all else it's the fact that it's Ben Stiller as a 'retard' (and at one point performing the entire movie at gun point to the cartel workers), Robert Downey Jr is a 'dude playing a dude disguised as another dude', and Black as a, uh, heroin addicted star of stupid fart comedies (which, oddly enough, is to Black's credit that he pulls off a role I didn't think would work). It has that same overt and palpable ludicrous vibe of Zoolander, only even more focused on character and sharper at telling the story. For all the insanity and just continuous 'did he just SAY or DO that' antics in Tropic Thunder, sometimes involving lots of violence or gobs of racism, Stiller doesn't forget to direct, and in fact it's maybe his best directing job yet. Pineapple Express might have gone to more extremes but, frankly, this is funnier.How funny may depend on how much you can take of each characters' 'shtick'. Frankly, I couldn't get enough, and loved just the surprise cameos and bit parts (Tobey Maguire is one real notable) that revealed how in tune they were with the rest of the project. Only in recent memory is Walk Hard comparable in going so far to deliver joke after joke that just connects either due to great dialog ('I'm the rooster illusion'), great rapport between the actors, some of which are just the drug dealers at the prison camp like the kid Brandon Soo-Hoo, and a finite ability to tap into how shallow and amazing movies can get. Did I mention Tom Cruise is in it?",10,4,12,17 August 2008
Hardball," Starts out Ok, then quickly unravels downward
","Brian Robbins' Hardball is a movie that actually has a decent concept- a troubled gambler (Keanu Reeves) takes on coaching a baseball team in inner-city Chicago to pay off his large gambling debt.  Not bad, but then of course the film diverges into a pit of cliches, usual endings, and Reeves. This movie might have gotten a higher grade if not for Reeves.  The thing with him as an actor is that when he's good (Matrix, the Gift) he can be good, but when he gets a role like this (or like Sweet November for instance)  it's almost a near abomination.  One thing to point out that was a decent touch- the pitcher on the team (I don't remember the name) Reeves coaches listens to 'Big Poppa' by Biggie smalls in order to pitch strikes.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," 7,000,000 points for this movie: comic KO!
","Edgar Wright just keeps getting better as a director, and his latest offering after the good Shaun of the Dead and better Hot Fuzz is a kind of super-speed-surrealist take on young love and imagined video-game battles. It's a geek-storm of comedy, the kind of effort that we don't get too often in movies that are dictated down by committee and tested so much for laugh ratios. There are so many things that go on in a scene in this film that some of it will pass by your head. Or maybe not; maybe it's just the right tone for a combo platter of comic-book/anime/manga/8-bit-to-PS3-video-game movie that knows itself and knows its intended audience so well that it can be so POP in its sensibility. This is a super-comedy, suffused in melodramatic romance and fiery action, for people who still wonder what it's like to be surprised at the movies.I wish I could contain my enthusiasm for the movie enough, but it's hard to do. Wright pulls off such a high-wire act, the likes of which take me back several years ago to Kill Bill Vol. 1, or to comedy masters like Mel Brooks. The filmmaker just *gets* it, how to pull off material that is nothing too new but with an original eye and perspective for what's funny. And in this story- of Scott Pilgrim, a 'hipster' with a band (of course) dating a 17 year-old Catholic high school Asian girl named Knives (of course) and who falls for another hipster girl, Ramona Flowers (beautiful Mary Winstead) who dyes her hair every several days and has seven (give or take one or two) evil ex- boyfriends (and a girlfriend) to fight to the death- the intensity and energy goes hand-in-OMFG-hand with the subject matter. But what's even more impressive, as it was also with Hot Fuzz, is how much affection Wright really has for not just his source material, but how people who dig the culture and nature of it so much. He clearly does enjoy what's hip in music, video games, clothes, hair, action movies and kung-fu fights, but also knows how to satirize it until it bleeds its own blood. And boy does he get some juicy satire here, always in the name of good fun and, indeed, some melodrama. As Scott (Michael Cera in a kind of amalgam of his on-screen persona to a perfect nth degree) goes through these evil ex's, each with their own 'quirks' and super-powers, such as one being an egotistical movie-star jerk and mega- Vegan (Chris Evans and Brandon Routh respectively, also both brilliant), we see how his character does go through an arc, that it's not all just fun and games. If a video game like No More Heroes took the perfectly- confused love tale of (500) Days of Summer, it might look like this... kinda.What it comes down to is that for everything that is familiar, even down to the coins doing their EXPLOSION on the ground after a baddie dies, or how rock bands awesomely suck so much that they become awesome again, this is shot and scored and performed like nothing else you've seen this year, or most years. Wright keeps throwing things at the audience, and knows (or hopes) they'll keep up. At the same time it never bores with its (::I snap fingers::) rhythm, and, and if a joke doesn't fly to the sky it still gives some chuckles or belly laughs. Lines are instantly quotable, and one can't wait to tell friends and others about this character or this shot or punch, or how Jason Schwartzman reacts when he swallows his gum. It's a radioactive treasure trove of romantic comedy, blazing action, random beats, well-timed reactions and physical gestures, awkward longing, and lots of kick-ass rock songs. In other words, if you dig it, it will be the cult movie of your time. If not... move along, or FIGHT in the arena! A+",10,30,66,12 August 2010
The Usual Suspects," Good film, but over-rated from my perspective
","Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a clever (if not too clever) film that showcases some good actors in a better than average cops and robbers movie. Unfortunately, Singer brings some flaws (not immense, after all, how would Christopher McQuarie win a Oscar for his screenplay is the film's flaws weren't immense). That includes a ending twist that negates the whole film.Still, there are many good things in this film, including fine performances from Stephen Baldwin (surprisingly so), Benicio Del-Torro, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmienteri, and Kevin Spacey (his first Oscar he earned for). Not bad Overall. B+",6,9,29,8 December 2004
Inside Out," Joy and Sadness
","Inside Out is one of the most daring films for children - and for adults as well - that I can think of from Hollywood, in the sense that it tells the audience 'look, not only can you be sad sometimes, you NEED to be sad'. That may be the ultimate takeaway, but it permeates a lot of the conflict of the film; there's no real key 'villain' here, and like Pixar's previous film, Monsters University, there's no really clear antagonist ala the robot in WALL-E or Jason Lee in the Incredibles. The stakes are all about 'what is this person going to choose to do, to be, to have the growth and change of human experience?' And with kids too, it's a fascinating idea to explore in the depth this does. Many times as children, we're told to not be so sad, to pick up our spirits and be happy, or be happier, to not cry, to not be angry, and some children even get punished if they, say, cry too much or throw temper tantrums - if they're not 'normal' in the sense of having constant joy. Look at Winnie the Pooh to see the many different takes on outlooks, such as Tigger being boundless energy, Pooh being curiosity, Piglet fear, Rabbit the 'brains', with Eeyore being the one who is constantly sad, and almost made to seem like kind of a punch-line, the 'Nobody's here but me' deal.If that sounds a little deep to take your four year old too, don't worry: this is one of the company's most entertaining and, often, funny films. It builds exponentially on the segment from Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, where we saw inside the mind of a man while on a date/during sex. Of course this is a PG kid's movie so it can't go there (It's an 11 year old-girl after all), but the filmmakers give us five 'emotions' with Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, who all control little Riley as she goes about her life. When her family moves to San Francisco, and a mishap occurs in the control room - Joy and Sadness get taken away and, in maybe the one real Pixar trope (Toy Stories and Nemo come to mind), they got to get back to where they need to be.Growing up and experiencing new things is what Inside Out is about, and getting there is the ultimate conflict. And while it appeals to kids who may be going through this (or will), and for adults who can tap into what Riley goes through, it doesn't stop for jokes involving the different places inside the consciousness sphere: sub-consciousness, 'Dream-Land' (the movie studio, with the dream filter over the camera lens for filming), Imagination-Land, and (my personal favorite) Abstract Thought, where beings turn step by step into shapes and colors.This latter one shows off just how endlessly clever Pixar can be, by making doodles and figures one might see in a painting right before us. And even the Emotion characters themselves keep making the studio work wonders: look at how the hair and fibers on these things comes off and has the depth of detail one always look for in the films from these guys. By now the company could be resting on their laurels solely - and there are some more (unnecessary?) sequels to come. But Inside Out poses another challenge for them, to make all of these different 'lands' and environments, the max of the Memory Balls, the 'Train of Thought', everything that shows everything was given consideration and metric-tons of creative wit.There's many laughs to be had following along with Joy and Sadness as they try to find their way back, and this is balanced out by the very real, painful things that a child goes through, especially at the age of 11. It's difficult to make an authentic movie in live-action, but in animation it just comes off like a miracle of some kind; all of the peril means something, and a seemingly goofy side character, like Bing-Bong the imaginary friend to Riley, is fully realized as anyone else in the film. Watch when Riley's objects in Imagination Island fall away, and Bing-Bong doesn't know what to do with himself, as Sadness comes up and makes him go forward. Joy doesn't realize why this should be - why can't she cheer him up? It may or may not be obvious, which is what makes the storytelling so precise and tender and spot-on.Some clichés are dealt with - have a dream with your underpants on and falling teeth, of course - and I wouldn't want it any other way in this film. Inside Out is rich in everything you want in a movie: comedy, drama, thrills, and, more than once real catharsis. It doesn't kid the kids, or the adults. You need everything inside you to be whole, is what it means to say, and it does it with brio and understanding of the human spirit.",10,8,34,25 June 2015

Resident Evil," One of the worst films I've seen so far in 2002
","I remember reading somewhere that George A. Romero, the great horror picture director, was originally slated to write and possibly direct the transformation of the playstation video game of the same name to the screen. Then it was also reported that the studio decided to go with another director on the project which to me indicates 1 of 2 scenarios- 1, Romero had lost his edge as a zombie film artist and did maybe write a bad script, or 2 (which is what I believe), the studios couldn't recognize what was possibly an intelligent script in the tradition of his 'Dead' trilogy (I can only speculate by the way) and decided to go with something that was a lot more dumbed down for their standards.Whichever is the case, this is the result, a zombie movie where, truth be told, the zombies aren't quite the most ominous and terrorsome threat to the people in attendance in the film- a mega computer system in the form of a semi/mute HAL in a military complex is and that is one of many flaws and miscalculations here.  Another is that the script has the dialogue span that a 10 year old would consider short winded (and this is a rated R movie) and development, yes even in action, that is not really good.  In fact, the only thing keeping me from failing this is that the zombies when they do appear, look OK and the laser death sequence is a bit keen.In short, this is the type of living dead movie where you can see what's on the other side of the spectrum of a movie like Day of the Dead (Romero's least effort) where there was more talk than action which didn't work that well and then this where even the action doesn't help to elevate poor writing (at least Day had a memorable ending).  Hardcore Resident Evil fans should stick to the games and movies.  Grade: Between D- and F+",4,3,9,15 March 2002
Quantum of Solace," do men still want to be *this* 007?
","One of the longest standing traditions- or if not that at least pleasant clichÃ©s- of the 007 franchise has been that James Bond, more or less depending on the actor, is someone women want and men want to be. With the James Bond of the new Daniel Craig variety, women still probably want him (of all people my own mother can't get enough of the 'getting-out-of-the-ocean' shot from Casino Royale), but now more than ever with Quantum of Solace I'm not sure what men will want to trade hats with this one. This is the coldest and most ruthless of all of the James Bond portrayals, both in Craig's efficient performance (in his own way he's as interesting an actor as Connery if on the opposite end of the spectrum) and in the treatment in the 'serious' action-movie tone, and while Bond has always killed first and asked questions later this time one feels no guilty-pleasure fun in Bond's fights and deathly encounters.Matter of fact, even more-so than Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace feels more like a slick and (sometimes) precisely oiled action-movie machine and less like the 'fun' days of Bond from his early years. This is a conscious decision to try new things, which is fine, but there's a sort of disassociation I felt to the film from time to time, that without so much as a shred of any real fun to the piece (and do try to distinguish between fun and camp, it's the difference between many Bond adventures) it goes on and on with its one-time-only sequel structure to Casino Royale holding only so much water. The kicker is that after so much time spent in a 'realistic' Bond world, which is a little like a cousin of the Bourne series at this point (I'm not the first to point to this but it's an obvious point worth making), the climax comes around to what appears to be a standard Bond-type over-the-top setting: a hotel in the middle of the desert built, perhaps, for the simple reason of burning it to the ground by the end. Uh-huh.But all of this gripping doesn't mean the picture doesn't have some entertainment value or things worthwhile about it. As said, Craig is a solid 'serious' Bond just as Christian Bale is a solid 'serious' Bruce Wayne/Batman. I also loved seeing French character actor Mathieu Amalric (Munich, Diving Bell & Butterfly) playing the villain Dominic Greene; he's built perfectly to play any villain, and in this instance her fits in wonderfully. It's only a shame he takes up more screen time than mostly wooden Olga Kurylenko. And yet for all of the mild joys of watching any Bond picture, the direction of the picture does start to wear down on a viewer not ready for its Eisenstein-on-crack editing values. Marc Forster, for all of his talents in directing an interesting cast (Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright also have small parts), is terrible with most of the action scenes. So much of it whizzes by, cranked to 11 with its cuts creating the effect of whiplash. Some may find this perfectly intense, which is fine. Personally, I pined for some of the more 'static' action sequences of old-school Bond - even Campbell's Casino Royale, which handled another similar level of intensity far more effectively.So, 007 will continue on with its latest and bravest of the Bonds, and the plots will continue to get further crazier and possibly even colder and cranked past 11. All well and good. Just don't expect anything too amazing.",5,5,10,20 November 2008

The Dirty Dozen," one of the supreme 'd*** flicks' of its time
","If you want that charge of adrenaline, and more than a few laughs, from an era when men were MEN, in capital letters, look no further. And what entertaining, all-absorbing MEN, or rather real-life stars. The basic gist we got here is as follows: Lee Marvin is the Major who leads a a rag-tag group of convicts in WW2 Europe on a daring, very dangerous mission to kill as many officers possible in a huge fortress. The premise has that ensemble ring of Seven Samurai, but it's given that level of pathos that is not entirely dissimilar (or not featuring some of the same cast members) as Cool Hand Luke. This isn't your common war movie in the sensibility of the characters, a mentality that has just that whiff of professionalism and a whole lot of 'let's mess with the heads of those in charge.' It's a balancing act that director Aldrich tries for with the material, with half the movie being bad-ass hijinks- bordering almost on sophomoric, as the music often chimes a level between chirpy military anthem and Donald Duck- and the other as hard-edged action movie.While Aldrich is up to task, performing his directorial duties with a cool professionalism (particularly in the climactic attack on the fortress, which goes between exhilarating and terrifying and with suspense thrown in for obvious measure), it's the cast assembled that make the mark it as an excellent effort. Everybody is spot-on, from Cassavetes, in one of his most notable turns, as a wise-ass who wises up, to Bronson and Brown in their own distinctive molds, to Sutherland's aloof 'General', and to especially the real psycho in Savalas. Even parts that are pretty standard like Borgnine and Kennedys' parts are fulfilled with all their worth. And Marvin steers the ship with a level fo vigor that defines what the hell we guys watch these flicks for. He's no fake; beneath his actual acting chops he's the kind of guy who looks like, under these circumstances (not to mention, especially, Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One), like he can get things done.But beneath the veneer of being a total hard-head who won't take any guff and can poise attack or defense in a heartbeat, there's humanity to him. And this, too, reflects a good lot of the Dirty Dozen. Just watch the scene where the girls are brought in from town to 'amuse' the soldiers. That moment when all of those guys, bearded and without a shower in weeks, are before these semi-attractive ladies, are sort of humbled and Franco asks one to dance despite the lack of music, which he hums. This interaction itself doesn't have much to do with the plot, albeit the scene's needed to get Marvin in trouble later with his superiors, but it's crucial to see a glimpse of the other side to these men, when all of a sudden taken out of their 'guy' element. And it's a help that there's this backdrop of humility in the face of wackiness and a climax that stands as one of the greats in war movies. 9.5/10",9,2,6,13 March 2008
Gone with the Wind," Breathless, beautifully mounted and idiotic. It's America at its brightest and dumbest.
","Gone with the Wind is a gorgeously polished rancid-egg of a Hollywood spectacle. I want to say 'turd', but that's not entirely fair. It's got perhaps THE most awful protagonist in popular cinema - and Rhett Butler isn't too far behind, though at least Gable finds some of the smirk in the performance - while De Havilland is the one who gets it unironically and Howard is completely adrift and knowing he's fatally miscast. It's maximum effort and art and craft and production ingenuity in service of a story where the character doesn't grow (or, if she does, it's a fake and she goes back to being the spoiled 'fiddle-dee-dee' brat of the world) and seriously lags in the 2nd half until a lot of people start dying and/or get hurt.Oh, and the 'I'll never go hungry again!' bit makes no sense.",7,1,11,21 May 2017
No Country for Old Men," You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair.
","No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor. More than this, it's also about as good a morality play as one could ask for, because it plays and tools and makes very serious questions about what is moral, or what isn't, or what is so ambiguous that it's all up to the toss of a coin or a chance ride out of town. There are a few interpretations to Bardem's character Anton that could be taken, but one thing is certain- he's less a symbol than a real presence, a 'ghost' as Jones's sheriff calls him that can come around at the drop of a pin, usually in the dark, and strike the utmost fear (or confusion if you're a clerk) in the hearts of men and women. You'll never look at a coin toss the same way again. Or an air-gun. Or fixing a bullet wound in a leg. Or a hunt at a motel. Or even the aftermath of a car crash.But at the same time it's the purest time of cinema, recalling Hitchcock and Leone and Welles's Touch of Evil and the best of noir and westerns. There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could- you can't look at his eyes, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what professional who can say), which occasional tear- and it's obviously worthy of an Oscar. And Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally 'emote'. Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.It's gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense (I clenched many a knuckle during some scenes), surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner not seen by the Coens in many years, and artistically fashioned to a beat that is meditative (watch the opening moments with Jones's voice-over), simple, and doomed. It's beautiful and terribly tragic, for McCarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest to his material- even if you haven't read the book itself the Road will give an indication of the mood and atmosphere at hand- and at the moment I can't think of any other film that would be the best pick of the year- maybe one of the best films I've ever seen.",10,761,1265,9 November 2007
District 9," a ruthless satire and a (mostly) kick-ass blockbuster
","District 9 doesn't f*** around, mostly. It's a harsh look at a harsh people, mainly us. It asks a question posed countless times before: what would happen if 'they' came 'here' and how would we respond and they act. By the end of District 9, a movie where we see an alien ship stalled over Johannesburg and the million or so 'prawn' aliens taken and put into a slum of the movie's title, you'll wonder deeply about our own ethical state of being. You might wonder also why Neill Blomkamp, the director (first time feature by the way), didn't show more of the aliens, at least until the second half of the film. This is intentional on his part because it's about drawing specific parallels in how human beings will look at a culture that is the 'other', and I do mean 'other'.And it doesn't have to be a parallel specifically to South Africa and the Apartheid, though that comparison can certainly be made if one seeks to. What about immigration in America, or even going back to how the US treated Indians? Or how about looking in the movie at the whole vicious cycle of taking a displaced people (without their leaders, by the way, which is why the 'prawns' are so despondent to do anything on their stranded ship) who are put into a ghetto and basically put there to eventually be just 'eh, whatever, they can go somewhere else, they can die for all I care.' That the humans just shuffle the aliens around- as early on in the eviction scenes with Wilkus Van Der Merwe- lack understanding of them, and it's through these humans (and sometimes through a documentary-lens perspective) we have our point of view. That and, you know, the aliens just want to go home and all of that.It gives us the story of Mr. Van Der Merwe, a bureaucrat at the MNU, the government group that oversees alien affairs in District 9 and after 20 years makes the decision to do a mass eviction to what is an even more cramped quarter a few miles away. But Van Der Merwe (a very common name in South Africa I'm told) gets infected by some spray in a can that one of the aliens named 'Christopher' has been using for some special project, and soon poor Wilkus becomes the first human to be fused with alien DNA, growing fingers that can also operate the firearms the aliens brought and that no humans can really operate. A first-time movie actor Sharlto Copley is also revealed to us by Blomkamp in a fantastic performance for any actor; what my friend compared to Michael Scott from the Office turning into Cronenberg's Fly.Blomkamp said that originally the film was going to have a final third that would have been 'more cerebral' as opposed to the shoot-em-up that is now in the film. I'm not sure who will agree, but considering that he took the popcorn movie direction, it's not at all a bad course to have taken given the results. Blomkamp isn't the best action direction ever, but he does know something important with this type of story (and having Peter Jackson as producer doesn't hurt and only helps in this regard): visual effects matter. The aliens and their whole world, so to speak, that is brought to Earth looks wholly believable, and we're even given that contradiction of human eyes and a disgusting face (save for the child prawn) that makes it hard to really accept them as something living and thinking but they are. And the ship and its things look much better than other things in terms of crazy-CGI technology from this summer. Just compare, if you will, to last week's GI Joe and get a kick in the nuts as to what can be possible in stunning visual effects. It's here, really.I can't say District 9 is perfect or even a great movie. It's hard to follow entirely with seeing the humans as being three-dimensional since they're either seen as military hard-heads or one-sided bureaucrats... and, of course, Wilkus the only human who has a transformation over the course of the film from mouse to man-mouse. But what intrigues is intriguing, and the satire is wicked-hot, much like a Romero film. We see an ugly side to nature, and maybe a sliver of hope, but mostly District 9 digs into us to make us ask what we think and feel about these creatures from another world. Would we do the same? Maybe we already have to our own fellow species? 8.5/10",8,17,29,16 August 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Smaug rules, and the rest of the movie... is okay (thought I'd say 'drools' didn't ya)
","Bilbo is supposedly the lynch-pin of this whole story - hell, it's called 'The Hobbit' after all, and it's about (as the song in the 1977 animated film starts, 'The greeeeatest adventurrrre') - but damn if you'd know it watching the majority of this entry. I say the 'majority' as he does show up in large part at the end, when it comes time to enter the castle in the mountains and the face-off against the dragon, Smaug, who has hoarded over the dwarfs' gold. But with the exception of a few scenes scattered about, it felt like there was a lack of Bilbo, which is a shame since Martin Freeman is so moving and funny and on-point in this role of the quirky 'straight-man' to these much quirkier, rambunctious dwarfs led by who is arguably the real protagonist - or co-protagonist - Thorin Oakensheild.Let's talk about that for a moment. For what he's asked to do, Richard Armitage isn't exactly bad in the role, not by a long-shot. He is there and present in this character if the hardcase leader of the dwarfs who has a rightful problem with his father, the former king of the dwarfs, being killed. He wants revenge and justice and so on, but the character just feels so flatly written and plain, somehow there was just a little more dimension with the Lord of the Rings trilogy's mirror character, Aragorn. Thorin comes into a scene and makes his declarations, which is what you do in a fantasy epic like this. But I never really felt for the character so strongly or his quest so much, despite the ending of the first film where there is something of an arc between him trusting Bilbo. Again, not a bad character, but something that I wish was a little more strongly written or played dimension-wise.Like the other two films in this unnecessary trilogy, there's padding. This is like looking at a nervous football player, loaded up so that he doesn't get pummeled. It's mainly in the inclusion of the elves, and an elf/dwarf romance that comes when the dwarfs are captured momentarily and the really handsome one and Evangeline Lilly's elf fall for one another. Oh, and Legolas returns and there's sort of a hint of a love triangle, because these epics need them nowadays. Not bad actors, once again, and Lilly has more than proved herself on Lost to be capable with a bad-ass action heroine as her character is here. But where's the purpose with the main story? There's no connective tissue with this, and just enough (though added not from the Hobbit but from appendices that Tolkien wrote - just that word 'appendices' like an organ you don't need) with Gandalf on his separate quest which will figure in to this whole SIX film epic at hand.There's enough well-filmed action and peril to keep things moving along not briskly, but in a manner that I at least didn't fall asleep... well, I did get annoyed by a barrel chase for technical reasons (sure, throw in a low-quality go-pro camera in the river chase while you're mostly using the highest-quality RED cameras, sure, why the hell not?) But, at least, the sequence with Smaug is perfect. It's a marvelous CGI creation that ironically brings back together from Sherlock Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who voices and also does the motion-capture work for the dragon of the title. This is a sequence fraught with tension, clever dialog (much of it with Bilbo's riddles, and this is very similar to the animated film by the way), and intense action and suspense. It's what one wants to see from one of these movies, with a dollop of humor as well.If only the rest of the film had that. Desolation of Smaug is a good movie, on the whole, but it's so uneven that it may frustrate those who aren't already super-psyched to return to Middle Earth anyway.",7,3,4,3 January 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," both amazing and annoying, it's a revisionist western with content and style
","With maybe the longest title of any film this year, the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, writer/director Andrew Dominik is out to make a real statement on the legacy of outlaw Jesse James and the man who shot him, Robert Ford. Was it murder or almost a kind of suicide? Was Bob Ford a hero, a coward, or just reluctant to get any of the press he originally might have wanted as a youth? Questions are raised legitimately by the filmmaker, and they aren't questions that shouldn't be overlooked. But there's a catch, actually a couple: as Dominik wants to stay truthful to the original source AND make an epic film, he makes a work that tells too much while also showing in a style that veers between the magisterial and the false. It's a subjective thing, to be sure, when looking at the cinematography of a film and how it is effective to the senses, though it could be something more legitimately arguable in looking at if it works for the material itself. These, of course, are the big minuses, which I'll get to in a moment.But one aspect to 'Jesse James' that should be noteworthy all the way is Brad Pitt's performance. He's been a Hollywood star since I can remember, even going back to the mid-90s when he started to break out of character actor parts and into marquee status. Now here's a sort of throwback to the best work he's done as a quasi-chameleon and still with the gravitas of a star. It's a mesmerizing portrayal of a man who is as mysterious as he is deadly, psychotic, loving, paranoid, scary, crazy, affable, and even charming. Just a little facial movement or raise or lowering of the lip indicates so much, and Pitt nails it every time, even in scenes where he almost starts to drag along with the dialog. It is, at the least, worthwhile alone to see the film for him (maybe a little less so for the rest of the cast who, while good at what they do, are there as typical back-up western parts). Affleck is also a good co-star, who has to play mostly in one-note status (mostly pouty, like a nerdy kid on the playground who is scared s***-less but out for blood). But it is, at its best, the Brad Pitt show, which is rare to see as of late in his career.In fact, it's probably Pitt that probably kept me in my seat through most of the film. Dominik's direction and writing are, on the other hand, a mixed bag. He wants to make a sprawling, affecting tome on the nature of a legend and of the effect it has on those around the person (who is, as Ford acknowledges, just a person), while coating it as an auteur. His tactic is to take as much narration possible, and it's literal overkill (no pun intended); we hear some moments when the narrator comments on Robert Ford looking through a closet! What does this add? It turns right from the start, and off and on until especially the last fifteen minutes, into a history lesson as much as a dramatization, which disrupts the intentions of making it a subjective perspective. OK, it's known, James was an icon for Americans as a figure of anti-establishment as part of a kind of establishment (not above the law but not one who should've been killed by a man of no consequence like Bob Ford). But does it need to be pounded over the head? It doesn't help then that cinematographer Roger Deakins adds to the mixed feelings. He captures many wide vistas, tight rooms and dark night exteriors (I did love the train robbing shots) like a true pro. But what are we to make of the constant shots with soft-focus? The explanation I have read is that it's meant to represent the truth that is blurred by legend in the story. That's fine to hear after the fact, but while sitting and watching the movie it just doesn't make sense- it's less poetry and more a consistent form of drab self-indulgence. After seeing No Country for Old Men, where Deakins made, ironically, a better looking western set in 1980, it becomes clear that the directing has to also be taken into account. And this goes without saying that it isn't a bad movie at all. Dominik does explore the themes at work here, with the damnation of betrayal and the fatality of the criminal, plus the side of America as a kind of hidden backdrop of pain and misery and fear of death. It's just that they're explored for too long and without the kind of depth that's really required. If you're looking for a real classic interpretation of the Jesse James/Robert Ford saga, watch I Shot Jesse James by Samuel Fuller. It might not have the aspirations of great art that 'Assassination' has, but in its B-movie way it's almost a masterpiece in examining some of the same material.",7,4,9,10 November 2007
Days of Thunder," some good Towne-script moments and a superb cast, but...
","Yeah, Top Gun is the one that made all the very BIG bucks back in 1986 and put Tony Scott and Tom Cruise on the map in bigger ways then they had been before (not to mention producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer), but somehow, much as with De Palma/Pacino with Scarface and Carlito's Way, the follow-up seemed to probably be the actual better film of the two. Does this mean that Days of Thunder, following the travails of an up-and-comer racecar star (Cruise), is a really good movie? Well, in some ways yes, and in other ways not so much.I give the production this: it moves fast and slick, and whenever cars are on the track it's visually compelling and exciting as the filmmakers know how to cut stuff together for Fast Impact (lest not forget the camera-work, filled with colors and smoke and cool contours, even a shot with Nicole Kidman standing at one point on the side of the frame is great to look at). And the casting here is fantastic; and forget Cruise, how about Robert Duvall (has he ever been anything less than solid, and here he's actually giving this conventional Trainer-cum-Mentor some soul), or Nicole Kidman (who gets really some of the best lines in the film), or Michael Rooker (by now something of an underrated character actor national treasure, and here imbuing an a-hole with a lot of sympathy and pathos)? Why not throw in John C. Reilly in there too, he has a couple of memorable moments too.Where it flails? Sadly, and I'm not sure if this is really on Towne's end - and one should note that Cruise has his only (?) writing credit here as co-story author - or the producers, but this all the same is light-weight stuff. There's not much conflict to the proceedings, or much that sticks to the gravel, no pun intended (OK, some). This is the kind of movie that gives people like Duvall some excellent scenes to at least try to overcome the clichés of the sports movie (and make no mistake, that's what this is deep down, and a 'programmer' of the old-time-studio variety, not a terrible thing inherently)... and then you got Cary Elwes as 'Russ Wheeler'. The last time one saw a motorist with the last name Wheeler was in a Disney Goofy cartoon about Motor Madness. And Randy Quaid, who is OK, also is saddled with some very basic material to work with here as the businessman who turns on a dime. There may be some stakes, like for Rooker's character, yet for Cruise there's not much there that makes it feel like 'Oh no, s***'s getting real here!' In other words, Days of Thunder has some genuinely good stuff to it, and it has some personality and verve and, for a couple of moments, sex appeal in that, uh, late 80's/early 90's style (and hey, this was the movie Cruise and Kidman met after all, so you can see the chemistry as white hot as they come). But it's hard not to eye-roll at some of the story choices and character motivations, or things like, say, the movie ending on an unironic freeze frame at a very silly moment. It's one of those things where I give it a tepid recommendation and/or a very strong put-down, if that makes sense. Quality, dumb-studio filmmaking for the masses - and, for sure, a step up from the waste of Top Gun. 6.5/10",6,7,8,26 July 2015
Remember the Titans," Denzel pulls through
","The film is Remember the Titans.  I won't remember the Titans forever, but I will remember the scenes.  Denzel Washington (as always) pulls together some great acting for this film, as a coach who is part of a team of great athletes who must win, or he's out of a job.  But it's more about football, it is also about race in the south and about acceptance.  At the end of the movie I felt feeling good.  Maybe not great but good.  And that's what a film like Remember the Titans should do.  Make me happy to see a good football/dramedy with Washington at the helm.  A-",7,1,3,29 September 2000
Batman Begins," a spectacular re-invention of the series, 2nd (or perhaps as good as) Burton's 89 vision
","It's always a challenge to take material from the comic to the screen, and to make it powerful enough, and entertaining enough, without getting overly preachy with the material, getting hyper kinetic with the action, or worst of all losing your audience. The last Batman film, Batman & Robin, committed the later crime, and put a stigma on the franchise for several years. But now there is Christopher Nolan, talented director behind the cult favorite Memento, and the under-rated Insomnia remake of 2002, who has taken the origins of the Dark Knight into a different direction, or at least to a better one. His film, Batman Begins, has the power, has the entertainment, and it doesn't cheat its target audience (the die-hard Batman fans) or the general public. There isn't as much humor as the first film (this film's only tiny liability), but there is that genuine dark sensibility that can take in kids as well as adults. That the story and characters are as important as the action sequences and fights is another bonus.The cast Nolan has put together is no less better than expected. Christian Bale is, arguably, a more compelling Bruce Wayne/Batman than Michael Keaton, or at the least he tries to put some feeling into his performance in ways that either Keaton didn't do or just in a different way. Since Nolan has license to reinvent the series, he changes around certain elements with Batman's origin (that I will not reveal here), and it brings about some changes in the line-up. Michael Caine is a good butler Alfred; Morgan Freeman is dependable as always as Batman's supplier; Gary Oldman this time is Gordon; and Nolan is also wise in not only Bruce's quasi-love interest (played by Katie Holmes, not too bad), but also in character actors like Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. And there's also Liam Neeson, in an unlikely (though maybe familiar- Star Wars/Kingdom of Heaven?) mentor for Wayne to form his alter-ego.Simply this- Batman Begins works because as a summer popcorn action blockbuster, it's definitely not too dumb or tire-bound in clichés (not that there aren't a few, which is a given), and it keeps enough adrenaline and surprises with the action/set pieces. The classic, Gothic look of Burton's films is gone for the most part, but what's replaced by Nolan is often creepy and urban (if at least a consistent color of browns), which gives Gotham a cool edge;sometimes I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. And I liked how Nolan did certain things with the structure of the story early on- which is his specialty as a true-blue professional- in a kind of non-linear way, keeping the audience off balance but not too much to know where things were headed. Basically, if you've been waiting over ten years for a Batman movie that works, this is it.",10,8,12,16 June 2005
Twilight," whoever you are, girl or boy, man or woman, Twilight is shoddy, pretentious film-making
","Look, whoever-you-are-readers, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm a 20-something gent who just likes watching movies, usually good ones. I can also go for the occasional really stupid/fun bad movie or incredible guilty pleasure. With Twilight, I knew it was, according to what I heard and read and seen about it, *meant* for teenage girls, I suppose, since it's one of those super dated and tried-and-whatever stories of a girl falling for a guy she's not supposed to and bad stuff happens - only with vampires. I can't speak for anyone except myself in saying it simply stating that it's not a good movie. Period.And it's not just about the treatment of vampires. Sure, there's that. Sure there is the facet of these being diluted and watered down so-called vampires to the point of being nothing but mockable. But it's simply a story that on its own terms is not told well. It's shot through the filter of whiter-blue-shade-of-pale, where the intent, I guess, is to make Washington state (specifically the town of Fork) look like this all the time.The director, Catherine Hardwicke, has directed some decent films before, such as 2003's Thirteen. But here she tackles the material without any subtlety. The cast, featuring sometimes very-good-actors Kristen Stewart and (yes) Robert Pattinson, seem to be in the kind of 'method* subtlety that comes with that caveat of years of the James Dean in-breeding school of acting. Her camera people roam around without, usually, any sense of placement for the sake of the story, and, well, the story itself reeks of stupidity and consequence in the most mind-boggling of happenstances.Perhaps there could have been at least a semi-interesting or compelling story here, with an out-of-town girl in a new town meeting a young mysterious man at her high school and falling in love and finding he's a vampire and still being really turned on by it and yada yada bad things happen. Or maybe I'm wishing impossible things. Coming from a book by Stephenie Meyer that is more Harlequin romance than vampire lore, it's central problem is giving us characters not only not likable, but without personality. Say what you will about the corny aspects of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it had characters and story lines that actually meant things, with personalities and humor and real drama that could be affecting. In Twilight the coldness of the environment is reflected quadruple-fold in the characters and story, and the film-making, shoddy as it is, probably reflects that attitude of the book.Oh, and of course, it's corny poppycock a lot of the time, but again it shouldn't have been a problem. I might have even laughed out loud, for all the wrong reasons, at one of the most unintentionally funny scenes of the decade with the vampire baseball scene (yes, it's as ludicrous and bang-your-head-against-the-wall-till-you-bleed without any point for the story save for a West Side Story stand-off). But aside from its abstinence-only allegory (and believe you me, this is the antithesis of 2008's Teeth), there's nothing here a viewer can take away of worth. Nada. Zilch. There's nothing interesting in the romance because the characters are either boring miscreants, befuddled side characters like Bella's father, or 1/2 dimensional drones like that 'bad' vampire in the mirrors climax.And finally, nothing to add significantly to vampire lore, save for its pop culture phenomena. Maybe I'm missing something the teen girls are seeing, maybe there's something oh-so dreamy about that pretentious navel gazer Edward. But a duck is a duck, and Twilight is an overwrought, meddling piece of a twaddle-corpse movie.",2,12,17,25 July 2009

While too much of the injected skag of usual turns and characters are found in Blue Crush, not to mention the always important climactic contest (can a sports film not lead to a major contest in the end?) and (spoiler) picture of the winner on the cover of surfing magazine, while all that is there, there is an audience for Blue Crush, and they ride that wave out.

To Rome With Love," a light trifle for Woody Allen is still amusing, hit-and-miss entertainment
","You kinda always know what you'll get with Woody Allen films by this point, which is that for every work that he does that knocks it out of the park (Match Point, Midnight in Paris), he'll come back and then... make a film that just stays as a single or double, to use baseball terms (i.e. Scoop, and this film). To Rome with Love is another 'Woody's European City Tour' that follows London, Barcelona and of course Paris, and with Rome he pays tribute by doing one of those Italian anthology comedies (I haven't seen a lot of them frankly, but I'm thinking like back in the 60's with Boccaccio 62), and there are four stories that Woody could also have made individual films. Well, two would have been potentially amazing if they had the right focus (one of them, not so much, the time it has here is fine). Let's quickly rundown:Woody himself returns for the first time on screen since Scoop (a little too old to be the romantic lead anymore, aside from, say, married to Judy Davis), and he and his wife go to see their daughter, played by Allison Pill, who is set to get married to Michelangelo. His parents are simple Roman folk, the father a mortician... who is also an amazing opera singer, but the catch is that he can only sing great in the shower (don't we all?) so Woody makes a trick: have him sing in the shower - on STAGE! Alec Baldwin plays a guy who, I think, looks back on his younger self as an impressionable architect (Jesse Eisenberg, very Woody-esque surrogate, but plays his own strengths well as well) who has a new romantic interest in the super-neurotic actress Ellen Page plays (a different turn for her that I had fun watching, though intentionally annoying as a character). An Italian couple are in love and are unfortunately separated and, through wacky misunderstandings, wind up with other partners over the course of one day. And Roberto Benigni is a regular guy chased by the paparazzi. Why? Why not?Woody juggles between these stories and, the worst I can say about it is, it has an air of a sitcom to it. There's some misunderstandings and usually around fame or love or sex, or all of the above, and it's not too deep. Well, maybe the Baldwin/Eisenberg plot has some poignancy about a Man of the World who looks back on his youthful indiscretion, or would-be one, and there is a lot of humor to be mined. Hell, it's great to see Benigni have fun and be actually funny again in his premise, where he starts to go down deeper in the rabbit hole of fame. And while it's the weakest plot of all with the two Italian lovers split apart, when Penelope Cruz comes on screen for her brief time she's sexy, fun, and intelligent in her acting. Even Woody Allen himself, telling a lot of the brand of old, semi-corny jokes (but ALWAYS with a knowing wit and punchline) is amusing. But when comedy works, it works, and there's a lot of stuff that worked here for me more than it didn't. Just seeing the old Italian man singing in the shower on stage (and applying/washing off Pagliaci make- up!) is a gag that only the most cynical would turn off on. It's a master filmmaker having fun, and a jazz clarinetist (yeah, I'm going there) noodling around on his instrument in a cinematic sort of way. I think for the summer season, which has passed know, it's a fine way to spend an afternoon or evening, not to mention with a wonderful cast by older-and-young Hollywood players and Italian not-so-well-known folks. Just not in an OMG YOU MUST SEE THIS IT WILL WIN AN Oscar sort of experience.",7,17,24,2 September 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," overlong, stuffed the gills, occasionally truly, unabashedly great
","Originally Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct the Hobbit series. Whether he had two or three films at the time he was in pre-production is uncertain, but he still retains a co-writing credit on the scripts. His presence, I think, can be most felt in this film, An Unexpected Journey, which also takes the most from JRR Tolkien's original book of the title. His sense of grandeur and love for creatures - unique, big, small, darker and more disgusting and 'out-there', the better, which I'm sure jived with Peter Jackson's tastes - is there big and large here, and it helps in moments... and perhaps detracts in others when things go on, and on, and on.Now that the trilogy is complete, I can look back on this first film and see that there was actually a lot that was good about it, at least in the sense of kicking off this new series of films starring that Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, arguably the reason if nothing else to see the movie as it's a tremendous performance for all of the little moments and gestures he gets right). Bilbo is a stubborn little guy, though not as much as the dwarfs who crash his house to eat and inform him - via Gandalf the Grey and Thorin Oakenshield, a son of a departed king - that he is to go on a journey to help them get back their gold and kingdom from a diabolical dragon named Smaug.Of course, this was originally a children's book - not three separate ones like LOTR, just one, and the first version was not as complex as it later became with rewrites and reissues - and here it gets puffed up to unimaginable heights. Though shortened and imperfect, a 1977 animated film got the whole story in under 90 minutes. Ironic that Jackson's 'Rings' series was the best criticism of the Bakshi adaptation, where now it's reversed. His film is loaded with action and adventure, some of it well choreographed, scary, exciting, deranged, and just... long. And, as with a lot of franchises (including Star Wars) things have to tie together, even if inorganically. Hence you get appearances from Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett (albeit as actors they're never unwelcome, just sad it's this dragging material) as characters not in the book, only to serve as connecting tissue for the 'Larger' threat that is really in the background of a tale of a little hobbit and the dwarfs.The film is the definition of hit or miss, and when it misses, such as an overbearing climax that just feels too BIG for its britches, giving a massive dose of epic battle to something that isn't that big, it's a lot to bear. But when it hits, I hasten to say it was almost (not quite, but almost) worth it for Jackson to come back to this series. The highlight above all else is Bilbo's 'Riddles in the Dark' with Gollum. Though the visual effects were astonishing and groundbreaking with him years ago, here they've gotten *better* and, in just once scene, we get so much from this character all over again - a showstopper, naturally for Andy Serkis in the best possible way, playing it for comedy, tragedy, horror, everything you dig about this character - that it's a reminder how much character is paramount in these types of films. You can have all the sweeping shots of New Zealand and characters running this way and that and CGI monsters and peril... but two people having a conflict over a piece of gold is much, much more intriguing.Indeed that one scene is a 10/10. But there's too much 'filler', so to speak, scenes that drag and characters who either have too much backstory (Thorin, the a-hole of the series and the kind of co-protagonist with Bilbo) or not enough. I enjoyed Unexpected Journey, maybe, just barely, the most out of all these new releases. But the lack of a consistent tone - some things played for much broader comedy than anything in Lord of the Rings, some things so dark that they nearly become comical, and action that feels like it's still going even after the movie ends - I don't know. It's a film where you can feel brilliance and mediocrity fighting one another.",7,2,4,21 December 2014
Before Sunset," what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer, but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here
","Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.Like Bergman's films, in particular Scenes From a Marriage (if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here), Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind, in the immediate sense anyway. Jessie is even more digging-in with his cynicism and wit, and Celine with her opinions on the world at large, family and on past relationships. But when it comes to getting at their connection, it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws. If the two of them were happy, to be certain, there would be no movie, but it's the characters' connection to that one night in Vienna, and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened, and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time. Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart, functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres- Jessie is married and with a kid, but not very happy in it, and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship- but the singular, glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses.Linklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties, even if it doesn't feel totally complete; I want to see how their story might end, however obvious it should and probably would be. One knows this could never work in real life, aside from the practical-side of it all, yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable. This, plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors, as Hawke and Delpy, as to be expected, seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the given-luscious scapes of Paris in afternoon, and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever. If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance, since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered, however conscious they want them answered or not. But as with the first one, I still loved being around these two, who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about, almost shockingly similar (one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland), and then in a slight cloud of romanticism.It ends ambiguous, maybe too ambiguous, as I found myself saying 'huh, what', but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film: one may take away something from this tale, or someone else another, but there it is, clear as day. Before Sunset is a straightforward romance, and proud of it, being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex. One of Linklater's best.",10,9,12,19 March 2007
Man on the Moon," One of the best of the year, again
","Man on the Moon is a really good film.  I thought it might not be too good, but with Jim Carrey, you can't loose.  He portrays Andy Kaufam in ways that makes us laugh and cry (sort of).  Milos Forman directs in a really great form in bringing Kaufman's life (not who he was, but what he was).  Plenty of cameos can't break Carrey's charm.  A+",8,0,0,1 May 2000
The Princess Bride," a fun fairytale satire, as much as it is a successful fable for pure genre fans
","Rob Reiner was on a streak in the mid 80s, and though it could be argued he his his peak at the start with Spinal Tap, this and Stand by Me can be considered two other important works in his decidedly since mixed career as a director. Princess Bride is as self-conscious as comedies get, but it's also a lot of fun for the whole family, and it's not just a typical aside to say so. On the contrary, as an adult now I find it funnier seeing it for the first time then I might have if I had seen it as a kid. This isn't to say that it doesn't have some special quality about it, that it's almost like a sprightly live-action cartoon. But there's a generous wink and nod behind most of the good jokes in the film, like how dialog between many of the characters point out some of the loops medieval fantasies take, in small things like climbing up a rocky cliff or in drinking a poisoned drink or going through a nasty swamp or in the convoluted mechanics of a 'Machine', or even how to revive one from the dead with a, uh, whatever it is that's given to Cary Elwes.It's the tale as simple as can be: girl and boy fall in love, girl loses boy, girl gets engaged to bad man, girl gets kidnapped by dastardly (and inept) figures, girl gets re-captured by a man in a mask that turns out to be the boy again, boy loses girl again, boy comes back from dead, boy and girl go back together again. OK, a bit complicated, but the fun in William Goldman's script is seeing how the questioning of the archetypes goes hand-in-hand with telling a conventionally satisfying story. There's not a whole lot of dimension to most of them- certainly not to the bride- but that's part of the excitement is to see how the characters meet their fates (particularly Patikin's character, who will stop at nothing to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, as he says about ten times while in the big climactic sword-fight). And why should there be, as the story itself is being read to a precocious child (Fred Savage) by a mustached Peter Falk.Actually, the script probably isn't even the best part, and neither is Reiner's often wonderful direction (though it helps, minus the score by Knopfler which is way too cheesy even for the material here). What makes this so watchable a comedy are the actors, who are all at the top of their games. Wallace Shawn (inconceivable!), Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal (65? can't do it for that), Patinkin, Christopher Guest in his most deadpan character yet, and Elwes and Robin Wright Penn in such straight roles, are equally enthralling and hilarious in how they dance around such good material, giving it the proper edge when needed and light touches of pure irony as well. Being more aware of what some of these character actors and stars have done now it makes for it to be hilarious, but what makes it work for kids too is that the actors never stray from being true to the goofy levels to their roles. This isn't quite Monty Python being dealt with here, but more family-friendly satire, and it's a success through and through.",8,2,4,1 July 2007
Saving Private Ryan," One of the Best War Films Ever Made!
","Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' is one of Spielberg's greatest masterpieces and I loved it.  It affected me like no other war film since 'Apocalypse Now' which is saying something.  Spielberg always makes great war films, and this is his best yet (he also won his second Oscar for his direction).  With violent (yet necessary) war sequences (photographed by Oscar winner Kaminski) and some better than average acting by Tom Hanks and a great cast, this film will make you think twice about World War 2.  The Best Film of 1998.",10,2,7,25 January 2000
The Pianist," Stoic, haunting tale of survival
","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+",10,132,176,16 January 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," funny and engaging, but it may just need to grow on me over time
","Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, a tale of an old-lady womanizer (Ralph Fiennes, the reason if nothing else to see the film) who is accused of murder and up against an evil son and set in the backdrop of a fake-but-sorta-real European landscape in the mid 1930's, is at its best when it evokes a comparative feeling through its style that may or may not have anything to do with the film itself.This I mean is the passage of time for cinema, as its in three times (30s, late 60s, briefly mid 80s) and had three different aspect ratios, largely shot in 1:33 (the square, not the widescreen rectangle for you laymans) And at this, of course, the film is always a pleasure to look at. That's a given for Anderson. His work here is especially colorful, every hue pops and shines even in that few minutes where it's Black and White on the train, and Fiennes and company are game to play along...Yet, ultimately, I felt maybe a little-sorta let down following the one two punch of Fantastic Mr Fox and Moonrise Kingdom. Though a lot happens in Budapest hotel and its oozing period detail (both real Euro and made up), it's ultimately a bug-eyed cartoon and only two main males, Gustav and his bell-boy-turned-surrogate-son Zero, have two dimensions with everyone else with one. And of course Willem Dafoe looks cool in black leather on a motorcycle (unintentional homage to his debut in the Loveless mayhap crossed with a second tier bond villain ?) and the music is sweet and catchy.I just didn't see the characters having enough depth for me to care that much past the facade Anderson has made up. As with Fox and Life Aquatic to an extent, this is a world where many times you'll see this world created in the hotel and out as a diorama, and all Anderson and his cameraman shoot it impeccably. maybe, this time, TOO impeccably, for me. It gets to the point where even in its controlled pov you''ll know where the cameras going to move, who will be where, even what they'll probably say, filled with witty and sometimes very funny jargony speech.And at the end of it all it's fun to watch, has a look that is unlike anything at the movies right now, and has the sort of bittersweet ending Anderson has made a hallmark of his career. It just doesn't stick with me and prod at me like the director does when he gives characters with firmer consequences at hand. And yes I know this story is in the backdrop of a (pre) war environment and involves falsely accused murder (if one must give the highest comparative praise, think the cultural refinery in Renoirs 30s pics with a Hitchcock yarn also from the 30s). But... too many characters, all drawn with broad strokes, and just when you think you're getting a handle on one like Ronans character shell slip away from the movie so long that the motivations get mixed up.Recommended for being the work of a master stylist (And Jeff Goldblum cause he's who he is) but not recommended if you want a movie with something to say, which after Moonrise and Tenenbams and bottle rocket, I know the man's capable of. 7.5/10",8,6,11,28 April 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," a much needed, outrageously funny and heart-warming look at slasher movies (NOT Scream)
","Sometimes a movie has to be made just to be a proper counter to so much that's come before it. I'm almost surprised this film hasn't existed before (not to say there haven't been critical analyses of horror conventions in horror comedies going back years, Student Bodies and of course the first couple of Scream movies come as good examples). But with this and Cabin in the Woods, it's hard to ever *really* go back to the way slasher movies used to be, the kind like Mother's Day or something where you got a bunch of hicks who go after seemingly helpless teens/twenty-somethings in the woods. Because here, not only are the roles reversed - the couple of hicks who have a cabin (and many sharp objects) who are suddenly the target of paranoid and freaked-out college kids - but it goes through a deconstruction of certain tropes in general.In a way it almost goes into romantic comedy territory in small bursts, as Dale (Tyler Labine, a much needed boost after drek like Good Ol' Fashioned Orgy) saves a young girl named Allison from drowning who was part of the college pack, and, being a genuinely friendly and nice guy (if not the best at approaching them, as we see early on), gets closer to her... well, that is until the other college kids, who think he and Tucker (the always splendid Alan Tudyk) have kidnapped her in their creepy cabin, which in reality is Tucker's summer home he's remodeling. More to the point, the whole film functions in its satire like a big but sincere Looney Tunes cartoon about mis-communication. In fact, I'd love it if this was shown in intro to communications classes in colleges, aside from its entertainment value, since it goes aways to show how we as a people mess up how we relate to one another through ALL pre- conceived notions.This isn't to say all hicks are pleasant and just want a couple of beers in a fishing boat, and not all college kids are arrogant and over-reactive morons. What Eli Craig and Morgan Jurgenson do so well with their script, and the subsequent direction, is keep the comedic pace so strong through so much of the film - at least the first two thirds before some revelations come forth - with a sort of 'checklist' as to the things that could happen. I kept thinking 'where could they go from here?' with how crazy it gets with the kills, which to one side are the maniac murders of Deliverance-folk and to the other side as the psychotic goals of a bunch of kids with a suicide pact(!) And yet with all of the beautiful set- ups and pay-offs of the gags, or the randomness of the VERY bloody violence (I appreciated that, and it really made it gut-bustingly funny, just for how long they would show things), it's still believable core characters that keep it going.I loved seeing Tucker and Dale as an on-screen buddy team, though it's hard to see this going past this one movie (maybe Tucker and Dale's Chainsaw Massacre is up next?) Tudyk and Labine drive their friendship to the audience right from the start, and their humor is much more natural than what one would expect even from a more broad parody. If anything the broadest characters are the dumb sheeple-like college kids following one super-deranged kid in a polo t-shirt with some backwoods- hick murder issues. While this doesn't mean the film wont' sometimes go into some of the territory its making fun of, that is characters doing stupid things when they should know better, in context it still works and is never less than a full blown crowd-pleaser.",9,2,3,29 September 2012
1941," even a Spielberg mess has a lot of excellent bits; it's his craziest effort yet, flawed, BIG, and proud of its longevity
","I'm not sure I'll want to sit too soon again through 1941, directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale and John Milius, but I wouldn't trade the experience. Unlike directors nowadays who go BIG and HUGE with action and cheesy comedy and thrills, and their movies end up possibly leaving a really lousy residue from a kind of soulessness (Michael Bay comes immediately to mind), Spielberg may go way over the top, and in the DVD version I saw it goes on far too long (whether or not the special edition solves the problems left in the original 2 hour cut boggles my mind just to think about it), but it never loses a sense of giddy excitement, like a 12 year old boy given free reign over the controls of a nose-thumbing, immature-yet-intelligent big-budget Hollywood action-war-comedy. For more than a few moments watching it, I thought of what Francis Ford Coppola said regarding the making of Apocalypse Now, when he said 'we had too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.' I wondered how much Spielberg decided to shoot- and shoot and shoot- from the script, though whatever mishaps occur in the picture (and for the most part goes on in the latter half of the film), yet he somehow pulls out a few really extraordinary sequences, and more than few deserved laughs.It's chaos, basically, when less than a week after the bombing of Pearl Harbor the threat of an attack from the Japanese seems imminent. Everybody's up in arms, or at least up in arms with one another (again, the 12 year-old aspect, both with plenty of explosions, weapons firing off, and more than a bit of innuendo), and we're given practically an Altman-esquire view of Los Angeles in this time of wacky despair, even if oddly enough most of what really makes of LA is left away. Then again, any big mash of reality would compact the escapist madhouse Spielberg and his writers intend. Only in a flick like 1941 would you get a bat-s*** pilot (a hilarious John Belushi), a timid but ready average guy with a gigantic machine gun in his backyard (Ned Beatty), a doubting Thomas General who cries when he watches Dumbo (Robert Stack), two army personnel (Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen) who have a deranged courtship involving air travel, and the actual (yet more-so potential) threat to the LA area, a Japanese submarine headed by Colonel Mikamura (Toshrio Mifune, who in a limited role gets to do what he does best- look down-right perturbed). It all leads up to a gigantic- and I do mean gigantic- climax that goes on and on and on with the crazed, war-seeking Americans finally finding their sights at the sub.Perhaps if Spielberg and his editors decided to try and tighten it up (and again I say this after the extended version, perhaps this is maybe a tad different with the shorter theatrical cut), it would be a much greater rush of insanity in wartime comedy. A topic like the delirium of Americans on the cusp of war is good for a variety of broad styles (if that makes sense), and the cast assembled here is more hit than miss (where else will you get Christopher Lee as a Nazi on a sub who can somehow have no problem communicating with the Japanese speaking Japanese!), with the goofy parts still retaining moments of levity. And the madness that usually unfolds on screen, be it small-time or large scale, gets the right treatment at least on the directorial front. There's a dance-hall sequence involving the main romantic love triangle (I forget all the names, though I remember Treat Williams being involved), where the fighting blends with the dancing and completely absurd homaging to a point of delirious genius, and it's one of Spielberg's greatest single sequences from the 70s. I even got a couple of chuckles at his blatant, irrevocable homages to his previous films (the opening with Jaws, certain shots right from Close Encounters, even a few unintentional allusions to future films).But again that frigging script, and the abandonment to pull back from the crazily cartoonish atmosphere, sort of damns it in the last section, where more seems to mean better, even when what might be expected (more explosions) doesn't quite come off. It ended up becoming almost an act of annoying the viewer, where already there's been so many scenes of hundreds of people in single shots, stretched into sequences, and grand-standings (Aykroyd's part) and wild flights of fancy, that even the best parts end up becoming mired in the thick of it all. I guess maybe it's meant to almost feel like a war in and of itself, but unlike the Coppola picture I mentioned previously, there isn't a lot of art to come out of the sensationalism, just some fun times to have with friends and a very good sense of humor (mostly a forgiving one). This all being said, however, I wouldn't tell you not to see it, most likely if you're a fan of Spielberg and Zemeckis, and I end up recommending it against my better judgment, or rather I don't recommend if as much as the MUCH better works of the filmmakers, but for a certain comic sensibility it might be real gold. I will remember the zany brilliance, but I also won't be able to shake off the fact that it is the sort of midway minor blunder of a filmmaker right in an awe-inspiring stretch of films. 6.5/10",7,3,6,1 February 2007
Foxcatcher," an eerie drama about weird obsession and the 'American dream'
","For a lot of people, but especially athletes, we're told that going for a respective native country is a very admirable, noble, Go-For-It aim. And for Americans, it's the ultimate sort of hope, at least in conventional terms - being the 'Best' and representing the country in places like, say, the Olympics. This is what John Du Pont (a mostly unrecognizable Steve Carrell) tells to the young, impressionable Olympic gold medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum, recognizable as can be), that his ambitions should be directed to get the gold - again - for America, as it is. Schultz is impressed by Du Pont, if nothing else by the attention of someone who is, as Mark sees, a super wealthy man (one of the biggest wealth-areas in the country), and wants to join him in his quest for Olympic glory in 1988 along with his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) who is not quite as enthusiastic, mostly due to his family/current work commitments. No matter, Mark will do it for John, this will work... for a little while...Foxcatcher is a helluva piece of work, mostly in how director Bennett Miller stages his scenes and lets them unfold with his cast. This isn't a film with urgent line-a-minute drama. On the contrary this moves more like a slow-burn dramatic film from the 70's (think, I don't know, Fat City or something in terms of tone), and he spends a lot of time just watching his actors move around settings, looking at objects and pictures in the Du Pont home, the horses in the barns and fields, the wrestlers moving their bodies this way and that (like apes at times, even the brothers, which makes Du Pont's comment at one cruel moment - 'You ungrateful ape' - to a character all the more brutal and spot-on). There's a lot of watching and waiting, and all the time, surrounded by stuffed birds, desperate, lonely men, and eerie, weird vibes, it makes for a film that us uncompromising.All three lead actors pull in solid work here. Tatum has been getting amazing notices from critics across the board, and this is his best work as a dramatic actor (personally I still prefer his comedic work or Magic Mike, but that's neither here nor there), in large part because he is there to react and listen. He doesn't have to emote in LOUD ways, if that makes sense. His most intense scene is in a hotel room and is mostly in shadows, so it's really about the internal space this character inhabits. And it's a compelling, interesting one: here is a man who is an Olympic champion, yet without this opportunity from Du Pont he would be still eating Ramen noodles and few prospects. Tatum goes for this uncertainty, then certainty, then going-off-the-rails, and then doom and gloom, with a quiet quality that comes through extremely well.Ruffalo has an easier role to play - the more 'normal' character here, who has his most pressing conflicts when dealing with his younger brother, or having to basically lie to a camera crew doing a propaganda documentary on Du Pont as a wrestling coach - but still is fascinating to watch for how much emotion he puts into a 'straight' man in awkward or tense moments like those wrestling matches or the prep. He may be underrated come awards time when Tatum and Carrell get the bulk of the limelight, but he is no slouch here in the slightest.And Carrell. Jesus. In a way there can be a big criticism of his performance, or maybe it's just down to how the writers present him (one of them from Miller's Capote, the other from Something Wild), that he's one-dimensional, or not that 'deep' exactly in his enclosed, rich weirdo. He really doesn't 'change' so much during the film. Things happen around him and he is not the most predictable Character (with a capital C) as he may be benevolent one moment, and slap your face the next or get mad you didn't put the 50-caliber machine gun on the tank (yep, that happens, that's how wealthy the Du Ponts were), but he is pretty much the same sort of 'off' kind of crazy from start to finish. It's just that by the end, his crazy finally comes un-spooled, whereas before it's more about the package of this man. (What's the line in the movie Speed? 'Poor people are crazy, I'm eccentric.') But all the same, Carrell inhabits this guy, and makes his loneliness and (maybe) latent homosexuality or whatever it is about him that gets him engaged about wrestling to a fullness. I felt repulsed, intrigued, confused, scared by this guy, who lurks around his mansion and comes to these wrestling practices - and at one point wrestles himself, albeit in a fixed match which he may or may not know about - like a vampire. Indeed how Schultz comes to this man's premises, becomes ingratiated, it's only a wonder the man doesn't get more people under his wing. Actually he does, under the guise of still having a lot of wealth and being able to do whatever he wants. If we ask an actor in such a quietly towering role to just be truthful to being a freak, Carrell is Freak of the Year.Foxcatcher at times may be a little long, or a little ambling in its pacing, but it all builds up. By the time it comes to that climax, it's shocking not so much for what it is but how inevitable and, maybe, preventable it could have been. The stakes in this movie are about mental wellness, attraction, and being enveloped in guises and dreams for something 'more'. It's presented like an All-American nightmare; one wonders if this is on a double-bill with the recent Nightcrawler if some would want to just give up on the promises for a better society.",9,6,16,7 December 2014
28 Days Later...," one of the best European horror films this decade
","The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive in the cinemas, as of late, is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime 60s and 70s era of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be on any given list one of the greatest horror directors (I included), it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of 28 Days Later- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work. What does Boyle and his team set out to do to freshen up the zombie string? By making not in precise terms a 'zombie' movie- you never hear 'living-dead' uttered in this film, although you do hear 'infected' and a new word for what these people have, 'rage'. Indeed, this is what the infected have in Britain, when a monkey virus gets let loose on the Island, and from the beginning of the infectious spread the film cuts to a man, Jim, lying in a hospital bed, who wanders abandoned streets and views torn fragments of society in front of him. That Boyle implements atmosphere as heavily as he does with the action/chase scenes gives an indication of his dedication to the detail. Jim soon finds a few other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris) and a father and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns) who hear of salvation on a radio and decide to brave it out to find it. When they do, it's a military outpost that's without any true salvation, outside of the various military typos. Like in Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald's spellbinding (if that's the proper terminology) adaptation of Trainspotting, the craft is on par (or arguably topping) with the story and characters, and thus it has to captivate us all the more so to care about the plight of Jim and his companions. The photography by Anthony Dod Mantle is striking, not the least of which since it was done on digital photography (like in Blair Witch, the use of non-professional camera equipment adds the proper shading when needed), but also many of the shot compositions are different for such a film. The editing by Chris Gill goes quicker than expected in the attack scenes, going so fast between the infected throwing up blood, the screaming on-looker; the new infected transforming within seconds, and then the results that follow. Mark Tildesley's production design, as well as John Murphy's music, evokes haunting, evocative moods even in the more mundane scenes. And the acting, considering not many of the actors are well-known, is more than believable for such a script. I'm not sure if 28 Days Later will be everyone's cup of tea. Some of the horror and science fiction fans out there will immediately hear of this film, see a preview or a TV ad, or even see it, and dismiss it as phooey rubble borrowed from the video-store. I can see their points of view, since I saw many similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of Day of the Dead, though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in Dawn of the Dead). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, 28 Days Later is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen, and like not many other sci-fi horror films you've ever seen combined, in a sense, for a modern audience: fascinating throughout.",10,236,315,16 August 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," '...Nothing is written'
","What a gigantic cinematic boom Lawrence of Arabia makes. It's an epic that's controlled by one of the most assured and basically visionary directors that the material could have asked for. And it leaves its final thirty minutes not with a totally triumphant hero, but one with more conflicts and despair than one might expect. Not that I would really expect a lot of Lawrence of Arabia on total fact, even as it is based on T.E. Lawrence's writings. Like with any other given number of biopics, we're given the 'character' of Lawrence, not the full-on man himself. And in Lean's ultra-masculine, heroic take on the man, it's got enough great scenes to knock others in other films out of the park.Why then did I feel as if I hadn't seen one of the very greatest films ever made? It's definitely not that i can't understand why some would say it so, as it contains that great need to tell a story that's worth telling (in the context it's presented), and with a cast of characters acted with the most finite of professionalism and passion. It's also the sort of picture, rarely made today it seems, that without a doubt is one of those meant to be seen on the big screen- practically all of the images captured by Lean and his crew out in that desert make a very convincing kind of metaphor for the picture, as man, no matter how much he ambitions or seeks out this or that or might think he is invincible for a little while, is quite small when seen in the 'grander scheme of things.' But like some other epic works I can think of, like Alexander Nevsky (albeit its short length I think of it in epic terms), or even more contemporary the Lord of the Rings, amid such a brave and undaunted work of superior craftsmanship there are some things that, subjectively, aren't totally in synch for me. One of those, chiefly, is Peter O'Toole's performance. It was his first big starring performance, and it's sort of mixed for me how I view him in this character. He ends up, by virtue of his own talents, being terrific in many scenes, like when he has to come to a fate with the same man he previously had saved en-route to Ackaba, or when he returns back to Cairo to tell of his 'impossible' victory. Even the last half hour or so that I mentioned before is better than expected, as we see more of an opening up of the sort of mythical representation of the character of Lawrence. But for a lot of it I just didn't really see him as much as a conflicted and ambiguous legend as I did as a, well, light-voiced British guy. In some scenes I almost felt as if it was someone still coming to terms with playing such a larger-than-life guy, and with the same attitude and mannerisms of someone doing (not to put him down too much but) lesser-ring theater. He's actually kind of 'neat' for the role, and unfortunately in comparison with his counterparts he's not one of the most notable parts even as Lawrence himself is the main juice of the picture.Meanwhile, other actors get their time on screen wonderfully, with Shariff probably never (or rarely) better as Sheriff Ali, as he and Lawrence have the most fascinating connection of all. Quinn is quite good, if a little hammy (as to be expected) as the Tayi, the rival warrior who first wants gold and then goes along with what Lawrence might have in mind. It's always great to see Guiness with such control and nuance with a character who gets such limited time when compared with the other supporting players. They're all pit in a story that has a great energy in the first half, as Lawrence goes from shuttered in soldier to a near prophet for a whole mass of Arabs by crossing a desert deemed uncrossable, and storming a city thought to have been impossible to take. Then, as he continues military campaigning in part two however, things start to change, if maybe a little too fast one might think following his tense scene with Jose Ferrer's character.And all the while this is put to Lean, with his DP Freddie Young, in creating a larger-than-life atmosphere for a man who has highs and lows of how his perception goes, including to himself. A lot of times as Lawrence and/or his men went across the desert, or a character looked into the near abyss of sands, it was nearing being too picturesque, as if the style vied to overtake the substance. But Lean is always in service of the story, and the deliberate but wise screenplay. Not matter how grandiose Lean can get, he shoots with a sense of some conviction. One more note that makes Lawrence of Arabia quite worthwhile is the musical score, the kind that you rarely hear in big studio pictures with the exceptions of maybe John Williams or Howard Shore. Of all the Oscars given out to this film, the only one probably more deserved after Lean was for Jarre's compositions, which compliment the images and add just the right touches of emphasis.It's not un-probable that I could come back to Lawrence of Arabia some years from now and maybe even find it greater, even more towering an achievement of using insane lots of money to add flesh and bones to adapting history onto celluloid. For sure, if it ever does get re-released again, I probably would even check it out. That I might not put it so high in my favorite films though is also hard to deny: it is, like Lawrence, 'not perfect'. But it is still quite a ride getting through it all.",10,3,8,5 December 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Contrived but sometimes fun
","To say this film is almost the clone of Jurassic Park (no pun intended) is to give Spielberg credit.  This film is a large drop off from the original and while sequels don't get up to the original, this one does try, but flails.  Story has ex mathematician/celebrity Ian Malcolm (played with some clueless finesse by Jeff Goldblum) going to another island by Attenborough with dinosaurs running loose with chaos and other plot things ensuing. Sometimes entertaining compared some other c**p, but to view along side the original is a no-brainer.  One other thing, why put the first smashing scene from the first book into the second movie?  Best scene for me though isn't T-Rex in San Diego (despite that being fun), but rather Vince Vaughn being chased by little reptile dinosaur things.  B-",6,1,4,13 November 2000
It Follows," tight, ambiguous, expertly directed horror
","It Follows doesn't use crap jump scares, nor the sort of Stupid Horror Movie Characters (to take a page from Ebert's Movie Glossary) and work to annoy the viewer or just be there for a certain 'demographic'. The film doesn't even feel like it takes place in this decade, though it very well may; the cars, the settings the styles, even the music, and the latter sounds like riffs from some obscure-but-magical genre treat from the 1980's. In the way it presents its characters and situations, it has a (modern) timeless quality of young people trying to figure out who they are, their loves and friends, who other people are, and... all it takes is the screws on the wheels of trust.It Follows is about Jay (Maiyka Moore, an actress I hope to see more of very soon), who has been dating a guy named 'Hugh' (Jake Weary) for a while. They finally do 'it' on a date, and Hugh-Cum-Jeff reveals that he has passed on 'It' to her. He didn't really mean any hatred or ill-will by it - if it wasn't her, really, it would've just been someone else - and now 'It' will follow her unless she passes it on to someone else via sex, otherwise 'It' will kill her, then kill him, and go on down the line. Where did 'It' come from? Is it some sort of supernatural-alien-otherworldly entity? Who knows. All that is of concern to Jay is that a) 'It' cannot be easily killed or out-run, and it certainly isn't the Stephen King 'It' (though parallels about the fear of the unknown can certainly be drawn), and b) it's real, and it's if she and her friends don't destroy it (two of who may or may not sleep with her, out of chivalry more-so possibly than romance), it'll ruin them all.It Follows is the first great film, horror or otherwise, of this year. The newcomer writer/director David Robert Mitchell delivers paranoia drenched from every scene of this work, and his camera, editing, music, pacing, and his choice of actors (the minor roles as much as the major ones) give this pure tension and horror. It's a horror-show that occasionally does throw on some gore, but only when it really counts and matters, like if a supporting character gets offed (I won't say who, don't worry), but it's purely about creating mood and unease. It's rare to get a film where you don't know what can come next, and it being exciting and terrifying without irony.Going in I was also worried that the movie might be some kind of rabid anti-sex statement due to how 'It' is passed, but it's not that at all. The filmmakers are just concerned with making things as intense as possible with, mostly, by letting things play out in real time, relatively few cuts, and naturalistic acting and writing (but in good, relatable, un-cliché ways). In filmic language, It Follows is a precise, foreboding study of the power of foreground and background: who will be IT next? Every person walking could be 'it', or nothing at all.The lack of any full on explanation of the origins of this entity or presence or undead killer makes things all the more horrifying; and even after its not shown to be in-the-head of the main character, it turns still into a tale of a walking, living-breathing nightmare, again punctuated by that sinister synth score creeping up on the viewer like the 'It'. Comparing this to early Carpenter and Polanski is not without hyperbole - in boilerplate log-line-language it's Halloween and Repulsion, but it's still more unusual in presentation, effective, and expertly, shockingly astute in its direction, especially with the dollop of ambiguity. If anything, this is the antidote to dumb slashers where characters are killed off due to 'Sex is Bad'. It turns that convention on its head by having something that can't be easily explained away with a bad childhood or tragic drowning or other. If anything, this 'thing' is closer to a shark.Go see this movie, preferably on as big a screen as possible, and with a significant other to snag on to your arm tight.",10,10,60,21 March 2015
City of God," a powerhouse crime saga, with a fierce, daunting fusion of style
","City of God played for months on end at an the Angelika theater in New York City back in 2003, and I was hesitant whether or not I should go there to spend ten dollars and to sit in a little theater with a packed audience, or to wait in video. I gave in to my temptations to see the film, from what I heard from various reviewers, and by the end, I knew it was truly worth the admission, and then some. Director Fernando Meirelles, along with co-director Katia Lund, crafts a film that steams so much with a passion to tell this story, to reveal all these characters (most of which who wear their flaws right on their sleeves like badges of honor), and to be honest with how their tales unfold, that even the most die-hard of action film or gangster connoisseur will feel the visceral, hardcore nature of the City of God long after the lights come up, subtitles and all.This true story (from a novel by Paulo Lins, former resident in the slums) is told, much like Scorsese's master-work Goodfellas, in a kind of flashback format where the narrator takes us back to the City of God when the lower class were shuffled into the slums of Rio De Janeiro without much hope. Our narrator, who only calls himself Rocket until the end, lives amongst the Tender Trio, friends of his whom start out robbing oil trucks and whatever they can get their hands on to stay alive. An impromptu heist at a motel gets the cops swarming, and the trio becomes scattered, though not dissolved. As it proceeds into the seventies, we find out that some members of the group died, a few went to jail, and Rocket stays on the sidelines, hoping to become a professional photographer with little or no assets to become one in and outside of the City of God.Then there's Li'l Dice (played through most of the film by the equally terrifying and gleeful Firmino Da Hora), who in the first act of the film is a kid who's the smallest among the bunch of older teens who make more or less successful robberies, though as Rocket says 'You need more than guts to be a good gangster, you need ideas.' In flashback (not to spoil) we discover what went down at the motel that night, and from there in a brilliant stroke of editing we see how Li'l Dice became Li'l Ze, who rises up little by little in the drug dealing schematics of the slum and soon takes over a supplier to sell cocaine. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) may be the protagonist viewers can identify with, but Li'l Ze is as fascinating an antagonist as any I have seen in a long time, who masks his insecurities with boyish joy in all of the mayhem he creates. Otherwise without hope, Li'l Ze becomes the dominant supplier in the slums, something of a tyrannical businessman, and as his story unfolds as does Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who becomes Ze's rival in the eighties.The only way a movie like this could work is if we feel for the characters plights and heights and such, even if they're evil in nature like Li'l Ze, Carrot, and Knockout Ned. That's why the filmmakers plunge us right into the City of God, and the nature of the city, and while the narrator may pass judgment on people he's known his whole life, he like us know why they're up to no good. The thieves and dealers and killers became such by looking up to their role models, the older hoods of the region, and with each younger group of kids who want to smoke dope and vandalize is another and another. As long as you don't get caught with your pants down by the cops, or get raided by chance, the odds for anarchy are in your favor in such a place. We understand equally why Rocket wants to get out of the city his own way as much as we understand the wars between the gangs, and this crucial facet makes the film work extraordinarily well to its advantage. Indeed, we understand the tragedies of such minor roles as the Runts- the orphans of the streets- much as we would understand the importance of such roles as in a Dickens novel.Along with this technique of storytelling, is the way it's filmed that's eye grabbing. The first scene shows in fast action a chicken chase, and then our hero between the gang and the cops viewed in a tailspin fashion as we are sent back to the beginning. Then, we get all the energy of even the simplest of scenes, and the hidden passion (Rocket on the beach with Angelica, for example) all by the mostly hand-held photography by Cesar Charlone, and the break-neck editing (i.e. the montage of how Li'l Ze makes a name for himself, or the disco dance sequence) by Daniel Rezende.",10,3,7,8 August 2003
Cars," Pixar knows how to do formula just right- a lot of fun in an 'old-fashioned' story
","Cars is the kind of animated film that, considering how computer dominated the realm is now and might be for a while, knows what it is and is successful almost in spite of what it could've been. It could've been, for example, a clunker of a formulaic animated movie where not only do you know what will happen every step of the way after a while the imbalance of comedy and the rest of the more grounded parts of the story detract from any pleasure from seeing the movie work on its own. Pixar, and particularly its co-founder John Lasseter, are particularly based on the importance of the story- however much it might lend itself to others- and having the best cast to go alongside the most believable visual schemes. Cars worked for me as being something that is akin to those 'old-fashioned' picture of its kind (which I mean here as a compliment and not as some kind of put-down like others might), where after a little bit in the story you'll know what will happen, but it's fun seeing what's done within the scenes and how unexpected bits of delight come from the characters.Cast-wise, it's actually rather remarkable; this might be the only time, for example, I won't mind a Larry the Cable Guy performance in a film (playing a dim-witted towing truck). Practically every part, in this case, gets the right choices *along-with* having the star power. Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen, who has a big ego as an up-and-coming race car driver. He gets sidetracked, however, when getting into a big accident ruining a road of a small, near-deserted town full of quirky oakies and long-forgotten types. The amount of supporting talent is commendable- Bonnie Hunt, Cheeck Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin (was happily surprised at that one), and Paul Newman delivering a good show as a car with a shattered past. Through the story then comes the usual thing- Will Lightnign McQueen suddenly break past his young self-contriteness and find who his friends really are? The answer shouldn't have to be too mysterious to find, but that's not the point that Lasseter and co-director (late) Joe Ranft are getting at.If the film does have a couple of liabilities- most of the songs are my least favorite of any of the Pixar films with the end-credits one the exception; a couple of scenes don't work as well even within the conventions- it's got plenty to admire. As usual the animation team at Pixar gives the audience what they pay to see with this kind of picture- plenty of fantastic sights, with impeccable details with little things like the road itself and the cars and buildings as well as the vast, cool vistas delivered. Thers's also a sturdy, good-natured message behind the story and scenes, with the nostalgia of a period evoked alongside that of the usual 'don't forget what's important' ideal for kids. And as someone who doesn't really watch Nascar or much of that at all (even for the crashes that remind painfully why less than 1% of the country does this), the racing sequences are tremendously well done, especially when sitting close to the screen. At the end of it, I knew I had seen a very good movie, even if in some little ways it doesn't completely POP like the best of Pixar's work. It's also the first really good take-the-entire-family movie of the summer, at least on a level of spectacle and all-around entertainment.",7,1,2,10 June 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Excellent Martial Art Sequences have true power
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does have a good story (though I feel that over time this film has begun to be over-rated), the fight sequences are extraordinary.  And besides the fact that seeing people fly in a film that should be semi-real (and almost implying that if you're Peter Pan and get taught by Bruce Lee your the ultimate fighting man), the fights between the guys, the girls, the guys between the girls with swords and other medieval things make this film highly reccomended, whether you are a average movie-goer, fans of the Matrix or of just plain old Kung fu action and stories.  It is a lot of fun packed in one movie, even if it isn't completely perfect.  Directed (surprisingly) by Ang Lee of the Joy Luck Club.  A",7,0,0,23 December 2000
JFK," Back, and to the left....Stone's second best picture behind Born on the Fourth
","JFK (the director's cut version) is like a history lesson taught by an unconventional, usually thought provoking, and ultimately inspiring professor, transferred brilliantly onto celluloid.  In fact this film, which has been put down by various critics (not film critics mind you) for it's lack of truth and tendency to go off on conspiracy theories.  These critics, and there are plenty of them, entirely miss the point of the picture.  This is the ONLY kind of film that a film maker like Stone could make, one that is a challenge to the system, one that questions, and with questions that, after such a hefty lesson, makes a whole lot of sense. JFK is in reality a film ABOUT America, about the feelings that go with a national tragedy, the assumptions, the cover-ups, the fears, control, and head question- why?Stone makes Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner in one of his few superb performances, as a man who starts off believing the Warren Commission following the assassination on the day 11/22/63.  Years later, he begins to get gradually drawn into the idea that a conspiracy could be, and after various interviews and queries, he finds that there may be more, his mind opened to the possibility of truth.  He takes Clayton Laverne Shaw, alias Clay Bertrand (played to a deserved Oscar nominated stance by Tommy Lee Jones), to court, that he was in cahoots with not only Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), but much, much more.  Personally, amongst other small items, I agreed with two main points on JFK - 1) there had to have been more than one shooter for the notion of the magic bullet theory, which states that a bullet went back and to the left, not to mention that the footage that shows this, within the film by Abraham Zabruder, is kept out of public view to this day.  2) in the exceptional cameo by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, when he refers to the military industrial complex, and to the fact that in other parts of the world people already were hearing the entire history of Oswald was the killer before people in the United States even knew about the man, also to the black operations, which I definitely don't doubt exist.However, by the end of the 205 minute investigative epic into the 'coup de-ta' of our 35th president, even those who may question Garrison's (as well as Stone's) views can still see the film as a masterwork of feelings, an atmosphere of a specific time and mood of a country.  The photography and editing, both Oscar winning, make the film all the more compelling, spell-binding, and very much unforgettable.  Along with Sutherland's near show-stopping bit, other actors make very noteworthy appearances- Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Walter Matthau (in the plot thickening moment), Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, and especially Joe Pesci, who's eyebrows steal his scenes. Based on books by Garrison and Jim Morrs.  A++",10,5,19,7 May 2003
Behind The Candelabra," imperfect, but for what it achieves it's absorbing
","Michael Douglas gets into this character - whether he IS Liberace, well, he is still a character in a movie ultimately, however true he may be to real life - is remarkable. Douglas has been playing characters for decades that have been like the 'Lover Man' types, the leading man with swagger and presence who you believe would have women flocking to him (Glenn Close, Sharon Stone in his prime, I'm sure there's more). Now he's in his 60's, but he's playing Liberace without missing a beat or stopping to go for broke, which is what Steven Soderbergh as director and Richard LaGravanese as writer goes for. This is a dark, flamboyant character with more layers and depth than it would appear on the surface. You might just look at Liberace and see a control freak (or just a freak in general), a megalomaniac, and an egotist, and that's in the first half. But it's his relationship with this guy Scott, played by Matt Damon, that makes it a full-blown character study and, in fact, a failed tale of romance and fame.Soderbergh captures the glitz and glamour, and the horror of this world too. Scott, as played by Matt Damon in a, frankly, slightly miscast role. Maybe ten years ago, when this film was planned, it would have worked, but Damon is now in his 40's, and he doesn't look or act quite young enough, much as he might try and it's sad to say as it's the only time he hasn't fully worked with this filmmaker. And yet, the writing and storytelling helps a bit, and when it comes time for Scott, who becomes Liberace's intense lover and confidant (for the most part) and almost his second in command at times, there's one last thing: he has to look... better for his old musical genius of a lover. So, plastic surgery.This was one of the things that stuck with me the most, how a person can change so drastically in such a landscape as in show-business - especially that around Las Vegas in the 70's and Liberace and that whole ball of wax - and change their look like THAT. Oh, and lest not forget Rob Lowe, who is so incredibly funny and horrifying at the same time to LOOK at. There's more cringe-comedy following the surgery, and the peaks and valleys of this relationship of this May/December romance. Soderbergh seems to be not shying away from the gaudy spectacle that was this world that Liberace had set up - and, ultimately, ended in tragedy for him, not altogether one he didn't bring on himself - but he shoots it with a level of class and sophistication; it's not too gaudy (though the color orange and red and yellow fix their way into the palette of the director's cinematography).In other words, the movie looks really good, the finale, especially if this had been Soderbergh's 'final' movie, is quite a way to go out, and the acting delivers on the sordid details making them feel palpable and, for as much as this kind of lurid and tempestuous narrative goes, real and full of hurt. Even as Damon, as I mentioned, doesn't totally work, he still tries to give it his all and it matters still. Douglas, after all, can't be as good as he is without some support, and at the least he's bringing his A game here. I don't know where it rests in this director's filmography, but it's up there as one of his toughest dramas and darkest comedies in one package. Oh, and get ready to SING! No, not really, but there's music a plenty here, and some of it, as kitschy as it is... it kind of works for how Soderbergh shoots it.Or, to put it another way - if a character from an 'Ocean's' movie took a left turn in the 70s, they could wind up in the dark corridor of... a Las Vegas concert room. So it goes.",8,1,4,7 November 2014
Gone Girl," A story about one thing, but also (or really) about something else
","Gone Girl would appear to be, from the book by Gillian Flynn (also the writer), about marriage, and love and trust, and what happens in a marriage after that trust is broken and people can't be together the same way again. One has seen this before - one of Fincher's influences, Kubrick, certainly had that with Eyes Wide Shut in a way - and will again in movies and fiction. But what's startling and makes Gone Girl much more impactive is that Flynn and David Fincher are out to look at something else (and something Fincher has in small part before): the media and perception. But both sides are compelling, and the merging of the two topics on display in the film, of the twisting of relationships and twists of the media screws, make for a helluva movie experience The film is split in two parts really, and the divider has to do with what happens when (SPOILER) Amy Dunn explains what her whole plan is to the audience. Before this, we only hear her thoughts from her diary. This is chronicling her relationship with Nick (Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck respectively), who first meet in one of those clever meet-cutes that isn't super cute and shows how each is quick-witted and good at talk, almost like Fincher doing a bit of 30's screwball (which he's done, in his cool-quirky manner in Fight Club). And they do love each other, and each other's bodies, as Amy even says 'We are so cute together', and then... things happen, jobs are lost, money goes, they have to move back to Nick's hometown in Missouri, and little by little, what's the line: love fades.Or does it? Amy basically decides to take revenge against Nick, who in her diary she claims abused her (if only briefly) and neglected her. Clearly, neither side is all peaches and cream in the marriage - by plotting an entire narrative, which we see unfold via traps set and stages set in the first act, for Nick to be framed for murder. It's one of those turns of the plot that had me lean forward and get far more engaged than I even was before, and the first act is entertaining and dramatic and well-acted and all-that-and-a-bag-of-Fincher-Chips enough. In a way it turns into a 'movie' arguably, along the lines of a trashy De Palma thriller where the woman is an iceberg-cold femme fatale who will get her 'Average Joe' any way she can.... only here's the catch: she is plotting everything for the cops, but it's the media that she never really thinks of, at least in much depth.Really, it's in the TV shows, especially the likes that we see with the Nancy Grace clone who plots every step of the Nick/Amy marriage and all of the little beats - i.e. the 'best friend' Amy makes so cheekily (and hilariously in a dark way) because she's 'dumb' and doesn't know any better - and can speculate up the ass and... create perception. Gone Girl explores what happens in rather chilling, pitch-black comic detail what happens when people have to bend to what all those cameras, all those vans and reporters and interviews and the 'public' face do to people. And, most interesting of all, how it even twists the one pulling the 'strings' as it were. It's interesting to note that Amy's previous messed-up relationships - one involving a simple heartbreak (but not quite so as we find out, Neil Patrick Harris!) and another with a testing-ground for what happened with Nick - don't get interviewed by the press. Why not? Story hole? Perhaps more was in the book and left out the film. Or, you know, it doesn't work for this story.This all may not be quite as deep or meaningful as some of Fincher's other great films, Fight Club and Zodiac especially and maybe Social Network to an extent, but there is still a lot to chew on just by what characters do, how they react, how they're trying to think and move steps ahead, or back, or forward. It's a devilish chess-game of a story, and the actors are completely game - even Tyler Perry, who for me was a super wild card given his past films - with Ben Affleck totally convincing as a man who we aren't totally sure about (is he true to himself, or us, or to anyone, or is he just totally exasperated like any number of husbands out there), and Pike just about perfect as this calculating woman who changes before our eyes.And this all may be totally manipulative for us too, not simply how the characters become manipulated and twisted by the narratives spun and perceptions made. But for me, I couldn't tell where this story would go from scene to scene, and the mistakes the characters make are very human, stupid errors that make them more... is endearing the word? Just entertaining I guess. Fincher's made a long, occasionally VERY violent and sexy, and maybe dangerous movie. And it does what a lot of movies that last can do: be about more than one thing, and keep the quality to a top level.",10,1,12,11 November 2014
Get Out," watch it twice
","It's a good idea to see Get Out twice. The first time you experience the film much the same way the main character does, as in any thriller where we are looking at things through the protagonists eyes - the best comparison I can make is to how Roman Polanski does this in his films, not just Rosemary's Baby (though this is what is closest to in horror movie spirit) but also Chinatown and The Ghost Writer, with the sense of oddness and outsider-ness becoming clearer with each encounter - and while there are some surprising revelations there's a greater sense of 'Oh, I hope what I actually suspect about this supporting character isn't true... oh, but it is, so why is he/she acting this way'. The last act is the most conventional as far as where it needs to go as a horror film, but the intensity comes more from character revelations and interactions, the meat of the drama in the suspense of who the 'other' is and what information is being withheld from us (also Hitchcock comes to mind as the typical but surefire comparison). Also, it's entertaining as all hell.The second time, you get to experience things in a different way and can try to spot subtler things, or moments that reveal things that are curious. For example, after the main couple Chris and Rose hit the deer, two things: 1) does Peele mean for the deer to be analogous to our protagonist, the old 'deer in the headlights' bit? Or is it something to do with the roadkill aspect, or how a deer is used as a prop (we see this later in the basement level of the house). 2) that scene with the cop, where he asks Chris for his ID. What I wondered this time was not if Chris ever experienced this before, which he clearly has (it's a given for practically every black man or woman in this country when it comes to dealing with the police *at their best*), but if Rose has. Is she doing what she does in front of this cop, acting in the credulous 'WTF Cop?!' manner to get on Chris's good side, or is she genuinely posing the white, ignorant-innocent side of it where, hey, you shouldn't have to do something that's unfair, like, c'mon, you know? Although Rose ends up (spoiler) being an extremely deceitful character - she's a pro at what she does, we later learn, which is both expected but kind of a bummer - this interaction with the cop feels genuine... or is it? There's a surface level part of it and a lower level that could be dissected further, but I'll leave others to speculate.Another thing along these lines is the brother character Jeremy, played with a special level of sleaze (like out of an exploitation film, or even blaxploitation like one of those white villains in the 70's movies) by Caleb Landry Jones. He's the only white person who doesn't put on an air of sophistication - even Stephen Root, who may be the one who can try to talk without some level of condescension, is still part of the 'system' that is controlling and enslaving blacks - but while Jeremy doesn't come out and just say it (he can't because, you know, story reasons) - and it makes for an interesting dynamic. He doesn't have many scenes, but those few he has stands out; among the whole white cast he's the one who isn't a phony, or at least he's not exactly putting on an 'act' like those at the white auction party midway through the film. You (or at least I) can feel the contempt he has for Chris right away. It may arguably be too much, like it's giving too much away how there's something not right with him, and it's different than with the Walter and Georgina characters. The second time around too the best friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery, who is mostly a stand up comic, and it kind of feels it) worked better for me. He was funny and a good presence the first time, but I also wondered if it felt not tonally consistent with the rest of the film (not that it's jarring in the sense of completely taking me out of it, clearly in the quasi-conventional sense as a script, Chris needs a best friend character), but that his humor was a different tone than that of the rest of the movie. However he is integral to the plot, at least to an extent (Chris may be one segment of the audience, but Rod are the ones who will talk at the screen - and at times in this movie it's not completely wrong to do so, depending on the crowd one's with), and I found him funnier the second time too; he is a capable person and is not dumb, which is refreshing in any thriller/horror movie. There are no dumb characters here, only characters who know more than what's going on at times than others, and that can make for a compelling film when done right.Get Out is a movie that is familiar in its construction in some ways, but is completely fresh in execution, with its sense of surrealism - the 'Sunken Place' feels like it could've been an element out of Under the Skin's 'Other' place - its befuddlement as much as rage at such a system that in many ways is analogous to how whites have treated blacks over the past centuries (whether as actual slaves or as the servants that are seen here), and that it is as sharp and vicious a social satire as George Romero at his best, not to mention every performance firing on all cylinders (Williams and Keener by the way have a lot of subtlety to explore on a second go around).",10,11,28,17 March 2017
2012," If you need explosions and disaster that is downright silly, you get Emmerich, as for story...
","2012 is 158 minutes long. This is longer than other movies by Roland Emmerich that include massive destruction and big explosions and people running from that destruction implausibly without getting killed or destroyed or even really hurt that much, like ID4 and Godzilla. He makes movies so preposterously that they either work tremendously (aforementioned) or they don't (10,000 BC). With 2012 he takes the overrated (yes, overrated) myth of the world ending on 12-21-12, the day the Mayan calendar ends, by creating an immense spectacle of the world ending and humanity starting anew with arks. Yeah. That's really how the story boils down to, or how I would like to boil it down to.There is more story, LOTS more story, so much so that plots go from one to the other, characters are given, um, names and things to say and sometimes do, but by the technique Emmerich sets up we, like the director himself, want to just get to the next big explosion. Especially because about fifteen to twenty minutes of the entire film (primarily in that destruction of California set-piece as the limo goes through the streets and then the plane flies through everything as it's crumbling and tumbling very precisely sideways (no implosions of course)) is actually quite brilliant. This is not being facetious: for at least a small sliver of the runtime, when Emmerich and his crew go for broke, the film is so immensely entertaining precisely because it doesn't give a damn what you think. He'll take down entire blocks, houses, buildings, towers, you name it, he'll kill it and blow it up... just as long as our protogonist and his group make it out all in one piece.But, again, the runtime is 158 minutes. So a lot of the film is characters, like ones played by really good actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt, standing around arguing the same points over and over again (and, in a pragmatic standpoint, the guy we're supposed to hate, the politician played by Platt, makes more sense usually), and the main family of characters- Cusack, Peet, so on- are so one dimensional as to barely have personalities. Even when the Russian actors are brought on to bring some hammy action there's only so much that can be done with wooden dialog, some of it unintentionally funny if one cares to listen to it fully. And when we're mean to take actions the characters take seriously and deeply, like with Danny Glover's President, it's just even more infuriating. Really, stay with the sinking White House (so to speak)? More like unnecessary drama. Only Woody Harrelson, as a complete whacko conspiracy nut with a radio show and a wish to see Yellowstone erupt as a volcano, lights up the screen to 11 with his energy and bravado.What we want to see in the case of 2012 isn't some polemic, and certainly not preachiness. At the least Emmerich sidesteps a lot of religious crap and gives us more-so hokey Scientific stuff. Some of the technical jargon, involving super-neutrinos and tectonic plates and the globe shifting around, will be at best silly and at worst insulting to most scientists, but then again why go to 2012 for science anyway? It's all about watching characters we're meant to care about (and if I did, it was only in the most basic turn-off-your-brain way possible, which means not much actually, albeit Cusack is always likable as an actor), going from one big action set piece to another, all leading up to that 'ark' made up by the government to ship those people that can get on out of the area before the typhoon hits. A lot of this climax, lasting as long as anything else in the film (which is long), is entertaining, but, again, if you turn off your brain and soak up the consistent, repetitive action scenes (i.e. he'll hold his breath long as he has to... which is a while).So, go ahead, watch 2012, it's certainly nowhere near the worst blockbuster of 2009 (Emmerich can actually direct big explosion-action-disaster-mayhem-murder sequences in a way that is entertaining in a stupid way, unlike Michael Bay's headache inducing versions). Just don't for a second take it seriously, not even when it puts on airs with its good actors and believable sets.",5,1,4,4 April 2010
The Number 23," this maybe could be a little more tolerable as a half hour Twilight Zone episode...wait, without commercials, 23 minutes!
","That is one of the goofy comparisons you might make, as I did, when this goofy psychological thriller ended. Because despite what might have been director Joel Schumacher and DP Matthew Libatique's loftier intentions with the grit and 'mainstream-noir', the writing ends up cramping up everything that might have been worthwhile. There is a premise here, just not one that goes down very fast in anything that seems sharp or with a real edginess that I could have latched onto. Fernelly Phillips, on his first feature as a screenwriter, comes out with many ideas and gimmicks and, to be sure, contrivances that reminded me of the gimmicks I saw from the lesser screenwriters at my film school- it's almost like pulling together some kind of general theme and extending it to see if something really sticks about obsession and the symbolism of numbers, or *a* number in this case as the be-all-end-all of meaningful numbers. Maybe if he had focused his energies on more of the noirish aspects of the characters, as opposed to flaunting the number 23, I wouldn't still be making jokes about numbers adding or equally somehow to 23, and almost hating myself for making those jokes at the movie's expense.Maybe it was to be expected that Schumacher, who hasn't really made a very satisfying film since the mid 90s, would gravitate to material like this that would at least allow him some time to exercise his 'weird' directorial chops. And really, there is some potential in this as well; Carrey's dog-catcher protagonist is given a book on his birthday (which is on 2/3, ho-ho) called the Number 23, which deals with a sax-playing detective with a dark past who gets involved with an even darker, more sadistic woman (Virginia Madsen, who also plays the 'real-world' wife of Carrey's character, as he envisions it as he reads it anyway), and the sadism and murder and madness that ensues. If there was just a straight adaptation of the book AS the movie, or if the archetypal figures that lay in this pulpy world inspired in part by serial novels were just put forward simply without the number symbolism, it would be a much more intriguing movie. Especially because said 'imagined' scenes showing what happens in the book are shot in a perfectly abstract style, where even in the choppy edit parts there's still a vicious vision going on. These sparks indicate that there COULD be some talent in writer and filmmaker.As for Carrey, he seems to be just going through his motions for what he can do as an actor (as with Madsen, up to a point), but it's not enough to stop what happens with the script, which at times seems to be going at lengths to continue that montage in Pee Wee's Big Adventure when Pee-Wee sees all the bikes going by when his is gone. Soon Carrey's 'every-man' sees it everywhere, with numbers adding up, the combinations endless, and it all leading to what ends up being so predictable I wouldn't dare spoil it not because it's very important but just to not insult your intelligence reading this. Just let it be known that Phillips decides to take that easy-route of the main character really having to face head-on everything that he's encountered so far and then re-contemplate everything in his entire life. This, which makes up the last fifteen minutes, is excruciating in the length of the exposition, with all the answers spoon-fed to the audience so that nothing is left questioned about who this man really is or what he's done. It compounds what has already gone on with the pretentious obsessive qualities, of it being about the 'trick' instead of it being more interesting about characters (the very last scene also made me shake my head and do all but throw popcorn at the screen).Bottom line, it's a pretty stupid entry in the careers of both actor and director, which also happens to include a supporting character of a dog named Ned (who provides a very unintentionally funny scene with the dog on one end of the road and Carrey in his car at the other), Bud Cort in the thankless role, and lots of big-budget attention paid to the grungy details of what is under a happy existence to reveal the wretched skeletons in the closet (or rather under a stone in a park). It's too conventional, in all actuality, to follow up on the daring it portends in the already pushy trailer and ads.",4,2,6,6 March 2007
Ghost Rider," a possibility for the perennial MST3K movie of the year; it's bad, but it's consistently funny
","Did Mark Steven Johnson know what he was doing with Ghost Rider? More than anyone else, I'd figure. Yet it would be probably just as funny as the movie itself to see him try and work legitimate claims to big-action movie clout with this one. It makes Daredevil look classy in comparison, but in a way it's actually better than Daredevil in the point that matters- where Daredevil was just run of the mill, Ghost Rider is a horrendous exercise in the ludicrous in special effects, stunts, cheesy-bread dialog (look how far it stretches!), and Nicholas Cage's ultimate decline as an actor. By this account I shouldn't recommend, but...damn it all if it isn't worth seeing once; it's like a disposable item bought from a mall that works great once in the worst possible ways, and then probably never will again. Unlike some of the bad movies from last year (i.e. Apocalypto, Lady in the Water), it doesn't totally offend the sensibilities even through its numerous faults. Actually, a part of me WAS offended, as I thought seeing it 'this is what action movies based on comic books have come to, good Lord', but the other part of me, that was expecting it to be bad, had a lot of fun in savoring every trashy, campy, whatever-the-f*** moment.And how about Nicolas Cage, huh? Summoned from the spotty parts he's gone to in the dozen years since he nabbed an Oscar, he plays Johnny Blaze, a character who might be one of the dumbest characters in modern movies, and who's motivations amount to 'I love to ride, I love my girl from my teenage years, and I hate the son of Satan (played by Wes Bentley, who's another sign of the decline of the American Beauty kids), and I got to lift the curse from Mephastopheles'. So, he's turned into the Ghost Rider, a creation of visual effects and cheesy grit that COULD actually be a legitimate marvel, but ends up being better for laughs, all unintentional I'd guess. But all the while though- and I might actually give credit to the filmmaker and star(s) for this- they don't make it necessarily a dull-bad movie. Few things get more entertaining than seeing how Ghost Rider vanquishes with his fiery whip his un-dead foes, including one who is made of wind! Or just the appearances of Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot, actors who might've been amazing at one time or another, but now seem like extreme caricatures (I was almost expecting Big Lebowski quotes in the dialog/voice-overs of Elliot's). And Eva Mendes becomes almost a counterpoint for Cage's plastic, trying-to-break-cardboard performance.But there's a lot of great lines to go with the wacky visuals too, as the inanities of style and substance start to go hand in hand (i.e. the cops just seem to know without much evidence that Johnny Blaze is responsible for the first set of crimes when he becomes Ghost Rider the first time, or when Ghost Rider rides up the side of a building). And by the end, my friends and I couldn't help ourselves, and went full-blown into what had already been happening for a while watching the flick- we became like the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000, making wisecracks at every turn when not busting a gut over Bentley's turn into being 'Legion...We are MANY!'. The material just lends itself completely to that kind of deconstruction, yet that's what ends up making it not a complete waste of celluloid at the same time. Well, some would argue it is a waste, and they might not be wrong, but what a waste! It's probably up there in the ranks of the most shamelessly entertaining train-wreck Hollywood spectacles, right up there with the likes of Howard the Duck and Zardoz. Just don't, for goodness sakes, expect a respectable adaptation from original source to screen.",6,8,17,21 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," flawed, in the way you'd likely expect with the 3-timer
","I wanted to like X-Men the Last Stand more than I ended up doing, but it goes without saying that the film does lend itself to a certaincase of style going triumphant over substance, it just is. There is an unspoken trend in sequels where the third film 9 times out of 10 is the weakest of the bunch (even if it may not be necessarily a very bad movie). It's a little sad in a way too to see a director like Brett Ratner- who is admittedly by many including myself not as good with the material as Bryan Singer- get pushed aside by a studio far more interested in the action over the substance. And it's unfortunately Do the new mutants look cool? Sure, some of them; it's one of the more amusing things to see this year in a blockbuster having Kelsey Grammar and Vinnie Jones as mutants with over-the-top make-up and costumes. And the special effects and action scenes are given as good, but not having the same real interest as in the past films. Moments in these action sequences- mainly in the wild climax at Alcatraz prison- are exciting, but the problems in the film run deeper than that. If you don't have things all well enough in the script, things are liable to fall apart.One might think that the main plot line of the film, with Famke Janssen as Jean Gray's unbalance and quasi turn to the dark side of the mutant force (maybe just me seeing the 'Sith' comparisons), and the amount of tragedy that befalls the mutants under Xavier's school would make it a very engrossing entertainment. It isn't; there is the feeling more than anything that too much is stuffed into one film, where some sub-plots are left to being undercooked (i.e. the one with Michael Murphy and his winged son), or just given to a lack of creativity (the sub-plot with Anna Paquin's Rogue doesn't have much to it that isn't a mile away). Would I recommend the film as leave-your-brain-at-home-frozen to watch the film? Yeah, but it isn't much of a credit that it's lacking in the ways that would matter to most fans and just movie-goers in general. It will make a lot of money, that is certain, but it will also suffer in time from the good of the film (dependence on the cast like McKellan, Stewart, a couple of newer faces among so-so ones too) contending against the disappointing bits. As one critic somewhere wrote about this film, it's 'soul-less', which is not what this potential material should have, and has me feeling less wanting to see it again the more I think about it.

The Lives of Others," a strikingly human suspense-drama about the changes that can come in good people
","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has here one of the better debut features I've seen in recent years, and until the last ten minutes has on his hands a tough, powerful gem out of Germany. His film brings memories of films like the Conversation, where a surveillance man got changed into a paranoid, The Trial, where the stark, bleak, disparaging mood strikes a chord in every facet of life, and even to a lesser degree the Pianist, where there can be some spark of goodness reached at men in the dead mess of bureaucracy through the power of art, and human expression. So much that we see the East German socialists do, the ones in the highest ranks of over-dominant power, is to make sure everyone is in check by means of fear and tactics of interrogation and surveillance, in The Lives of Others concerns why certain basic freedoms are important, especially in the arts, and that change is not only possible, but paramount for people in bad circumstances.Such is the case for Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gerdeck), who get put under suspicion for possible co-horting with undesirables (i.e. those of the 'West', and conspirators against the state, not always thinking in the party-lines in short), and get put under constant audio surveillance by the State, specifically agent Weiseler (Ulrich Muhe), who is so detached that he doesn't even have a grin at a joke at the expense of the head of state made by an underling. But as he listens more and more to these people, and their own personal struggles (Christa's unfortunate liaisons with a slob of a minister played by Thomas Thieme), and to how they react to a good friend's suicide- by playing a touching Beethoven tune on the piano- he starts to question what he's doing. Can a man who really listens to this music be good, is asked rhetorically by Georg after playing it. This, plus the whole aspect of change, which is mentioned early in the film, becomes the emotional and suspenseful core of the picture; Georg gets help in smuggling an article about suicide he's written- for which he can't put his own name- and Wiesler becomes an accomplice, but to him for what are the right reasons.So what starts out as a tale with possible intonations of espionage or whatever turns into a morality story, and where the personal and political meet at different levels but with similar significance. Can one's duty to one's country's methods and ideals be as crucial as expression in art, music, acting, writing? Donnersmarck's thesis is that, more than anything, change, and the choice to change, is a part of this as well, not just for Wiesler, but for Georg, who decides to go out on a very dangerous limb and not only write the article on an illegal typewriter but to send it out with his friends to the West, but Christa as well with her priorities for 'getting by' in this world. She might be a popular actress, but the price she pays is just as dear as he does, and as Georg witnesses a fellow writer go over the edge as part of the 'statistics', it becomes too much. It's a very potent point about the nature of people in this part of the world at that time that being an individual gains much more to the human spirit than rigidly following a set of rules. Whether or not this is based on a true story or not is irrelevant, because, usually, Donnersmarck gets truthful performances from his actors (especially the subtle Muhe) and is true to how it plays out in sort of a triangle fashion.Now, to say 'usually' because his film isn't completely flawless. The last ten or so minutes, a denouement where everything is made tidy and neatly put together in a sort of contrived way, goes too long and feels out of place with the rest of the picture. Maybe there's much to say about what ambiguity can do, but that would have been more appropriate for what preceded it than the sweet ending that comes out where bittersweet would have done just fine (i.e. ending it right when the Berlin wall falls). Yet, the catharsis, while not totally satisfying, doesn't make things completely cheapened for the experience, which overall is gripping and touching in the ways that matter. One feels for all of the characters, save for those in the high ranks of power like the Minister and Grubitz, especially when Wiesler reaches out for saving just a small piece of humanity in such an oppressive and hopeless civilization. In short, Donnersmarck is definitely a new filmmaker to watch.",9,3,6,11 March 2007
Hellboy," Guillermo Del-Toro's exciting, fun tribute to the flamboyantly cool powers of comic books
","Hellboy is self-conscious, perhaps, but in the best ways possible. Actually, it's more due to writer/director Toro being very aware of what makes up the conventional bits to every sense character-wise to the world of a comic-book, but also what can be entertaining as well, than it is just to having it being a Hellboy movie where the comic-book Hellboy already exists IN this world (guy sees the Hellboy comic, looks up, it's Hellboy!). We get the tough-as-nails, dryly witty, and possibly ticking-time-bomb hero in Hellboy, a deadly serious villain in Rasputin (yes, Rasputin, with a blonde Nazi as his evil side-kick no less), the young apprentice to the hero (Ruper Evans as John Meyers), the hero's love interest (Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair), the father figure (John Hurt's Professor), and the reluctant 'boss' (Jeffrey Tambor), not to mention the plucky side mutant in Abraham (Doug Jones) AND a magnificent creature in that hard-ass slug. They're all there, bright as day (or dark, depending on point of view), and it all works wonderfully due to Toro running with it all head on. It's not done in a way that's meant to pander to the audience, either, but just to have fun with the conventions, to see what makes them all crackle and pop under big-time special effects. It's not quite a guilty pleasure because Toro is also a smart craftsman.And craftsman just as much as director, he crafts this world where the creatures (which were and still are Toro's forte) are fierce and radically charged, whether they're crucial to the picture like Rasputin's rabid, rapidly hatching slug-monsters that can only be killed one or two ways, or if it's just a minor creature like the zombie Russian corpse that leads a little of the way when Hellboy and his crew are in the main hideout of the villains ('I was better off dead!'). Toro is sensitive to the characters alongside this, and makes them all pretty believable- and I say pretty cause it's all a little simple, yet effective, in the main thrust of Hellboy's emotional core being about Liz and if she may or may not go for John over him- and doesn't dumb it down too much or contrive the relationships for the audience. It's a good balance, because there is A LOT of action in Hellboy, in fact probably at least a 60% allotment to either Hellboy fighting the monsters after him (usually in the subway, or in the Russian castle), or with the possibly un-dead assassin in the mask and leather who marks as one of the fiercest forces in comic book movies.So, fan-boys rejoice, because Hellboy should, and hopefully will, have everything one looks for in a brawny, high-octane entertainment where humor isn't confused with cheesiness (Perlman is too well focused as a possible anti-hero to get into any of that, as he makes that hugely built red lug a very real being), and the action isn't over-done with a tongue-in-cheek. Not that Toro doesn't flirt with having goofy things in his picture, like a moment where Hellboy has to save a box of kittens from the grasp of the slug-monster. But they're earned moments among a very tightly constructed story where human evils in history and the bizarre in what is in the facts (Hitler into the occult, Rasputin's very long death) into a comfortably understood framework of comic-book clichés that never get too old when done right. Bottom line, can't wait for number 2!",8,14,15,9 March 2007
Good Will Hunting," Funny and Brilliant- One of the Best Films of 1997
","Good Will Hunting is a great film.  It brings, heart, good (and bad) nature, and many other things in this tale of a janitor at MIT who is terrific at math.  This man Will Hunting (played remarkably by Matt Damon) has many flaws though, and soon, he meets his match- Sean, a psychologist (Robin Williams gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance here) and little by little, starts to change.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Trilogy continues, and it's just as good as the first...
","...with even more action pumped in; the final battle sequence is an astonishing feat from Jackson and his team, making an entire fleet of Urk-Hai completely computer animated, seem totally convincing.  And while the second part is exactly as long as the first, it's even more eye-grabbing with it's visual wonder, the scope of Middle Earth the most impressive thing about Two Towers (it's deserved of an Oscar).  Another impressive feat is the computer animated creature of Gollum, a schitzophrenic, deformed Hobbit who finds Frodo Baggins his new master, alongside Samwise Gamgee, and he may just be the most compelling of the characters, along with the somewhat downsized role of Gandalf the Grey, er White, played still with skill by Sir Ian McKellan.So, for the fans of the Fellowship, and for Tolkien's core audience, they may find a few story strands missing from the original novel, but it is highly reccomended viewing anyway, and if those are concerned about not seeing a scene they visioned from the book, keep in mind that probably a year from now will see the release of the Two Towers extended edition on DVD.

Schindler's List," One of the Best Films Ever Made. Spielberg's Best
","Steven Spielberg has his best masterpiece here with Schindler's list.  It is also his most personal work to say the least.  And what he brings to the screen is like nothing the world has ever seen before- a true to life depiction of the horror known as the holocaust.The story brings us Oskar Schindler, a German munitions chief who brings thousands of Polish Jews from the death camps to his factory and saves them. The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the frightening German commander.  Along with a frighteningly haunting score by John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has created a film that will remain with us forever.  Haunting, dramatic and true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever made.",10,74,138,13 February 2000
Across the Universe," do I want what Julie Taymor is smoking? overlong, visually stunning work of pop art
","It's easy to love the Beatles. They're almost the apex of what British rock/pop music was in the 1960s, and their legacy will remain long after Paul and Ringo join John and George. The songs were of love, and other wild and crazy things, and from everyone 2 to 22 to 64 to 100 can find appeal in the melodies, the harmonies, the experimental usage of sound effects and other tools at the time. Now comes Across the Universe, adapted from the stage musical, and it's like a half lovey-dovey goofy romantic drama, half mind-warp commercial for classic Beatles songs, not to mention a kind of condensation of infamous moments in Beatles pop-culture (sans the Ed Sullivan Show for some reason). At the least, it intrigues one to think how this could ever be executed on a stage- or if it is somewhat less ambitious- though on its own it seems to cast an impression that should be taken on its own. This is mostly due to director Julie Taymor making this a kaleidescope of 60s socio-political fever ala Hair, only unlike Forman's film Taymor weaves in and out of making something of a crazy exploitation film, and it's in these moments that a break from 'conventional' musical film-making can be seen.But in a way the experience of seeing Across the Universe reminded me of what I thought of Pirates of the Caribeean: At Worlds End; both films are overlong, at least by a few (if not more) minutes, tend to not make much sense at times, and also contain some chunks of tastefully tasteless acts of brazen, hilarious surrealism (where Verbinski had Jack Sparrow in Davey Jones's locker, this time we get Bono as Dr. Robert, and Eddie Izzard performing 'Benefit of Mr. Kite' in sequences that would've thrown the AIP people for a loop with their psychedelic product). The story is meant to be simple, as many musicals tend to shoot for, and anyone who's seen a few melodramas will know what's going on in plot turns: Jude and Lucy are a British kid and an American girl respectively who meet when Jude comes to America looking for an estranged father (only seen in two scenes, by the way), and Lucy meets Jude by way of brother Max (as in Maxwell Silver Hammer, there's more in-references).Soon Jude and Max decide to split the college area, go rent out an apartment in New York City thanks to (Sexy) Sadie, who soon meets Jo-Jo (come on flat-top) right out of Detroit and can play a mean guitar for her singing group, and then there's also Prudence who 'came in through the bathroom window.' Then there's love, a good chunk of drama, horrors of war and protesting as backdrops for the wishy-washy love-affair between Jude (who doesn't see the reason to go all-out with the protesting) and Lucy (who doesn't seem to realize until her bosses at the Democratic-action headquarters are making bombs something is fishy). If this sounds like it's getting not as simple, I neglected to mention the throwaway psychedelia scenes, making up a good twenty minutes in the mid-section of the flick.What ends up distinguishing this flawed film- and it's hard not to have at least some criticism even if you go into this a die-hard Beatles fan, as more or less forty years has made playing on a roof-top old hat, or just in the putridly conventional turns the story makes in the last fifteen minutes (including a version of 'Hey Jude' that makes an already overrated hit even more unbearable)- is really the vision behind it, the verve to make many scenes at least have the feeling of vibrancy and intimacy, and the guts to take theatricality into the realm of camera compositions, deranged lighting set-ups, production design out of underground paintings, et all. A scene like at the bowling alley is taken as far as it can, playing with all the space and as the actors (including the guy who played Jude, can't recall his name) make it fun times with the palette of colors used. But then when looking at 'Mr. Kite' or 'I Am the Walrus' (with the guest stars Bono and Izzard bringing their own weird quirks to the process), or even 'Because', all logic is cut-off, not even little bits like in other portions of the film (i.e. Prudence in the movie) and suddenly it's imagination incarnate.This all being said, I'm not sure when I would want to see this film again. It's not like one of the Beatles movies from the original era, where Help! or Hard Days Night or Yellow Submarine carried unique comic and cinematic charms as well as a level of rewatchability that's unparalleled in rock movies. It also becomes something of a nitpicky affair to go from one segment to another and have it jarring to find one excellent or touching and the next shrill or just stupid (despite them both being great performers, I couldn't stand the 'arc' given to Jo-Jo and Sadie). But the singing and performances, for what they're worth, are at the least fantastic covers (far and away better than those for I Am Sam), are quite accomplished and, for the 'kids' as it were spot-on for what's needed. And there's a balance that Taymor tries to keep in scenes like 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' where there's the aftermath of war and veterans in hospital beds, and at the same time six Salma Hayek nurses all doing dances, that are all her own. It's all nothing great, but I was glad I saw it.",7,2,5,11 October 2007
The Incredibles," My favorite film from Pixar in over five years- Bird and company produce a triumph of a family film
","Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again.",10,249,311,5 November 2004
The Mist," a near-classic throwback to 1950s sci-fi movies, with an emphasis on cool, creepy monsters and a chillingly human atmosphere
","The Mist is one of the bleakest horror films to come out of Hollywood in many a moon, but with some points that can be taken. This isn't trash or torture-porn, but an expertly crafted piece of sci-fi/horror fiction that can only come from someone as bravely demented as Stephen King (or rather from what appears to be a bravely demented creativity that, of course, knows no bounds). But if you asked me who directed it had I not known Frank Darabont had, I wouldn't be able to say: this is far from the classically-stylized form of Shawshank and Green Mile, and instead resembles what is like a sci-fi channel movie of the week, only much better written and acted. In fact, it's more comparable to the most succinct and terrifying that 1950s sci-fi movies offered, where creepy (and I do mean creepy and gross) monsters and huge insects and things crawl all over and in the darkest places, but it's the human beings and how they react- and how society is reflected ten-fold in the reaction- that counts.Truth be told, the actual plastics of the film are well-done; the monsters themselves, which are explained only for a moment as a throwaway by a frightened soldier who says this mist and the creatures that come from it are from another dimension and there's some sort of portal or other, are delightfully nasty. They're the kind of huge critters that might have had room in King Kong had PJ had even more time, with the form of an insect or a huge squid or a gigantic crab, can make the audience jump and laugh and yell at the screen. Plus there's the mist itself, which holds a kind of 'big-other' quality, as is described by philosophers as this other entity that human beings just can't really completely grasp, even when it's staring them right in their faces (not quite as direct as in Boyle's Sunshine with the sun, but close enough), and if one wanted to read into it enough it's a kind of crafty, ingenious metaphor from King on the nature of fear, of terror completely unbound in the unknown, or the little that is known which when confronted (i.e. when they go out to the pharmacy) is about as startling as anything imaginable.But on the side of substance, this is also a winner, maybe even more-so. There's not much doubt in my mind that Darabont, for all of his faithfulness to the original King text, enriched the material for present times with a classic example of rationalism vs. irrationalism. The premise is this: an out-of-towner (Thomas Jane) is in a small sea-side Maine town when after a heavy storm a mist starts to crawl over the town, and as he goes to the supermarket to get supplies, with practically everyone else in town getting things, the mist comes completely over, a man runs out 'there's something in the mist!' he says, and the door slams shut. From there-on there's a struggle on the fronts of, simply, what to do: Jane just wants to know what they're up against, how to get to the cars, how to get the hell out; Andre Braugher's character, a lawyer, might be the most rational, thinks it's poppycock that anything is out there even after the encounter some of the men have with the tentacled creature at the loading dock; and Marcia Gay Harding, in one of the great examples of playing a one-note character so right, is a hardcore bible-thumper who riles up those inside of the supermarket to realize that the end of the world is coming ala Revelations, and that she- following not getting killed while standing still by one of the alien-bugs- is the wrath of God. It's the first time in a while have I seen an audience yell and cringe and laugh at how each major character meets their fate, no matter what the approach.If it isn't quite Night of the Living Dead classic-status, it might be expected- hence the comparison to sci-fi channel movie-of-the-week status, in small part. It is clichéd with certain characters, archetypes, lots of hand-held camera-work, and a melodramatic musical accompaniment. But it's worth seeing on the big screen, if only for the audience-participation sake, and to take in all of that potent terror that is realized from the fronts of effective creature-feature and socio-political drama. And the ending, to be sure, save for Jane's over-the-top reaction, is bewildering, and I mean that as a compliment.",8,75,150,21 November 2007
Driven," Good entertainment by Stallone and company
","While Driven has some loose ends in the works (I don't think that people would come out of those car crashes with just hurt legs, they would be dead), it still delivers some good things along the way.  The film goes in the sense of George Carlin's statement, where else am I gonna see a 26 car collision, and not be in the SOB.  Because, the film not only shows the drivers, pressmen, owner's and driver's girlfriends, but the fans, and how many come to the races in hordes to watch cars go in a circle.The film stars Stallone as a once great driver who comes in to assist Reynolds's new star driver (Pardue) to try and get his head together on and off the track.  Often, it seems director Harlin takes his cues from Stone's Any Given Sunday on many of the shots, but this is pretty much original (if you don't take into account that Cruise and Kidman flick).  Sometimes absurd, but it works in the popcorn movie sense.  Love the quarter trick. B+",6,8,14,28 April 2001
The Elephant Man," An amazing drama, one of the best of its kind
",David Lynch brings some great atmosphere in this updated Elephant Man film. It is a drama filled with true compassion that makes you think and draws you in with great cinematography and black and white film.  The story is about a deformed man (John Hurt in his best performance in incredible makeup) who gets some help after years of torture by a doctor (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a early and good performance).  Real emotion is evoked here and it works as it is one of the best Lynch films and the 1980's films.  Biggest surprise- film is produced by Mel Brooks and his Brooksfilms productions.

I Am Legend," the tale of Robert Neville, five years in the future...
","Another post-apocalyptic flick? And this time with Will 'gettin jiggy with it' Smith. And from the director of Constantine. But I liked it. Or at least relative to what are much better films of this ilk (28 Days... movies, where they don't rely on CGI for every single infected) and lesser (30 Days of Night, if the comparison stands. Director Francis Lawrence deals with the tragic nature of the 'last man is not alone' idea seriously, and with little touches of humor (some of it, of course, relying on Smith's charm, which in a weird way makes his small-talk to mannequins he has set up in a video store as the sad continuation of social mental stability). It's also amplified by his companion, a dog, who becomes like the quasi-Wilson of the picture- only, arguably, with more sympathy going out to a dog than a volleyball. Their scenes are the most heartfelt, but without having to try or cloy too much.I liked the dark atmosphere for many of the scenes, particularly dark in the sense of it being literal (Robert Neville going around in the building to find Samantha). And I also like how the writers, taking off of Matheson's great source of a novel, at the path of professional and mental well-being, in the face of absolute (and calculable) doom. Even some bits of rational vs irrationalism between Ana and Neville work pretty well. And it goes without saying the impressive scope of the special effects - meaning almost all of the location scenes out and about in Manhattan where telling CGI or green screen or what is very difficult.For everything that is impressive, and for a big-big studio movie (probably the most expensive 'zombie' movie ever made), there are some liabilities. Some may differ, but the infected as shown are all complete CGI creations, and look as such. There are some legitimate scares (the bit with the girl on the operating table that jets up after what looks like death is a good one), especially in the old-fashioned 'dont-go-there' kind where things crawl in the unknown spaces. But the design of the infected is never very compelling, they look like monsters and despite the difference from a 28 Days kind of movie the lack of a recognizable human feature (past the obvious fact that as mutants they're meant to look a little skewed) it's never too compelling an example. They look, as many suggest, out of a run-of-the-mill Playstation game.But nevertheless it's worth a full admission price; I Am Legend is creepy entertainment that works well for the multiplexes. Smith as the (would-be) lone hero Robert Neville is in near perfect form; it might even be his best dramatic performance to date, where he calls on all of his resources to make this a guy we want on our side. He makes Neville much more human than Charlton Heston did in The Omega Man, and believable when he should be at his most pathetic. Even through monologing about Bob Marley Smith's interesting- a true leading man, and well worth this respectable treatment of a once-again adaptation of a classic science fiction/horror piece. Whether it's a great film or not you be the judge.",7,7,13,15 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," until the 2/3'rd mark...
","The Bourne Legacy had potential to be really dynamite, with good (non) romantic chemistry between Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, and I was genuinely interested in his story as the (non) Jason Bourne of the story. In fact, I was glad for at least the first half the film was relatively action-free, and I could try to understand what this Treadstone thing was that came apart and then fell asunder.... And then the second half - no, I'll be more generous, the last third - came along, and it became another chaos-cinema spectacle with a chase through a Filipino city that is just ludicrous, and yet played completely straight.The sad part is that Tony Gilroy, who wrote some if not all of the other Bourne movies and is a damn good director in his own right (see the excellent studio drama Michael Clayton and the good if not great studio comedy Duplicity), knows this world and finds a way to make the dramatic angle work without Jason Bourne. Indeed I found Aaron Cross, Renner's character, to be interesting because we don't know much about him at first, and yet it's not Bourne all over again; he knows who he is, at least sort of, in pieces (an ex-soldier who was 'turned' over to this special program and one of nine 'Recruits' for the program). All we know is, he needs his drugs. It's a nice drug-addict parable. What does he need it for? Well, to be a superhero, of course.Seriously, that is the logic working here, and yet I could buy into it, because of the movie-science as laid out by Weisz's doctor, who is really into viruses and has a stable career... until her co-worker flips out and shoots up their lab (a really, genuinely tense sequence that shows Gilroy and DP Robert Elswit in their element, giving enough time to shots, and mounting dread as to how this guy can't be stopped - a more horror movie version of Cross mayhap). Surely the plot with Edward Norton, reduced basically to looking concerned throughout the movie and occasionally yelling at Stacy Keach, is not intensely interesting, mostly because we've seen it all before, in all three previous movies really. A man-hunt, track him down, squash the program, etc etc, oh and there's Joan Allen for a moment, move along.What I had a small hope for was that Gilroy, a fairly sophisticated Hollywood director, and Elswit, who did a sharp job shooting the possibly equally preposterous spy thriller Salt, would change up the action just a little, and not make things as chaotic-actiony as Paul Greengrass had done with his previous films (it's been so long since I've seen Doug Liman's film so no comment there). But alas, Gilroy must have also thought that given that he's already dishing out a more intriguing character and dynamic between the male/female leads, and that there's more at stake, he has to give the audience what 'they' want. And what is that? Brash, chaotic cinema: super fast cuts, close-to-the- character shots, spatial madness really. But where Greengrass, for his over-reliance on it (even in small dramatic scenes really), could manage it with a certain flair, I was lost in the miasma of the chase that ensues first over rooftop and then on motorcycle through the city. So much built up, and then it was hard to care except in little touches, such as how the Chinese equivalent of Renner's super-drugged-up-spy-hero would be a bit more aggressive and dogged since, well, I dunno, he's Chinese (I'm merely speculating on the part of the cynical filmmakers). Will the series continue? I dunno. Renner is a capable and talented actor, finely physical but can bring the emotional weight when he has to, and Weisz is a fine addition. Yet, ultimately, Bourne Legacy is disappointing more because of who it's coming from. Had it been hacks, I might've forgotten about it. I may still, but not easily.",6,2,8,19 September 2012
22 Jump Street," what else to say that it's funny. well, it's a funny sequel that may be better than the first!
","My first thought as the credits rolled for 22 Jump Street - and of course these are the kind of credits you really have no choice but to sit and watch until they are all done just in case you miss 34 Jump Street or whatever the next one is - was this: it's funny. If I could make it succinct that's my review. The filmmakers practically dare me to write more like, 'hey, we already know this is a money grab with multiple references to appeasing corporate masters while also making constant light of how much goddamn bromance there is here in these buddy cop movies, so, take your best shot!' so... yeah, forget it. It's funny, and the bromance is not something to gloss over as it's one of those have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too things where it's full of genuine sentiment, but at the same time they get to have a 'breaking up/apart' montage that is just perfect comedy. Oh, and seeing how Tatum goes about his undercover college life with his, uh, new bros is also very funny.In short, you should go see it, that's it. Oh, and those twins are very funny, and Ice Cube steals the show in one scene where he reacts to something I never thought I'd see but makes perfect sense: what happens when the Ice Cube of this movie, the hardass detective sees his daughter with one of his, well, underlings? His facial expressions in just one scene are more hysterical than ten average comedies.",8,1,3,30 November 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," one of those movies that, in a strange way, is almost TOO good
","We've seen this story before, but then again maybe not. This is the attitude that director Sidney Lumet takes (as he did with films like 12 Angry Men and Serpico, the later also starring Al Pacino) with Dog Day Afternoon. Bank robbery films are a staple in cinema since The Great Train Robbery filmed in 1903. However this story (not even saying based on a true story, just saying 'this is a true story' is enough) is set in 1972, and filmed a couple of years later, at a time when attitudes in society were changing, as was storytelling. Lumet here could get away with things he couldn't get away with if he tried this in the 50's; with unapologetically homosexual (but truthful is the key) characters, one of them the lead character; surprises that add to the unconventionality of the style of the film; and an ending that will keep you guessing. Lumet did a lot of good with this movie, and in a small way some not so good; people would look at many bank-robbery pictures that would come after this and size them up to this, as it was almost transparently influential (the 'Attica, Attica' tirade is something a child knows years before he actually sees the film).But its the honesty in the truth of the story and problems of the main characters, and in fact the lead up to the robbery and the (unsuccessful) robbery has truth out of it. It is manipulative in a sense, as it is so truthful artifice is almost excluded entirely from the picture. Take when Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) first whip out their guns in the bank. Their friend can't take it and wants out. This is a great moment, and the film has them scattered about. In some ways these great parts and scenes make up for the fact that beneath it all is a story that we have seen too many times (the robbers faced with intense media attention, wanting a plane to take the hostages, etc), or maybe not; maybe one has to put the film into context of the period. But a scene, for another example, when Sonny talks to his 'friend' on the phone. This is one of those moments where Pacino is of course as always 'Pacino', but also totally immersed in the character and the situation. Lumet lets this play for painfully real results.Dog Day Afternoon is one of Lumet's grittiest successes, as he takes the city he's made most of his films in, New York, and gives it the right tone, inside the bank and out, for this story of eventuality to unfold. The opening montage, with an Elton John song in the background, really has little relevance to the rest of the film, except to set up mood, and style, and it is a wonderful style (interestingly, the rest of the film aside from this opening is without music, another touch of the gripping realism). In a way, as I mentioned, its almost TOO intense, and too spectacular in the power that it has. This is Al Pacino in his prime, after all, off the heels of Serpico and The Godfather films, with his Sonny loaded with vigor and ambition and delusions of grandeur. John Cazale's Sal, by the way, is equally convincing in his own right, bringing a level of sanity to some of Sonny's over-the-top ideas. This film, and its actors and characters and Dede Allen editing, is almost a blue-print for how many other films that would come after this would take. One almost wonders what's the point of all of it, but when it makes its moments to shine, its dynamite.",10,28,35,1 September 2005
School of Rock," it's got kids, it's got rock and roll, and it's got Jack Black, and it works
","I wouldn't put The School of Rock into a pantheon of great, artistic cinema lists, but then again the subject matter itself defies that possibility. Fact is, like the film Airheads (only this film is a little more convincing in its 'logic'), School of Rock is like that fresh treat of a comedy that I wish in some ways I saw as kid, as I know I would've been even more amazed at its silliness but also its true enthusiasm for rock music, GOOD rock music I might add. It's not just that it has director Richard Linklater- who also laid down his film Dazed and Confused with the same good solid hard rock and roll pathos- giving the film some needed push into the right direction (through Mike White's clever script), but also because he lets the reins off just enough on Jack Black. He is an actor with such a distinctive personality he either elicits his avid admirers (some through Tenacious D), or adamant boo's. But even those who usually aren't Black fans tend to gravitate to this film- it contains some of his wackiness and over-the-top zeal, but it also has him giving a good performance, like in his breakthrough in High Fidelity.And Linklater, as with Black, is testing different ground here- working with kids. This is so tricky that it's very hard to explain it to some; having multiple children characters in a film can be OK if you're doing something typical like a 'keeping-hope-alive-in-a-school melodrama'. This time though there has to be enough personality to contend- and play off on- Black. It's here where there's some very good ground laid out; Black's character is meant to go through some sort of transformation through working with these kids, obviously through just being himself (and not through some incredible higher cause like in more self-conscious films), while still having fun. Most of the kids are given enough back-story to not be just cardboard cut-outs, and I liked that they took their roles with equal sincerity and coolness. They're are even a few laughs that come from scenes where the kids bring out some of their own 'wit' against Black.But then it comes down though to two things in recommending this film- do you find Jack Black funny, or at least entertaining to an extent, and do you like him rocking out like a 70's party animal? There are some of the obligatory obvious scenes early on in the film, mostly as set-up, as he gets kicked out of his band, leading him to secretly take a substituting job with the kids at the school. And some little scenes of minor characters ironically don't work as well as the ones with the children, like the 'Edge of Seventeen' scene at the bar with Joan Cusack. And maybe being more of a casual observer of Black's work over the years seeing his work in a film like this once is enough for a while (I actually haven't seen the film in some many months, though fresh in my mind). But ultimately the film works as a mix of tongue-in-cheek with, what one critic compared to slightly Dead Poets Society touch of teacher-pupils storytelling, where even if you're not rolling in your seat with laughs you're probably grinning most of the way...and as one who is still heavily into the kind of rock that is played by the (talented) kids in the film, I can't help but feel some glee that songs by the Doors and Led Zeppelin get such prominence in a major studio film at a time when good rock music is getting harder to find in them.

Amadeus," Excellent in the director's cut, though still long.
","Amadeus actually caught my attention, in parts. It has excellent performances from F. Murray Abraham as a semi-famous musician who is incredibly jealous yet fascinated with the prodigy Amadeus, played to utter perfection by Thomas Hulce (love that laugh). The theme of competition is one that director Milos Forman latches onto and gets enough juice and dramatic tension to pull off the epic nature of the film, both personal and extreme. Often quite good, however suffers from the overlong-ness and sometimes it is impossible to keep attention, however it snaps back every once in a while. Period detail and is to the dot. And the music makes up anything else I could want in a film. A-",9,5,7,8 February 2001
The Game," a thriller with enough paranoia and gusto to be one of the better films of 97
","The Game is basically an elaborate hoax, but unlike at least several others I've seen over the past several years, director David Fincher gets something really right about this one. The fact is the plot is so convoluted at times, so pumped with the kind of paranoia and surrealism to give Hitchcock the willies, that it almost works to annoy the viewer with the amount of manipulation it puts across. But, as it turns out, it is more about being manipulated than it is about, well, to put it this way, the audience isn't necessarily cheated as in a lessor picture. Adding to the intelligence level of the audience (or, for some, lack thereof) is superlative craftsmanship on the part of Fincher, who has carved out for him with his roster of films from the 90's quite a nook of edge-of-your-seat thrills that, at the least, isn't boring.Michael Douglas is really excellent here as well, on par with some of his best work of the past decade and a half. At first his performance seems rather subdued, like a distilled version of those businessmen he plays in almost every other movie he's in. Again, part of the manipulation not just on the audience, but tenfold on the lead character. Nicholas is given a birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn), and it turns out to be 'the game', where anything can happen, and rather relentlessly at that. Soon Nicholas, cold and sort of detached from those around him, becomes super-duper paranoid and on his toes as the CRS (Consumer Recreational Services, ho-ho) goes to work on him. Pretty soon he has no money, no home, almost no life. Or is it? It's not too inappropriate to have the opening image over the credits of jigsaw puzzles is not far from what the film is itself, just one huge set laid out on the carpet.If there could be anything that started to bug me as the film started to near its climax, it would be that, well, it's a reminder of both how much I like and dislike getting mind-f***ed by a movie, particularly a brilliantly shot-one like this. And the more I think about it, however, it may possibly lack something that Fincher's follow-up, Fight Club (possibly his best film to date), had, which was a connection of character to some kind of statement about something. Has the hoax that ends up showing itself as amounted to something in the way that it should've, or could've? The cat-and-mouse factor of the script, direction and acting, and the whole atmosphere is probably on par with Fincher's other work, but is there a connection with how Nicholas was and how he does become, or is it all meant for the gimmick? Still, with this observation, if not quite a criticism, I still recognize this film as being a mile ahead of other films that have come in its wake. Too often do I see a film where a lead character- or characters- get the run-around (so to speak) just for the sake of the script. This time in the Game, the director- by way of the almost TOO convincing performances (that scene between Douglas and Penn in the car & stairs at night had me talking to the screen for the right and wrong reasons)- doesn't insult the audience's expectations. Bottom line, go in with a suspension of disbelief, and it's one of the better elaborate hoaxes put on film in the 90's.",9,2,5,21 April 2006
Kick-Ass," 'Wait till they get a load of me' Ho-Ho
","I can't claim to be an aficionado of the comic-book Kick-Ass, written by Mark Millar and John Romita (and in case you don't remember, don't worry, their names pop up as characters read the comic-book on screen, good tie in, I mean, in-joke), and I can't even speak entirely for what the man's talents as a writer are completely (other exposure would include his Superman: Red Son comic, which was a fantastic 'elseworld' book, and the adaptation of Wanted from 2008, which was... decent). But what is here is the film, directed by Matthew Vaughn, on a rather gigantic wave of fan-boy buzz and hype. Character posters have appeared in subway stations and on internet sites, commercial emphasize the 'Kick-Ass'-ed nature of the characters, and the trailer is juiced up to pump up the audience like there's no tomorrow. As a red-blooded 20-something going into the film, I had no expectations as to the total quality of the film, but I hoped for the best.As it turns out, Kick-Ass is... just OK. That might be the worst thing Vaughn would want to hear, but it's what happens when one shoots so high with a high concept while also, as a director, not taking into account something as, say, originality. I don't mean in the premise itself, per-say, which concerns a teenage kid, Dave, who is just an average nerdy dude who gets picked on and whose mother died rather un-tragically from an aneurysm (oh, and he masturbates a lot, just thought I'd share that). He decides one day, 'hey, why doesn't someone just become a superhero?' Dave throws on a scuba suit, goes out into the world, and... gets his ass beaten down, a lot, like emergency-room suitable. But, as he says, like a good serial killer, he can't let go, and keeps going out, getting his ass kicked (and kicking a little bit here and there), and a video sparks him into the momentary flavor of the moment.There is some satire present here in this concept, and with some of the other characters, like Mr. McCready and his daughter, Mindy, the former training the latter since birth to fight and, on occasion, be shot at like it's going to the park ('It's like getting punched in the chest,' kindly Damon says). Whether this is all really top-notch satire it's hard to say; from the looks of material in Kick-Ass and Millar's previous adaptation Wanted it's easy to say that he's a big Fight Club flavor, really, just a big comics fan since naturally he writes for them and wants to toy and see what makes the conventions kick. In fact I wasn't bothered so much by the Big Daddy/Hit Girl relationship... actually, that's a white lie. It is disturbing, particularly when set, at least at first, in something that really resembles a 'real' world in the scope of a movie. But it's handled well in the sense that it's interesting.I actually would want to see more of that, and see more of Hit Girl/Mindy developed. But then again, why have development (playing Devil's Advocate here) when you can just have Hit Girl by way of her father/mentor go around killing lots of people without much background in character. What ultimately comes up in the film is a sense of a shallow interpretation of the material, of it sliding into a weird region where it loses sense of any kind of reality based in its satire and becomes a derivative fan-boy genre wet dream. And I'm not trying to make hyperbole with that; Vaughn transforms his film, in the second half, after what has been a curious mixed-up but sometimes very funny story of misguided outcasts living vicariously through fantasy, into a genre knock-off. And not even that, but a Tarantino knock-off. By the time the Morricone music came up and the masses of guards arrived, only one thought creeped in my mind: At what point does Hit Girl join the Deadly Vipers? The loss of originality in the direction, and moments of humor that fall flat, could be made up by the performances. As luck would have it, Nicolas Cage does really rise up to the occasion (perhaps as he's such a comic-book fan himself that he really does get what Millar and Romita went for). He puts on a strange William Shatner type of inflection for stretches of time, and puts some serious emphasis into his characters own vendetta - his story makes up the crux of the film, getting vengeance at the gangster played by Mark Strong - and he gives a genuine piece of work, at times howlingly hysterical and dead-pan. Those who fare less well are Hit Girl, played by Chloe Moretz (though she does what she can), and especially the guy playing Kick-Ass. Even in scenes where I wanted to get behind the jokes, like the running side-story with Dave and the girl who thinks he's gay (a creep thing to do, but hey, he's a teen), I couldn't because it's just an unconvincing performance. Mint-Plasse as Red Mist doesn't fare much better, but the character is one-note anyway.I wish I could get behind the film a lot more than I did. Yet, the longer it lingers in my mind after watching it, the less I think of it, favorably or negatively really. It will probably give its already solidified fans of the comic something to chew on, and maybe Vaughn can bring a few more into his cinematic fold. Little sparks of a fantastic commentary show up (perhaps media attention, which has some basis in fact, re: the story a year ago in Cincinatti where an actual guy named 'Shadow Hare' went out to try and fight crime, could have given some better focus). But overall, it doesn't really make its mark as its own genuine article, which is a shame.",6,13,29,15 April 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," amazing screen presence, sure-fire direction, and a tragic-comic action script - a classic for all involved
","John Huston must know, equally, how great and how damn flawed man can be. A lot of his films- some might say the bulk of his oeuvre- focuses on this, from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to Moby Dick. Sometimes, it might seem, a man has both the writhing worm of ambition and promise and the potential for complete failure in a single bound. He excels at this, not because he has to but because he needs to tell these stories of men like this - his heroes were manly male stories by the likes of Melville, Kipling, Hemingway and Hammett, but one can also sense the spark of criticism, of questioning what makes such men the way they are. The Man Who Would be King is no exception, and may be the pinnacle of such a tale, where we see two men, formerly failed soldiers, make themselves into the rulers of a nothing country right off of Afghanistan in the 19th century - one of them becomes a God by luck (or destiny) - and how it eventually ruins them. Whether Huston's film, by way of Kipling's story, is meant as a cautionary tale or a wicked satire (or maybe both), it's still tremendous storytelling, acting, direction and musical composition, etc. In the film, two ex-soldiers of the Royal English Army are in India, Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnahan (Michael Caine). They both tell the impressed if a little doubtful Rudyard Kipling himself, merely a journalist at the time (Christopher Plummer by the way), that they, being pretty much without any real place to go or things to do as disgraced soldiers (lots of crimes such as theft and blackmail), have a plan: to go to Kafiristan, which is a country few know exists and hasn't been inhabited by any kind of real ruler since Alexander the Great. In short, a great place to rule and take charge with their skills as soldiers.After braving the terrain, in some brief but effective scenes showing how much of a duo Draven and Peachy are in battling the weather and a few stray wanderers, they arrive at the country, which is in shambles, and they train some of the locals to fight their way against their rules (the one guy who is sort of, kinda ruling things wants 'Terrible' to follow his name, not 'Great' as it were). But somehow Draven stands out - first when he is hit by an arrow and it doesn't hurt him or draw blood (since, yeah, it struck a part of his shield), since this shows that he is automatically King. Next, when the High Priest calls him out, he happens to have around his neck a Free-Mason symbol, which sets off the High Priest to declare him a God (since, well, it's the same image as on a tablet or something). For all of the riches now at Draven's disposal, over a short period of time - that is, he really starts to like the idea of this God thing, when before he was on par with Peachy, a tough and smart and witty entrepreneur. No Guts, No Glory, I guess.This is the sort of story that reads interesting and raises questions about Colonialization and worship in general. On the screen, when delivered by a director who lets the backdrops of the mountains and hordes of middle-eastern mountain people, and the glorious acting of Connery (I might say at a career high here) and Caine (who is no slacker either, certainly when he realizes how crazy Draven has become), it becomes something to behold. The dialog is one thing that sticks out as particularly clever and intelligent; the script could easily fall into some kind of delirious or ridiculous swashbuckler story, or even something that praises what they're doing. But Huston and his co- writer's script give these characters smart things to say, things that people like these British officers with carte blanche, as well as their go-between guy who translates for them, would say in this unlikely cinematic situation. Like other Huston films ala 'Falcon' and 'Sierra Madre', it's very quotable.The themes are very potent, and not dumbed down or so sensational that they become incredulous. Huston and Kipling draw upon the history of man's ability to overcome obstacles, be it climbing a mountain or training a small army or becoming enamored with the responsibility of a God, what the outcome of adventure and ambition does to people. It's significant, for example, that Draven is told about how Alexander the Great picked his wife from this region when he ruled, and so he decides he must take a wife and bear a son for future rulers, even as it's spoken that women fear being chosen to become the wife of a God since they'll burn up in flames. Things like that, or how simple a small group of monks can stop an entire battle with everyone bowing in heed. It's remarkable how astute the commentary is in the film, while at the same time not detracting from the action or the power of the performances.The Man Who Would be King is elegant and harsh, with a beautiful and harrowing Maurice Jarre score (if not as iconic still as fantastic as Lawrence of Arabia for him), and memorable for its star power and how its story is really about something. It's also a grandly British story, of guys who sing traditional songs when they're bored or near death) and joke when they can and are so likable for how they just go for broke. That's one other thing: these guys are never so distasteful as to be hated, and even their 'scheme' is sort of endearing because of everything they go through to get to Kafiristan. There's a reason at the end Kipling stands mouth agape instead of reaching for his gun; in spite of everything these guys are truly, painfully human.",10,7,10,16 June 2010
Ghostbusters," One of the Funnest movies ever
","'Human Sacrifice, Dogs and Cats living together, MASS HYSTERIA' said one Peter Venkman.  And that could pretty much describe this goofy comedy from the great minds of Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis.  But the plot is pretty interesting also.  It shows a trio of scientists (funny ones at that including Bill Murray in one of his best roles) turn from college rejects to the biggest hit in New York by being 'profesional paranormal investigators and eliminators' (AKA- Ghostbusters).  There are plenty of funny parts, but they are overshadowed by parts of ridiculous (yet remarkable) effects which showcase ghosts of plenty. But thanks to great writing, great directing (Ivan reitman), and great acting, this film gets to be a great example of comedy in it's finest form and It's one of the best films of the 80's as well.",10,8,15,5 March 2000
Coyote Ugly," A so-so entertaining date movie
","I thought this film wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it isn't something to rush to either.  There are enduring performances by Ppier Perablo and some others, and the story is good, but it is missing something. I think it is called brains.  This film (despite being entertaining) is kinda stupid, so it can appeal to stupid teens.  And it does (not that I am stupid).  But I think that couples will like the sensuous parts and some of the romance.  But that might be it.  Also, you might want to see this movie for Perablo's performance.One more interesting thing (and according to this site) is that Kevin Smith (of Jay and Silent Bob fame) is supposedly a uncredited co-writer on this film, and I actually think he did do a couple of things.  The clues- 1, the character Violet (Perablo) comes from South Amboy, New Jersey (which is where around Smith is from) and 2, the Adam Garcia character's prized possession is a Spiderman comic book (Smith had Stan Lee who created Spiderman in the film Mallrats).  Just a notion, I could be wrong.  But one thing I am sure of is this film is a must see, for girls. B+",5,0,2,4 August 2000
Gran Torino," the memorable Golden Years of Walt Kowalski
","Seeing Clint Eastwood now is like looking at a face weathered away on a mountain ridge. The crevices go so deep on his face that one has to put that right alongside the voice, which is now so growl-like (indeed Eastwood's Walt Kowalski does growl in some scenes) that he would be a dead-ringer to play Batman if Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns ever got adapted (yeah, he's in his 50s in the comic book, it's not a stretch really for Clint when you think about it). At 78, you wouldn't want to cross his path down a dark alley, or even just in a diner, without paying some proper respects. It's his presence, if nothing else, that makes Gran Torino compulsively watchable. It may be flawed with some of its dialog and plotting, as well as some key performances. But it's Clint Eastwood directing and Clint Eastwood the star acting in a near perfect two-dimensional performance (it works best as that, anything too much explained actually defeats the strengths of Kowalski for the audience), which makes it a minor must-see.But there's more. Gran Torino showcases, in some scenes that have blistering comic effect, a rarity in movies: a drama about racism that focuses on a main character who is a kind of dying breed of pre-Baby-Boomer era racist blue-collar white workers who love drinking their beer, cursing out minorities (sometimes just kidding around or what amounts to kidding around, sometimes definitely not). It is in that sense kind of like a Dirty Harry picture, in that Eastwood's character is an equal opportunity offender. But he also is wearing a similar hat to his Million Dollar Baby persona, complete with a pestering Priest and a protégé in Thao (Bee Vang). He's a curmudgeon, and the kind that audience's eat up. At first, indeed, it's instantly comical, like a more parody-like take on the old-man Eastwood persona, grumbling around during his deceased wife's after-funeral dinner and while, well, sitting on his porch chugging Pabst Blue Ribbon and getting his shotgun out at those punk Asian gang-bangers having fights on his lawn.This leads to the obvious point that what Eastwood does as an actor makes it so watchable because it's layered: we get the 'Get off my lawn!' line that made the trailer look as funny as it is- this is, at least for a good half of the movie, a kind of comical Eastwood performance without ever breaking a sweat- and as a soul who can't seem to figure on knowing how to live since knowing death is kind of easy as a veteran. And yet, for all of the joy in watching an icon like him on screen, and for some of the memorable scenes that make it enjoyable (oddly enough, since it's not as good a film as it, more enjoyable conventionally than Changeling from just two months ago), its not up to snuff with what Eastwood's done this decade at his best. In his 70s he's been more or less on a roll, making masterpieces like Mystic River and Letters from Iwo Jima and even near-excellent pics like Million Dollar Baby.Gran Torino, sadly, isn't one of them; for everything that Eastwood has going for him as star of the picture, he doesn't cast the bulk of the supporting parts well: Vang is actually dead-flat or just flubbing a lot of this character of Thao, and his sister Sue (Her) doesn't far much better. The Father (Carley) is decent but ineffective, and these kinds of average pieces of acting surrounding Eastwood magnify some of the phoned-in qualities in the script. While it goes without saying Gran Torino is nowhere near as hackneyed as Crash or lame as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, for every powerful scene dealing with racism in the picture there's another that's just a little too tidy. It works best to see Kowalski not changing much by the picture's end, being still pretty true to who he is as a good person and a mean SOB, as opposed to silly scenes with the Korean gang who are gone for very long chunks of time from the story.For everything that doesn't work with the picture though it's just a lot of fun seeing Eastwood as this character. I'm not sure it is his last performance, as I hope it wouldn't be (as an optimist I'd hope he could find just one more icon-defining-and-redefining role before he moves on or retires), but it's not at all a sucker's way out of his iconic place. That's the way Clint, like Walt, would like it.",7,5,12,23 December 2008
Hero," If you suspend all disbelief you'll like it, maybe even love it, despite some confusion in the film's structure
","Hero, translated here in the states as Ying xiong, is the kind of film that must've seemed either one of the great post-modern epics for their country (called 'Our Land' the film tells us), or a flamboyant, ultra-dramatized version of the true events. At the least, Hero is helmed by a talented painter of the canvas, Zhang Yimou (responsible for the classic Raise the Red Lantern, a film about repression in Chinese society), who in-between and sometimes during the highly stylized (in the new Crouching Tiger movement of getting the characters flying high in the air as they fight), gives splendorous colors and landscapes, faces, settings, and moods. Along with cinematographer Christopher Doyle, at the least Hero aspires to a technical mastery, and it does work most of the time. By keeping the story in a tale of legend amid what was based in truth, the characters can believably be suited in the palettes Yimou puts them in.What gets the film down, for me at least, is that it's not entirely comprehensible on a first viewing. It may help it to some that it's dense and achieving a level of wonder in the non-linear structure, sometimes I didn't know who was dead and who wasn't, and perhaps in the Rashomon sense it was effective. But to lose track of the story when the technical side is trying to be moving, by default, creates style over substance. This isn't helped by the practically emotionless Jet Li as the 'nameless' one, and with a constant use by the director of slow-motion in the fight scenes. The supporting cast gets put to some good use, which includes such Chinese film heavy-weights like Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, and Zhang Ziyi (the actor who played Broken Sword, Tony Leung, may have been the best out of them from my perspective). And by the end, the story thrusts them into the reign of the tragedy, and it almost becomes like another character, one that isn't completely honed as it should've or could've been.When I walked out of the theater I knew that despite not being all in tune with the story (as it moved around I knew where it was going and not at the same time- a few scenes did make me start to lose interest until the next fight scene came) Hero asks to be seen more than once (maybe both times of cable, no?). On the level of the pure imagination, the film aspires to something it reaches, and it is in and of itself an epic. I just don't think it is a great one. The string sections by Itzhak Perlman are a nice touch, by the way.",7,0,2,28 August 2004
The Hurt Locker," 'In Iraq, you're dead'
","Early in the film, one soldier says this to another who is just starting on the job of being in a particular unit in Iraq. One might think it a lame line, and it's even mentioned as such right after the character says it. But it is, actually, accurate in a way. The characters, both the soldiers and those who engage in the suicide bombings (whether all willing or totally against in some small cases), are like the living dead, living through the dead that is, every day and every second. It wears down minds and souls, and it sets apart personalities. Some have to stay professionals, others get blown to bits at a second's notice for just not hustling ass or, perhaps, just standing around not on constant alert. Kathryn Bigalow's film is most exceptional at a level of pure suspense, but there's this underlying feeling too, of what this kind of combat does to a person, that isn't underestimated.Her film is lean and mean. I don't know for certain whether or not it's accurate to all of the details on the streets and in the desert. Some others have already complained about the lack of authenticity (just look at the IMDb negative comments to give some perspective on the inundation of critical praise from the press). While I can figure Bigalow and her writer did their homework, that's not even what makes the film so palpable and worthwhile. It's creating a sense of what it is to be there, the tension that is completely unpredictable even when all appears to be going right. It's essentially about a bomb squad, a unit that goes around checking out and (hopefully) disarming bombs that have been laid out. The hand-held camera and jittery zoom isn't done for ill-used effect (this isn't, for example, Public Enemies again); not a shot in these moments are wasted, and it gives a new urgency to the 'ticking time bomb' scenario that actually means something here as opposed to other sources in TV and movies (24 anyone?) And it's not without some good dosage of characterization as well. True, Bigalow paints with some broad strokes, at least at first; there's the strong-minded leader Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), who pushes down his fear with his professional sniper eye, the weaker link of the group who tries to hold it together but just can't keep going on with it, Eldridge, (Brian Geraghty), and rounding it up is Jeremy Renner as James, the 'adrenaline junkie.' It would be easy to say James is the antagonist of the group, and I was fully expecting him to be painted as two-dimensional at best. But if anything he's given the most dimension of anyone (compared to him, in fact, Geragthy is given much less to do except to look frightened, not always a bad thing), as we see him break down over little things that turn bigger, like with the 12 year old kid selling DVD's, or his estranged relationship with his ex-wife and little boy. And on top of this, Renner is simply electrifying in the role, going all over the place emotionally but never missing a beat. It's one of those unforgettable characters in recent war movies.Bigalow also has other tricks up her sleeve casting wise, such as giving 'name' actors parts that aren't actually on screen for very long (this isn't quite a spoiler exactly, the three big ones are Morse, Fiennes and Pearce). And as far as person-to-person drama goes, there are some startling moments, such as that drunken fight between James and Sanborn. So with that covered, with the characters in these situations given that sense of danger at any moment anyway (stray bullets can fly through the barracks, of course, as mentioned just in passing), it's the big sequences that steal the show. In particular is a sniper-fire scene, where the bomb unit stops to help a British jeep with a spare-tire fix only to come under sudden fire from miles away. Rarely does one jump and feel such itching tension in one's seat in this scene and, oddly enough, that turns into a long scene where characters have to wait, at the ready at their snipers, sometimes having to do things simply as getting enough fluids into the system. One is reminded of the sniper sequence in Full Metal Jacket and, as high praise indeed, this is just as good if not given fuller dimension with its equal intensity and patience.The Hurt Locker isn't always an easy film to take, and it shouldn't be. It's an in-the-zone motion picture where you never are quite sure about the outcome, except that in the end everyone will be more or less f***ed for life even when they get out. They might not even know it, but there may be that moment in a cereal isle, staring down at endless boxes and brands, and the derangement of the senses comes through thick as smoke. Powerful stuff, and one of the director's best in a career of lean/mean (smart) action pictures.",10,8,24,11 July 2009
No Man's Land," One of the Best Pictures of the Year, shattering and brilliant
","First time featue film writer/director/composer Danis Tanovic's No Man's Land is a great example of a war satire, though it is so realistic it shimmers on the edge of reality and fiction to the point where you just sit back in a form of awe.  Tanovic depicts the nature of men in war, nothing new, but the way it's done here is what's remarkable.  Here, a Bosnian (Djuric) hides out in a trench from Serbian fire, only to have 2 Serbians (one being Bitorajac) come into the trench to see if there are survivors. The bosnian kills one of them, and leaves Bitorajac in the trench with him. This causes a conflict with the men having to wait on the UN to get them out, and to help out Djuric's best friend (played with heartbreaking accuracy by Sovagovic) who is on a land mine that will explode if he moves off it.A tad cliched, but when it's a satire, it might need to be a little cliched, especially with a war movie.  Still, Tanovic has created a film that breaks a lot of the boundaries of many war movies and in it has made a remarkable work.  The last shot is pitch perfect.  A+",10,3,7,20 December 2001
Moulin Rouge!," well made, if still a spectacle ultimately
","Buz Luhrmann's Moulin Rogue is a good example of a film where having songs in it repeatedly and sung by the cast isn't distracting from the rest of the film (unlike the recent Dancer in the Dark). In fact, considering the frenzied pace, razor sharp camera cuts and settings, songs do this film some good. Moulin Rogue, as we learn was a very big and flashy dancing and practically insane place for really entertaining people (notice the sarcasm). Enter in a dreaming writer (Ewan McGregor) as he soon find that his most important philosophy (I believe in love, he states) is put to a test with the lovely and tempting Satine (Nicole Kidman). Then the usually noticeable convention happens in the story, but that's not what gives this film it's high rating.Luhrmann presents a musical that hasn't really been seen or heard before. He uses a Technicolor film approach, mixed with contemporary songs (some might remember last month's Knight's Tale tried this trick) and 50's dance numbers. It is actually quite a stupendous spectacle once you surpass the flaws. Kudos to the cast, of course, but also to Lurhmann, editor Jill Bilcock, cinematographer Donald McAlphine and production designer Catherine Martin for making such a different piece. By the way, in case anyone is wondering, this is the only film where you will see (originaly it was) Roxanne turned into a Broadway type of production number.",6,1,4,3 June 2001
X-Men: Apocalypse," sweet dreams are not made of this
","X-Men: Apocalypse, where we get the X-Men another full ten years later (also still have barely aged a day since First Class, but whatever, movie), and now the stakes are GLOBAL! It's time for a blue-skinned Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie villain steps up to bat to take over everything to 'cleanse' humanity, and take on his four horsemen/women for this apocalypse while the X-Men sort of race to stop him (I say sort of since they get captured at one point).This movie is... a movie, that exists. It's the textbook definition of an 'eh' experience. I didn't hate it, there's actors in it still trying and working their butts off to dig deep into characters they've been in for three movies now (McAvoy and Fassbender come off best, Lawrence is sometimes in it and sometimes not), and there's new people (Sophie Turner for one) who are trying as well. But what they're given is... minuscule, too little, and too undercooked. This is the kind of movie that features both Beethoven's 7th symphony/2nd movement and it made me think of the Nic Cage flick Knowing and how *that* used the song better (which wasn't much at all), and then uses at another point Metallica's 'Four Horsemen' because, hey, title! These may sound like small points, but they're what I latched on to while watching this. It's a plot that is both stupid and rehashed not only from other X-Men movies but from other movies in general. The End of the World OMG scenario doesn't cut it anymore (not that Fox will stop if Independence Day 2 is any indication, but I digress). And unlike the previous two films which were rich in character and motivation and using the period they're set in - 62 and 73, the height of Cuba and Nixon - there's not much here to distinguish it from the 80's aside from the obvious Thriller jacket and Star Wars reference (which is so out of place I'd wish that Kevin Smith could come and smack Singer across the face).Here's my analogy for X-Men: Apocalypse: if you're the kind of person who likes to go to Burger King, and you haven't had a Whopper in a little while and you go to the local Burger King and get a Whopper that's been sitting around for half an hour - so it's not inedible for it's not cooked fresh - and you eat it and go 'Well, it's a Whopper,' and don't ask them to cook you a fresh one and take what you've received and don't ask for anything else... well, you might be fine with this movie. But it's the textbook definition of a movie with a ton of great actors without a good story.Also, if you happen to love Oscar Isaac as he's one of the most magnetic personalities in American film right now... this is a stunning low for him as a character to play. He has NOTHING here, compared to this Poe Dameron in Star Wars is Michael Corleone as far as complexity goes.",4,34,68,29 May 2016
Slap Shot," This is a f**** the world punk rock movie and a wonderful sports comedy.
","Fierce and unapologetic, helmed by a tough mother like George Roy Hill and scripted by a woman (yeah!), this is a hockey movie for those who love hockey and also those who have no idea what hockey is much about aside from the fights- and believe me there are lots and lots and lots of fights here. When it ended my wife (who has become a hockey fanatic over the past few years) commented on how it's a movie where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts: it's not a terribly quotable film, but you leave having gone through a full experience.Slap shot is grimy and sometimes very sleazy, and with the exception of Harry S Truman from Twin speaks, the Chiefs follow coach/player Paul Newmans lead: we got to get people seeing this team again and win some (bleep) games, so he goes for a sort of nihilistic approach: screw it! Get in fights! Rile up the refs! Get the audience involved! Then maybe the team won't be folded and shut down by the owner but rather sold to some Floridian.There even is an arc for Newmans character somewhere in the midst of what is a precursor to Animal House, a raucously anarchic studio comedy, only they're out of college and working class dudes who don't mind getting some teeth knocked out or getting a lip sewn up post (or dying) game-play. It's extremely slight though and if anything the players overall desire to get the hell out of their current state (i.e. they try to play 'old fashioned' hockey without uh violence and then when they hear from blustery p'd-off old Strother Martin there are NHL scouts in the stands, that's all that registers from the managers motivational speech so BACK TO THE CREAMING THOSE BASTARDS!) makes it that much funnier.There are stretches here where the laughs aren't plenty - it's much a 70s movie that way - but much of this is so hysterically spot on because it is all about behavior. Sure, the players on their bus (plus some local girls following on another bus) mooning some angry rival team onlookers is one thing, and that can be funny. But Hill is smart as a director to let so much of it be about the personalities of these players - those three brother goons who play with their electric train set and seem more like one entity with three heads and pairs of glasses are a prime example - and also how Newman does a lot with just a look or a reaction, how he interacts with his friends girlfriend as she drives at top speeds in her van, how he is both 'don't give a f***' but giving a f*** at the same time for what counts.Did I mention how wonderful Newman is here? Kind of? I must say again that he is the heart and soul of this movie, a true star who continues (maybe at this point caps off) a career of anti establishment I-do-things-my-way forces of nature like the Hustler and Cool Hand Luke. He can be brash and crude as this guy, but damn is he charming and clever and a character only a complete stiff upper lipped being couldn't get behind.Slap Shot is a great comedy for the reason that we as the audience see all the truth that is there, in this case the dirty, foul mother and scabrous lives of (semi) professional hockey players, and that they are not in on the joke of themselves. And if my wife was somewhat correct that on a first viewing its not the most quotable thing ever, there's a constant energy to nearly every scene where the comedy is big and bold and brutal and unapologetic. I love that kind of comedy, and in a blue collar 70s milieu that is deep down, at the end of it all, political too (working class vs the rich, a town closing a plant so jobs gone, how will they go to hockey games, etc).",10,1,2,20 November 2016
Back to the Future Part III," A time traveling dolorian that runs on gas!
","I'm sorry to say this is the third best of the trilogy, which means it is at the bottom.  So I recommend to see either one of the first two if you want. But, that doesn't mean this film is a waste of time compared to other films.  For instance, this is a way to keep from watching CNN.  But seriously, this isn't all that bad, because for fans of westerns who want a chuckle, this is for you.  Or if you want to see Christopher Lloyd drunk. Sometimes funny, sometimes cute, usually overdone.  B+",7,3,11,14 July 2000
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," a momentary blight on good storytelling, vampires, and other things
","Watching the sequel to Twilight, New Moon, is like looking into a dark, scary vortex. Not because the movie is scary or the director creates a compelling mood or the characters are particularly creepy (at least in the way intended). Heavens, no. It's the vortex of a cinematic nightmare of unintentional hilarity tinged with boredom, a romance movie with no touching romance, a horror movie with no horror, a love story without the love - or, rather, there is love, but it's the kind that speaks to a time before the feminist movement actually did things meaningful. And the characters have no concerns, nothing that interests them or makes them anything outside of their one-dimensional (if that) parameters, aside from the push-pull bond with Bella, and some kind of organization called the Voldroi or something. Even the aspect of 'vampires' and 'werewolves' becomes bunk. This is PG-13 non-sex nonsense porn of a high order.The film picks up right where the first left off, a couple of months later and Bella and Edward are still together, dating and being all snug together, until at Bella's 18th birthday party she has a paper-cut and this sets off Edward's other hungry vampire relatives. So, because of this incident, he says he's leaving with the rest of the Cullen vampire family, without Bella. Why he does this entirely is made only by mild sense- mild being mumbling in the woods about 'You're not good for me, I can't be near you, blah blah', and this, of course, sends Bella into a tailspin. For three months she just stares out her window doing nothing except moping and having screaming-dream fits. This changes when she reconnects with the local Indian guy with the six-pack abs (believe me, they're shown quite often), who, as it turns out, is a werewolf.And other things happen too, like lots of 'adrenaline junkie' scenes like Bella jumping off a cliff, and (badly) riding a motorcycle, and then a whole big preposterous climax in Rome where the vampire council is meeting and more things happen like fates decided and yada yada. In New Moon there's a new director for all of this, Chris Weitz, and unlike Catherine Hardwicke he doesn't put a light blue sheen over the movie but makes it look just regular-tinted... this is probably his only real positive contribution. It's not that his direction is of the completely mind-boggling or cine-vomit variety of Michael Bay. Albeit, I must note, that his skills at direction action set-pieces is atrocious (in that slow-FAST-slow-slow-FAST-slow motion makes me pine for Zack Snyder's 300) and his creative decisions with the camera like Bela's waiting for three months (the 360 camera spin with title cards saying the month in case *outside the window seasons change* didn't clarify it) or just the blurry appearances of Edward in front of Bela to give her advice when he's not there, are haphazard at best.No, what makes this a badly directed film, most of all, is how he treats the script and his actors. This script, coming from a book by hack Stephanie Meyer, is just about the dumbest, mind-numbing and bloodless (no pun intended.. OK, some) from this year's lot of bad movies. Characters look and talk to each other without chemistry or anything that really makes them believable past their necessary stereotypes. Let's see; Bela: stuck-up and, to put it lightly, 'moody' girl with an obsession and without any direction aside from her crush; Edward: subtly (or just) psychologically abusive, without personality except for a crappy emo-kid imitation by Rob Pattinson; Jake: caring boyfriend-type whose face barely ever changes its expression, though a mullet was apparently harmed during the making of this movie. And the words given to them to speak ranges from hilariously stupid (so much so that you'll be laughing so much inside you may just cry) to painfully dull.New Moon, unless you're already a die-hard with the books, or someone who takes in hackneyed romance seriously, is actually quite boring for much of the time. This, too, was a huge problem with the first Twilight film, and in this case it kind of sneaks up on you. Watching scenes go by, particularly in the mid-section when hairless boys aren't transforming in a nano-second into werewolves and having fights- where's Rick Baker when you need him (?) oh, wait, he got a call on the common sense train to not get anywhere near it- there isn't much going on in terms of a developing story or characters that grow at all. By the end of the film all we get is where things were at the start of the film, only with the teaser (spoiler) that Edward and Bela may get married (!) And it cuts to black just to get an audience full of helpless girls and older women clamoring for more.The acting is stiff, the characters are depressive idiots and the craftsmanship from the cinematography to the music to everything else is bargain basement gussied up for a big-time blockbuster. There are two 'teams' for this movie, and no I don't mean the 'Team Jake' 'Team Edward' teams, silly gooses. There's the team of people who go for this sleazy and demoralizing claptrap, and those who don't. Suffice to say, I don't. At all. Cuss this franchise!",2,18,32,24 November 2009
La Grande Illusion," Thoroughly enjoyable, memorable characters and scenes, an early classic in humanist/prison escape films
","I can't deny that Jean Renoir has a genuine eye for human connectedness and moves his camera with a practical naturalness. The performances by the principal actors as well (Jean Gabin as the working-class Marechal, Pierre Fresnay as the eloquent Boieldieu, Marcel Dalio as the subtle and happy Rosenthal, and Erich von Stroheim as the un-mistakenly stiffest and suavest of movie prison wardens Captain von Rauffenstein) are on the money every step of the way. Perhaps my one problem (and it's not a big one) with The Grand Illusion is that despite it being made at a time when cinema, in particular sound cinema, was just starting out, there could've been better targets hit by Renoir. He hits on a mark with these prisoners as well as with the guards- these are regular people, caught up and made to feel like they're in the schoolyard with ruthless heads and rebellious minions. As a satire, for some reason, it works a lot better for me than a drama- at least at first.For example, when Marechal is in solitary in the first prison, this is a masterpiece of a scene in and of itself, and for some reason I wanted more moments like this. While this could be attributable to the fact that Renoir didn't film everything he had intended with his script (lack of budget one can assume), there are some expectations that weren't up to what could've been met. This may be variable from viewer to viewer, which is why this shouldn't deter those interested in seeing this - this is one of those POW films that's inspired others (i.e. Great Escape), but has a sort of spirit that's all it's own. On the other hand in what comes out when one takes more of a look- which Renoir allows through how watchable (in terms of just being able to not turn off the film once it starts) the drama does become integrated with the critical view of the characters and changing situation. It's almost TOO complex, if that's possible.One of the fantastic joys of Grand Illusion is how much there is life and energy in his scenes depicting the prisons of world war one. Like in a Fellini drama (which it may very well have inspired for the later Italian), there's a lot pf love for how cinema is made itself to get too depressed with the story & characters. And like in a neo-realist film, the dialog between the people is quite realistic and interesting. Some of the supporting characters/actions may seem odd to some new viewers, although one has to take into context the period. With an awesome cameraman (Christian Matras), finite music score by Joseph Kosma, and an escape scene that's almost as thrilling as what Darabont cooked up in Shawshank, Grand Illusion is deservedly so the first film released by the Criterion collection (DVDs), and is a suave, nice note in film history. AND, it definitely becomes better upon repeat viewings, as these characters become more familiar, as if we're in there in the prisons with these amicable, existential beings.",10,3,6,3 June 2004
The Illusionist," there's more potential than is really tapped into in the Illusionist
","The Illusionist is actually more than anything an actor's movie, which is a little ironic considering how much romantic sweep and movement there should be in the writing and directing. In terms of Neil Burger's direction, it's never really bad at all, and is very competent most of the time (aside from a couple of notable instances involving the 'soft focus' around the edges of the frame in flashbacks and one sex scene). The writing, however, is a little more lacking even if it's also never annoying or deterring from what's watchable in the film. But there's contrivances as well, through all that is supposed to be seen as complex and very intricate and exquisite. The latter of those can be tapped into in the period setting of early 20th century Vienna, and it's always professionally done. But there's something lacking to it as well- a real driving force through the romantic core of the story, and that supporting characters are more interesting than the main characters, almost in spite of the performances.And as mentioned, if there's any reason more than anything to see it it's for the acting, where Edward Norton makes a character who's own purpose and need in the film is very narrow (to make his illusions, but more than anything all for the possession and togetherness of another woman, played by Jessica Biel). As a child he, Eisenheim, and Sophie meet and fall in love, but are separated by the boundaries of class. Years pass, and she comes back into his life by chance, but now she has a suitor, a Prince played by the icy Rufus Sewell. When a certain tragedy befalls the situation of the Prince and his bride-to-be, this sets Eisenheim off into a whole new direction with his illusions (Norton often in a trembling, shocked trance look that is always convincing) by conjuring up lost souls. This the sets off Paul Giamatti's inspector character, and the ties become all the greater to what may become of the central question, however elusive it might seem.All of this might be even more compelling if the actual romantic plot felt stronger. But despite the impeccable skills of Norton, who makes this bland character driven and intuitive (his choices as an actor are very good here if not great), and the OK presence of Biel, their characters aren't as interesting as the tricks and leap-of-faith sized wonders that Eisenheim creates on the stage. If anything at times the film felt stronger and with a better purpose and strength with Giamatti on screen, as he is more than anything the part of the audience, trying to figure things out. By the end his own revelation is probably the biggest leap of all, almost Shyamalan-sized, yet I find his performance is what sticks with me as opposed to the twists and surprises thrown to the audience. It's almost as if the iron-clad conventions of the plot and the intensity, passion and creativity of what goes on in Eisenheim's total control battle it out for dominance. I'd recommend the Illusionist, but with some reservations that not the spectacular event that it might seem to be. Its got skill and tact and a very fine sensibility with Norton and Giamatti and even the dastardly done Prince by Sewell. Though at the same time it's really got nothing up its sleeve.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," not deep much at all, and it's happy that way- 'safe' doesn't necessarily mean terrible this time around
","Rise of the Silver Surfer is like a three-part cartoon version put back into live-action on Saturday morning for kids. If I was a kid, I think I might have responded more, if only because I knew there could be some cool toys to get. It's a shallow diversion of an entertainment spectacle, but as far as others out there go- notably the prior installment in the F4 series- it could go a lot worse. This time the stories focused on three points: stopping the total annihilation of the world from Galactus- a super-duper space being that comes on like the biggest hurricane, as a big lumbering marvel of visual fx; the problems of being close together between Reed Richards and Sue Storm, and the rift ego and the good of the group causes among the four; and the Silver Surfer, and his connection invariably to the previous villain Victor Von Doom.None of this, unlike a Spider-Man or Batman movie, is very psychologically complex or rounded in a kind of perpetually existential comic-book way. But this time it's not exactly dull in seeing how our main heroes interact (even Johnny Storm isn't entirely annoying this time, as there's a little development about his obviously narcissistic edge), and how the media buzz around them encroaches right behind the Surfer and Doom. There's even a very funny bachelor party scene- not too explicit for PG of course- including a drunk joke with the Thing and some guy with an afro. If there are fun enough moments, it doesn't mean the flaws are there, even for one (like myself) who's never read a Silver Surfer comic.Doug Jones, who plays the Surfer, provides about a tenth of the skill and imagination he brought to his roles in Pan's Labyrinth, but it goes without saying that he's not given a really impressive villain to play. Hardcore fans be damned, this is a very simplistic creation, for the film anyway, where he goes about on his surfboard in T-1000 form (minus the knives). It's also a distraction to hear Surfer's few words spoken by Laurence Fishburne, who provides nothing except a deep-sounding vocal to a practically expressionless radioactive force. Doom, on the other hand, just provides a kind of extension of his egomania from the first film, only this time compounded by a devilish plan that makes no sense ('hey, let me ride on this board to mess around with F4 while the world will soon come to an end, that's smart'). It doesn't help matters that Tim Story, more often than not, is still coasting along as director, offering little by way of visual prowess or much understanding of what rises comic book adaptations to possible great art.But all this aside, I'm kind of not disappointed with Rise of the Silver Surfer on the whole. Notwithstanding another movie in the franchise that probably won't get any better, it's a reckless fun-house that keeps buoyant spirits and may have the fans of the original comics more pleased than with the first outing. At the least, there's an uproarious moment during a Chinese wedding, and maybe one of Stan Lee's best cameos to date ('It's Stan Lee!'). 5.5/10",5,2,6,19 June 2007
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," a tale pure goodness, and the inanities of greed, in human beings, set in Miyazaki's amazing world
","Before Princess Mononoke, which is still for me Hayao Miyazaki's greatest work, he made this film, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which like that other later film addressed issues that are paramount for the filmmaker: the environment, and the Earth, and how human beings can have highs and lows in attention to it. On the one hand Miyazaki gives us who is perhaps one of the purest heroes in any animated film, Japanese or otherwise, with Nausicaa as a woman who doesn't want killing on any side, and knows that there can be some peace with the environment of the world. Her greatest strengths end up coming out in various ways, like when she goes to stop the Ohm, the big beetle-insects that are the largest 'threat' (threat in quotes because it depends on the reaction of the two sides- the Tolmekian and the Pejite- and how either one inflames the reaction of the Ohm)- and in her general attitude to killing and violence. It's a fragile world, and she's perhaps one of only a few, and the only one willing to 'go the distance', to understand how what remains underground, what can't be seen, can make a difference. She's like a big action hero for preservationists and pacifists, but it's such a strongly defined character that the basic qualities come out wonderfully, like when she has to contend with her obvious emotional reaction to her father being slain (almost a Star Wars 'force' moment if you ask me).So as she represents the good, there is the other side, which is represented by not necessarily the outright evil, even if the Tolmekian find the only way to combat anything is through warrior actions, but by ignorance and greed. It's not always as simple as that, and one could see a little dimension to the princess Kushuna, but even there the essentials get burned down to not just Miyazaki's points, but what works for the structure of classic fantasy. It might be tricky for Miyazaki to balance out his message of peace and understanding with what should be a sensational entertainment of a world 1000 years from now following an apocalypse; it treads the line, as Mononoke did, of becoming incoherent with the message and the manipulation of the audience. But Miyazaki happens to be intelligent enough to trust the audience on the front of the message, and so he puts up his film in his usual thrust of indelible, one-of-a-kind images and exciting action. I especially liked seeing the Ohm themselves, one by one looking like even more detailed, nuanced versions of the Garthem in the Dark Crystal. Or in the sky-flying scenes, where the clouds are like unique formations that can't really be of the world we're in, but are in this world nonetheless that Miyazaki forges from classic mythology, reinterpretations of forests and insects, and post-apocalyptic technology out of a high-powered junk-yard.And on top of this, as a word of note, this grandiose (in a good way) kind of epic work is supplanted with a better than expected voice cast- for the English language dub on the new DVD. They help back up the pieces of Miyazaki's world where there is some science fiction, but not in a fully compiled sense (if anything it's sort of like a 'used' science fiction world like Blade Runner, in part I mean). There's also some moments in the classical style, of a hero coming into her own that might seem too reminiscent of other movies. But Nausicaa is backed up by several cool supporting characters, like the equally heroic Lord Yuru, and the conflicted Pejite Asbel who has to choose the greater good (and common sense, in the Miyazaki form) over his tribe's priorities. By the end, it actually left me like Totoro did with a huge, well-earned smile on my face, due to it being one of those happy endings that is so unlikely, yet is done as if there could be no other way in Miyazaki's universe. It's fresh and sublime anime, and the master of Studio Ghibli at one of his best.",10,9,11,5 March 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A story of a man's life, told backwards, with both lots of good and some not-so-good at all
","David Fincher is a truly gifted storyteller, probably one of the most talented and inspired that have come from that much hallowed age-group of early 1960s born American filmmakers (i.e. Soderbergh, Tarantino, Linklater) that rose to prominence in the 1990s with their groundbreaking work. It's a shame then that one year after directing a picture like Zodiac, where with a 157 minute running time (almost the same as this film) not a minute was wasted, he should have a film like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button: filled with so much promise, delivering in some brilliant bits, it's overloaded with a particular storytelling device that flat out doesn't work and doesn't help mask what also doesn't work in the actual story itself.I say this admiring this picture, admiring Fincher's work, the cinematographer immensely, the make-up artists and especially the visual fx crew (who, by leaps and bounds, should get the Oscar this year if it means much in those circles), in criticizing it heavily. This is one of those pictures one *wants* to work wonderfully so much that its bloated length is the cause of a central problem: the script. While not entirely the fault of co-adapter of Fitzgerald's story as a quasi-remake of Forrest Gump (the similarities are many, too many for here to note), the framing device used to wrap the story of Benjamin Button around - his story told from a diary he wrote read by his daughter (I'll get to that later) to her mother Daisy, who lies dying in a hospital bed in the middle of an oncoming hurricane (also get to this later) - is relentless and pointlessly repetitive. Imagine how annoying it would have been if Winona Ryder's old-lady version of her character from Edward Scissorhands kept popping up to tell the story and you'll get the idea of how it a) just is mundanely acted overwrought by Blanchett and Ormond, and b) it doesn't progress the story save for one or two of the flash-forwards.And as for the actual story of Benjamin Button, born on the night of the end of World War 1 as a baby aged 90 years old and aging backwards until he's a little boy with old-man dementia and Alzheimer's? It is, as you watch it, pretty entertaining, at best engrossing, and provides the viewer with so many rich ideas that are only followed upon a couple of times. Button lives a fairly uncomplicated life for someone who should be, by the look of the trailer, to have something extraordinary happen: he becomes a sailor when he turns 17, he sails the world bit, befriends and has an affair with a Brit (Swinton), does some minor combat duty in the Navy in WW2, and then has an on-off again relationship with Daisy, and then that is mostly the rest of the picture.Like in Forrest Gump, to make a quick comparison, Button has some of that whimsical fortune put upon him, brought on by a slightly sad circumstance: instead of Gump becoming a shrimp boat captain by a promise of a dead war-buddy, Button is abandoned by a father who runs a big Button-making corporation (Button's Buttons, cute, huh?), to which Benjamin is the sole heir. Only, we don't see him work at the factory, he sells it at one point for extra cash, and it doesn't have much prominence in the story. Maybe Roth or Fincher or whomever thought buttons wouldn't be very interesting to the story. But, hey, why not try it? This is a case where the parts are better than the whole, if not greater. Some sequences are brilliant, really wonderful, like Benjamin's explanation of all the clockwork-type of events that lead up to one of those life-changing accidents for Daisy, or when we see Benjamin walk for the first time, or even just simple things like bits of montages. It also goes without saying it's a technical marvel, as mentioned, and is gorgeous to look at - just as, I should add, it's two stars, who give very good performances (albeit not as good as Jesse James or Bob Dylan last year respectively), as people who have to cope with aging with each other, and have to grapple with death and the lingering sense of oncoming loss that leads to a decision 3/4 of the way through the picture that should be better handled, but isn't.The way I'm describing it, from the daughter 'twist' that shouldn't be one at all and is handled like one of those mean contrivances in movies that is unbecoming of a production like this let alone Fincher's, or the Katrina angle (which I wager was Brad Pitt's idea, noble but out of place), or just little things in the story that don't work, you'd think I would rate this lower. But it is a kind of flawed marvel, a work of mainstream movie art that is tainted by an excess of unnecessary storytelling in a film that requires that it be strong throughout. It takes a lot of guts to pull off a picture like this, and I'm glad Fincher made it. That it's not something I'd watch ever again from start to finish goes without saying.",7,4,9,30 December 2008
Transformers," as far as empty-headed summer blockbusters go, this is the empty-headiest!
","For some Michael Bay can do no wrong. For others, he's the anti-Christ in cinema today. I'm nowhere near the former, though maybe not exactly the latter either. He does what he does and his films make money (with the exception of the Island, ironically since that film is somewhat more watchable than most). So he's a safe bet for the studios to do what he does, which are big, noisy, shiny, and completely empty-headed popcorn action pictures where the special effects triumph overwhelmingly over any human presence. This has never been more relevant a criticism than in Transformers, even if it might not an abomination like Pearl Harbor, or like Armageddon where its awfulness dawns on the viewer after a first somehow impressive viewing.Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I wasn't a 'fan' of the transformers by much when I was a kid (which, of course, is the best time to become a fan- they're cars that turn into fighting alien robots after all), and never watched the animated movie. So it wasn't a priority to seek out a film version directed by Michael Bay. After finally seeing the movie, it's a reasonable conclusion that it has either found its audience or never will. For those who might love a big, clunky, overlong and densely-plotted flick where the humans are given dumb-ass dialog in lieu of overpowering visual/special FX that moves at the speed of delirious light, it hits the nail on the head. For those who want, er, substance, look elsewhere. It's a film based upon a *toyline*, after all.So, saying that it *is* empty-headed and silly may almost be a plus for some. And, in a sense, for Bay this has now become his forte. And indeed, needless to say, when one turns off their logic centers of the cerebral cortex and tries the 'go-with-the-flow' nature of the action sequences, of those giant alien robots fighting ridiculously with other robots all over some cube, it almost is kind of fun. Almost. But as soon as one is stuck with the human beings, characters like Shia Labouf's character, it's a little torturous when it's clear that Bay can't direct actors (it's not that Labouf is even not talented, as evidenced in the latest Indiana Jones picture). And there are a lot of scenes with these silly humans, far more silly than those with the robots, who work on a guilty pleasure level of excitement even for a viewer as reluctant to appreciate the finer nature of the movie's appeal.Here's the bottom line, folks. It's a huge fantasy movie that has no real discernible plot, that often invokes 'the world wide web' and 'ebay' like they're sacred objects. It relies on dialog that any other filmmaker (well, maybe not Spielberg, who produced the movie) would find mostly laughable. It's cinematography is shiny, like an overpriced Christmas tree. It's got hot new young talents like Megan Fox, used mostly for eye candy. And Bay even tries to throw in 'real' actors, like Jon Voight and, for a few cool moments, John Tuturro. And the work put into designing the robots by the VFX animators is commendable. Transformers, for me, isn't a total disaster, but a sign of the times, of marketing and packaging for a young and seemingly hungry crowd for loud, stupid action to lumber along at a frantic, uneven pace. In short, it's Michael Bay, as clear as alien-robot-transformer crystals.",4,6,14,10 June 2008
Men in Black II," More protection from the scum of the universe.
","Barry Sonnenfeld, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith return for the inevitable (money wise anyway) sequel to the 1997 hit, and it unfortunately falls flat all too many times to be ignored.  The film does contain impressive visual effects, such as the entire civilization in K's locker, or the worms and other aliens, and there is some fun in starting the film with K (Jones) working as a postmaster, and in having Johnny Knoxville with two heads, but it's overall dumbed down and Smith offers mostly lukewarm or generic jokes (ie on the car K and J go into after they get flushed into times square- actually, it came with a black dude, but he kept on getting pulled over).

Magic Mike XXL," entertaining dialog and some dances, but... story? character development?
","Magic Mike XXL in a way is like the films that Adam Sandler has been making with his buddies over the past several years (think the Grown Ups movies, Blended, even Jack & Jill), where, and Sandler's admitted this, it's really an excuse to hang out with his buddies while going on basically a paid vacation. The difference in this case of a Magic Mike sequel is that there IS some actual craft going on, with an artist like Steven Soderbergh behind the lens and in the cutting room. While he is not credited as director - this is currently during his hiatus as a full-on helmer (I hasten to say retirement) - his fingerprints are still all over Gregory Jacobs' first stab at making a Hollywood feature.The camera and editing can get experimental here, which is good and intriguing; one might not expect things like low, natural light (see the Tatum/Amber Heard meeting scene on the beach at night), but it is here in a Magic Mike sequel and that is appreciated, as is the use of light and how Soderbergh cuts his dance numbers together. They don't move ever TOO fast or kinetically, and he uses cranes and other motions really well. Considering that this is, in a manner of speaking, an action movie, the action is presented reasonably well.The problem then? In lieu of the character Dallas being written off (i.e. McConaughey couldn't get brought on back post-Oscar, I suspect), Tatum's titular character rejoins for the One Last Time scenario, and goes with his 'Male Entertainer' buddies on a road trip. So, first off, no McConaughey, so what can be made up for it? Jada Pinkett Smith in a sexy but thankless role as a would-be MC, and Donald Glover basically doing his, uh, Donald Glover/Childish Gambino thing, and though somewhat putting on the stripper-thing is really not that physique. The other thing is more crucial: there's no story. Or really much character development. Like, at all.Oh, sure, things happen, and Mike has his moments with each character (oh, look, his phone to do all his work stuff is thrown out the window, as are all the uh, wait, all the old costumes, won't they need some of those, whatever). And there are some funny set pieces; the one that takes the cake for me involves the character played by Joe Manganiello in a convenience store where he does an over-the-top dance to a Backstreet Boys song to just get the cashier to smile. However, all of the hijinks can't mask how little there really is here - and how stretched it becomes at a near two-hour running time. It feels its weight and length especially in the mid-section, mainly in over-long scenes at a Male-Stripper party at night and a chance meeting with Andie McDowell's character (albeit she is one of the better actors here in her all too brief and kind of on its own intriguing scene).Ironic that Tatum gets a sorta, kinda, half-assed love interest here played by Amber Heard, and though less developed than the romantic angle in the previous film she carries more charisma and talent than Mike's flame in the first film (also written off for the sequel). She is practically shoe-horned in to whatever thin narrative is here, and yet among the characters she does stand out in her naturalistic way (at least as much as the script allows, which... is quite a bit actually). So there's a lot of male bonding here, some fine dialog that allows for funny jabs and even small, if minute, moments of insight... but ultimately, it lacks what a movie NEEDS to actually get one invested.It may have more dancing than the first movie - I didn't put a stop-watch to time it out, but it felt like bigger numbers, certainly with this movie's climax which lasts a good twenty minutes, albeit meant to be a showstopper and it tries hard - but Soderbergh's presence as someone who could corral the story and characters together into something more interesting is lacking. Kudos to him sticking around to make the look consistent and compelling though, if he didn't do more for Jacobs.",5,2,8,12 July 2015
Coco," Near classic Pixar with terrific music and a deep and moving message on memory
","Coco is a very, very good movie that earns its heart about two-thirds of the way in - a little later than one may be used to given this is the director of Up - and has imagination pouring in every little mark of animation and detail. It's also the rare movie by this studio to be an animated musical, of a sort, and it is ingrained in the DNA of the thing- I thought it would be about something as simple (and still important) as music. That would have been enough. I got more than that, chiefly an inquiry through drama about what memory means in existential terms. Yeah, I didn't expect that quite either, but then again it IS the land of the dead we're dealing with here.It is one thing to think deeply about what a life means and the death that everyone faces. The real terror is not having anything beyond this plane of existence; this world of the undead skeletons snd spirit animals is comforting ultimately since, naturally, there is a place after we die that we can reunite with others and be merry and so on. But what if you are gone and... That is it? Mexican culture (and this goes for other cultures too) has another idea about the afterlife, hence the Day of the Dead (Dios lis muertos), than we typically think of. But functionally it is this version of heaven that is a bit, uh, funkier, cooler, more colorful, less uh... White. The main conflict is deceptive here. I think what keeps it from full greatness for me is that Miguel is a bit too typical of one of these animated characters, or just in any of these 'I wanna do this with my life' 'No you can't! Family!' 'Bah! No!' Etc stories. Just this past summer the underrated Patti Cakes had that basic premise in gritty rap. This also has to include, as these stories do, the old 'dont meet your heroes' maxim, in this case with Ernesto De La Cruz, the Mexican equivalent of an Elvis. So while one might think this is where the movie will be going, what throws the plot an excellent monkey wrench is Hector, a gangly undead guy who comes on like he'll be another in a long line of helpful but, again, conventional comedic side kicks (this world's Genie). The power of Coco, past its inspired look and immersive world and its solid aims at humor (ie the wonderful surrealistic scene where the female assistant to De La Cruz makes her Dali-style sets), is that Hector, not Miguel, is the heart of the movie. It should be too jammed full of revelations by the end of the second act (and like other Pixae, this *is* very 3-act structure, and thats fine, they know how to do it well), maybe taking its cues slightly from Telenovelas for dramatic emphasis. But without revealing too much, as you should go in knowing little story reveal wise as pissible, Hector emphasizes the main song of the movie, 'Remember Me,' and it makes a profound point. Memory is for the living after all - why have a cemetery at all or a memorial like done every Day of the Dead otherwise - and it's another one of those times like Inside Out where a characters existence carries total, paramount importance. Oh, and if you don't cry (as my wife did), you'll smile, genuinely, from the commitment to its emotional outreach. Coco isn't in my top grouping of Pixar films but it's only due to a minor feeling of familiarity. Its strengths are no less though than classic Pixar: amazing and deeply- drawn characters, unforgettable designs, and that is about something at a time when a lot of animation storytellers think having characters dance and tart is enough. This wants you to laugh and cry and sometimes be genuinely surprised, and if you buy the soundtrack that's icing on the cake.",9,1,5,1 December 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," a big mega-hit blockbuster... and other things
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs took me by surprise. I went in on a near-whim - or, in other words, very positive critical buzz and the word of some specific critics I trust. As it turns out, it's got nowhere near the mastery of storytelling of Pixar's Up, nor the kind of cult-movie ambition of the sleeper 9 by Shane Acker. No, but it is by far the funniest animated movie to come out this year, maybe just as funny as Kung-fu Panda from last year. The directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, treat the source material as a pure jumping off point (a 10 page short story for kids done in a captivating and unusual style for a children's book), and it just get completely crazy from about five minutes (or just minute-one) on. And while it is probably more for kids, if you're an adult- or just a dude in his 20's with fond memories of Rocko's Modern Life and Animaniacs, it will do more than just make you smile. You'll be laughing, a lot.It just takes absurdism to heights that can't be topped, at least this week. The main idea is that Flint Lockwood is an inventor, usually of stuff that works but not on a grand enough scale (like spray-on shoes and a voice-defibrillator or something that is able to make his monkey Steve express his thoughts like 'HUNGRY HUNGRY!'), and he one day invents a device that can use radiation and water to make up any food programmed in the system. It needs energy though, so after a (botched?) attempt at a power station, Flint's machine get launched up in the air to the clouds, and from there weather and purely unnatural events cause perfectly edible Cheeseburgers to rain down everywhere. From there, Flint's semi-career takes off, as well as the courting of a weather-girl, Sam Sparks, who secretly was one (gasp) a nerd.Oh there's so much craziness here that one can't describe it. That is, unless, you are already on a high of candy or soda and can relate to a scene like when a frustrated policeman (Mr. T - yes, Mr. T) wants Flint to do something special for his son's birthday, and the next day it's an entire neighborhood of ice cream - which then goes into a snow-fight of ice cream, and snow angels of ice cream, and Flint's first ever participation in a snow-fight where he practically slaughters the kids with his hard-hitting ice-cream-ball accuracy. Or that monkey, Steve, or those rat-birds Flint invented years ago that roam the beaches and town like Hitchcock-Bird parodies, or the Mayor (voiced wonderfully by Bruce Campbell, didn't recognize him at all), or just little things like Flint's dad's bushy eyebrows and mustache ('Look in my eyes when you say that,' he says at one point). Did I mention the romantic jello mold or the bad puns like when chicken drumsticks rain to with Sam replies, 'Poultry in motion!' There's much more to get into, not least of which the big big BIG climax of the movie, which starts to roll into Godzilla territory with how insane it gets. And, more often than not, the jokes are more sophisticated than one might expect, and flew over more than a few of the kid's heads (not to say some jokes are more squared right at kids specifically, which is fine). One of these, 'Let's Diem that Carpe,' work almost a few seconds after the joke is told, but a lot of them are just purely visual gags. And even more than Up, which had its share of laughs, 'Meatballs' cashes in on the whole visual cache of raining food, and all of the varieties, and the truly original idea of having a monkey on a flying car fighting evil gummi bears. Oh yes, it's one of those movies, and if you're just after ridiculously hungry imagery, this is the place to go. It's a vibrant and imaginative cartoon, loaded with gags, a little bit of heart, and some predictability. If I had a kid I'd make him/her see it with me twice - even if they were fine with just the once.",8,4,15,18 September 2009
1917," In the 'it's alright' trenches
","Sam Mendes in 1917 gives us his variation on the old adage, 'if you think you're going through hell, keep going,' and for all of the given technical prowess - and a 70 year old Roger Deakins showing with a big grin that he's still got one of the most massive cinematography you-know-whats in the industry - I didn't feel much while watching this, except the occasional 'oof' or 'ugh' (usually when seeing some of the first dead bodies and rats). It's a conceptual piece that means to be a major statement on the horrors of war, and it only reminds me that the films about war that have stayed with me more than any are the ones that provide visceral and complicated characters FIRST, craft wizardry SECOND (or at least concurrently).I thought at some point I might compare it to how a war-like video game works (I dont have a lot of experience playing these sorts of first-person shooters, Im just going by assumption), and to Mendes's credit he tries to slow things down here and there so it isnt all thrill-a-minute action and spectacle. But it does carry that sense of the mission these two are on and the sort of 'stuff' that happens is more interesting than getting to know them (and when we briefly do, it's unremarkable, maybe a sign of why Mendes doesn't usually write his own films).It's a somewhat precarious position to be in as one in the audience, since objectively I know what everyone on the crew did to make this come off, from the art direction to the props to how goddamn realistically-based the camera is (or I should say like 80% of the time), yet by the end it means to lay an emotional punch to the gullet, and I just didn't connect.Maybe some will, or maybe some will be even more bothered by what is clearly, as far as elevator pitches go, an attempt to one-up Kubrick with Paths of Glory (I van almost hear Mendes in his head as he shoots this going, 'hah, take that and your trench tracking shots!') via the near-one take approach of Rope. But, again, those films had scripts that were engaging completely on the scale of what horrors human beings do to one another on an individual scale, with the system as a cudgel, not to mention enormously moving performances (same with another film that did this far better, Birdnlman, for its theatricality). This is kind of a... Forced-Poetic idea of a tragic story, impeccably made but hollow at its heart.For all the impressive filmmaking brio on display, I unfortunately have a sinking feeling this may win best director and best picture at the Oscars not for exactly being a 'best' but for being the 'most' film (or trying to be). And as for it being an anxiety-filled experience... Folks, c'mon, Uncut Gems is in a theater right next door to this one at your local cineplex .",7,32,74,10 January 2020
Sing Street," a real sweet heart of a movie, but with actual edge and, most importantly, good rock songs!
","This movie reminds me how much I miss music videos from a time when all a band needed was themselves and a good looking chick. And with the exception of that syrupy ballad near the end. Sincere and heartfelt in the best ways, genuinely funny (at times), and has a great message for young people who want to find away to express the bad things going on their lives. Maybe not the most original message, but it's told well and these young actors are good at selling it (I also liked the main kid's brother very much, sort of like an Irish Chris Pratt from Parks & Rec).One odd thing... what was with that cutaway as Sing Street was practicing for the first time where the one guy's mother goes into her bedroom to use a vibrator(?) We also never see her again. I guess I should accept the mystery but... uh what?",8,4,6,26 November 2016
Rules of Engagement," Jackson and Jones
","William Friedkin's Rules of Engagement is good, if your a war veteran fan. I am not, so in this film I looked for some other things, like acting.  I found that and it was good.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson work very well together as Vietnam veteran Colonels who are caught in a cross-fire when Col.  Terry Childers (Jackson) is accused of ordering the murder of 83 Yemenese during a confrontation.  He asks Col.  Hodges (Jones) to act as his attorney.  During the trial there is some really great courtroom drama. This and the acting (and Friedkin's directing) are what make this film OK. But that's it.  The backplots aren't though out and the supporting characters (i.e. Ben Kingsley) aren't in the movie as much as I wanted. Still, It's OK.  B",7,0,3,14 April 2000
Pi," not about math, but about obsession, paranoia, searching for answers never found
","Pi is the kind of movie I wished I could've seen in one of those dank art-house movie theaters in New York City, as it's practically gift-wrapped for the crowds. But it's not done with every shot lingering on the characters, soaking in minimalism in its black and white photography, quite the opposite. Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker I first got into through Requiem for a Dream, which now years after I saw it I want to revisit again upon the soon to be released the Fountain and especially after now seeing Pi. Before with 'Requiem', I did like the movie a lot, but felt a little apprehensive about deeming it that old term 'masterpiece' as the editing, while ultra fast for a purpose, almost came off as too 'MTV' for me. But years later, after hundreds of more films taken in, I'm ready for a second look. In this particular case, Pi is also the kind of movie that warrants a second look at the director's other films. His themes run just as much together as does his breakneck style. And it's not just to show off; he truly does get inside a psychology through subjective camera AND editing, to a degree that might impress Hitchcock, albeit with some whiplash.Max Cohen played by Sean Gullette is the protagonist of the story, who's main foe is none other than the universe itself, in a sense, all through one number. Or rather, a series of numbers, one which might unlock the Stock Market secret for him. He doesn't even want to play the market, mind you, but the point for him- if one can follow- might be attributed to a repeated memory he has of looking at the sun as a boy, and soon looking past the shock of actually looking long at it. This is a very small device by Aronofsky but it works well to establish- and continue- this man's downward spiral. And spirals, by the way, seem to also figure into the film, as well as a secret technology firm (with a woman who reminded me of Condaleeza Rice look-alike), and especially a near undercover Hasidim ring where they need the numbers *in* Cohen's head to unlock some big secret to God. But even with all of this pressure, Cohen can't shake what's dogging him around, in his own cramped, wire-ridden apartment, with many bugs crawling around.The key for this movie really is atmosphere, in the acting (if it makes you uncomfortable sometimes that's the point too, and it's probably the strangest performance of a lifetime for Gullette), the production design (that apartment and the subways), the grainy, spectacular photography by Matthew Libatique, the editing to be sure- which here, unlike the breakneck 'Requiem', does take a break from the cuts so quick they almost past subliminally (which isn't bad)- and the moody music that is so slight you almost forget its there. It even works for me, and this is a big plus, as someone who's not really interested in mathematics (worst subject in school), and even better as it drew me in to his obsessions with it. I really liked one of the early scenes between Max and his the friendly Hassidic man who explains on paper different numbers and their relation to parts of the Torah. And, in the end, it all comes down to getting engrossed through what the filmmaker's bringing in with this man. There is a sort of detachment from reality- that most of us would never touch much of this with a ten foot pole- but then again it really isn't. Aronofsky also makes a point of some hallucinations/dreams adding to the ambiance, skidding almost towards the pretentious, and thus creating a world all of its own in Pi for Max, and for us as well.A film that I shall certainly seek out again when I can, if only to see if I can understand some things a little more (or maybe not as case might be), and to see such a powerhouse performance from Gullette.

Kelly's Heroes," as much fun as MASH, with only a few glaring problems
","Kelly's Heroes is a fantastic war/heist/buddy movie for about 90% of its running time. It's predates Three Kings by thirty years as a yarn about a group of soldiers out to get a whole crap-load of gold bars (sixteen million to be exact), and it gives us a group of characters we can have fun with and, more or less, care about in their quest for the gold. It's also one of those 'guy' movies where there is not much sign of the opposite sex and us dudes get to hang out with Clint, Don Rickles, Telly Savalas, and a very bizarre but perfectly entertaining Donald Sutherland. And if you need to get pumped up for a new war movie coming out (i.e. Inglorious Basterds) it does just the trick.We follow our group of 'heroes' who are able to slip by their superiors to go after gold locked up in enemy territory. If it doesn't have the same satirical impact of Three Kings it at least has an abundance of tough, brawny action scenes and even a fun knock at General Patton with Carrol O'Connor's character. We don't get the deepest insight into Americans or Germans during WW2, but we don't need it really anyway. It sometimes just makes for an intriguing viewing trying to figure out where Sutherland is at: he's a dead-on hippie, but without the same subterfuge that one saw in MASH... and yet, arguably perhaps, I was much more responsive to him here than with his fun-but-smug character in Altman's comedy. He keeps saying lines like 'don't make bad waves!' and is only missing tie-dye and a joint to fulfill the package. Without a real good reason perhaps except on a visceral level, I would recommend the film if only to check out Sutherland here.But there's other good things about Kelly's Heroes. Clint is Clint, which makes for some fun exchanges, especially with some of the more testy soldiers in the group or at a moment of a pinch, and Savalas makes some really good ground as one of those hard-but-fair army unit leaders who we can sympathize with when he has his doubts (the most doubtful of all) that the heist can actually work. And Don Rickles shows how he was as much good as an actor, when properly used, as a classic-snarky comedian. Other little treats include seeing Harry Dean Stanton crooning on the harmonica, the climax of the movie turning at a distinct point into a western (and, as an influence mayhap, Tarantinian), and that theme song 'Burning Bridges' being catchy and hard-charging as a driving force for the characters.My only big gripes were the beginning and end scenes, as they dragged and didn't add a whole lot to the story. It's a decent try, at the start, to establish the hectic and frenetic mood of nighttime combat, but it obstructs what's more interesting with Kelly and the drunk German. Also, the ending goes on at least five minutes too long, as we see quick cut-aways of the soldiers' reactions to seeing the gold with images of a liberation celebration in the streets, which would have been sublime, but there's more movie that goes on after this point that doesn't need it. But overall, Kelly's Heroes is a lot of fun, with convincing action and direction and writing.",8,2,4,21 August 2009
Children of Men," recommended for anyone interested in a (rewardingly) bleak futuristic thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron, make no mistake, knows what he's doing with the style of Children of Men. Following from the same cues he started off with Y Tu Mama Tambein, his and Emmanual Lebiznaki's camera never stops to go onto a dolly or just to stand still, it's always hand-held and on edge with the characters and the dire situations they're set in 2029 Britain. Sometimes this allows for some really incredible long-takes implemented (my favorite a very pivotal death/chase scene that occurs surprisingly early in the film), allowing Cuaron with complete subjective freedom of perspective. There's never a moment to relax in this world, as just setting a cup of coffee in the middle of the city square could have the next second arriving a bomb just next door. However, perhaps if only for me, the style called attention to itself sometimes, or to the fact that it's all 'just a movie'. Not that there isn't some very gritty action and horrific bloody violence that comes out, notably in the climactic 'uprising' as Clive Owen's Theo almost escapes being annihilated among the total chaos in an especially long take (blood spats on the lens included).The whole set-up of the story of Children of Men is simple, and I (unfortunately maybe) knew most of it from the trailer. Owen works a dead-end job in the only country where there is some 'stability' (note the quotes) at a time in the world where infertility is dead and the youngest man alive has just died. There's terrorists everywhere, no one can really rest easy, and the police state makes it very hard to get around on the roads, not to mention the immigration problem (sound familiar?). Enter in Julianne Moore's character, who was once lovers with Theo, and needs his help to get a foreigner across to safer grounds. But it becomes further complicated when the cat's out of the bag- she's pregnant, and needs to get to safety to have her child. So then the characters are off on the mission, however complicated further by the (well laid) twist that the group that were originally going to help get the woman to the 'Human Project'- where she could be looked after with the best spark of hope- really just want the baby as collateral to propagate their uprising against the government. Meanwhile, the chaos continues and continues.In a sense, this is probably the bleakest futuristic 'pro-life' movie ever made, however pro-life in relation to Children of Men is actually a necessity rather than a political or religious point. There seems to be no respite from civilization eating itself up at the thought that humanity will end if procreation becomes nothingness, and so part of the strength in Children of Men is seeing the conviction behind the main message in the film. In a time where there is practically a culture of death by way of a lack of governmental control and a burst of extremism, the only hope is new life, if only in a small dose. Populating around this message- which only becomes a little thicker by the end of the film- is a strong performance from Owen, who maybe doesn't have as much range as usual due to him being mostly a reactionary (mostly with shock and conflict, and early on malaise) at what's around him. Michael Caine also turns in the amusingly human supporting turn as a pot-smoking ex-political cartoonist. Even the woman who plays the most crucial one in the picture- who may or may not name her child Bazooka- is very good in the part.So why didn't I respond to it with overwhelming enthusiasm and with a place for it in my top 10 of the year? Hard to say even hours after seeing it. Maybe there is almost a certain lack of momentum even as the clock ticks down on the pregnancy. The bleakness that carried over the picture is so thick and disparaging it's half a relief from seeing other futuristic pictures that don't deliver so much on the dread and decay of humanity gone to the dogs, and half a desire for it to not be as such. No doubt I recommend it to all who'd like a serious trip into an original Orwellian-nightmare-popcorn-thriller (if that makes sense), though I don't think it's necessarily a full-blown masterpiece...AMENDMENT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW (month & a half later): I rewatched the film, and I liked it even more; it gets deeper, with its message more impactful and the staggering long-takes even more powerful- and it is one of the best directed films of the decade.",9,4,11,6 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," boxers' blues- one of the more notable points in Eastwood's career
","Something a friend of mine talked with me about after he and I had seen the film was a good point about the film's dramatic structure (which prompted me to see the film a second time, aside from knowing intrinsically it would get doused in Oscar liquid). It's like a darker, slightly harsher Aesop tale, with simplicity in its message ingrained into it, but with power none-the-less. I wouldn't say even after a second viewing that Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's latest film as one of the few remaining Hollywood auteurs, is one of his very best films (I don't know if I may be one of only a few that found Mystic River more shattering on the whole). Still, I think that at the least with these two latest films, Eastwood has reached on his own level the heights of one of his great dramatic influences- director Vittorio De Sica. His films were filled with an intuitive touch of humanity, observing where heart lies within people, and where it doesn't. Aside from the darker themes that the film brings up, it's also at the core a simple tale of those who observe who has heart, kindness, and who doesn't.Eastwood is better than usual as Frankie, a trainer and owner of a boxing gym. His friend and observer of the film's details, Scrap (Morgan Freeman, supreme in his understated performance), was once a boxer too, but with going too far with a fight, he became half-blind, but given a job and residence by a guilt-ridden Frankie (who is so for that and a few other things, some kept perfectly ambiguous). When he loses his boxer for being 'over-protective', a woman, Maggie (Hilary Swank, intuitive as always in her scenes), asks to be trained. After much convincing, Frankie takes her on, and little by little, he gets looser on his strict terms of not being questioned with his teachings. Then, as Maggie finally reaches the top, there comes what is called in screen writing as the second turning point, and the story turns its last act into the contemplative, the deep, and the tragic.One thing that grabbed me even more so on a second viewing was that the theme of what boxing does to the human spirit and psyche is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as Scrap observes, it's 'un-natural', to be moving around getting right in the face of pain and not running away, and how it is not a very glamorous 'sport' at all (a theme that makes it more worthy than a lessor boxing movie would give). On the other hand, it also goes in hand with the theme of having heart; the two supporting characters of Danger (in a satisfactory performance by Baruchel) and Shawrelle (Mackie), who are a major contrast. I really liked how Eastwood and writer Paul Haggis (from a book of short stories) dealt with the sub-plot to go so well with the main plot of Frankie, Scrap and Maggie. Another exceptional scene that makes this point clearer- and more resonant as the final act unfolds- is when Maggie gets a treat on her 33rd birthday from Scrap, and he tells his story about how he lost sight in his eye. In this scene, both of the actors are brilliant in their tone and reactions, it makes for one of the more meaningful, and dramatically compelling, pieces of the story.I wouldn't say, as I said, that the film is entirely flawless (which is arguable, I know). One problem I had both times I saw it, though not overall, was with Morgan Freeman's narration. For the most part it is insightful and narratively correct, but unlike Freeman's key narration role (as the key observer in Shawshank Redemption), not every line seemed very crucial for the story. It is a simple story with simpler, sometimes philosophical notes of narration, but I sometimes wished that everything had to be outlined - one can sense things right in Eastwood's face and eyes while Freeman talks gruffly behind him. And, arguable still, the sheer simplicity of the film does leave it so that one can't figure out parts of the story for themselves.Never-the-less, the film is an extraordinary stroke of skill for Eastwood as a director. If one can't say that his performance is one of his very best, one could say that his direction, his use of the camera (via DP Tom Stern), is at a peak. The way he uses his strokes of lighting and darkness, and with the way he can control the camera and not be (un-appropriately) flashy, makes it extremely professional. That he's been known to shoot scenes in one or two takes makes for such a sweetly spontaneous result, however totally controlled. Indeed, I agree whole-heartedly with one critic who said 'to call this an old man's film is a sincere compliment', especially on the craftsman side. A-",8,4,12,15 February 2005
Garden State," a sometimes serious, sometimes silly film about dealing with life
","I heard a lot of hype on Garden State, the film-making debut of actor Zack Braff, the star of the hit or miss TV show Scrubs. Mostly because I am a New Jersey boy, and a good number of my friends who saw the movie loved it. I saw it, and it pretty much met my expectations, nothing exceeding, but nothing to lower them either. Garden State is the story of Andrew Large, who gets off his overload of medication, as he goes back home to New Jersey from his would-be acting life for his Mother's funeral. There he runs into and has a couple of odd adventures with old friends (one being Stellan Sarsgard), a new one (Natalie Portman), and also has to face up to his once-psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). He leaves with a somewhat clean slate after going through some interesting, if a little painful reminders of what he left.Garden State slightly rises above other indie films in this vein (a young man coming to terms with himself and his demons, and having some eccentricities along the way) because Braff is good at directing actors, and gets out of his co-stars- particularly Portman (who is rather wonderful at times, if cutesy and inexplicable in others) and Holm. And, there are a few laughs thrown in amid Large's encounters with old friends and acquaintances. But it doesn't really rise to the greatness that it could've because Braff, as a first-timer, is one of these directors (at least on a first film) that is so in love with film-making that its over-stylized, at least for me. Maybe I've seen TOO many movies, or maybe I'm not as in tune with the 'MTV generation' as I could be, but I get tired of things used like slow-motion where the main character(s) are looking straight at the camera (the opening shot is a mixed reaction for me) or in a state of their own (the last shot, and just the last sequence, is tiresome and too deliberate for its own good). There is this romanticism, or maybe pretentious idealizing, and Braff is so infatuated with it it overclouds the better aspects to the film. There is a sense of drama that works, but sometimes its suppressed by the parts that are a little 'showy'.But these are observations more-so than criticisms; it's obvious that Garden State now has a cult status (especially kids from Jersey, who almost look at this film the same way the young people looked at Godard in the 60's), and I suppose its deserved. I wouldn't be apart of the group that trashes the film to no end, but I'm not calling the film a masterpiece either. At the core its a 'date' movie, the kind of film that is great for a couple looking for something that will give some good laughs, a little provocative touches, and a sentimental (if totally clichéd) ending. The soundtrack is also interesting, if of course 'soft', but too emo for my taste. In short, this reminds me of seeing a film by one of my fellow film students at school- I see potential, but they still need to put something on the screen that's a little more compelling, and not pandering too much.

Casualties of War," the brutality of any war - inhumanity
","Casualties of War is one of the most powerful anti-war movies. Note that I didn't mention Vietnam in that sentence, but just anti-war, period. Around the time of the mid to late 1980s many Vietnam war movies were flying out, The Killing Fields, Platoon, and best of them (not counting Apocalypse Now from the 70s) was Full Metal Jacket. What a lot of these movies have in common though is that they're not simply about Vietnam, but about the war experience. Of course sometimes the context of the times has to be taken in, such as it being the 'baby-boomer' generation where drugs and rock and roll were apart of the down-time. That and getting some Vietnam women for sex on the side. The themes are meant to be universal, or at least capture the nature of a platoon mind-set, of what it's like to be a soldier.Brian De Palma's film is set in Vietnam, like those films, but it could take place during any war. It peels an uncomfortable layer of the soldier's experience that does need to be told - it's not pretty, it's not sentimental, it is what it is. Some soldiers during wars, not just Vietnam but others, take out casualties that are not really the enemies. And for De Palma the brutal rape and murder of a girl, an innocent one, was just such a horrible story that needed to be told. His film is full of heartfelt emotion, but it doesn't show on the actor's faces, save for Michael J. Fox. It's about an ugly subject, and so the actors (Sean Penn, John C. Reilly, John Leguizamo) play precisely unsympathetic characters, to one degree or another. They don't start out that way though, and that makes it too complex to ignore as a polemic.It's about a squad, led by Penn's Sergeant, who decides to take a leave for a short while of the usual soldier duties to take a girl into the jungle and rape and murder her. Fox's PFC thinks he's kidding, but boy he isn't. They drag her miles and miles, and it becomes a morality play. Again, this is complicated: earlier in the film we saw two crucial things, that Penn's character saved Fox from death by the enemy in a tight spot, and that one of the squad's best people gets killed quite suddenly as everyone's just standing around talking (this is, truly, a shocking moment to have in any film from it coming at a mundane moment). He doesn't start off rotten, Penn's Sergeant, nor even the other guys like Don Harvey's Chuck, but as they get closer to the inevitable situation 'out there' as they say, it takes on a ghastly inhumanity, and the kind of peer pressure that one might see in a DARE drug video, only here there's no messing around. Especially in the aftermath, with a 'don't care' policy the army takes, for at least a little while.Casualties of War is skillfully directed and unflinching in its emotional reach. When we see Fox, in some desperation of not being able to save the Vietnamese girl from the rape, try to help her and, subsequently, fail to escape, it's really shocking. Not because of what doesn't happen, per-say, but that after all of these scenes of the troop in this group-think, and the torture of this woman, there's humanity again, or something close to it (it was hard for me not to tear up a little when he finally communicated with her, 'Mama-san'). But, interestingly, De Palma and his actors don't need to do all of the heavy lifting in the dramatic department. Ennio Morricone comes on in many scenes with a musical score that, in a way, confronts the audience. Do we dare not be moved when the music swells? Is it manipulative? Possibly. But it takes a master like Morricone to do it so well in this context - only Days of Heaven can come close or top it to its haunting elegy of the heart.This is an important film to look at, and it hasn't dated. Not to mention a fantastic performance from Michael J. Fox, whose subtlety in many scenes, his restraint, his character's face just pained in looking on at the horror of the situation unfolding, is just as great, if not more convincing, than Penn's surly hero-cum-villain. Another war is hell movie? Sure, but directed and acted with a modicum of believability and humanity.",10,12,16,21 February 2010
Event Horizon," so good at points that it's a shame when it isn't near the end
","This is another of those movies I saw in pieces on TV, which frankly isn't giving Event Horizon enough of its due. It's probably the only Paul WS Anderson movie I can think of that truly deserves your attention to be WATCHED from start to finish, not looking away, not distracted, because it is aiming to be a serious science fiction movie, with some horror elements. And finally seeing it from start to finish I came to the conclusion that, yes, it is Anderson's best... and at the same time it also has derivative aspects, not inherently negative against the movie per-say, and a clever concept (a space ship that takes the emotional readings of its occupants and proceeds to f***-up and/or kill its inhabitants), but near the end it falls apart not so much in script but in execution.So, this is good. At times, it's very good. The set-up is a mixture of, to me, Alien AND Aliens, to varying degrees (and maybe, as Roger Ebert reminded me of in his review, Solaris): Doctor Sam Neill is on a mission to go back to a vessel he had a major part in shaping, the Event Horizon, which has gone past the reach of central space command or whatnot in the orbit of Neptune, and he has made the crew of the Lewis & Clark, led by Captain Laurence Fishburne and including crew such as Jason Isaacs and Joely Richardson, to go with him to find it and what happened to the crew of the ship (there's a recording that sounds extremely distressing). I like sci-fi like this, where the characters talk salty to one another, and you get the chemistry between the characters (and actors most especially) in these early scenes. I genuinely cared what would happen to them, which is a credit to Anderson in the casting.And this has that moment that explains how to bend/travel through space with the paper that you can poke a hole through one end to another, which is so neat! Things like that always spark my attention, and for the first half of this, as derivative as it is in some of its look and the fact that, in its way, this time the alien/aliens ARE the ship itself, it's different and compelling in how it traces the inner fears and phobias of the characters, reaql traumas (i.e. Kathleen Quinlan's disabled son), and manipulates them literally to death. That's all fine, and there's even one genuinely great, masterfully done scene where Sam Neill's doctor has a 'meeting' with his dead naked wife in a bathroom. That is creepy, if not outright scary, and it ends in a cinematically satisfying shot.But there's also a feeling that the movie could go into more, like what really *is* in that other dimension or other place the Event Horizon has been to, what it means to go into that 'other' side that Sam Neill seems to know about but is cagey in revealing. More than that though is how Anderson slips the tone in the final stretch, this is what made me realize it wasn't *as* good as I was hoping for: when it finally comes to bringing some action and gore, where Fishburne has to preserve his (dwindling) crew and ship, he goes into filmmaking pyrotechnics of a sort that's distracting and moments and lines even from Neill, who is so good here, that becomes funny in an unintentional way. I found myself stifling laughter in a packed theater seeing parts of this ending (some parts are more intentionally funny, with the black astronaut who has to use his boosters to get back to the ship and says 'motherf***er' every other word, and... it feels organic to him!) and could predict so much of what was about to happen. After a set up and partial pay-off that was working and for Anderson to not have all the follow through I hoped for was a let-down.All the same, Event Horizon represents the sort of sci-fi spectacle we don't get in theaters as much as we used to back in the 90's, and in that sense it's easy to take it for granted, how it does dig into ideas of identity and fears and what obsessions draw out of people when traumas are put to full throttle. To put it another way, this is a brainy-dumb thriller, or a dumb-brainy thriller, and it's good. Mostly. When it's trying. 6.5/10",6,3,4,29 October 2016
The Nightmare Before Christmas," One of the best films of 1993, highly re-watchable
","I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," (review of American cut): what a mystery movie should do nowadays- absorb us in and get us set for anything
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is concerned with its plot, but also, and maybe even more-so than in most American films, with the characters. It's as if the Swedish filmmaker behind the film, by way of the very popular book(s) by Stieg Larsson, doesn't want to compromise anything with the characters for the sake of the story. So the film becomes a balancing act between its themes and its characters, its plot and its persons going through trying to figure out what happened to Harriet Vanger forty years ago. I'm not saying they're the most fully rounded and developed beings in a mystery movie ever, but I'm glad to see that a filmmaker has the guts to put the characters up front for us, particularly the force on the screen in Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace.It's her that we're given as the real lead of the story - by the end it feels as if the story, however neat and tidy it might seem (and, perhaps as a slight fault, be it through the cutting of the Swedish version or not, a little too tidy), continues with her and not journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and given perspective. While the story, about the search through the case file closed long ago for the disappearance of Harriet, is engrossing once it really gets going, it's also about women, and the violence done to them. We've seen a killer with this sort of sick method before, of the kind of 'true' evil and hatred that comes out of repression and racism and, yes, inbreeding. But not put into the context of a lead character who, throughout her life leading up to this case she stumbles upon, has had to put up with the worst in men. Really, really bad men.Indeed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo carries with it a rather nasty undercurrent that may turn off viewers expecting just a mystery story. In its own right it's as hard to take as Silence of the Lambs was for audiences back in 1991, as we're brought in to what sort of frame of mind might do such a thing as kill an innocent girl (or, as we learn, more). But what it is, at the least, is just a plain well-told story. You know the kind, where we're given hero-characters (maybe more flawed here than usual, but still) put to task to find out just what happened. And like a really grisly and humanly ghastly murder mystery as the layers are peeled away it feels ickier, the images of those pictures, those slaughtered girls Harriet alluded to in her notes, appearing before us like ghosts.If the director exceeds at creating just a bit of mood with his story (and, while a repititious method, the dissolves and super-impositions create a really strong palette visually to draw upon), he also cast his film with some strength. I'm sure just based on this film Rapace doesn't have to worry about a career for a while, and not just in Sweden. I could see her playing as a tough girl in a thriller here in the States, or, just as well, a more vulnerable character as Lisbeth is both (albeit I've yet to see her in anything else, this could work just fine as a calling card showing a multitude of range with the exception of, of course, comedy). Her character is like a cross between a femme fatale and a runaway from life, dangerous and hostile with layers built up to protect herself (and, sometimes, it has to come in handy with horrors like her really sick-f*** new probation officer). On the opposite side of her is a more subtle turn from Nyqvist, who has to be more restrained as he's the more 'normal' character, or with more on his plate (his character is after all being set-up in another case he worked on).So, the ultimate effect of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that of solid storytelling matched with strong characters. We want to see the characters solve the mystery, as dark and depressing as it gets (and really as lurid as it does too, something David Fincher can work with perhaps in the American remake). While it's not really a 'perfect' thriller or mystery by any stretch - some plot holes, such as why the characters don't take the pictures touched by the intruder fingerprinted when they're so investigative about everything else, or why Lisbeth lets a character go in a crucial scene - it involved me more than I can think of from a mystery-killer movie in a while. I'm sure I'll want to revisit again, if only for that breakthrough performance from that actress, and for some of those impressive visual-story bits with the pictures (watch as they move!)",8,4,9,9 April 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," a terrific combination of a directorial style matched with intelligent subject matter
","Good Night, and Good Luck, is one of the better (if not one of the best) films I've seen this year, and it's definitely the most thought-provoking and successful one to look at the news business since 1999's the Insider (coincidentally, including CBS). It works chiefly because co-writer/director/co-star George Clooney is even more confident with his style here than with (the under-rated) Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and that it doesn't sell short its audience the slightest. This is an important point; another director might have done things a lot differently with this film to make it more 'accessible' or 'mainstream', such as over-using a score, or doing the typical 'everyone watches the TV's all across the country' shots, or having an actor portray Joseph McCarthy and other historical figures shown as themselves here. Clooney makes some brave choices, and they all pay off at the expense of an intelligent, truthful script, and some interesting performances.Chiefly in these performances is David Strathain, an actor I'm not too familiar with, but after seeing this I definitely want to see more of his work. His turn as Edward R. Murrow, the legend of a newsman of the 20th century, is quite remarkable because it's all done for effect. Almost all emotion is repressed under the veneer of his total professionalism on and off camera, and it's a good contrast with the other newsman, who happens to not be taking things too well when it comes time for the showdown with McCarthey. He helps to counter Clooney's style with the black and white camera, which is very elegant at times, and also is very wise in taking in the close-ups and shadows (this, of course, is also a credit to his DP). And as the film goes along, and the suspense goes up and down with story, one can't help but see how effective the film goes to making parallels with today's current events. The big difference, of course, being how much depth and honesty was really in the news of Murrow's day.But another success to the film is that it can hit home to anyone, regardless of political affiliation. It does include the communism struggle in the Cold War era. But it is more concerned with the ideals of what it means to be a serious journalist, to stick by your story and how it has creedence and importance to the public, even if there are risks. Another key performance is also Frank Langella, who happens to give that objective balance between someone like Murrow and someone like McCarthey. This is a fine contrast with the footage of the hearings themselves, which take up a quarter of the film. Aside from some flashes of a jazz band playing songs, and a couple of-the-time commercials (those the only minor liabilities for me, although still setting in the mood), it is focused on these guys, on the CBS news team, and the whole cast (Strathain, Clooney, Downey, Clarkson, etc) are so good it helps keep the look of the film from not going too much over the rails. It's a mature film for those open to the subject matter; I'm not too surprised that it's not out at the cineplexes, but that being said it's far more worth the time than most of the films that are there now.",10,4,7,21 October 2005
Big Hero 6," a solid Disney-Marvel-Anime hybrid, if less than masterful
","Big Hero 6 provides what you'd want in a movie as a kid, and maybe as an adult depending on how in touch you are with your inner-kid. Especially if you have a sibling (brother more specifically) the film's core relationship between Hiro and his older brother - it's not something that we see throughout, due to the first major turning point in the film, but the memory certainly remains strong - it will resonate. But the movie is only intermittently interested in pulling at your heartstrings; it's ultimately about suiting up, getting on the gadgets, and putting together a team. So the film is a lot of things in one - not to mention having an instantly adorable (i.e. lucrative) mascot at the center with Baymax.By saying that it has 'what you'd want' in a movie, I don't just mean super-heroes in the Marvel tradition (though it doesn't have the Marvel banner, this is based on a Marvel title, albeit an obscure-ish one), but anime as well. Many of the story turns, including the ones that are rather startling and the tonal shifts from lightness to tragedy and then swiftly back to lightness and action and thrills, it's like what I might expect to see from Japan directly. Which, of course, is part of the source itself, and the fact that the city is called 'San-FrancTokyo' (ho-ho) and the film has primarily Asian characters - whether they're all played by Asians is another story, but I digress.I can't be too hard on a film that is just out to sheerlessly entertain the audience like this. It does have some points on the nature of grief and what happens when people are faced with losing someone who can't come back (... or can they?) I think it could've been even better, possibly great, if it had a bit of a better balance on the dark and the light sides of the film. Ultimately, I felt, the tragic parts came when they had to, and outside of that Big Hero 6 is essentially a Fun Ride Of A Movie (in caps), primarily led by a Doctor-cum-Fighting robot in Baymax, and some other supporting characters who are fine, no more no less. Just fine.But maybe Baymax is enough, and certainly, more often than not, this is a very funny movie. He has the entertainment value of the Genie in Aladdin - like in that film, he's the friendly BIG companion who can help save the day for the protagonist - except instead of the thousands of impressions of Williams, it's the exact opposite that makes him appealing: one personality, pretty straightforward, and the dead-pan nature is closer to, oh I don't know, Jeff Bridges in Starman. He's the perfect innocuous character, but is hilarious for the reasons of reaction and straight silliness.It should also be noted the last act, the climax, has its predictable points - like most (or almost all) superhero movies, i.e. from Marvel, it has to all build up to a gigantic Must-Save-the-City from impending gargantuan destruction, involving space as well. And a turn from a character kind of comes out of nowhere, which is fine except that the development is kind of off to suddenly be the 'villain'. However, again, akin to anime, so I can let it slide and still be sucked into the peril of the thing (I mean, hey, they can't all be The Incredibles).For what it's worth though, there's so much to enjoy with this film that I'm sure if I was younger I'd eat it up with a spoon and want seconds-thirds-fourths-etc. It's an insatiably pleasant film to experience, faults and all. 7.5/10",7,58,87,4 April 2015
Mulholland Drive," Life is But A Dream (after a reviewing)
","David Lynch's Mulholland Drive brings him in the territory of Twin Peaks, Eraserhead, but more-so a highly-charged form of surrealist thinking singular only to Lynch regarding Hollywood to make the best films of the year, and of his career. The film is a twisting, meticulously crafted and acted cinema piece about many a lot of things. At FIRST, the basic plot: a woman (Laura Elean Haring) survives a car crash and stumbles down the hill next to Mulholland drive and walks into a woman's house she has never met before. She also has amnesia, and when the woman (Naomi Watts), an actress, who is currently occupying the place lets her stay for a few days to get her memories together, the plot unfolds. Other side stories are interestingly blended into the rest of the movie involving a troubled director (Justin Theroux) who is forced into things he didn't intend on, the woman living in the house who tries and goes for auditions, etc.But the plot (even the part involving Haring) isn't even the big part of the movie. Lynch, like he did in Eraserhead, exposes the audience to logical and realistic (er, in Lynch's sense) scenes and then sidesteps into a surreal and dreamlike world...or what one might THINK is the dreamworld. Yet it's really about dreaming, one might think, as reality and fantasy become part of the pieces of Lynch's method. What is it to have a dream, anyway, Lynch may be essentially asking the audience? And what is it to have things both idealized and ugly in equal measure, reflected in the subconscious, and drifted back during sleep like some kind of wavelength that is personal but psychologically sound, more or less? And, most importantly, why do we need fantasy? Well, there needs to be a divide, Lynch may be supposing, between fantasy and reality, but at the same time, for the sake of art and cinema, the line needs to be blurred as well to reach underlying truths about what it is to create, what it is to act, what it is to be controlled in the measures of creation and reinterpretation.These might be pretentious points presented by another filmmaker, but Lynch, for all of his abandoning of conventions (albeit with a firm, knowing embracing of the intent in conventions, archetypes and clichÃ©s from Hollywood films), is nevertheless a superlatively entertaining writer/director/sound editor, who makes some of the most profound and everlasting statements ever about Hollywood and the illusions created from reality (whether manufactured ala 50s singers in a booth then put on film, or in some capacity regarding a dirty dude behind the Winkies) while never losing the power to make it one hell of a ride. And by 'ride' I mean the ride of a filmmaker overwhelmingly yet carefully confident in what he wants to convey: of the corny light and contorted ideals that comes out of the darkness of Diane's dreams (I'll relent and say that it makes the most sense, even though I'd love it just as much if it didn't go so easily for sense), and that, of course, it's all about emotional response.In short, it's one of the must-see films from the 2000s, not just for Lynch fans but for those who might never think of going near a Lynch film: it's funny, it's tragic, it's mysterious, and it's both dense and simple in equal measure. Like music, it'll either rock your boat or leave you dry and for me it still rocks my boat to this day.",10,7,13,12 October 2001
Dumb and Dumber," A reason to see comedies
","Dumb and Dumber is a hilarious look at two dummies who go across the country to return a briefcase.  During their escapades we see some of the most memorable and humorous scenes of the decade.  Including  a cop drinking a beer bottle full of pee, a blind kid getting a parrokeete without a head, Jeff Daniels taking a monster dump, and many, many other things.  The movie also introduced two film-makers who would also be remembered for There's Something About Mary- Peter and Bobby Farrelly.

Grave of the Fireflies," a combination of Rome Open City and Wiesel's Night (and like both, an extreme, personally felt story)
","In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro. Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival. And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child. It's basically about two siblings, an older brother and younger sister, who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around, and with very little hope in sight. This lays the groundwork for their relationship, a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing.Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker, in this case Isao Takahata, touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime. By leaving us with these two characters, who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter (they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders) and scrounging for food any way possible, we're left with nothing else but their struggle, essentially. The backdrop itself almost becomes abstract, something so huge that we don't even know that it's Americans dropping the bombs, as it's already too much to grasp that a child's parent is no longer with them. Like Elie Wiesel's book Night, the backdrop and horror is used to pit these people in an untenable situation, and it can only end, honestly, without compromise.So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films). The animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive in violence; images are visceral for just what is briefly revealed, without the extraneous shots that one might see in a work not meant in a G-rated film (i.e. when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter. The voice-work, too, doesn't strain credulity- these sound like, if it were a regular live-action feature, the kids who would play these parts (and, speaking of neo-realism, the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again).Most often, the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation. It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son, but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge. Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko. And, finally, there's the last ten or so minutes, which I won't mention here. Suffice to say it's one of those times in movies where the opening of the film- Seiko dying homeless and famished- is explained to a perfect degree by film's end. It's a harrowing experience, and one of the very best animated films.",10,4,5,12 April 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," it's directed fine and there's some good acting, but it's also dim and silly and contrived
","The Boy in Striped Pajamas, aside from it looking mostly like a slightly upgraded TV movie (it's financed by BBC) and featuring British and non-British actors not changing any of their accents for their characters, is also too obvious for its own good. Holocaust = bad is the basic message of the picture, and a message that apparently never sinks into the head of Bruno, the 8 year old boy who befriends Shmool, the boy of the title who befriends him across the fence of the concentration camp. It also seems to be a movie pitched at children more than adults, which would be fine except that it's not even a very good children's movie, unless they don't know much at all about the holocaust- which, perhaps is likely. Maybe my standards are too high after so many countless films regarding Nazis and the holocaust, but among the many of them (Schindler's List by far the masterpiece and others like Jakob the Liar remake worse), this one is just... meh.Does it provide a look at how innocence had little place of the Nazi's plans against the Jewish people? Yes. Does it have a point regarding good versus evil? Maybe. It's scope is mainly centered on Bruno's experiences around the family house where his father (barely one-dimensional David Thewlis) is the Nazi soldier and his mother (Vera Farmiga, almost two-dimensional but not quite) who is horrified by what she finds out goes on at the camps. And, as well, about the kindness of some people who could not comprehend (or just weren't up on the facts or too young, like Bruno) the evil possible with the Nazis. All of these ideas and perspectives are fine. It's the execution of these on film, in drama, that counts, and the performances and the direction just don't add up.On top of this are some contrivances to the plot that keep things a little too thick for comfort. Maybe I just wasn't as emotionally invested in the ending as some other critics have been, but it starts as being pretty stupid - for Bruno to just casually dig his way into the camp and then slip on the camp clothes without anyone noticing is one thing - and then, the final straw, with the big lesson being delivered as a manipulative sucker punch to the parents as Bruno and Shmool are shuffled off to the gas chamber at just the exact moment they go into the one bunker. This is just a cruel twist, something done to drive tragedy into a story that doesn't provide much except for a feeling of '... what?' If it touches other people who don't see any of the obvious lines drawn in Herman's script or direction, good for them. For me, it's a total emotional sham.",5,15,33,1 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Don't look to the horizon, look at the piece of massive, character-driven entertainment (and some pathos) here
","Ive seen Last Jedi twice now and the second time went with my older brother (who is old enough to have owned original Return of the Jedi toys). He remarked (and I took for granted) John Williams's score once again being a highlight, and starting off on that point reminds me why Star Wars still has the adventure/operatic impact it does. The Last Jedi is full of sweeping action and tragedy and loss and hope, and Williams reflects that and heightens it, elevates it, into more than it was. We just always think, well, this is Johnny, but his achievement here is no less than any of his other compositions. For all of the attention to the psychology of the characters (as much as can happen in Star Wars, which is a fast-moving adventure serial), without Williams's themes it doesnt grab the punch. One day he will go into the great dissolve in the sky. I'm struck even more this time by how there are many, many character dynamics in this 150 minutes - even Benicio Del Toro's stuttering thief, who has the kind of grime and sleaze but charisma this needs, some originality here and there - and Johnson as a writer is able to juggle so many. I should have more or a gripe with his Poe only kinda sorta grows by the end (for all of his cocksureness, he knows well enough to leave a giant death-star-tech cannon alone at a certain point), but it's offset by how we get to see Isaac actually inhabit this guy (unlike last film when he was away most of the time). Every connection that should matter, from Luke to Rey to Rey and Kylo (a curious linkage by the way that makes me wonder about whether Snoke was saying truth or not when he commented on being the architect of their bond... A very small moment near the very end tells me he wasn't or at least not fully), Finn and Rose, Poe and Holdo (is she coming back in the next one? I have no clue, but her exit is easily the most breathtaking moment in this film and most of the Star Wars movies), and even Kylo and 'Admiral Hugs.' It might be a lot of skipping between the timelines, but the tension isn't lost from thread to thread. If anything seeing it again I admired more the tapping between tones, from the wide-eyed goofy (mixed with a tinge of melancholy for the exploited underclass) in the Casino city to the uneasy and veering on psychedelic bits on the island. Oh, and as a director Johnson gets the most bang for his buck as far as capturing indelible images and even visual poetry (and I dont mean how Lucas once tried to say it once upon a time). Only flaw: he could have even more if he slowed down for a beat or two (my one minor gripe pace wise, it's breathless in the storytelling often in this long but not overlong sit).This is wonderful work, funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking, and while with no twists that will especially change the fabric of pop culture, there are a couple that make enough of an impact to get a packed theater into excitement (but then again perhaps Johnson knows ironically people might go in *expecting* to get one of those bone-shattering/solar-plexus-damaging twists like in 'Empire'). And it has a strong take on what is wrong and right at the same time about legacy. You can't stick to everything in books that are older than dirt, but the impetus for keeping a balance in the force is a good one and may inspire those who are told from birth they should have none. This goes for Luke but it also goes for Kylo Ren, and his turn towards the dark side in this story is more subtle in some waye than that of his grandfather - what do you take with you and for all of the talk of God powers (and demonstrations, like the kick-you-in-the-ass climax), it's always down to choice in a given circumsrance, pure and simple.Thats a powerful message, especially for children, and if one takes it a political step further there are far greater parallels that can be drawn, but that would take a longer review to get into (suffice it to say if you can't make paralells between the Resistance and the First Order to what's going on in America and the UK and other points worldwide now, you're not paying enough attention). In other words as basic entertainment it's a blast that has steady direction, and as something political (as all art, or good art, should be), it kicks ass too. One question as I still am in awe of what Johnson was able to do as far as making a spectacular blockbuster film... Why didn't Laura Dern just take Oscar Isaac aside and tell him the plan to ger into the cloaked ships? He wouldve saved a lot of trouble, though ultimately the trip to the Casino planet for Finn and Rose *is* much more important than even I first thought. It really is key to setting up a lot of what's to come in movies beyond this which was clever given how it seemed like a silly diversion (was that Justin Theroux as the expert gambler? Looked like him). But anyway, just a minor gripe.",10,28,96,17 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," a winning combination of comedy, characters, and special fx (and a little heart)
","Guardians of the Galaxy was something I saw this past summer, and by now it should be gone from my memory, or rather a little faded. Summer blockbusters should be fun as disposable entertainments (or on the flip-side can be detrimental to your brain and well-being if they're not), and yet Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel Studios' 10th feature film in eight years, has a little more to offer than the usual. At least, it should be said, with its characters and most of its cast. Plus, it's a comedy deep down - with some tragic roots that aren't totally ignored - and it stays true to that and makes it more memorable on those grounds. If it's not THE best of the MCU flicks yet, it's probably the funniest by way of its ensemble.After little 'Starlord' (yeah, it's not his name, but might as well) loses his mother at the start of the movie (and yeah, a bit of a dramatic start, but director James Gunn makes it real and impactful) and happens to get, yes, sucked up into a spaceship by some mysterious group, it cuts ahead to twenty years later as the boy is now a man (Chris Pratt), a kind of bounty hunter but for objects instead of people. Somehow one thing leads to another and he winds up in a prison, alongside a motley crew of other 'low-lifes' like Rocket Raccoon (voiced by, yes, Bradley Cooper), his companion/partner/Tree-Monster Groot (Vin Diesel), a woman (Zoe Saldana) who is actually from a family of royalty but gets shuffled out by a betrayal of sorts, and Dave Bautista as a Big-Headed Lunk named Drax who's one crutch is that he takes things very literally (including gestures that seem self-explanatory).This central ensemble is cast and played with excellent timing and a strong variety. No one member is alike, even though there's plenty of sarcasm to go around - Starlord is like a Han Solo, but to a point so is Rocket Raccoon, and of all things it's the latter who is the most 'bad-ass' of the bunch with his technical skills, though also the most unbalanced - and quirks and distrust is a-plenty. There's a lot of comedy in the writing, including some off-kilter sexual references - which, for me as a summer movie presumably meant for kids, made me giddy that they could get away with it, and more importantly that they were hilarious - but also Pratt has excellent timing and chops with everyone. And yet he doesn't play it all for laughs all the time, and when called upon to be serious or call back to his character's mother and past, he can go there too.The fact that Gunn can get the audience so worked up about this group is really endearing (he described the difference between them and the Avengers like the difference between the Stones and the Beatles, similar songs to play in a group, but varied approach to the music with Guardians being harder edged), including, yes, a giant tree and an over-bearing Meat-Head like Draxx. And there are a couple of solid supporting players who have just delightfully bizarre science-fiction/space-opera get ups (this is also a variation on Star Wars of course); Benicio del-Toro in his one scene and Michael Rooker, the best 'villain' type character of the film as Starlord's a-hole mentor, steal their scenes completely.I mention all this good stuff, not to mention some winning action set-pieces and occasionally truly spectacular special effects, because the main plot of the film isn't all that great. It's a little been-here-done-that, the Magic Item (one of the items that will eventually make up the Infinity Gauntlet) that has to be saved and protected, and a main villain via Lee Pace that just isn't interesting or compelling. He does what he can, but there isn't much room to do past what is required. It's almost as if Gunn and Nicole Perlman (the writers) knew they had to work with this boiler-plate sci-fi story, did decently, served the franchise that's continuing, and decided that the best way to make this worthwhile would be to give the really choice stuff to the heroes. For me the only thing keeping it back from the heights of The Avengers is a really captivating villain or stakes in that regard.But if you watch it for these main players, their rapore with one another, the awesomely self-conscious soundtrack (you laugh when certain songs come up, and tap your feet at the same time), and some of the wilder visuals that can come up for these planets and settings - and did I mention a f***ing raccoon is one of the great characters of the past several years in mainstream films, it must be said again - it's popcorn bliss for a couple hours and change.",9,3,8,13 November 2014

The Evil Dead," The only horror movie, make that movie period, you will ever see a possessed tree limb act as a dildo.
","While that first line might be a bit of a stretch, it gives a bit of mind about what to expect from Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, a horror movie so vulgar, so gorish, so unexplicably twisted, that it's incredibly ingenuous until the last shot.  Even for a low budget film noticably shot practically on a shoe string from a corpse, it's balsy.  The story starts off, and in times steers towards, the area of horror cliches, and yet by the time(s) we see the demonic characters, and the blood that goes along with it, it's accepted with the territory. The Evil Dead is to me one of those horror pictures like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or or Night of the Living Dead that goes to show that within the muck of endless B horror films that those with little money to spend can concoct something that shows craft (and good old chills) triumphs over money every now and then.  And if you happen to view this as a comedy, it goes for laughs in certain spots as well, albiet twisted to a crazed T. A+",10,12,19,22 April 2002
8 Mile," Convincing and entertaining...
","...though sticking to a certain music-movie formula, and not sticking to the total truth of Eminem- the atmosphere that he must of felt in those days in Detroit's slums is excellently captured by director Curtis Hanson, and the rap scenes are finite, but non-fans of Eminem who see this movie may get the wrong impression about him, and fans and observers of his last three albums (like I) will see that he skewers much of his material.  For instance, the relationships between his mother (Kim Basinger) and pregnant girlfriend are not what Marshall dealt furiously about on his 2nd and 3rd albums.Having said that, I enjoyed 8 Mile, as that it doesn't go for cheap emotions, and Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith's misery and frustrations are projected splendidly by Eminem, since this is basically a version of how he made it- he starts off in a trailer, clothes in a garbage bag and a car that breaks down constantly, but has a gift to come at people at the right times with rhymes.  I even thought (in a sense) that Basinger did a decent job with Rabbit's mother, and she doesn't seem too much like a Hollywood starlet here.Bottom line, fans of Eminem and those who identify with the underground Detroit lifestyle will have a captivating couple of hours with Mr. Shady on screen, and maybe others will too.  However, fans of Hanson should know this isn't his best picture.  Grade: B+",7,2,3,8 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Arguably one of the most potent treatises on 'genre' film-making that you'll ever see
","After seeing Kill Bill Volume one tonight I am certain of two things: 1, Quentin Tarantino, mastermind behind Kill Bill as well as the smash hits Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, is the only filmmaker that can walk the tightrope of doing an unfortunate rip-off and a brilliant homage without falling onto the wrong side. And 2, I agree with his logic now of splitting his epic in two parts, if only because of the climactic battle between The Bride and the Crazy 88 fighters- any attempt to top this within the same time frame of a three hour+ motion picture is ridiculous. By doing so, Tarantino leaves us with one of the most violent (and I mean that as a compliment, since when violence is frowned upon in movies that means it's impressive instead of tongue-in-cheek like in horror films), visceral, and definitely entertaining films of the year. After seeing it once, to which I'll probably see it again, I can say that it's my favorite movie-going experience of the year.The Bride, her nickname in the group Black Mamba, is killed off (or so they thought) by her fellow partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. When she awakes from her coma four years later, she regains her consciousness of what she must do- kill the four partners, and then her boss Bill (played by the immediately recognizable, if only by voice, David Carradine). In volume one she goes after Vernita Green (Copperhead), and O-Ren Ishi (Cottonmouth), and like in Tarantino's past efforts the story is told in a non-linear style that gives answers first, questions later. But these story elements are, unlike his past films, just little details. Even to those who won't like Kill Bill and I know they have their understandable reasons - for Americans this will be one of the most violent films they may ever see, and for marital arts/kung-fu fans on Asia this will be something standard, however in parody. But the violence is done with the message that it's all stylized, and that Kill Bill is a triumph of style over substance is a compliment the haters may feel poking at them (I'd say though that kids under the age of 12 and character-study film buffs should stay clear of this one). As an avid film-goer, I found that there was so much to soak up in Kill Bill that at the least it contained some of Tarantino's most daring direction, taking chances that paid off, and borrowing to the point of a true transcendence of the material.One thing I love in a movie, personally, is when certain images or scenes stay in my head long after the film is over, and there are a few in this one that are still buzzing in my head as I write this commentary. The climax is impressive, yet the sequence that had me completely riveted was the Japanese anime sequence detailing the background on O-Ren Ishi. Like much of the rest of the film, it has bloodshed, intense close-ups, and quick editing. But there was just something about this whole sequence, the emotion that came through it. I'd have to say it's one of Tarantino's finest moments (and equal credit goes to whoever directed the animation, which ranks second to Toyoo Ashida, director of the classic Fist of the North Star), right up there with the overdose in Pulp Fiction and the opening in Reservoir Dogs. In fact, I also think an equal amount of praise should be given to cinematographer Robert Richardson, contributing heavily to Q.T.'s vision, and his usual editor Sally Menke for putting it all together. Kill Bill volume one accomplishes what it was hyped for- it's a spectacular showcase for devourers of grind-house cinema (while I've never seen any grind-house films, surprising I know, I felt I had seen so much of the genre in this one effort) and for Tarantino's main fan base. And while it is often assumed his fan base if mostly comprised of some film buffs and a lot of guys who like guy-action-movies, having Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox, and Lucy Liu (who all contribute great fight/stunt work by the way) turns Kill Bill into something of a chick flick as well.",10,3,9,10 October 2003
Ip Man," fantastic martial arts movie, good-to-OK drama
","I must have had a different experience than a large number of people who have seen Ip Man, since I came to the film about eight years after its release in China, and three years after I saw a very different film about the Ip (or Yip) Man, Wong Kar Wai's The Grandmaster. That film has some of the same characters, and its unavoidable to not have some of the same beats in the story (that Yip Man is already a master martial artist, and also a father and husband, but his life is turned upside down with the invasion of Japanese forces in the late 30's), but the style is far away from this film.Where Wong is someone totally interested in visual effects - how rain will fall on characters, how movement goes from slow motion to quicker motion and how to change things like shutter speeds with the camera - Wilson Yip (any relation to the real guy I wonder) is out to just make an entertaining, mainstream movie that is very much for Chinese audiences. Where one film is more of a mood pieces, albeit with some intense action, this is all about telling one part of the Ip Man's story, and it's all the better for it.I also knew actually that this film wouldn't really be able to cover all of the events since its now over three movies (sequels in 2010 and 2015). These events are all about Ip Man's time as a teacher of his own form of martial arts - which he tries to say, in his usual humble way, is not too different from other martial artists, though of course it's the teacher and students who learn from him who are of a higher order - and those Japanese invasion events.The strongest part story-wise is that it took a direction I wasn't so much expecting; in the first half hour, when things are relatively OK for Yip Man (played with confidence and a great way into this naturally heroic person by Donnie Yen), he seems almost *too* perfect in a way. It's like, can a guy be any more of a full-blown leader and good-hearted and kind but firm and un-shakable human being? Here's a guy who's only fault is, maybe once or twice, he doesn't look at his kids drawings, or he might, maybe, break a chair or something when a challenger comes calling for a fight.But when Ip Man and his family are put out on the street and, like everyone else in their Fu Shan village, are starving and just trying to get by the day to day, he's no longer a teacher but another survivor, and, as a greater conflict, is up against the repressive Japanese military who want to see him fight. How this happens are parts of the story I'll leave for you to find out, but suffice it to say it's one of those tales where a hero is established early on, then taken down a peg due to exterior circumstances (the fall of a village, of a people, oppression and so on), and he has to rise back up to meet the challenge set to him.Now some of this drama is acted with just enough conviction to get by, no more no less, and yet that's not exactly the reason to see the movie. I appreciated that the filmmakers kept things period-correct and used the real-life, tumultuous history in keeping with the protagonist and his adversaries (maybe my favorite character is the Chinese interpreter who Yip Man thinks for a while as a traitor, but the guy is just trying to get by like everyone else and pays dearly for just being near the Japanese for too long). The reason to see the movie is for the martial arts, and it's damn impressive; Sammo Hung does the choreography here, and he stages fights so that there is an ecstatic flow to things - it's not a rush into one thing or another, pieces build and we see a continuity with how Yip Man defends himself and/or fights his opponents. And when Yip Man gets angry in a fight (or just a little more aggressive) watch out because Yen definitely brings it.It may not be some masterpiece or anything, and it may rely a little too much (especially near the end) as a piece for its Chinese audiences to lap up more than for a worldwide one (and of course the Bruce Lee trivia is put in there because how can it not be), it's a highly entertaining spectacle that has light moments that work and dramatic parts that are never unsatisfying. It's loaded with well-shot action and if you like kung-fu/martial arts its basically a must-see, maybe only a notch below the likes of 36th Chamber of Shaolin or Five Fingers of Death in terms of the 'Holy S***' aspect of the choreography.",8,0,0,26 February 2016
From Dusk Till Dawn," Gore + vampires + Tarantino & Rodriquez= great entertainment
","Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film.  More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino) who are part focused and part insane.  They kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and bring them to a bar called the T**y twister while waiting for morning and their money prize.  But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless 'from dusk till dawn'.  Great fun, terrific violence (if not disgusting) and cool quotes bring this film to a fine T.  Look for Tom Savini as Sex Machine, Salma Hayek as a stripper and Cheech Marin who plays 3 characters.

The Last Emperor," the isolation of a simple man in times of change
","Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is a glorious epic that almost should be made for someone of a higher stature. In a sense all of the visual splendor that Bertolucci, DP Vittorio Storaro, and all the costume and set and art designers- not to mention the Forbidden Kingdom itself- are a contradiction on a man who spent his life more or less as a prisoner, either by birth or by choice. He was taken from his mother at a very young age, still practically an infant, and basically given an empire, with many servants waiting at any and all command.But then Pu Yi was given an empire that was crumbling due to the historical shift from power of empire to republic, and he became only important as an obscure figurehead in a society that kept him away. Until he was 18 or 19, when he was forcibly ejected from the Forbidden Kingdom by a new system, his whole upbringing was warped. This led then to becoming, by something of his choice (though, as with any drug like the devil opium from his homeland, something he wanted without knowing all the consequences), an installed 'puppet' emperor. And, finally, this led to a real prison, albeit one with a far greater existential means to an end.What Bertolucci charts, brilliantly, is what a man of royalty becomes when he has no power, no real influence (and, if any, as a pawn figurehead for the Japanese), and most importantly with very few actual emotional connections. There's a wet nurse, there's a wife (or two, briefly), and R.J. (Peter O'Toole), but in general there's very little Pu Yi can cling to. It's rather staggering to boot since the director is not entirely after a political message- Maoists are seen as just another wave, towards the end of the film, that's stemmed from the protesters from earlier in the late 1910's- but more-so about what Pu Yi's purpose is in life without real freedom. There are escapist pleasures, like being a Playboy, and even as a puppet emperor there's some escapist element from the gravity of the real situations he's not aware of. As the director said once about the character, which makes some good sense, is that he's a 'Peter Pan character', and with change being reflected as something that goes on to far greater lengths around him than in himself.But is this a Peter Pan story or film? Not quite; it's one of those grandly filmed historical dramas that does the rare step of choosing character over plot (this despite the fact that Bertolucci jumps back and forth between the 1950s prison and the history), but at the same time everything goes like clockwork, staggeringly at times, in terms of the production values. Almost by luck, like with the scenes with little Pu Yi, there's some awesome cinema captured in the unexpected, as the colors spring out, sumptuously, with themes that are quite internal and deeply felt. He also has the luck of having John Lone playing, for the most part, Pu Yi from young adult to old man, a presence that often hides back his true isolation with the markings of a man who's not as strong as he thinks he is (this despite how he acts with his wives, and how he is around the wise and caring Johnston, played by a perfectly cast O'Toole). Lone makes the character sympathetic in ways that would be trickier for a less adept actor with those subtle moments of anguish.Worth seeing for sure in full widescreen, preferably the remastered Criterion where everything's crisp as bacon, it's one of the best films of 1987, and it challenges the perception of the typical 'costume epic'; beneath the veneer of the hundreds and hundreds of extras, the atmosphere behind the walls of the Kingdom or at the prison, and in all the carefully orchestrated moments, there's questions about the nature of power and change in contexts political and personal.",10,0,0,26 May 2008
Jerry Maguire," remembered for so much, and it's actually a pretty good movie
","Tom Cruise is so Tom CRUISE here he out Tom Cruises when Ben Stiller has done Tom Cruise (or should I say Tom Crooze?) He is practically everything that he has ever been asked to do as an actor, minus the running and action stuff (oh, no, wait, he does run a little bit in the climax, how about that) and it's one of his major performances (to the point where I wondered a few times if this could be an unintentional sequel to Risky Business). He, and not Cuba Gooding Jr (who is fine but given a largely two dimensional character, a type to be sure), deserved the hell out of that Oscar. This is his movie, and he rules at every moment.The movie around him is fun and entertaining, and it's Cameron Crowe also at his most...Crowe-ish (for better or worse, mostly better, from his can't-help-himself wit to the musical choices, from the Who to Miles Davis), though not as deep as it might think it is early on. It also has a wonderful turn from Renee Zellwegger, a sleazy turn by Jay Mohr, and Jerry O'Connell for a few key scenes in one of his best turns (hey, no small roles, right?) The key thing for me about all this: Jerry Maguire was one of my cinematic blind spots until... Well, now.I knew all of the major cultural references (it's just how it is, whether it's seeing a parody long before the actual source, to a Patton Oswalt bit about seeing it on Christmas), and seen a few scenes here and there, but I'd never seen it start to finish. What I come away with is... It works. Mostly. Largely on movie star charm and some snappy Crowe dialog that only occasionally is too, uh, cocky for its own good.It also is a much more compelling story when it's focused on the sports world, and the first part seems to be indicating it'll be largely about that. And then roughly halfway through, when the thrust of the story should be about how Jerry picks up the pieces and gets back on track, Crowe remembers he wants to kick in his romantic comedy/drama plot and it takes over. Arguably, a bit too much and yet, there are some really touching scenes late in the film between Cruise and Zellweger, like it almost makes up for a sluggish middle.Jerry Maguire, not without flaws, is what used to be a quality example of a popular and massive Hollywood hit in the mid 1990s. I wonder now if it would go straight to Netflix or not, with a different star. Is it still an iconic Hollywood piece of the 90s? I dunno. But I did laugh. And I could see how Crowe could go down the path he has for the last 15 years.",7,2,3,28 December 2018
Clash of the Titans," release the campiness! it's not all there, it seems
","The original Clash of the Titans will come up in most reviews of the new 2010 version directed by Louis Leterier (Incredible Hulk). Might as well join in: frankly, the original was no full-blown classic, but it was a good chunk of Saturday afternoon fodder for us fans of the Ray Harryhausen school of stop-motion in fantastical tales of Gods and monsters. But it does appear to have more classic tendencies than one remembered when looking at the new film. Even if I hadn't seen the original, I'd have the sneaking suspicion that something was up with this film, that its story went through a mechanical meat-grinder in the studio executive sense, that the scriptwriters were behooved to make a film for a low-common denomenator, and to make sure, of course, that everything was as neatly explained as possible. Zeus, Hades, who are these people to Joe six-pack? Nothing they can't take in simple action-movie stride, it would seem.This Clash of the Titans is a stupid, quite possibly bad movie. I can't say I didn't have fun with it, however. Its makers must be aware, at least on some level, that they are in spirit remaining true to the original, which itself had its level of camp (and, where that had nothing less than Olivier as Zeus, they bring on Liam Neeson this time to fill the role, something he's up to task to do, perfectly straight-faced doing some ridiculous lines). And make no mistake, you shouldn't take this stuff *too* seriously. Go back to your school books in the Greek mythology school for that (if you start comparing this to the 'history', by the way, you might find more than a few discrepancies, like, for example, the much more blatant disregard humans have for the Gods, when in the text it was just the occasional hiccup of dissent).The story is cookie-cutter, but then again it was in the original: Perseus is a Demigod, bastard man of Argos via Zeus, and put in place to stop Hades and, more crucially, the A-bomb in the beast Kraken. From this premise on, it's a series of wild action scenes and confrontations, lots of sword dueling and men in steel-plated chest guards fighting things like scorpions and Medusa and other weird demony things. Again, similar to the original. But there's something about Leterier's movie that, in a way, doesn't quite go far enough with the campy-ness (mostly Ralph Fiennes, playing Hades as if still mostly in character as Voldemort, and on occasion Neeson - Worthington is a complete cardboard cut-out hero as he was in Avatar). Some lines and scenes bring some laughs (i.e. all of the 'Pegasus-es', ho-ho), but then it stalls and goes into crap common-ACTION movie mode. Ho-hum.It is not that all of the direction is bad, but some of it just so mechanical, moving from one thing to the next, rarely with much emotion or spark. And the effects, save for the big finish with the Kraken at the climax, barely have the same intensity or just pure joy and wonderment of Harryhausen's creations (and this may be a minor gripe, but it's a true shame there's no owl save for the brief mention). When I wasn't trying to hold in my laughter at the stone-faced delivery of some lines, or the hambone delivery of others (i.e. Fiennes, the flamboyant character awaiting to sacrifice the girl to the Kraken), I was kind of bored. Somewhere inside of Clash of the Titans it knows it's as bad as it wants to be, but it also thinks its as cool as all of the major blockbusters in recent memory.It's neither total foul nor is it a rousing success. I'd say it's worth it to see those spectacular sights on a big screen (and in 2D only, not the 3D that's suckering people in after the fact), but in reality one would feel comfortable with a bunch of friends mocking it to pieces. Some of this is a lot of fun, in the most guilty-pleasure way possible in Hollywood product. Other times, it's just dull as hell.",4,3,8,1 April 2010
Jurassic World," a fun B movie with A-movie credentials
","I look at Jurassic World and I end up holding it up to other movies that are out now as well as the original Jurassic Park and its sequels. It's hard not to, when we live in a film world that gives us Godzilla (some decent monster action, practically non-existent humans) and the new Planet of the Apes films (which has two of this movie's co-writers, and has arguably greater CGI/mo-cap and writing). What Colin Trevorrow and producer Steven Spielberg do here - and make no mistake, this is very much a Spielberg production - is try to give the monster-movie-CGI-heavy blockbuster a jump-start with things that are familiar as well as new creatures, new peril, and a much bigger park. This time it's open, folks, and this place must have a helluva insurance premium.You know the set up and what'll happen as soon as you see the trailer, or just read the following sentence: the scientists in Jurassic World have 'designed' a dinosaur hybrid (we don't know everything that's in it, which is part of the mystery), and because it's been in captivity all its life, it's extra-dangerous and unfamiliar with the world around it. So, yes, in short, dinosaur breaks out, wreaks havoc, other dinosaurs spring loose, and the velociraptors are used to try and track this other big 'Indominus Rex' down. Yeah, wait, what? Jurassic World certainly delivers on the peril, on some clever lines and witty banter - especially between Chris Pratt, as the Navy-Seal turned raptor hunter, and businessy-turned-sorta-bad-ass Bryce Dallas-Howard - and there are some legitimately funny turns of the story. One such one is when a villain gets the perfunctory monologue about his 'real' plans cut-off by another dinosaur. And when the dinosaur action really kicks in, mostly in the last third, it has some umph to it and is directed slickly and with some tension.What the movie may be missing for me is a full-on 'wow' factor of it. For kids this movie may be the bees knees. For an adult, as I now am, it wasn't very scary (no no, no 'six-foot turkey' comments for now). By this I mean, even though the action is well-staged and it has that solid, Spielberg-sense of direction where you always know where everyone is, the surprises feel genuine, and if there's any excess it feels like it's all in the brazen fun of what the Jurassic series is, when the suspense happens it kind of comes quickly, like the Rex attacks. Part of this for me is that, as good as the CGI is here, I miss the practical dinosaurs of the Stan Winston age. Only once is there a dinosaur that is actually *there* on the screen, and it's for a moment where it would've been silly to have an animated one otherwise.This isn't to take away from how cool they do look, on the whole. There was never a moment where I thought any of the fakeness took away from the action. If anything the velociraptors, at least in close-up, look better than they ever have (in computer form, I should say). But this is a gripe that I couldn't shake, and still put it a notch below what the WETA folks did with the Apes movies - perhaps more on par with the work in Godzilla last year. As for the humans on screen, they all have charismatic and interesting actors, including Irrfan Khan as the new John Hammond (this time he can work a helicopter). Do they all get dimensions? Some more than others; the kids here basically have two molds, with maybe just a hint of bonding over the course of their escape-from-dinosaur peril. And one of the stranger things is to see BD Wong here, the only carry-over from 'Park', now as a corrupted scientist-engineer. It's like if I were to see Walter Peck in the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot: like, OK, cool, uh, hey again...Jurassic World does its job better than the previous two sequels - there's no real annoyances with the characters, or involving gymnastics or whatever - and is worthy of a matinée, adults and kids included. The best it could've been though is hard to say.",7,10,25,19 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," what scares us all is what we can't see...
","Paranormal Activity arrives to us in the multiplexes already becoming a hit. And how easy it is: its budget was ten grand, looks like it was shot for ten percent of that, and made a profit in just the first night of its limited-run midnight screenings across the country. Now as a bonafide hit (if not yet the Blair Witch sized phenomenon, though it's on its way to be just that), it comes as something one may be a little curious about at first but not entirely sure. Does it live up to the gargantuan hype? That depends on what you've heard: some adore the movie, have been scared s***less by it, and others, frankly, laughed at the end. But what it is is an effective ghost story put to film, taking with it the same 'it's not there but is it' film-making approach that made the original Val Lewton Cat People so scary.Seeing it in a packed audience has its ups and downs. The big up is that the audience, if properly primed or the right crowd (i.e. young people), will react to it like a ride in the guise of an minimalist exercise in suspense and tension. The big down is that... you're seeing a movie with a huge obnoxious crows that can't shut up or put away the cell phones. But those who want to be attentive to the movie do get rewards. Paranormal Activity provides its audience a 'this is happening' style movie. It's not in the same this-is-how-we-found-the-footage editing of Blair Witch or Cloverfield. It's more like a collection of clips and scenes that do add up, where Micah and Katie are living in a house and are (to put it nicely) bothered by a demonic spirit of some kind.Where it came from, why its hounded Katie for so long, why it hasn't taken her or done more damage over the years, are questions (if not entirely logical gaps) that will come to the viewer. One may even wonder, until its answered for us, why the couple just doesn't leave the house and get away from the spirit. What makes it work as a movie utmost is that it's a fresh take on familiar subject matter. We've seen stories of a possessed house, we've seen movies with possessed people, but not in a style that calls to mind Andy Warhol's film of a non-stop movie of a person sleeping on a bed for six hours straight. Paranormal Activity isn't as arty as that, but it does provide the same frame of reference: every night, it would seem, that the camera records in that same spot the tri-pod is on, things happen of a disturbing sort, from creaks in the night to lights turned on/off, to shadows, and finally slammed doors and bodies pulled out and bitten.The acting, for this kind of docu-horror movie, is pretty good if not always great or totally believable, and the set-up of the characters early in the film makes them sympathetic, simple middle-class characters. The director puts the audience in their shoes- or more-so Micah's shoes as someone who looks at this whole ghost/demon event night by night half-jokingly- and then lets it rip for what we don't see to be far more terrifying than showing anything (albeit the final shot of the movie is a true stunner, oddly enough it being Spielberg-inspired since it's a call back to Jaws by the way the audience reacted). Filling in the blanks and things-in-the-dark-what-the-hell-was-that scenes make up some of the best moments in horror movies, and first time director Oren Peli milks this style for all its worth. At its best, it's on par (or better) than Blair Witch.If nothing else, while not a perfect movie, I would hope that its chances at the box office top the upcoming fecal money-shot of Saw VI. I don't know how much either will make, but it would be nice if real horror and real scares won over torture porn with audiences again. A-",8,19,42,16 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," taking it on its own terms, the film is good overall, some great things, some not so great
","It's tempting as a critic to go straight for the easy route a compare/contrast the 1971 Mel Stuart adaptation of Roahl Dahl's classic book of children's fantasy, and the 2005 adaptation by Tim Burton. But I think it would be more beneficial for readers on this site to just discuss the film on its own terms, as best as possible. In the end, I found much of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be successful, but with some flaws/personal quips.On the technical side of the film, it's near flawless- Tim Burton is, indeed, one of only several visionaries working in the mainstream Hollywood system (mostly, I'd guess, out of his movies grossing so much over the years). In the compositions he chooses, in utilizing Alex McDowell's wonderful production design, in giving many of the scenes colors (or lacking in them) to heighten the mood, he has a distinctive style that doesn't seem to loose its energy, even in the less momentous (or overly so) parts of the film. Adding to that is the instantly recognizable music score by Danny Elfman, and the atmosphere is set to a good stance to Dahl's original story.With the acting side, the performances from the children are faithful to the book's descriptions, in particular Freddie Highmore as Charlie, with a genuine good soul in a sea of spoiled and rotten kids (and parents). All of this is fine, and then comes Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. If Gene Wilder in the 1971 version made Wonka his own, so does Depp, which is at the least to his credit. At times he can be hysterically funny, in just the little physical actions and facial expressions. He fits the eccentric, slightly off-putting qualities of Wonka well, but at times he also seems a little uncomfortable in the role.The script by John August gives, un-like in the book where a reader had to fill in the gaps, a back-story of Wonka's childhood and how he became the way he is. But it tries to explain too much, while at the same time not explaining enough. Only towards the end of the film does Depp give Wonka another side to him, and what I was left with was seeing an actor portraying a complex character in what should have been a not-so complex story. While Chistopher Lee in these back-story scenes is dependable as always, it seems a little too much to put on the plate- Depp can play weird well, but he can also play sincere, and the film doesn't give him good room to do his work on one more than the other.Burton can get brilliant with some of his excesses of the bizarre, but this time it becomes a little much. The Oompa Loompas, the strange little people who populate Wonka's factory, working for their beloved cocoa beans, are all clones in this film (I'm not sure that was how it was in the book, which is fine), and give elaborate, over-the-top, impromptu musical numbers following each of the children's demises (i.e. Augustus Gloop loving chocolate too much, Violet with the gum, et all). It wasn't so much of the portrayal of the oompa loompas that I thought didn't work- I found the scenes involving the Oompa's back-story in the jungle to be very funny- but they tend to be strange just for the sake of it to the story, and the musical numbers are so over-the-top, so inexcusable (in a Monty Python sort of way, not necessarily a bad thing in that context), that it interferes with the rest of the story. The rest of the film is not a musical except for when they appear, which also gives the film a little inconsistency.So at heart, I was glad that Burton was able to give an interpretation (granted by Burton and the filmmaker's claims it's not a remake of the 71 film) of Dahl's novel that gives room for criticism, as opposed to some of the recent flood of Hollywood remakes and adaptations that make me feel almost indifferent to how bland and average it is. Whatever faults I did have with the film, be it with the script or some of the performances, the pros tended to outweigh the cons, and that a director's imagination, when let loose properly, can make for an entertaining time. Much like with Burton's first film twenty years ago, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, his films work delights in original ways on kids as well as adults.",7,3,8,17 July 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Better than the first, really
","John Woo's MI2 is a great example of what one can do with a not to great 1st film and turn it into a terrific sequel.  Tom Cruise is better than last time with a new edge (especially in those fight and chase scenes).  Woo, being the virtuoso director of this genre, brings this film to a fever pitch that is to be expected from his films.  With a great soundtrack, this film may not be exactly the best memorial day film made, but it is worth a look-see.  Anthony Hopkins appears unbilled as Cruise's boss. A",6,0,5,3 June 2000
World Trade Center," good if you're looking for a memorial of heroism and courage, though short of really affecting
","Maybe part of my reaction to Oliver Stone's latest directorial effort, World Trade Center, is not totally the film's fault, or maybe it is, I still can't decide. Months ago I saw what I thought was the ultimate take on the pain, horror and bottomless grief that came from 9/11 with United 93, which took a full-on documentary approach with one particular story from that day and without a known cast or really well-known director made an incredibly emotional film. With World Trade Center, this time we get one of the chief directors working today with melodrama and heightened emotions, who more often than not does make it work for his goals. It also has a cast of known Hollywood actors, such as Nicholas Cage (as the star), Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Stephen Dorff, and Jay Hernandez among others. That matched with a story that has no real villains aside from the elements around them (i.e. a mountain of rubble), and given a more old-fashioned approach to the devastation, puts the film at more of a distance for the viewer. This is a respectable, well-made dramatization of the events of these two un-questionably brave policemen. If it isn't better than it could've been, it's because of its ambitions as a simply respecting, and sentimental detailing.This is not to say that Stone and first-time writer Andrea Berloff don't put up some very effective scenes. It's just that they often have to share time with material that, while probably not far from the truth, are too typical or diverting from what is compelling. For example, the early scenes as the chaos first comes up with the first plane hitting the tower, and the officers going in, is just the right pacing for this set-up material. When officers John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jemeno (Michael Pena) are under the rubble, which is very well constructed by Stone's designers for full authenticity, their scenes together are close to touching. Even a moment when Jesus comes into the picture via Stone's use of symbolism isn't lost on me. But it's in the cutting back to the families of the men where I started to feel the disconnect. I understand the purpose of showing the worrying, sorrowful wives and kids in this situation, but it becomes almost like filling up the running time, especially in the most unnecessary scenes of the film in the flashbacks showing both men before the incidents.This added with Stone's hit or miss tactic of visual melodrama makes the film lesser than it could be. But this is all personal gripes, and what I did expect from the film I did get. There are more than enough scenes that hit the buttons that should be met about the bravery and heroism of those who responded to the towers collapse. And Stone is tactful enough not to go all Michael Bay on us with his style (and, at the least, keep a kind of restraint that seems to be a good rebound after Alexander). He keeps his actors in a state of mind that fits the subject matter, and even in the moments that do border on being in a TV-movie (though in the end a stroke above a TV-movie), they're never un-true to what their characters need to be for the material. World Trade Center is meant to hit the mainstream movie-going audience, unlike the more independent-minded and un-restricted United 93, and for a mass audience it's just the right touch of pathos that's not too soon five years later.",5,5,13,11 August 2006
Black Snake Moan," a pure Blues movie, if not a great one, with Jackson in one of his coolest performances
","I didn't quite get what I expected from Black Snake Moan, but by the end I didn't mind too much either. I went into it thinking I was going to get a real low-down, Southern-Fried exploitation flick where race relations get turned around in a small town and the 'wickedness' that Sam Jackson's blues-man character is trying to rid of Christina Ricci's wily nymph would sort of parallel that. In short, pure, unadulterated outrageousness of the Sam Fuller White Dog variety. It goes without saying that the central 'gimmick' (and it is nearing a gimmick I think) of the chain around Ricci- and particularly one moment where Lazarus (Jackson) is letting out Rae (Ricci) for a walk like a dog around the his field he farms- is meant to be outrageous, as are the moments when Lazarus's young assistant farmer-boy walks in on the itching-for-sex Rae and gets jumped by him for 'it'. But really, the intelligence of Brewer's script and how he handles the characters is that we get to see these people not just as simple caricatures but as real people, with histories, and it actually becomes a story of redemption, for both Lazarus and Rae as well as Rae's anxiety driven dishonorably discharged army man Ronnie played by Justin Timberlake. These characters do have the blues, and their own personal discoveries are put against this gritty, small-town Southern setting.But there are two very important factors that Brewer has going for him not just in the dramatically sound and fairly original script: the music, which strikes up some of the best blues music I've heard in a long time (including the great usage of songs by the late R.L. Burnside, an epitome of true blues), and the performances from Jackson and Ricci (more so the former). Ricci goes on a brave route playing Rae, who has some skeletons in her closet (which provides the bare-bones of why she is 'this' way, even if it seems a little lacking for full psychological depth), and who is completely without inhibitions. That she is in panties and a small shirt for most of the movie is only scratching the surface, but it's definitely a high point in his career. But even more so this goes for Jackson, who taps into what makes him such a magnetic talent in American movies- he's super-cool, to be sure, especially when he's playing the blues songs (one he plays on stage at a blues night at a club brings out even funnier 'mother-f-ers' than one heard in Snakes on a Plane). Yet the range of emotions are on display just as well, with the hurt and wisdom, and the craziness that is sort of underlying Lazarus as well as a sinner-cum-bible thumper. It's certainly the best I've seen from him in years, possibly since he last teamed up in Tarantino's Jackie Brown.Not to say that Brewer doesn't come close to confusing what kind of movie he's making. One might wish he had made just a straight on exploitation film out of the 70s, where the roles get reversed from one of those 'Pam Grier in prison' flicks. And there are moments of that, and the more trashy side of my taste in movies almost wanted more of that. But I was also very pleased to see Brewer's maturity with the material as well, and in not going for the very big statements like a Paul Haggis or something. It's not even about it being a white woman and a black man- not that there isn't a moment or two that's obviously called into question by supporting characters- but about two lonely, psychologically screwed up folk who, if only by scratching the surface, un-earth things that have been going wrong for them: for Rae, her unwillingness to deal with commitment and her sexuality, for Lazarus his peace of mind and relationships with women and the Lord, and for Ronnie about what it means to be with someone like Rae. It's highly charged, darkly funny, and touching, and it's likely to be under the radar, albeit not without its cult audience.",8,6,12,4 March 2007
Black Hawk Down," One of Scott's best films, but not quite on my top 10 list for 2001
","Ridley Scott seems to have a knack for high intensity in movie-making (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Hannibal and Thelma and Louise among others come to mind) and Black Hawk Down, a war picture set in Somalia, is another prime example of his knack. Black Hawk Down is a war movie that does something I haven't seen much (or dare I say haven't seen at all) which is not going directly into the battle scenes, but instead keeping the audience in check with how the soldiers are reacting and feeling and never diverging much from the action. It is a daring move by Scott.In 'Down', a somewhat large group of soldiers are sent to the heart (or mindless brain) of Somalia to capture 2 lieutenants in regard to a civil war going on in the country that has taken 300,000 lives ('it's not war, it's genocide' comments the major general played by Sam Shepard). At first notice it seems like they can get in and out of the mission in a few hours...but then everything goes wrong. The Somalians start a near unstoppable attack on the U.S. soldiers, shooting as many as they can and sneaking out from roofs and sides like cockroaches. It becomes a chaotic day and night for the soldiers as they try to stay alive while waiting for extra troops to come in to rescue them that could take time to get there.Outside of the couple of flaws in the film (at the end it tells that 18 U.S. soldiers died in the attack but if you don't keep exact track it will seem more/the cinematography is alright however the editing cuts too much in the action and tension), Black Hawk Down is quite the war picture, one that will be memorable in years to come as the most accurate depiction of what went on with us in Somalia in 1993. Kudos to Scott and the cast; Ewan McGregor gets the highest praise from me if only for giving an amazing American accent. A-",9,10,16,21 January 2002
A Bug's Life," One of the Best Animated Films I Have Seen This Decade
","'A Bug's Life' was much better than I expected.  This film made by Disney and Pixar pictures has elements that are good for the whole family.  I think this film is the best animated film since Pixar's last film, Toy Story. Mainly because both films have a lot in common.  Both films look into groups that we usually don't think (or want to think) about and how they have to overcome the odds against their enemies.  Both films have great animation, comedy and entertainment.  This film is not as good as Toy Story just because Toy Story was the first of the computer age animation.  Yet, this film is still extraordinary and is one of the best films of 1998 (by the way, watch the credits for the first bloopers with bugs).",10,2,5,26 January 2000
Silence," Scorsese in Bergman/Dreyer mode, and it's amazing
","It's Scorsese. Martin Scorsese. He makes the best films. Is this one of his best? Hmm....It's a personal/religious epic, but it's all about the interior self - an intimate epic, which is always the toughest to pull off. Silence chronicles morality in such a way that is staggering and with very few specks of light (that is, brief relief through laughter - it does come through the character Kichijiro, more on him in a moment), and it's practically an anomaly to be released by a major studio with such a budget and big stars. This is a story that comes from history you rarely ever get to see anymore - history from a country like Japan that doesn't involve samurai (at least how we see them) and dealing with Christianity vs Buddhism - and it's directed with a level of vision, I mean in the true, eye-and-heart opening sense that declares that this man still has a lot to say, maybe more than ever, in his latter years.Silence is, now pondering it hours after seeing it, possibly the best 'faith-based' film ever made (or at least since Last Temptation of Christ); in its unintentional way, a great antidote to those pieces of garbage like God's Not Dead and War Room which preach only to a select few and insult the intelligence of everyone else. In this story of Jesuit priests who go on a journey to find a priest who may be long gone but could be found and brought home, it's meant for adults who can and should make up their own minds on religion and God, and the persecution part of it isn't some ploy from the filmmakers for fraudulent attention. This is about exploring what it means if you have faith, or how to question others who do, and what happens when people clash based on how people see the sun. Literally, I'm serious.It's also heavier than most other films by this director, which is good but also tough to take on a first viewing. And yet it feels always like a Scorsese film, not only due to the rigorous craft on display (I could feel the storyboards simmering off on to the screen, I mean that as a compliment, this is staggeringly shot by Rodrigo Prieto, I'm glad Scorsese's found another guy), or the performances from the main actors (Garfield is easily giving his all, and not in any cheesy way, Driver's solid, Neeson seems to be paying some sort of penance for some mediocre action fare), but because of a key character: Kichijiro.He's someone who really fits in to the Scorsese canon of characters who are so tough to take - he makes things difficult for Rodrigues, to say the least, and yet keeps coming back like some sad pathetic dog who can't make up his mind - but, ultimately, the toughest thing of all for this Father, as it must be for this filmmaker, is 'I know he is weak and irrational and probably bad in some way... but he must be loved as all of other God's children.' So as far as unsung performances for 2016 go, Yôsuke Kubozuka follows in a tradition set out by none other than De Niro (think of him in Mean Streets and Raging Bull, it's like that only not quite so angry).I may need another viewing to fully grasp it. But for now, yes, see it, of course. For all its length and vigorous explorations and depictions of suffering (occasionally highly graphic), not to mention the, for Scorsese, highly unusual approach of a lack of traditional (or any) music or score, it's unlike anything you'll see in cinema this year, maybe the decade, for pairing the struggle of a man to reconcile his God and his responsibility to others in a repressive regime with the visual splendor of something from another time - maybe Kurosawa if he'd had a collaboration with Bergman. And yet for all of this high praise, there's also a feeling of being exhausted by the end of it. Whether that exhaustion extends to other viewings I'm not sure yet. As a life-long 'fan' of this director, I was impressed if not blown away.",10,173,293,8 January 2017
For Love of the Game," easily the worst film Sam Raimi has directed yet
","I remember seeing For Love of the Game in the theater and thinking 'this isn't the same Sam Raimi that directed the Evil Dead trilogy and A Simple Plan, is just can't be.' It's one thing that it's a Kevin Costner movie, which in and of itself carries a certain formula that can take down director and ship with him. Maybe there might be some even die-hard baseball movie fans out there (baseball itself is cool, the movies from that can either hit or really miss) who might appreciate this film, but as that and as a romantic melodrama it's just, well, a shamble of formula, over-sentimentality, and over-wrought dialog. Some of the supporting acting isn't too terrible, as John C. Reilly and JK Simmons are usually hard to disappoint. But it's practically humorless, and (this is a bit subjective here) can be somewhat incredulous against Yankees fans. The premise itself could've worked- aging baseball pitcher does a perfect game while his romantic life has a checkered past. But Raimi isn't able to breathe that much life into the script, and the Hollywood feel of it just adds to its, well, blandness. It's not one of the worst movies of 1999, but it's a definite yes that I would not only not recommend it, but would steer clear of it if it came on TV again. Maybe as a piece of fluff it might just be a below satisfactory effort, but from Raimi it's emanates from me a big 'huh?'",4,1,3,23 April 2006
Logan," emotionally it gets it so right that one can mostly look over story flaws
","I have to wonder how people will react to Logan even a year from now, much less years from now, when some of the story flaws in this become more apparent. Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.All of this noted... this movie is really good. The reason for that is James Mangold, the director, taking a second (ahem, sorry, I can't resist) stab at this character and as it's the end he takes almost a rough R-rated Clint Eastwood 70's Peckinpah spaghetti-ish western approach to it all. And this is an BIG R rating, so parents take note, if you don't care about your kids hearing 'F' and 'S' words (and there's a lot of them, it's not like this got the rating for going over the 1 or 2 time minimum of PG-13 movies), then you might care about the various dismemberments, beheadings, stabs through the head, repeated stabbings *from children* onto nameless bad guys. Or maybe that won't be an issue either; in that case this is a dark tragic western for the whole family about a mutant who is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia-ish father figure with a little girl so they can find a possible Eden. If one feels a Children of Men vibe too I wouldn't say that was unintentional.But alongside Mangold's commitment to going for something we haven't seen before, what matters most in these movies to me more than the plot or stories more-often - the interactions of the characters, the emotional weight, how characters do (or don't) grow since, you know, once an a-hole always an a-hole - that works spectacularly. This is maybe the most deeply felt of the X-Men films, or at least as close as Days of Future Past was, as far as showing us how these characters are in great pain and danger and grappling with things, but we also get to see more dimension than before. With Xavier, for example, a lot of time in past movies (certainly the first three) while played by an actor with gravitas like Stewart, he was an exposition machine. Here, Xavier gets to show anger, resentment, sadness, pain, misery, confusion (genuinely, remember he's 90 here), and even a moment where he gets to help a farmer coral his horses (it's a minor but important one). And damn if Stewart doesn't deliver the goods; I can praise Jackman high as he does deserve it, and the young newcomer playing the mutant Julia is incredible (mostly in how she listens and her subtle moments in silences), this is Oscar-worthy s*** from Stewart.So I think if you have really enjoyed most over the years how the actors and characters have interacted the most, regardless (or regardful) of how it strays from the comics (a touch that gets commented on here, for better or worse), Logan gives that score with moving fashion. If you are interested in a coherent story, that's here too... up to a point. It's a good send off for these characters.",8,7,15,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Enough flies to make it worthwhile
","Let me start off about Ultron. Voiced (and performed, perhaps in mo-cap) by James Spader, he is a weird, robotic creation meant for peace and, instead, reverts to the ways of violence. Actually, that's not entirely true: Ultron gets all the information on what is up with his sorta-creator Tony Stark, and the world, and realizes there is a way to make peace: by getting rid of all the people on it. He may need some things for it, like the stone inside of Loki's scepter, and then he'll be ready to go. What's so refreshing with Ultron is that he/it's a villain who probably, no, for sure knows how twisted this is, and yet sees with such contempt what the Avengers are and stand for. That and being a sarcastic son of a b****. He's the sort of curse words that the heroes, in mock jest, tell each other not to say. You know, kids are watching! Age of Ultron is as BIG a spectacle as they come, with the action you come to expect from Marvel movies. The highlight for me is when the Hulk, influenced by the powers of the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, among many top shelf actors here), goes on a rampage in an African city, and the only one who can stop him is Tony Stark - as the HULKBUSTER. And yet for how ridiculous this sort of fight can get, as others in the film like when A.I.'s Ultron and the Vision (the later-model sort of hybrid of other alien stuffs whatever of Jarvis) go at it, Whedon makes the battles creative and refreshing.And there's even time out to, you ready for this, showing the superheroes going out of their way not only to make sure people are out of harm's way (much as they can, sometimes it can't be helped, though there's no R-rated stuff for here), they save people sometimes one by one. Though things certainly get melodramatic near the end - there may be death, there may be rather abrupt departures for characters for, you know, 'reasons' of the plot that aren't convincing - the writing is consistently clever and funny throughout. Genuinely funny I should say; you don't expect to get things like a Eugene O'Neil reference, but it does come at one point (whoops, does that count as a spoiler)? There can be gripes with certain decisions characters make, or that the film has both too much in it and not enough time to go even further with things - allegedly a director's cut is waiting for DVD. But this is the sort of case where I'm happier to get more rather than less, and there's a balance of strong character interactions and great dialog carrying things along. A relationship like the one that Banner and Natasha have shouldn't work - for some it might ring as false or rushed, like where was this in the first film(?) Whedon ultimately knows two things: we're invested already with these characters (and he's done his share in the first Avengers), and there's real pain and tragedy to how they connect. Could things be different if they weren't broken people, or thought they were, amid the heroic acts? Who knows? But the filmmakers put that in there just as we think it's ALL about the jokes and mayhem.Added to this are some wonderful new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - people who you don't know for sure will or won't be the villains, the 'puppets' for Ultron ironically enough - and reappearances by others in the gallery of characters from the past Iron Man and Captain America and Thor movies (Incredible Hulk... well, who knows). It's all so much you may take for granted that Downey is still a blast to watch as Stark, a man who is his own worst enemy and keeps screwing things up for his team. He's self-aware, terrible and wonderful, a jerk and a realist, and drives the story forward.So... yeah, good times all around, if less than great for reasons of certain plot issues, things that seem to go by so quickly you may need to watch it a second time, and characters that only get a sliver of screen time (i.e. Andy Serkis, and... Julie Delpy?!)",8,1,10,2 May 2015
Big Fish," The director- as well as character- as illusionist: a Tim Burton treat
","Director Tim Burton is notorious for his inventive, unique brand(s) of images he puts into his films, and a style that seems to regenerate in each film he does (though not always successfully- Planet of the Apes proved that).  Now there's Big Fish, a film loaded with visual spectacle, and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years.  Here he tells a story about storytelling, using both make-up, sets, and CGI at his disposal, and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others, whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.This man is Edward Bloom, played by both Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, and they both deliver wonderful work here as the dying Bloom still telling stories of adventures and the young Bloom playing them out, respectively. As do Billy Crudup as Edward's son William, who's grown weary of his father telling the story of his birth (involving a catch of a big fish), among many others, and all he wants now at his deathbed is the truth.  Jessica Lange is also dependable as Edward's wife Sandy, the love of each other's lives.What's so alluring about the world Burton creates (based on the novel by Daniel Pierce, which I imagine must be loaded with vivid description) is that he simply builds on the world Edward created for his and his family's amusement.  Stories like the visit to the town of Spectre, and that town's most known poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in one of the film's highlighted supporting roles); the years spent working for nothing in the circus for Amos (Danny DeVito, another note of interest) just to know more about Sandy, whom he sees frozen in time; his stint in the war, etc.  All of the people and environments that are reveled are done so with many visual effects, but they're the kind that help build on Burton's vision instead of depleting it.  Even if a scene may have dialog or acting that could be taken as over the top, the storytelling is on par with some of Burton's best work (i.e. Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and even the somewhat recent Sleepy Hollow).  The best thing that can be said about Big Fish, even to those who might not like it, is that the journeys and stories taken in the film, by real and 'elaborated' real characters, generate a film as a delight for all ages. That it also has comedy along with drama (grounded in a sense of humanity for both) is also a feat accomplished well by the actors.  To me, this is one of the better films of the year.

The Insider," Riveting
","Michael Mann's The Insider is a well done drama that looks into whistle blowers and the truth.  The film isn't fast paced or electric, but the way it is put together gets my attention.  The acting, the directing, the photography and the atmosphere bring this film to a fine touch (not to mention 7 Oscar noms).Based on a true story, the film circles on a scientist (played great in an Oscar nominated role by Russel Crowe) who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and a persuasive TV producer (played well by Al Pacino) wants him to tell on his news show 60 Minutes about what effects smoking does to your body. What the film shows is a startling trip in 2 parts- 1: scientist Jeffrey Wigand's trouble with being a whistle blower (he wound up losing everything, but gaining everything); 2: producer Lowell Bergam's struggle to get Wigand's testimony on 60 Minutes without being sued.  And it is well done. Not the best films of the year because of a few flaws, but it is a definite winner.  A+",10,3,6,19 March 2000
Major League," Yes Yes Yes
","This is one of the best baseball sports films ever made.  Notg because it exactly depicts the tradition of baseball.  Mainly because of a pitcher who can throw a ball at 96 mph at a guys head, a vodoo guy who doubts Jesus Christ's curve ball skills, and a guy named Willy Mayes Hayes who can run like haze but hit like s***.  These are the original comedy things added to this great baseball film about the new owner of the Cleavland Indians who wants the team to finish dead last so she can sell the team.  That is until the team (which includes Tom Berenger, Cornin Bernson, Charles Cyphers, Wesley Snipes and Charlie Sheen) changes all that.  Incredibly funny, and it gets better with each viewing.  My favorite moment, when Hays (played by a good newcomer named Wesley Snipes) finds out he made the Indians and just runs outside and goes (Owwwww, yes yes yes).  A+",7,4,8,5 August 2000
The Dark Knight," Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, all hit it out of the park
","I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole 'Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance' hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real 'origin' story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are 'jokingly' referenced that 'my dad did this, 'my wife did this'), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than 'I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here'). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the 'white knight', someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking 'say it isn't so', and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure 'fun' of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.",8,12,24,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," one of the best Harry Potters yet!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has a gripping main story involving the continuing peril for Harry and his arch nemesis, the dark lord Voldermort (Fiennes, as sinister as possible), but what surprised me a little was seeing that there's even a kind of political subtext to the story at Hogwarts. This is personified by the ministry's new professor-cum-control freak Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), who teaches theory instead of practice, and is every ultra-harsh, practically laughable disciplinarian you've ever had the horror to have over your heads. Odd for some other 'kids' movies (save for Happy Feet), but for the Harry Potter universe the foreboding presence of the ministry makes the feeling of the dread that Potter has to face that much more pronounced, as a feeling of helplessness spreads out amongst everyone in the society despite the message from the messenger that 'everything's fine'. Staunton is perfect in the role of Umbridge, and helps to make the character as part of the ranks of those played by Alan Rickman (?), Gary Oldman (not really), and Ralph Fiennes (for sure) as one of the most dastardly figures in the Potter universe. Though she may even be more chilling, even as a momentary figure, because of what she represents for those who need to practice magic first hand.The sense of rebellion with the Hogwarts school is a solid facet for the Order of the Phoenix storyline, and except for a tiny sub-plot involving Harry and Cho Chang, and some of the visuals involved when the kids finally take over during a big exam (kind of like a super-magical version of the Another Brick in the Wall music video), it's a great balance for the much darker elements at work. There's another facet, aside from strong performances (Radcliffe, by the way, is really coming into his own more than ever), which is that David Yates- primarily a director of British television- imbues a lot of extraordinary imagery here. Mostly, because, he makes what could be another 'kids' movie, as the first two films were, and makes a gradual progression from the third and fourth installments into the realm of a sort of pop-surrealism; the image of Voldermort at the train station moving his neck around could be out of a stark painting, same for the 'mystery' room that serves for the climax of the film. It's much more sophisticated than one might expect, albeit some typical flashbacks used in the realm of the conceit that Voldermort screws around with Potter's mind a lot, and it's certainly the first time since 'Azkaban' that the direction and the script are at levels of quality that one might not expect in a big summer blockbuster. There's nuance in this struggle of good vs evil, and it's worth seeing it in the theater if only on that level.And as foreboding and cryptic and always with the ominous foreshadowing- unless you've read Half-Blood Prince (from which I've heard, as I haven't read any of the books, is even *darker* than any of the others combined, with even truly disturbing imagery)- as Phoenix can get, there's still a sense of it being a crowd-pleaser. I liked the scenes where Hagard shows Potter and the others his half-brother, a huge ogre that marks as the least essential character story-wise but is a lot of fun to watch, and the scenes with Potter and the others in their secret training rooms gives the movie a sense of purpose for the audience to follow along. In a strange way there is some hope in Order of the Phoenix, though one needs to find it, and not in the way that the one 'we don't mention' would go about it.",8,2,10,15 July 2007
Into the Wild," overlong and precious, also marvelous cinematography and solid turn by Emile Hirsch
","Christopher McCandless, in a manner of existential terms, had it all really. He graduated from college, had $24 grand in tuition, and a possible future law career. He could do anything he wanted with his life. So, he followed his passions, mixed perhaps with some escapist connotation involving a wounded family history, and left on a solo trek across the 'wild' of America, eventually on a quest to Alaska. At that point, he used what little knowledge he had to live off the land, hunt for game, and be one with nature while camping out of an abandoned 'Magic Bus' vehicle. It's here that we see the story, told in a somewhat typical non-linear form, take shape around the intellectual scope of a quintessential Thoreau wannabe.In Into the Wild, Sean Penn's treatment of this man- who, eventually, died of poison-cum-starvation- this is a quest that is made interesting by the people that Christopher (sorry, Alexander Supertramp) meets along the way, which include some hippies in a van (an earthy Catherine Keener one of them), a very young Joan Mitchell type (Kristin Stewart), and blue collar worker (Vince Vaughn), and the proverbial 'wise old man' (Hal Holbrook, easily my favorite of the lot). They help bring a human dimension to what would otherwise be a guy, somewhat but not quite disillusioned by a particular American society, walking around in a state of being that calls one back to the discussion between Jules and Vincent over 'walking the Earth' in Pulp Fiction.Is he just a 'bum', or is a true risk-taker? Or is it just all, as Christopher at one point admits, for a possible future book to come out of this? These questions arise, and some others, as Penn tries to question himself what kind of audience is coming to see his film. Will they easily pass judgment on a kid in over his head and not prepared for full-blown saga out of Jack London, or as someone who sadly lost the good fight against all reasonable responsibilities as a common, law-abiding citizen? Luckily, Penn did cast just right for us to want to be with this character, as Emile Hirsch has the qualities of strength and vulnerability so that he doesn't make him unsympathetic (which, for this sort of character, could be easy to do), but keeps him grounded and strong and, simply, just right for the part in this context.The only problems come with Penn, as a director, taking flights of pretentious fancy with his style. Part of the problem with taking on a tale of going out to nature is there's the tendency for the visuals to outweigh some of the narrative strengths. It's reminiscent more of his work on the Crossing Guard (though not as much), and there are some passages and montages and those chapter breaks and yellow words streaming across the screen that do mark it as original but not necessarily driving much with the story. If it's poetry he was looking for, it's not achieved with the utmost beauty or grace, despite the marvelous moments that he and his director of photography grasp the many landscapes. And, as the greatest asset, Eddie Vedder on the soundtrack- who's songs might even be better than the movie itself- compliment the nature of the character but also sounding fine as stand-alone songs or guitar numbers.So, take a trip into this moral conflict that strikes up Into the Wild as a worthwhile effort, if not a masterful one, and see what it's like to be young and escaping and living life to the fullest, if not the smartest.",7,2,7,23 May 2008
Annie Hall," it's better than I remembered.
","(Re-review 2011): I was telling my wife after seeing the movie again, for what I'm sure is only about the 20 or 30th time (and stuff just keeps getting funnier every time I see it), that while it is great, it's great in a very loose, sketchy-comedy kind of way. It has a story, and it's never hard to follow even as it jumps around (it even has, as we say in 'screenwriter-lingo', good 'plants' and 'pay-offs' with certain mentions of stuff), but it's not really about that. I have to figure it's cause Allen originally had a *three-hour* movie on his hands, that was Annie Hall and Manhattan Murder Mystery - or what would become of that.Oddly enough, I have to think that Allen canned the Manhattan Murder Mystery footage due to it, you know, not working, and then he and his fantastic editor Ralph Rosenblum made the film we have today out of all the sweet and funny relationship/cultural-awareness jokes that were in the story anyway. I'd be curious to see that footage though; in a way, when Allen finally made Manhattan Murder Mystery, he probably didn't change what he and Marshall Brickman originally wrote, he likely just grafted that script and then re-shot it (in some part as he was creatively pre-occupied at the time due to the Mia Farrow divorce going down). So, ultimately, Manhattan Murder Mystery is like his The Man Who Knew Too Much, a remake of his own material. But I digress.It's Woody Allen. It's Diane Keaton. It's Paul Simon in disco gear talking about chilling with 'Jack and Angelica'. It's Jeff Goldblum forgetting his mantra. It's Christopher (bleep) Walken on vacation from planet Wiseau. And it's Marshall MacLughan talking about fallacies and so on.Boy, if life were only like this.",10,4,8,11 March 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," Girls will like it, I guess
","This chick-flick remake of One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest does not live up to the hype it is presented with.  It barely lives, but not completely.  It is supported by the two actresses- Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie (Jolie got an Oscar nod for her performance) who work great together as patients in a mental home in the late 60's.  Funny at points, dramatic (maybe too dramatic) and poignant, this film is good, but don't expect a Cukoo's nest. Why?  Because the main character Susanna (Ryder) doesn't hole the same embodyment and character that Jack Nicholson did.  Still, it isn't as bad a some people might make you think.  I'm sure guys who watch this film with their girlfriends will not be pleased by it, but their girls will be.  One of the best menatl home films ever, nevertheless.  A-",7,1,2,9 June 2000
Green Street Hooligans," mostly a lean and tough action-drama with intense characters and melodrama
","Green Street Hooligans (or just Hooligans for short) is a feature that announces a new female director, Lexi Alexander. Like Kathryn Bigelow, she's not a director of romantic comedies or (I hate to use this term but I will) chick-flicks, but someone who understands how to get the same kind of grit and testosterone that any gifted male action director could get from his cast of actors. In this case Alexander's tough skin is fitting: her subject matter are 'soccer hooligans', or more specifically those who form in gangs in pubs and fight out in the streets with other gangs representing respective teams. It's a whole system that is far more aggressive (and 'pissed' aka drunk) than a typical group of sports fans like one would find in the States, but it's not quite as ruthless as a gang like crips and bloods either.The Hooligans of the GSE fight and act like a gang for status, not for profit, and this is the way of things when Matt (Elijah Wood), a Harvard dropout, lands in England and somehow befriends his brother in law's brother Pete (Charles Hunnam). He's taken along to the pub, then to a football/soccer match, and then proves his worth the best way he can: he gets in his first real fight-cum-brawl in the streets with some other soccer hooligans. From then in the film becomes a story of friendship and eventual betrayal from a scorned member of the GSE, who doesn't like Mike from the start and feels taken aback by his best friend Pete's connection to a practical family member.It's also about the way that the male brain works in such situations: Matt is a very smart guy, being from Harvard and all (and sort of hiding a secret as a journalist major - a big no-no in hooligan gangs, being a 'Journie' as its called), but he can go into this violent state of being because it's part of a clique, and part of being part of a group where everyone looks out for everyone else - which he doesn't get from his sister (Forlani) or his absentee father. Alexander works best with her cast of characters and actors when they're in the pub and out on the streets, with the camaraderie so easy to just turn on a dime - the intensity is thick always, even in one of those big sing-alongs like with the GSE's 'theme song' out in the streets. It also helps that Wood is better than usual and Brit character actors like Hunnam and Geoff Bell impress very much, very much in the mold of a gangster movie (a good one).The only big drawbacks are some unneeded exposition with the narration popping up a few times. Once is too often really, as it doesn't add anything aside from the 'I learned this and blah blah' material. And the final brawl, which shot well, is saddled with a cringe-worthy song that kills the energy and features so much melodrama (and an understandably tragic conclusion) that it's just too much. But in general, this is a fine and hard-knocking 'Cockney' flick- watch for that slang- and great if you've never heard of a soccer hooligan and want to take a look. 7.5/10",7,2,2,1 November 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," the proverbial 'good' science fiction movie- meant to be seen on a BIG screen
","Years from now, when quite possibly film studios decide that filming and screening motion pictures for theatrical distribution no longer will work out financially and make everything for DVD and TV and, Lord help us, cell phones and I-phones, 2001 will remain as one of those reminders of what would be eternally lost. If films like this can be made on celluloid and *intended* to be screened in full 70mm or 35mm glory for all to see in a packed theater, then there should be hope.Because, as it stands, Kubrick's masterwork, aside from being the rare landmark to be an attempt at transmogrifying the form of film itself (as Spielberg once noted, it's not entirely drama or documentary or science fiction), is all fine and well on TV, particularly in full widescreen DVD. But, at the least for those who have problems with the film (and it's not hard to have them), it could be a universal likelihood that it's so much a pure visual experience, so visceral and surreal and all 'als', that it deserves no less than to be seen at least once up tall on a screen too many feet tall (and, fingers crossed, someday on IMAX?) 2001 has caused more debate than during presidential primaries. What the hell is up with this movie? The fact that we question it- and, perhaps, even ourselves for why we thought the way we did- is part of the experience, and the mystery, and depending on how much or how little you're willing to take on that mystery will determine what you think of the film. Is the monolith really an alien, or some nothingness that one can project whatever on to? Why does it make the high-pitched sounds on the moon when made into photo-fodder? Where is that crazy room that Bowman goes to at the end? And don't get me started on the 'star child'. It's all of this that, for me, makes it so unforgettable, and something that enriches the experience the more times its revisited.To be fair, even as much of a Kubrick nut I am, it's hard to say that I wasn't bored the first time seeing it at the age of 12 and not used to sci-fi/fantasy that went this... well, slow isn't the word exactly, but meditative, patient, like a story that is in no need to rush itself in lieu of the stylistic choices of the director. But a few years later, it worked better, then better still. While it goes without saying that it might just fall flat for some time and time again, for me it's one of those things like a marvelous piece of music, where revisiting it is part of the enjoyment of familiarity, but at the same time you might rediscover something else, or you might have even changed since the last time.It's surreal, trippy, courageous, revelatory, frustrating, bewildering, and firmly structured. From the continuously mind-blowing visual fx by Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull, from the ominous presence of HAL 9000(possibly as the eventual continuation of a bone thwacking ape), from every careful but broad-stroked piece of direction and subtle piece of acting, it's popular art at a high water mark. It's probably not the greatest of all films, but many others can only hope and try their absolute best to reach the levels Kubrick and Clarke reached, how it plunged the aspirations of what is 'out there' among the stars and the galaxy to an intellectual point via the confounding magic of cinema (yes, I used the word magic).",10,4,10,13 January 2000

Blood Diamond," a message picture, sure, but a good one, with strong leads
","Surely Edward Zwick is no stranger to tackling big hot-button topics (the most prominent for me is the Siege where terrorism and martial law in the US) and merging them with 'old-fashioned' studio values. Old fashioned meaning that we can expect something of a happy ending, if not for everyone involved then for the more important characters in the lot. Here we're given much more bloody, graphic violence though, with plenty a curse to be found as well, plus some disturbing subject matter, like with children being taught to shoot at younger and younger ages in countries abroad. But it's a reality too that Zwick and his team are capturing with Blood Diamond, a dramatic thriller about the corrupt system that was (or maybe still is) in effect in Africa where diamonds get shipped across country lines, then get transferred to the rest of the world, but not without the share of multiple casualties, to confusing lengths (appropriately so). It carries it's message in tow throughout, particularly at the end hammering it in like a hangover. But aside from this, and a couple of rushed bits in the script and storytelling, it's a solid picture with some terrific performances.Although I'd still go with Leonardo DiCaprio's turn in the Departed as his best role of the year (though it goes without saying that it might be my favorite from him so far as an actor anyway), his work in Blood Diamond is not to be scoffed at in the slightest. He's a man through and through here, which may be undermining his work in his 20s, but here at the least he seems poised completely to be a rugged action hero, or a tough one to be sure, who can kick ass and get the job done while also having a touching arc to his tormented, cynical character Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. When he finds out about a very big diamond hidden by Solomon, played by Djimon Hunsou, in assuredly- if I had to guess in shallow terms- an Oscar contending performance for his overall compelling nature. Solomon also lost his family during a raid by rebels who wiped out most of his village. He finally finds most of his family in a refugee camp thanks to Danny and Maddy (Jennifer Connolly, good if not stellar, though not with as much to do), a tough and one-sidedly moral journalist. But his son is not there, and has been indoctrinated into the ranks of the young rebels with guns, whom now he has to strike a deal with Danny- diamond for son, son for diamond, a fair trade it might seem, as Danny just wants to get out of the maelstrom of wretched violence and death that comes with his job.All of this then is done in a slick, professional style by Zwick and his crew, and that isn't at all problematic (if at times feeling rushed with the script, though definitely Zwick is still a good leap ahead of other contemporaries in the Hollywood action-film department). The story does lurch forward oddly in a couple of spots, mainly in how Danny and Solomon agree to be partners finally- in the midst of an all out street battle. And there's one scene towards the end of Danny & Solomon's journey- following Solomon reunited with his boy (and the subsequent quasi-deprogramming of the son's killing skills, which is very effective as an emotional scene)- that didn't seem too believable to me. But it's the performances and the heightened atmosphere of suspense in the air of a f****-up environment and topic that make it a worthwhile movie. Even when a story point seemed on the verge of total contrivance, I was always wrapped up in what the filmmakers and the actors were trying to convey, so there was always that emotional connection. It doesn't rise surprisingly above to task like the Last Samurai, Zwick's last flick, but it was a very good time throughout, particularly with one unexpected scene involving an animal carcass.One thing's for sure- you'll be a little more questioning when you look at your local jewelry store for that next big present. 7/10",7,2,3,19 December 2006
Men in Black," Clever and Smart. One of the best film of 1997
","Steven Spielberg's Men in Black is one of the few summer block-busters that actually make a smart impact, and I liked it.  The film looks into aliens but this time It's a comedy with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith (who actually work good).  The comedy includes the conceiling of extra-terrestrial life in New York.

The Graduate," A film that still holds up thirty-six years later, though not to the fullest extent it's hyped to be
","The Graduate, when released in 1967 (i.e. Summer of Love 1967), was a stirring, hugely entertaining event for the generation that embraced sex, drugs, rock and roll, more sex, more drugs, and then, for the most part, became what the parents wanted Benjamin to be.  That's the only reason The Graduate doesn't hold up like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, or Five Easy Pieces- Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock, while as keen and funny an uneasy and unsure young man can get, isn't exactly a representation of a time capsule of the angst, rebellion, and freedom of characters like Wyatt and Billy or Robert Dupea.  He's more of a representation of the common suburbanite male , who feels all the pressure of parents and their friends, and is in the conflicts of love, lust, and livelihood.  It's questionable whether or not Benjamin would leave the comfort of the pool he dwells in for free-love concerts and LSD.And yet, Oscar winning director Mike Nichols realizes that the story of the torn young man is prime for certain experimentation, not only in the dialog and mannerisms of his actors (which, especially from Hoffman, are hilarious), but from the techniques he uses in Robert Surtees' camera-work and Sam O'Steen's editing tricks.  Most notable of these techniques are the following: the subliminal nudity when Mrs. Robinson first 'reveals' herself to Benjamin, the mis-en-scene/positions of the characters in certain scenes and moments (i.e. when Elaine finds out about the affair and Mrs. Robinson says 'Goodbye, Benjamin', look how the camera pulls back on her and how she's a complete 180 from how she was in the first seduction); a jump cut from a swim in the pool to a moment in bed that's up there on the list with the bone turning into the ship in 2001; the way the over-head shots on Benjamin when he's at the college how he seems dwarfed among the rest of the world; and one of the finest climaxes of the sixties with the quick close ups of the attendees mouthing their curses and slander at the frantic Benjamin on the window.  As a film in and of itself, there's much to look for in repeat viewings that give extra hints on some emotions or intentions from the director or writer.And then there are the performances.  Hoffman, as mentioned, is splendid in how he balances between stingy and awkward, scared and determined, and that he's the center-point in a largely first person (late) coming of age tale. And his counterpart for nearly half of the movie, Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, has a balancing act of her own- she can be alluring, demanding, sweet (with a vodka in hand), and sour, and in that sense she's the most fascinating character of the film.  She has the persona of a stern mother who's wanting to feel a little rebellious herself, and finds moments of relief with the son of her best friends.  The one performance that doesn't work today or back in the day for that matter, however, is Katharine Ross' Elaine Robinson.  While she's not like her mother, she is at her will before and after she finds out about a secret she's been hiding.  She's set to marry a blonde jock, and, until the climax, is like a puppet.  It's the least convincing character and performance of the lot, and a certain scream she has in a scene is a little too scathing for comfort.  Murray Hamilton (of Jaws fame), for the short amount of time he's on screen, is near impecable.So, would I reccommend The Graduate for younger audiences?  Yes I would, it has the classic comedy-of-manners that is instantly recognizable, in particular as an influence on the American Pie movies (coincidentally, Jason Biggs portrayed Benjamin on Broadway), and is a good starter for those who have an interest in what the old man and old lady were watching when cool was solid.  Would I reccommend it for those from the generation that cherished it and made it part of American film history?  Hard to say and here's why, some may wonder why they enjoyed it so much when the characters may have lost their 'edge', and others will love it as much as they did when it first premiered.  I'd say it's worth the view, if only for the wedding scene, and for those three little diddies by Simon and Garfunkel.  Grade: A (like a 93 or 94)",10,8,15,5 August 2003
Singin' in the Rain," unequivocally the best American musical-comedy out of (and about) the Hollywood Golden age
","Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain embraces conventions and self-reflection like it's the most wonderful things that can be accomplished with a musical-comedy. It's knowing so well of everything that made up the Hollywood musical- and the bumpy transition from silent film to sound- and always gives a wink and a nod while retaining as a form of pure cinema, in a sense, by giving into its gleeful archetypes. It's also, surprisingly, very smart and witty for a comedy, with its goofy and cornball moments well earned thanks to the earnest effort put into looking so effortless and totally fantastical. It's a fantastical sensibility that can only come out of the movies, the escapism of smitten romances, eccentric characters, and a more contemporary spirit than one might expect (one ends up laughing at how risquÃ© the humor can get, and how guiltlessly silly). And ultimately, it breaks ground, like Citizen Kane, using all of the songs, tricks and superlative technical additives at the disposal of the artists to make a film/amalgam a marvel on all fronts. To put it in a more direct way, if you don't feel happy once this movie ends, it may be time to hit up the the doctors for some heavy medication.The story is like a double-edged sword, where the world of film-making and musicals get their just due in being revealing and reveling in the history of it all. Two movie stars (Kelly and Jean Hagen) of the silent era on high acclaim, who really shouldn't be together, get put to the task of there being a new medium: the sound picture, where people need to talk into the microphone, big physical acts and motions of the grandiose don't quite fit, and the dialog needs to make sense- through strong voices. After a disastrous test screening, a new plan is hatched- that the leading lady, the wonderfully high-strung and 'dumb' Linda, be dubbed over from her squeaky voice to the impeccable voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Adding in the musical sequences, and tweaking it a bit, make it a total hit, but at what cost? This is the broad stroke of the story, anyway, but there's much more to Singin' in the Rain than the usual double-crossings and cynicism to the Hollywood 'dream factory'.All the humanity that the principle characters feel, be it humor ('Make em Laugh' is a classic number), or in love (the sweet song behind the Dali-esquire set behind Kelly and Reynolds), or in just enjoying what the world has to offer ala 'Good Morning'), gets expressed through song and music, with the title song given a classic form of song and dance expression- as elsewhere in the film- as the camera gets its chances for going into the vibrant style, but also is patient in just capturing all the music on all fronts. On top of being such a sharply crafted comedy, with practically all of the jokes hitting levels of hilarity few musicals could aspire to today (usually in part to Donald O'Connor's determined comic relief and levity), Kelly creates indelible images of choreography, in painstaking detail of foot-work and in the timing of movement with the characters. This all reaches its nexus in a sequence that's all the more brilliant considering it's not even a filmed scene within the film, but that it's the visualization of the idea behind a musical sequence in the film, as Kelly pitches it to his producers. It's loaded with bits of sensuality one wouldn't expect in a 1950s movie (look at those legs!), and encompassing all of the juicy, delightful bits in the crossroads between Broadway and Hollywood musicals. You can lose yourself in this sequence, and always with a big grin at the proceedings. Even towards the end it doesn't lose sight of its 'movie-ness', yet critiquing the nature of the business amid the magic that comes out of it. So get ready to tap your feet and, if inclined, sing along to what serves as the perennial feel-good movie, a work of popular art that has some serious questions in the subtext and never relents to let the audience have a good time at the absurdity of it all- a master's class in absurdity, artificiality, and a love of all things Golden-Age-Hollywood. Think of it as the musical-comedy side of the coin to the dark film-noir coin of Sunset Boulevard; both question what it is to work and stay pertinent in the Hollywood system, but where one treats Hollywood with tougher satire and darker themes, the other goes the route of everything being so fake that it resembles a reality of a fluffy, knowing and kidding dream. An essential of 50s cinema.",10,3,6,31 March 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," an modern artistic triumph for all involved
","Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of 'little' Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind). He understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn't want them all to be erased.As I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could've gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn't necessary. But it's an asset that the story doesn't start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Valdís Óskarsdóttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn't a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.But then there's one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.There's not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It's one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade.",10,376,457,27 October 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," A sprawling, deliberately paced, and generally a superbly crafted piece of work
","It's been said that when one watches a 'spaghetti' western (one of the 'Man with no name' films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good. It's a story of life-long friends, in the tradition of the Godfather movies with obvious differences, and the story cuts back and forth to Noodles (De Niro) in his old age returning from exile, looking back on his childhood in Brooklyn, his rise to power with his partners, and the twists come quite unexpectedly. The pace is slow, but not detrimental, and it gives the viewer time to let the emotions sink in. The story is also non-linear, and yet doesn't give away facts to the viewer- this is something that more than likely influenced Tarantino (and many others) in style. By the end, every detail that has mounted up makes the whole experience rather fulfilling, if not perfect. Finally, I'd like to point out the exceptional musical score. Ennio Morricone, as it says on this site, has scored over four hundred films in forty years, including Leone's movies. This would have to be, arguably, one of his ten best works- his score is equally lively, saddened, intense, and perhaps majestic for a gangster epic. Overall, it's filled with the same spirit Leone had in directing the picture, and it corresponds beautifully- there are some scenes in this film that would simply not work without the strings.

Taken," turn off your brain for the good 'good-God-do-they-expect-me-to-believe-that' Besson production
","On facebook there is an event coming up I believe in June which is called 'National Man Day', which will be a day for all men everywhere to feel and act like 'Men', whatever that is. If there are any screening rooms available for this kind of created event, Taken could be a good choice as a movie to screen. It's a preposterous action movie fantasy that has a good dosage of Jason Bourne and surprisingly, and not offensively, some conservative connotations in it. Yes, conservative: where else will we get a France-is-evil tome that also includes a sex-slave trade (which, apparently, is based on real things going on in Europe right now) complete with deflowered girls the highest marker- yes, American girls, go to France and you will be sold into the sex trade- for Albanians or whomever the immigrants are with the can-do American government bad-ass with one step removed from Jack Bauer and a penchant for torture when it suits best.Sound not like your cup of manly kill-kick-ass tea? Then look away and read no more. But if you're still with this, well, you know what you're in for, sort of. This is another vehicle by Luc Besson, as writer and producer, to use Paris as a backdrop for a crazy plot designed to give whoever star it is- usually Jason Statham- a run for his money for the good of the entire audience as super-violent escapist fare. The plot, with Liam Neeson's retired government agent who has a strength comparable to both Jason Bourne and Batman having to go to France after his daughter is kidnapped along with a friend, is of not much consequences as we've seen it in other molds and folds before, sometimes in sleazy packages or straight-to-video deals (one may wonder where Chuck Norris is when you need him).But the plot actually becomes a little more believable, or at least acceptable, because of or in support of the presence of Liam Neeson. He's such an underrated presence today in movies, popping up when a director has the right mind to use him (yes, he was even pretty good in Phantom Menace), and in this case director Morel and Besson have here an action hero who shows weariness and real conflict on his face. He's not the first person you'd think to play Brian, but he's the right person for what he can bring to the part. He's tough as nails but isn't chiseled or completely stone-cold like Daniel Craig. There's something else going on, like he's thinking and makes us think with him as he crashes through glass and kicks and punches and shoots and strangles and bamboozles dozens of gangsters and baddies. He helps make Taken something of a wonderful contradiction: believably unbelievable all the way through. You know this guy can do these things because, frankly, he just can.As my own mother, God bless her, said after seeing the movie: it gives a good enema to the brain. She meant that as a compliment, I suppose.",7,6,9,30 January 2009
This Is Spinal Tap," Hello Cleaveland! Still one of the funniest films ever and even better on DVD
","Spinal Tap seemed funny the first time I saw it, but I never got all the jokes.  Now though, I saw it through and through and I loved it even more (especially on DVD where the extras are hilarious).  Nearly every gag in the movie is dead pan funny, from the cover of 'Smell the Glove' (just the description will make you laugh) to all the others including the three piece guitar solo, the animal costumes ('this is what you'll look like as a crab' is the funniest line of the 80's next to 'Frank, they're not here for you, Weird Al is on the plane' in Naked Gun), the backstage food, (of course) the amp that goes to 11 and the 18 inch stonehenge.  Satire at one of it's best, and it's excellent.  Cameos include Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Paul Schaffer and Anjelica Houston.  Other best line: you can not do free flow jazz odyssey in front of a festival crowd!  A+",10,76,109,28 May 2001
Alice in Wonderland," bizarre (and not-so bizarre) eye candy, an ideal cast, uneven results
","Tim Burton should be ideal to direct an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's stories set Through the Looking Glass. And, as it turns out, he is. But this is not a real 'Alice' story like we've seen before. It feels more like a Wonderland story by committee, the sequel, where Alice returns at the age of twenty, has some disassociation from her first time down the rabbit hole, and is told 'it is written' or whatever that she has to face the Jabberwocky, and slay it. It's not that the story is entirely bad, but the way that the screenwriter Linda Woolverton puts it, nothing is really fresh the way one might hope for. The designs go some way to change things up, mostly on the human characters, and it usually looks pretty and bright and dark and ominous and surreal. Which is just right. But the story needed work, an injection of the 'less-business-as-usual' juice.It's hard to exactly pinpoint, but I can give some guesses. For one thing, Burton's film is in large part set in a CGI landscape. One misses the days when Burton would film on breathtaking sets like in Batman or Edward Scissorhands. I'm reminded of the criticism of the Star Wars prequels, which I have made from time to time, that the computer effects drown out the potential human elements or things of interest in the story. I might be able to cut some more slack to the film if it weren't so beholden to the HUGE CGI effects (one wonders if Wonderland all took place behind blue-screen, certain actors included). It's hard to ignore, however, how rigid everything seems, from the attack from that big dog-like creature with the missing eye, to the Jabberwocky itself, barely saved by an all-too-brief voice appearance from Christopher Lee.This shouldn't be entirely to Burton's discredit, however. Here, like on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one sees Burton still has some skills brought over from his days as an animator from Disney. Something is just missing after a while, though, a general focus of the effects assisting the story, of which the story is already kind of generic (some have compared to Narnia, though I saw more Lord of the Rings). After a while it's like Burton seems to be more interested in the little things, the garnishes that he lays about in his auteur fashion, leaving the big effects and 'sets' to his crew. One of these garnishes is Helena Bonham Carter, wife and sort-of muse for his past several films. She just keeps getting better in his work, following Sweeney Todd, and here as the Red Queen she's reason enough to at least sneak in to see her scenes, as her giant head on a small body is ferocious and subtle and beet-red screaming. It's hilarious and intense a performance you'll see this week.Others who pop on screen are more or less lucky based on their skills. Of course Johnny Depp- playing a Mad Hatter who obviously gets more screen-time because of the star status of Depp, or just how much Burton loves looking at him- can play crazy well, as he does here, but it also gets a little boring after a while, punctuated by an out-of-left-field moment (yes, an out-of-left-field moment in an Alice movie) when he breakdances at the end, which has been alluded to but not as WTF as that! Alan Rickman, Crispin Glover, and Stephen Rea round out the cast as other notables, though their screen time is all too brief, left to their own devices they can only do so much as a caterpillar, one-eyed Red-Queen lackey, and Cheshire Cat respectively. They're just overwhelmed, ultimately, by the special effects.So why the high rating with these problems, not to mention a less than stellar girl playing Alice (Mia Wasikowska is a pretty face, but can't do much with such a thin character)? Because as a Tim Burton movie, flaws and all, it's still amazing to look at and sometimes just too weird to put off as a total mess. It's definitely more in league with something like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than with Burton's best or his worst: it's an intense curio, made as a 'family film' but with such dark corners and outrageous beats that will throw off even the most hardcore surrealist. It's a flight of fancy that owes as much to its hit-or-miss Disney studio name than its iconoclast director.",4,2,5,13 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," Watch the Rock turn into a scorpion...and give the people's eyebrow
","(possible rock spoilers ahead)In this sequel to the first film, which is just slightly lesser than this one, the deja-vu style sets in as Fraser and company face of against Imhotep again to stop him from ressurecting the infamous Scorpion King (The Rock). At times my mind was going crazy from the illogical plot points (running from sunlight and water, etc.), but the film compensates with amazing visual effects and tightly done action sequences (those battle and fight scenes are quite well done).  Good of it's kind (popcorn style), as long as you turn off part of you brain in the process.And by the way, going back to the Rock, he only appears in acting role for about 10 minutes and then later appears in computer face on a giant scorpion.  While his role is nothing more than a glorified cameo, he does what he can for the movie and is actually amusing doing the rock bottom on helpless soldiers (just remember, most wrestlers have to do a trademark move or trademark in the movies ala Hulk Hogan leg drop in films).  Best scene to look for though: the little mummies.  B+",6,0,3,7 May 2001
Avatar," Mr so-called 'King of the World' returns with a visually dazzling spectacle and so-so story
","James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying.",6,57,107,19 December 2009
Toy Story 2," I liked it...
","Toy Story 2 is and isn'tt like what the first one was (besides the terrific computer animation that makes the characters look 3-D like) which is good. Good because it gives the film-watching audience a new story to feed from the toy world. This time Woody isn't in the confrontation he was with Buzz Lightyear (favorites), but this time he has too choose between going old and his master Andy throwing him away, or living forever in a museum. Like other Pixar films, this isn't just a moral choice and lesson for kids, it's interesting for adults too (adults and kids alike will enjoy the puns with old toys, quotes and characters) because it is a decision that though is colored over, has a deep meaning in life.But, unfortunately bad because like most sequels, the first is in this case is better. It isn't by much, but mostly in the means of comedy (some of the humor in this film is just *too* silly, while the first maintained a better pace with its jokes and gags). Don't worry though, it isn't all bad, but I just feel some sequels aren't as livable to their precedors. Still, I found many of the new characters and the new story (not to mention the extraordinary animation) to be quite entertaining and I recommend this film to anybody. A+",10,0,3,28 April 2000
Frank," Love and insanity in rock and roll
","If Hal Ashby were alive today, he would probably make a film like Frank. Lenny Abrahamson's latest feature (from a script from in part Jon Ronson) has Ashby's sense of eccentricity but a contentment with that. The characters here are all alive, even the ones who don't have a lot of lines (the ones who speak French, yes them too). It's a story about creativity and process, and how it can tear a person apart or make someone who doesn't have it down yet that much hungrier to achieve it.It is extremely funny through its off-beat dialog, how a line will come out from where you completely least expect it, and yet it's got a core that is very serious. Frank deals with mental illness in a way that is both delicate but subtle; we know a good many in this band are crazy, some maybe just more clinically so than others. But the director and writers never go to mocking them, at least with any cruelty. It's completely sincere, and so, hopefully, most of us buy it too.Frank is a rock and roll movie, but I've rarely seen one as funny as this. And it's disarming in its humor, its asides, and the dark edges that wrap around so much of the storyline and characters. I have to think without a character like John this movie would still be watchbable, but a bit more impenetrable. John gets into the weirdness of this avant-garde group, the kind that records sounds of the wind and water being poured for their album, and experiment for a full year, fourteen hours a day. We feel the weirdness right along with him.For how unusual Frank looks, a great amount of the power of Fassbender's performance is that we don't see him for 99% of the film. Fassbender's voice is enough, and he uses it as well as his body to convey so much. He makes a fully realized character and a soulful, uproarious deadpan satire of rock stars - but without the face, which is quite hard to do; in a sense though he's playing a rock-n-roll Darth Vader (maybe crossed with Jim Morrison if he'd gone through five different alternative scenes). But despite Frank's trajectory is that of someone with mental illness, there's not too much of a feeling of cringing when he does some oddball choices (for example, for a friend's ashes, he instead tosses out into the wind flour), and the writing hatches on to these folks being true to themselves.So, by the time the group makes its album, and heads by luck to SxSW to play a gig, they're not so unusual anymore. The movie emphasizes this band as family, and it's here that the movie has yet another level, about the dysfunctional brothers and sisters (are there even any parents? maybe Frank and Clara, but it could go either way), and John as the adopted child or pet who tries to get in with his music, which falls up short more often than not - at least in the midst of the eclectic and strange. So yet another thing, about who's got it and who doesn't in art; this is a sort of topic that is not new to movies, to be sure (hey, Amadeus for one). But here, it gets a fresh take thanks to the characters being likable and unlikable in equal measure. We don't know what could come next for John or Frank or anyone really.And the music itself... it's actually pretty cool. Or maybe it's terrible, but it's a cool-terrible, if that makes sense. Of course, if you don't have any sort of open ear for experimental stuff - whether this goes past like Radiohead or Pink Floyd for you I don't know - it might seem like a big laugh at experimental music's expense. And yet it's all so original and of its own (the actors playing the music and Fassbender singing with everything he's got live by the way) it's hard to see it being mockable except in almost an intellectual way. I remember before seeing the film the band performed on the Colbert Report, and the initial shock of seeing these actors playing and singing with this giant head included faded in like ten seconds. It's real music, as bizarre and left field it is.A slight downside is that, maybe just at first but here and there, Gleeson is a little one note. Or, maybe that's the character himself, harping on the same beat of 'I want to make good music, here's a song!' Where he goes and how he takes charge and deals with the conflict of this group, while things go from weird to shocking to sad to weird and off-putting and delirious and sad again, makes so much of the film engaging and different and with integrity. And the ending is simply extraordinary. So much leads these characters, through ups and downs, to a point where they're just on a stage (in part) and find the song a certain way.I love when stories go on such a real but absurdist journey, and there's no lack of humor in the face of a dramatic story that has characters facing personal odds and ends, and can find a place that feels true and heart-breaking in a way. We don't know what will happen to the Soronfbs from here, but they don't lack artistry. Finding a movie that can handle that really well and true is rare.",10,4,11,8 November 2014
Drag Me to Hell," 'Return'? Who's to say Raimi ever really 'left'?
","To get it out of the way, most people writing or talking about Drag Me to Hell are saying that 'Raimi's returned' or 'he's come back finally!' There is an underlying current here to say that he 'lost' it somehow, in terms of being a talented director. Maybe it's jet-lag from being on a binge of several years of Spider-Man (and the, politely saying it, mixed reaction to Spider-Man 3) that maybe one wondered if he would return to his horror 'roots' as he hadn't made one since The Gift and not one that really stuck out in the 15 years since Army of Darkness. But he's always had the goods, even through the Spider-Man movies (and yes, even through most of part 3 I would argue), and what Drag Me to Hell represents not so much a return but a revival, akin perhaps to the Coen brothers, Raimi's old buddies, going back to basics with No Country for Old Men. Suffice to say, this is more than comfortable territory for Raimi: Drag Me to Hell is a reminder of what he's good at, which is not simply horror, but scaring the s*** out of you while making you laugh your head off.This wont be for all horror fans, perhaps, such as those who scamper off to the 'safe' fare like Haunting in Connecticut or the super trash like My Bloody Valentine 3D. This is PG-13, but in a way that doesn't mean Raimi or his brother co-writer Ivan are playing it any safer than Evil Dead 2. Their story of Christine Brown (gorgeous and talented Alison Lohman) turning down an old gypsy for an extension on her mortgage and thus being branded with a three-day-ticket-till-hell curse, is the stuff of pulpy EC comic books, with a touch of satire (did anyone else think of the current mortgage crisis when watching this) in the stew of over-the-top gags in true horror set-ups. Sure, there may be a few 'JUMP' scares, and sure a couple of story turns may not be logical (I had a problem with Justin Long, playing the psychology professor boyfriend of Christine's, doing something at about 2/3 of the way through the movie that didn't make much sense in terms of know-how), but it there's rarely a scene without some wallop of entertainment.And like the Evil Dead films, when they were at their best, Drag Me to Hell confronts its protagonist with an onslaught of 'holy-crap-what-was-that' things, such as an incredible (and I do mean incredible) nosebleed, the old gypsy popping up in a shed where an anvil is hanging conveniently overhead, the goat used for a sacrifice that suddenly turns possessed during a ritual, or just certain things like the recurring fly or (gulp) the bleeding eyeball in the middle of a piece of 'Harvest cake' which Christine has prepared. And like a former bewildered but strong hero like Ash, Christine toughens up soon and fast enough to do some unthinkable but hilariously tasteless things (i.e. poor kitty - and the kitty's return, ho-ho). And, not the least, after her roller-coaster of a horror-comic endeavor has supposed to come to a close, nothing is really, truly over.Drag Me to Hell is a rollicking good horror movie, and for the certain moviegoer with as many laughs as another not-quite-comedy movie playing right now, Pixar's Up. For fans of the people involved, or just looking for a few jolt-out-of-your-seat scares and bat-s*** crazy sequences, this is your current if imperfect fix you're jonesing for.",8,2,8,31 May 2009
Selma," the work that goes into a revolution
","Selma, about the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and how Martin Luther King and his group faced adversity at every turn to get equal voting rights, is one of the better films this year (that is to say, it's just shy of my top 10 list, but it's still really really really good).Oyelowo and director DuVernay turned in fantastic work. I can see why you'd say the filmmaking does matter here. What I loved about the movie were actually the little moments, quiet scenes where King is trying to figure out what he'll write or talking in hushed tones in a prison cell, or (what I didn't expect) the scene where the extramarital question is raised and done in brilliant drama between King and his wife - that is particularly a wonderful scene with so much weight in this room that is surrounded by the threat of death, but it still all comes down to love.Is it a perfect film? May be not, but it really is directed and presented with vitality and especially now it's more (sadly) relevant than ever between the cop murders and voter disenfranchisement in the south. When you're watching scenes that are really set pieces for the major events that unfold with people being beaten and killed ruthlessly, it's hard to watch - which is the point. DuVernay doesn't turn away, and gives it the harrowing edge of an action film. If she is at all manipulative as a filmmaker, it's for the right reasons for this story. Get people taking notice, not sitting there too complacent at a boilerplate story of black uprising. The way she shoots and executes the action, and how the actors play it - it matters.Oh, and to briefly address this because it's come up: and Johnson doesn't really come off that well in the film. But you know what? He's not the main focus of the movie anyway. Selma is; even King is, even as the leader, still just a part of the puzzle. He doesn't seem like the most high-minded president, but as a CHARACTER, not a historical figure, he works well for the conflict of the film. If King could walk into the Oval office, ask for voting rights for African-Americans, and LBJ goes 'alright', there's no movie.certainly has more conflict about him as a politician than George Wallace (both Wilkinson and Roth are good on screen, if over-shadowed by Oyelowo and Carmen Ojojo Coretta Scott King), and ultimately I was okay with his portrayal in the MOVIE. If I want more I can check out the Caro books or, when the time comes, Cranston as LBJ when the HBO movie comes out this year.The filmmaking is just so charged and vital, but DuVernay knows how to make her film in tones of darkness - a room will be without light, but she has a way of getting us to feel the presence in a room, that weight that King carries is made cinematic as far as being a moral figure who still has to stay alive and keep his family alive. The filmmakers knew it was a subject that has 'Important' going in to it. The question is how to make the performances count - and almost all of them do - and how to make scenes move and flow dramatically speaking.Even supporting characters like John Lewis gets a strong turn and dimension, and one scene where an 82 year old man, who has lost a family member due to police brutality, has a hear-to-heart with King, it's impossible not to feel the emotion there, and it works. Selma works.",10,5,12,19 January 2015
Grindhouse," the bad-ass extravaganza of the year; B-movie heaven if there ever was
","Ah, Grindhouse movies, loaded for bear with the sickest garbage and clichéd to hell; hell, by the way, not to be taken for granted. The films and trailers presented are half-vomitoriums and half-absurd white-knuckle thrill-rides, where genre is taken apart like scissors on a stretch-Armstrong doll with all of the gooey effluence gushing away on the screen. And unlike some who've already seen the film, I'm not totally certain yet (least on a first-viewing) of which feature I liked/responded to more. They're both imperfect movies, but naturally so, and there's stuff in both that can be criticized for (i.e. Planet Terror goes too far and has dialog written as if by a guy in prison, and Death Proof is maybe too much like a Tarantino movie to really squeeze into the grindhouse mold). Yet on the terms that the filmmakers go for, they totally accomplish ten-fold. It's also just an extreme load of fun and excitement, with the kind of disturbing material that is unequivocally, hysterically funny.Planet Terror is, in some ways, an even more f***ed up horror-show circus of violence and explosions and massive-gun-fire/death-counts and catch phrases than From Dusk Till Dawn was. It certainly marks another high-point for Rodriguez as someone who takes precedence for shocks and wild tricks of the visual medium than 'interesting' dialog. In this case, Planet Terror revels in the cut-outs from past low-grade genre drek, and it works terrifically in the realm of the premise: noxious gas unleashed on a small town that sparks up 'infected' people by the dozens-to-later-hundreds of zombie-esquire folk after a stripper, a rogue, law-enforcement folk, doctors, and a couple of babysitter sisters. It's almost a case for how some things- like WRETCHED violence and gore and multiple casualties and excess to a T- won't get an NC-17. Rodriguez also wisely uses two courses of action. First is to make all of these vicious special fx all the more gleeful in the debauchery in its humor- not just the popping sores on the faces, or various limbs affected, but the 'did they actually do that' moments, (Tarantino's genital area, the wrists of McGraw's doctor daughter), and to wonderfully set-up the look of the Grindhouse picture, where scratches are common as hell, a reel will go missing once in a while (ironically right during or before a hot sex scene), and almost tearing at the seams. This and Machete, his much-anticipated vehicle for the great character actor Danny Trejo, demonstrate Rodriguez's real gifts, and the actors he puts on display (from Cheech to Michael Biehn to surprisingly Rosa McGowan) are completely, hilariously unconscious of the recklessness of schlock like this. In very short, a gas from start to finish, with a nice touch of Carpenter-music (John I mean).In the middle of the two films, by the way, are at least three whacked-out trailers as sort of special guests of Rodriguez and Tarantino's. Far more funnier and audaciously outrageous than the 'normal' trailers, where Zombie's Werewolves of the SS giving Nicolas Cage his finest moment in film in many years, Wright's DON'T! a fantastic play on a cliché-by-title, and Thanksgiving being maybe the best, most shameless work Eli Roth has done yet (where else am I going to see a turkey get...well, maybe I've already said too much, aside from the greatest line ever: 'White meat or dark meat, they'll both be carved!'). There's the movie-geek in all of us that would wish that all of these movie will someday be made into features, though part of the charm, if one could describe, is that they won't.Tarantino, meanwhile, has something of a totally different route to go on here, which is all relative: Rodriguez, after all, is the first part of a double-billing, and as such makes his with much greater abandon for standards of good taste or common sense, yet is also not completely as strong because of its sort of badness (albeit goodness too). Tarantino is, more appropriately, the second half and not-quite main attraction, even if his might seem like more of a tame and conventional effort when compared to Planet Terror and the incredible trailers. It's an homage to the wild road-chase movies of the early 70s, where Vanishing Point gets a huge nod and Kurt Russell gets the brightest note to a career now overloaded with kids movies. His character, Stuntman Mike, is a wickedly fun masochist who's got attitude by leaps and bounds, and quite the bad-ass car. He doesn't contend with some ladies from the stunt-department of a movie-set, however, where a cat-and-mouse game ensues. And a damn fine game indeed; the car chases in Death Proof should maybe even appeal to those who usually don't take to car chases too highly, namely because Tarantino's got a satirist's eye always at work somehow in the material. The danger comes when it leans towards being talky, as QT tends to do, and one shot in a diner brings Reservoir Dogs very much into mind. But it's also of interest that Tarantino has actually made a very solid action thriller, one that goes one or two steps further than the common road-movie of the old times went, with the craziness there and sort of complimenting Tarantino's clever direction, tough women, and good old rock & roll.So gear up in your dirty seat, if you can find one, with a bunch of friends in a crowded theater, and make sure not to miss the little animated intros to the 'parental advisory' warning before each movie. It's the movie 'event' of the year, particularly for fans of unrepentant action and gruesome carnage.",10,6,12,6 April 2007
There's Something About Mary," One of the best films of the year
","The Farrelly brothers' There's Something About Mary is a crude yet surprisingly sweet comedy that involves a 13-year crush, a casted up dog, and a zipper problem (Beans above the frank is quite the original gag).  The film turns out to be a top notch comedy that puts the characters into ridiculous yet hilarious situations that makes them even more like-able. These characters include the Pathetic detective (Matt Dillon), the 2-sided personality (Lee Evans), the real one who's in love (Ben Stiller) and the apple of their eyes Mary (Played nice by Cameron Diaz).  Packed into 2 hours of gross-out comedy, this film is the funniest film of the year, and of many others.  A++",8,1,4,26 March 2000
Invictus," The Master of His Fate is given a decent, corny sports movie
","In Invictus, Morgan Freeman doesn't have to act like Nelson Mandela, since he basically *is* Mandela (more God-like in demeanor and in his kindness and reserve than his God in the 'Almighty' franchise). His poise and speech and way of showing immense pain and conflict buried underneath a strong demeanor is perhaps reason enough to see this movie. Seeing him on screen, acting intensely even when sitting calmly in a car with his sunglasses on, is seeing a tremendous actor doing service to a marvel of a human being like Mandela. I just wish this Mandela, who is what he is and is alongside Matt Damon as a likable-tough South African Rugby captain, was in a movie less corny and more political. The story is the tale of the 95 Rugby World Cup, but it's also the story of Mandela in this context, and the balance between the two becomes, shall we say, 'sappy'.With all due respect to Clint Eastwood, it comes off here like all Nelson Mandela did as president was worry about how South Africa was doing in whatever Rugby game was going on, even when doing President-things like meetings and speeches. It's meant to be a stirring sports movie - how the underdog triumphed against the odds - more-so than a politically-charged screed, which is fine, on paper. But I wish the sports scenes were less corny and we saw more of what Mandela did as President. His tactic is clear, to be sure: get the Rugby team to win the world cup, and unite the nation. This, too, is fine, on paper or in theory. But we only get very slight glimpses of this nation's strife, and people going into the film without knowing the history of the aftermath of apartheid will be getting a story that is half-cooked around the facts and pablum of victory.It is watchable, don't get one wrong: the scenes where Mandela projects his influence on people is magnetic to see. Mandela in front of a crowd can be just as moving and interesting as in front of one person, be it that sports organization he comes to as a surprise visit ('You chose me as your leader - let me lead'), or his cool rationale for focusing so strongly on Rugby ('It's a ... human calculation'). One wishes for more of that in some part to Freeman's presence and control of the role, but also because the scenes with the Rugby team, frankly, aren't anywhere near as compelling. We've seen this story before and even without knowing the true story know it's outcome minutes before it's presented, like, as they say in sports movies, 'destiny'.Again, some of the predictability would still be fine, and is tolerable, but Eastwood also doesn't really do enough to give the Rugby matches real uplift and energy. He does try in the climax, but in, again, a corny aspect - he cuts between the various fans watching in bars and houses and in the sold out arena New Zealand/South Africa are playing in, and then with a little boy who may/may not be getting ready to do something with an object in a bag, only to stop by the awesome power of the game on radio. Perhaps if one is a sucker for such inspiring stories, this will come as the treat of the season. For those wanting something more from its iconic filmmaker, or to see a side of President Mandela outside of being a hardcore Rugby enthusiast, it disappoints. But, at the least, it has that embodiment of a great figure at its center, the best one's seen since the days of Henry Fonda as Lincoln.",6,9,19,12 December 2009
Mission: Impossible," Not DePalma's best
","Brian DePalma is a great director, but this is not his best work.  Since the sequel outdo's this one, I have to say though, this film wasn't that bad the first time I saw it.  The only problem was I understood the plot as well as any other person in the theater (no clue whatsoever).  But the second time, I understood it a little more.  Tom Cruise is good as Ethan Hunt, but not perfect here.  He improves with practice, and this is practice.  Still, the action sequences are memorable (especially the infamous drop in the office scene) and the supporting cast works well (Jean Reno, Jon Voight, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Emilio Estevez, and Ving Rhames).  Dandy, but not quite fully fine.  B",8,0,3,3 June 2000
La La Land," La La Land
","I wonder if I had just stumbled upon this movie, being Damien Chazelle's third as director, not knowing anything or knowing little about it, if I would've liked/loved/fallen head over heels for it more than I did. Because of the state of the independent film scene (and this is one of those mid-way movies like Pulp Fiction, where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood, the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting), movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for, say, a Star Wars movie. It also has to do too with the director's previous, Whiplash, being a ride that gives Emotional Roller-coaster its clichéd status, since it was the announcement of a director (from my generation/exact age group) swinging for the fences. And La La Land, with its major reviews and festival runs, seemed like another one. And it is, ultimately, a great movie. Could it have been better? Hmm.Sometimes, furthermore, coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always 'correct' as one might say. It may take another viewing, or a few days, to get more of what I felt about it. But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies, and usually these cross and twist like it's a dance out in outer space. Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar - artists in music and performance, close enough as the same thing, who meet, have a little push-and-pull at first (they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam) - that it could be criticized as a rehash. Hell, we just had a movie come out a month ago/around this same time, Nocturnal Animals, that, if you look closely, isn't too far off (though the endings are VERY different, which I'll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie).Gosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love, and I'm sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around. Though as a nitpick (and it should be mentioned) Gosling can't sing anything exceptional, Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force. La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities, of pulling off all of the care-free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has (seriously, he's about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino - notice the Ingrid Bergman wall- sized poster in Mia's place and other parts, or the whole use of the WB lot), but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately. More than well, they find the truth in the clichés that come with artists-trying-to-make-it and sell it as well as Chazelle's script can get them to.Which, perhaps, is the one thing that keeps me from saying 'OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I've EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE' (which, again, hype) - it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it's jarring to then go back into the 'real' world, more or less. Songs of course happen, but it's a balancing act, and all the while Chazelle's story points for these two is so familiar as far as the 'What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic/Corporate America' thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain - not embracing and finding a truth in cliché, but just being conventional (i.e. how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend's got, and this takes him away from his actual 'dream' of a jazz club, and then Stone's Mia's dream of being an actress, etc etc so forth and so on).... And then the final 15 minutes or so happens, where we flash ahead five years to what's happened with these two people who, at one point, went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy (I'm reminded of the French New Wave, a lot, by the way, in how much Chazelle embraces post-modern self-consciousness; if Breathless was his Whiplash, is this his, uh, A Woman is a Woman?) And the two of them have changed, more or less, and Gosling plays a song that transports into the 'what if' and it's... I don't have words for it. It's what the movies are about. It's a magical, wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering (like I don't hear you, old bastards) and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made-up, empathetic landscape.My first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls*** of saying 'this is 'better' than this' (that is Whiplash vs La La Land), but it doesn't matter. That last fifteen minutes, and many other scenes and Stone's performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography (oh man, I don't care if you're verging from homage into rip-off of PT Anderson, it's so delicious for my eyes to look at), confirms that Chazelle is the real deal, a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience, about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the 'dream' of artists and musicians and actors and so on, and at the same time can bring it forward with... soul. It takes a little time, but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first, beautiful homage second.",10,7,16,18 December 2016
Saw," Imagine if Ed Wood re-did Seven and this is what it would look like- the worst film of the year so far
","(Possible spoilers)I was immensely grateful not to have paid to watch this film (snuck in); because if I did I would've felt un-clean once the credits began to roll. The filmmakers, writer/director James Wan and writer/actor Leigh Whannell, have concocted another story in what Hollywood finds as the popular Silence of the Lambs/Se7en vein. The premise sounds like it might have promise- two guys (Whannell and Cary Elwes) are chained up in some abhorrent tub-room, and are given two saws. They have to find a way out, or else Dr. Gordon's (Elwes) wife and daughter will be killed. Then the rest of the story takes off, and it's down-hill. What happens then are a series of flashbacks, tracing how they got in there, how a cop (Danny Glover, a sad state of affairs to see him in this) gets maddened by the cases and an encounter, and how the gory details of the cases emphasize how disturbed and 'scary' the Jigsaw killer is (whom we never really see, except for a clown-type of face that's more of something to laugh at than anything else).The problem with this film, the chief one among others, is that Wan and Whannell underestimate the audience's intelligence. Everything has to be explained, and with a style in bold, gruesome type that end up not coming off as successfully scary as successfully sadistic (and there is a big difference between something being effective and not- last year's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake is a prime example). They seem to care more (along with their editor and cinematographer and production designer) to drum up the atmosphere. But they spend so much time going over the top in many cases (and this includes with Wan's direction of actors, which brings out some bad performances, even out of co-writer Whannel) that they don't set up characters we can really sympathize for. In fact, at some point, it becomes so tiresome with how the plot dances around; you almost want them to get it over with it so that the Jigsaw guy can go on to his next abomination. What's worse is that when the third act comes around, all the elements produce material that becomes laughable, and not because we (or at least I was, the audience around me were much the same) are laughing at the sadism of it, but because it's so ridiculous. Se7evn and Silence of the Lambs spent far more time setting up the good guys, or at least making they seem like strong forces we could identify with, and at the same time the story lines weren't completely unbelievable. At some point while watching Saw, I found it to be like if some hack (i.e. Ed Wood) decided to re-do Se7en except to focus on the victims instead of the cops, to dance around the storyline like they're going farther than Tarantino, and that by the end everyone who deserved to die (except for a few) do. Then I realized, it's like, it is. I don't discourage the 27 year old Wan and Whannell from some kind of potential in Hollywood, but I just don't see it here. D-",1,10,19,30 October 2004
3 Idiots," my take: at the least, you can't say you don't get a full-course meal of movies in one LARGE one
","Unlike many who have commented here in the years since 3 Idiots was released in India and throughout the world, I am not well-versed with Bollywood movies - indeed, far as I can tell from his filmography, this may be my first Aamir Khan movie - so my take on this experience may be different from others. It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are. And, as far as the most general impression, overall, this isn't too bad. Is it very good though, or as bad as certain IMDb message board posters might say since its ascension to the top 250 films of all time? In short, 3 Idiots is a full course meal of a movie, and it has so many types and moods of movie stuffed into one, like a Turducken or something: it's a broad college comedy, an Alvin and the Chipmunks farce (think about it, with Khan's Rancho as Alvin and the other two idiots variations of Simon and Theodore, sort of, plus the Chatur character as the 4th wheel), a soap opera about strict fathers and their children, a tragic tale about suicide meant to highlight a very real problem in Indian society, and of course for Bollywood a musical, not to mention a kind of moral story of what it means to be a teacher or a student and how to not be so uptight (another subtitle for this movie could be 'The System, They Just Don't Understand!').It's even other things I'm sure, and the tones fluctuate and alter on a dime from one to the next. Case in point, there's a little more than mid-way through the film a very serious turn in the plot; nevermind how exactly it gets there, suffice it to say it's due to some late-night antics from Rancho with pals Raju and Farhan, with Raju most drunk the next morning in class and being forced to decide whether to be expelled or put it all on Rancho. Raju decides to jump out the window, though he doesn't die and he subsequently gets rushed to the hospital. Cue up the sad but (it can't be anything else) supremely heart-felt song that plays over as he is brought to stable condition. Then it becomes a rather crazy comedy of 'how do we wake up Raju' sequence as he is stuck in his, uh, comatose-sort of state and Rancho keeps saying wilder and wackier things to get Raju to wake up. And yet as broad as this is it's still serious... sort of.A lot of this happens throughout 3 Idiots; for a stretch of time the movie will take on something like a frat-house comedy (that's actually how the film seems like it will take shape early on, 'initiation' sequence with butt-branding included!) but then it's (duh) also a romance with the headmaster/principal's daughter, Pia (Kapoor, pretty but also a very good actress) and Rancho since he not only is the cool/suave prankster but he also spots the phonies who try to have her hand as a significant other. But then it's also about Raju's sad (in black and white no less!) home life, and then it's also about how to function properly in an academic environment with Rancho sometimes like a, uh, RP McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest turning the system upside down with the headmaster as the one-note headmaster. And then it gets into a musical number about things like 'All is Well', which gets finished off by someone jumping off a ledge and to their death, which makes it uh... sad again, as it cuts to the pouring rain at a funeral.This may be de rigeur for those who are regulars for Bollywood cinema - for me, it was at times a startling experience, sometimes akin to getting whiplash on a roller-coaster. This is not to say it made the experience intolerable, however. It was surely made as a prestige/high-mainstream comedy/drama/musical-et-al, and it's the kind of movie that will have high-powered, super-slick musical set pieces (not quite as many as I expected, to be fair, and those that are here do stand out well and are the highlights of the movie aside from Khan's performance), and then for the regular musical score it will be some of the goofiest notes I've ever heard outside of a Disney channel show. And for as BIG as the actors go for this material - perhaps, you could argue, they don't have much of a choice - there are moments where there's something close to not subtlety but measured stuff; when Raju confronts his parents with what he actually wants to do with his life, it's a legitimately strong dramatic scene that pulls on the heartstrings just enough.In other words, it's probably not what will be the *best* Bollywood movie - some may put it high up there, and that's their prerogative - but if you are new to this style of movie-making (and I don't mean Slumdog Millionaire for the laymans that's basically Bollywood crossed with Danny Boyle), it's a good place to start. It's sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite harrowing with its drama, and often it's much too much with the emotional manipulation (that delivery scene, my God). It is what it is.",6,3,7,29 February 2016
Life Is Beautiful," One of the best film ever on the holocaust
","(Spoilers Ahead)Though Schindler's List is the best film on the horror that was the holocaust, Life Is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella in Italian) is way up there. And I enjoyed it.  Especially because the film doesn't completely circle around the concentration camp, just half of it.  Half of the film surrounds Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni won a well deserved best actor Oscar as Guido, along with a second Oscar for best Foreign film as director and writer) as a Italian-Jewish waiter who is in love with a 'princess'.  This half has more of the comedy than drama, but the second half is melodramatic as Guido has a son now with his princess and they are taken to a concentration camp.  But so to shield his son from the horrors, he makes a game the two can play as their ordeal unfolds.  Very original, and very well done, with Benigni acting now aa a Italian version of Charlie Chaplin. Excellent all around.  A+",7,1,6,11 May 2000
Up," as they say, Pixar hits it out of the park again!
","Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. 'An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough 'art' for my taste' (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.But it's not enough to compare it to Herzog, or even really try to. Pixar's Up, directed by Pete Doctor, is original in its intent to make a serious adventure movie that starts off as something quite mature, makes it big leap to kids, and then straddles that line like that guy who crossed the twin towers on the tightrope in the 70s. Take your adjective, this is beautiful, audacious, heartbreaking, heartrending, sublime, hilarious, surreal, inventive film-making, and it doesn't talk down to any age group in its story of an old man, Carl Frederickson, who fulfills his and his late-wife's dream of having a house on a hilltop called Paradise Falls that their favorite explorer as kids flew to in South America. If you're a kid you'll not get any tasteless jokes (there's one poo joke that actually works since it's brief and, dare I say it, funny as hell), and it helps to get you prepared for some of the hardships that may come in life, like, well, the possibility of not having kids and losing your loved one in old age. Rare does it happen that you'll cry in the first ten minutes of a Disney family film anymore. Here's the rarity.Up is also in the tradition of wild fantasy, like a tale out of the Lost World mixed in with a tale out of Pixar's idols, Studio Ghibli. One could definitely see the kinds of characters like Carl, Russel and the hero-turned-villain explorer Charles Muntz in a Miyazaki film (as Ebert so thankfully noted in his review), but they also remain true to the Pixar tradition that's given them their distinction. They're never card-board cut-outs, and even when faced with certain plot elements reminiscent of Disney fare, such as with the big bird, 'Kevin', in the jungle they have to help get back to her kids, or the (insane/perfect) comic relief of the dogs that talk with the collars around their necks, its dealt with the kind of love and care that should be given in solid storytelling. Nothing is too frivolous in Up, and there's an undercurrent of sadness to both Carl, for what he's lost and has to achieve without his late wife he's known since childhood, and for Russell lacking a father figure or real mother (this last part is handled really well, watch for 'Phyllis' mentioned).Oh, and I forgot, it's animated in the usual tradition of Pixar fare: awesomely. Following on the heels of their arguable top-top masterpiece WALL-E, Up features the ordinary (inside a house, an old man) and the extraordinary (the birds, the dogs, the juxtaposition of a floating house with an airship, something else out of say Howl's Moving Castle) with delicacy and subtly while at the same time grandiosity and the vibrancy possible in the medium. I could go on and on, about how howlingly funny it is or how touching it is in the little moments. But make no mistake, Up is modern film art, even if it doesn't fit into your local art-house cinema. Take the (well-behaved/respectful) kids, take the old folks, take your rotten punk kid. It is what it is- squirrel! Good stuff.",10,8,16,31 May 2009
Snowden," Watching the Watchers
","I don't know if I have enough thoughts on this yet for a full review - I know I liked it, maybe some of Snowden's personality himself rubbed off on me the wrong way at times (as with other stories of high-strung whistleblowers like Serpico and The Insider seeing the interactions the protagonists have with the women in their lives is hard to watch ... I should also note Woodsley was highly underrated in this, as was probably Gordon Levitt, but somehow I keep thinking about her and how, for one of the handful of times in Stone's career, Heaven & Earth included, he has a solid three-dimensional female character to work with, but I digress).But it features a solid script that doesn't necessarily have that feverish energy of the 80's/90's Stone movies - though, with age, Stone also therefore has appeal, one can hope if his name isn't too attached to those iconoclast cherry bombs, to middle America and people who want to see a simple good thriller, and this serves that purpose. It also has some of the strongest visual ideas Stone has had in a long time, maybe since Alexander or longer; the highlight of the film (aside from Nicolas Cage's precious minutes) is when Snowden faces his boss/mentor played by Rhys Ifans when he is in trouble, in a conference room, as the man's face is on a giant screen, seemingly 3 times Snowden's full size (but it seems to loom larger). That's the tense-as-s**t Stone I've been missing, and it's all done in shot-reverse-shot and largely dependent on the size of characters in the frame (in a sense it's sort of like the reverse of that scene in Network between Beatty and Finch).Maybe another viewing will change my mind, though it's hard to shake the fact that we already have CITIZENFOUR in this world, and that's kind of enough. So it's a good Stone film, it truly is, but it's missing that *something* that I can't describe just yet from his work in the 90's.",7,0,1,19 April 2017
The Hurricane," A Powerhouse of a Film. Washington's Best.
","Norman F. Jewison's 'The Hurricane' is an exceptional piece of film making. It has good editing, good writing, good scenes, and great acting.  Now, the film itself is good, but the acting makes this film outstanding. 
Denzel Washington is a terrific actor, and this film proves it (also a golden globe nomination and Academy Award Win in 1989 backs it up). Washington plays Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter with such perfection not seen in a very long time.  It's his spirit in this movie that gets this film up in the high life.And Norman F. Jewison, a great Oscar Winning Director who directs this film of the human spirit with great intensity and knowledge of what Carter's life was like.  That makes this film one of the best of the year.",8,3,8,13 January 2000
A Clockwork Orange," one of the masterpieces of 70's subversive cinema - Kubrick at his peak
","(from 2007): Kubrick's perfect grind-house/art-house 'tour-de-force' (I think that term could apply here), on a big screen, is the way to go. Seeing the print emphasized the 'grind-house' aspect, as it was spotty and scratchy as s**t, but it added to the appeal of seeing it in such a lower-east-side movie theater- albeit part of a chain of theaters- and seeing it for the first time since I first saw it (probably I was 14) in full glory of the cinematic experience.Certain things always pop up again and again from seeing this work of intentionally shocking, precisely over-the-top, and garishly satirical work, and while it's not like my bible or anything, the film emphasizes as always feelings that I hold very true and reticent: that free-will, notwithstanding certain typical procedures of the law if it's wrong, should not be repressed from within (see the Chaplin scenes), at least certainly not in the indifferent, mechanical process of the Ludiviko treatment.It's not even really a futuristic world so much as, like with Brazil, is sort of environment where present-day fantasy meets reality (or as Zizek calls it, a nightmare), where one ends up feeling sympathy for a little devil like Alex because, quite simply, he has a lot more liveliness, humor and humanity in his form of evil than those of the government propogandists, scientists, or even the 'writer', in their form of self-aggrandizing, larger-scale evil. If anything, he's almost naive when compared to the big scheme of things- a boy getting the ultimate horror-show of a coming-of-age handed to him.But thinking of Slavoj Zizek again made me double check the reasoning of the ending, and how endlessly clever Kubrick could be that having seen the film countless times I only caught on this this time: that Alex, by accepting the quasi-desperate plea from Frederick to make them look good, is still subverting himself to a form of control, even if now 'recovered' from his treatments. The ambiguousness of the ending- of if Alex may or may not return to his life of crime or change his ways- has always been paramount for me, as it's been with many of Kubrick's films, but that little catch kept me thinking as I skipped along after the movie, singing the notorious song- the only one McDowell knew by heart.",10,9,19,29 December 1999
The Fly," both chilling and strangely intimate, amazing make-up effects, but the depth of a very good play
","Here is something of an unlikely, yet very likely, pairing: David Cronenberg and a big studio budget sci-fi remake. His take on the Fly, which was originally a film featuring a man with his body human and his head a fly, is stark as hell, with one of the bleakest endings in any movie of the 80s. Cronenberg is also working at one of his driving thematic forces as a filmmaker, though not as something that feels forced, per-say, which is the two sides to things, to people, to relationships, and to what science can provide in new breakthroughs. We're given the character of Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), who is a shy but massively accomplished scientist who's come upon the breakthrough of a lifetime- teleportation of matter from one spot to another. But a moment of relapse in his emotional state, of vulnerability to his feelings for a woman he gets close to (Geena Davis's Veronica), send him to go for the experiment himself, not noticing the little creature that's going along for the ride with him. It's a gradual change, but one that is not in the physical sense; we're not getting a man with a body of a man and the head of a fly, but a man who we're seeing in a slightly 'altered' Kafka perspective. Instead of the man waking up to discover he's already been transformed, we're with him as he goes through a grotesque change, all the more-so because unlike in Kafka's tale he's very smart and can speak his emotions throughout the story, but at the same time it's the tragic unraveling of humanity.For Cronenberg, this makes up the crazy dilemma of Brundle, who is truly half human and half insect, and it provides for him little moments of the macabre comedy he's famous for (watch as he exercises, or tears a guy's wrist off when in an hand match), while keeping strong to the darker implications of a story this implicit. It's a tale that starts out in romance as much as in science, with two characters we immediately care about because they're not simple cardboard genre movie cut-outs. They have their consciences, but for Brundle it gets turned up-side down by a force that is essentially instinctual. For an actor like Goldlum, it's not exactly a walk in the park to go from straight-laced (if eccentric) scientist to a half irritable and half deformed bugman. He's daring to go for the physicality straight-on, but to not make it terribly over the top, and it's a fine line to walk that isn't crossed. This is important considering for the last section he is, of course, totally disguised by lots of wretched (but excellently executed) make-up FX. There's not much to be bugged about, no pun intended, by the director or actors in how they approach tricky material.Actually, what makes the Fly hold up isn't just its horror show aspect. Like John Carpenter's the Thing, we're given an atmosphere of true terror, but less for the simple facet of 'ooh, there's something around the bend about to get us', but about human beings not being able to have trust in one another. Yet Cronenberg is even more operatic than that with his horror: the final scenes are very graphic (make sure you don't have a fly buzzing around the room!), but in still keeping the events on the horror for the characters. The ideas, as with many of the greatest horror films, are paramount, giving rise to everything else that is fun, and quite sad, in dealing with the unimaginable.",10,2,4,16 June 2007
From Hell," Impressive retelling of the graphic novel by The Hughes brothers.
","(possible spoilers)From Hell tells the story of Jack the Ripper in 1888, possibly one of the most infamous murderers, in an enriched and stylized way pumped up with some good old killing scenes.  Johhny Depp plays an investigator in England who can find who the Ripper may attack next in his visions and begins to get close to someone who could be next (Heather Graham plays this next, a helpful prostitute).  How he sees these visions? He is a regular opium taker and in his state he sees these gruesome details.  The story wanders here and there, yet it's made up in the most part by a rich and darkly exhilarating atmosphere evoked by the Allen and Albert Hughes and their photographer peter Deming, and by some fine performances turned in by Depp, (dare I say) Graham and Ian Holm who plays a hierarchy figure, so to speak.  It might not be for all tastes, but for those interested (or those who took interest in the graphic novel) won't be disapointed.One more note: adding the Elephant man may not be neccessary in a movie about Jack the Ripper, but credit is due in having two of the 19th centuries more famous English gentlemen in one film.

Groundhog Day," A uniquely funny fantasy/comedy
","Harold Ramis' Groundhog's Day is not only one of his best, but also a highlight for the star Bill Murray.  The story follows a self-centered weatherman (Murray) who realizes that one day on Groundhog's Day, he has his day repeating over and over again.  A film full of laughs to the brim, even if it's sometimes light, but it is pulled through by comic veterans Murray (who gives one of his best performances) and Ramis who follows with his tradition (Animal House, Vacation, National Lampoon, SCTV, Ghostbusters, Caddyshack and Analyze This) of great comedy films.

Reservoir Dogs," Practically tailor-made for a film buff (as well as for a viewer who watches occasionally), 'Dogs' is a picture loaded to the brim with terrific visceral energy
","Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, 'too violent' (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.  Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design. Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.  For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it): Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.  So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of 'Stuck in the Middle With You', or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.  My opinion- Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, and nearly superior over Jackie Brown.  A+",10,8,16,23 July 2003
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," a compelling tale of the dangers of imperial dominance, how it spreads, and how political turns personal
","The Wind That Shakes the Barley, the Palm D'Or winner, gets most compelling because of the ties that form between the political and the personal, between what is loyalty to one's country versus one's own blood and how the latter becomes almost irrelevant and taken for granted in the midst of the bickering of specifics. For a while, Ken Loach's film is suspenseful enough as a story of Irishmen rebelling against their dastardly British occupiers in militia-style tactics, practically guerrilla tactics actually, and there's not much sentimentality going on. But then when the Irish get a small sliver of independence, albeit still in servitude to the British empire, it sets off a chain reaction of infighting, of there being adequate freedom and not enough freedom, and two brothers- Damian and Teddy- get caught right in the works of it all, tragically so. Loach doesn't let either side off in this, and it adds to the complexities of the last third of the picture. Damian goes full circle as one who starts off not wanting to join the IRA, even after the death of a friend, but soon becomes more than he thought- a killer, of British as well as Irish (a troubling, tense scene where he has to take out a boyhood friend over treason)- and now sees that it's his duty to go for more than his brother settles for.But Teddy is not put as a simple figure of a submissive Irishman completely, and the emotion that suddenly starts to boil over in his contention and eventual head-to-head with Damian helps to not make it too shallow or underdeveloped. Some critics have called Teddy unsympathetic, but it's not that easy an assertion: circumstance in the face of something that has never been attained before might seem worth it on one side, even if on the other it seems maddening. Beneath this, however all the clearer in the scenes with the British officers early in the film as a horrible brutes who will torture and kill to get control and dominance over the Irish, is Loach commenting on the dangers of imperialism, of how it becomes if not contagious then almost something that becomes accepted if seen as something that has to be taken for a little extra freedom. In the process, one can see parallels to current events, more or less, and that it's filmed in a very immediate, staggering fashion where melodrama is stripped away.It would be one thing if Loach was making a simple message picture, and yet when it is loaded with 'message' like when the Irish argue over ratifying the treaty it's still very engrossing, but Loach is interested too in the impact on close-knit relationships: the connection with Damian and his love, who he has to watch in pain from hiding as British officers torture her and burn most of her home down; the lack in faith in institutions like the Church, connected to those in power; and finally Damian and Teddy, two sides of very courageous, yet proud figures. It would be wrong to consider that Damian and Teddy are direct representations of the two sides of the Irish struggle, those that oppose and those that support the treaty with the British, wherein the Northern part of Ireland was still indebted to England. There's more depth than that- neither of the brother's deep down really wants this, Teddy more than Damian as the film progresses despite his political convictions, as Damian, played in a very strong turn by Cillian Murphey, trained to be a doctor, not in any military or political faculty. One can't say for sure how much of The Wind That Shakes the Barley speaks to the people of Ireland of today, so many decades after North and South and the IRA have gone head-to-head, but it contains the spirit that thrives in the better war films of recent years where thought is taken as precedence over action (not that Loach is a bad action director), and the end result brings little happiness anywhere.",9,2,7,21 March 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," a good example of a formulaic family picture
","I know a film meant for children (or a 'family' movie so to speak) is working right when even as I can recognize where the whole plot will go, A to B to C to Z, when I think that if I were a child of 7, 8, 13 or whatever, I'd really love it. Perhaps I've moved on from being able to be really invigorated by these stories, where a nerdy outsider connects with another outsider in a society where their bond is sort of verboten. Hell, we probably have already seen this formula done, to one degree or another, in just the stable of Dreamworks animated films in the past years (shades of Kung-fu Panda spring to mind). But the good news is that the filmmakers give the characters some good life and circumstances, and the energy in the action and drama is high.But what also makes it work is that a) when it needs to be funny, it's very funny (quips I didn't think could work won me over), and b) when it needs to, pun intended, the movie soars. Many will be immediately reminded of another movie filled with 'flying things' from some months back, James Cameron's Avatar. While his film implemented cutting-edge 3D technology, I found seeing this film, in just the straight 2D, just as good if not, really, better in some ways. When it comes time to follow along with 'Toothless' the dragon and Hiccup as they piroutte through the sky, I was completely with it since I already was soaked up into this world. This isn't to denigrate Cameron's work inasmuch as to just make a point of comparison: it doesn't look quite as silly, oddly enough, by having dragons with this film as opposed to the whatever-the-hell prehistoric hybrids the Na'vi rode along.I digress though, the film is easy to see where it will go. The plot turns, the conflicts, the interest from the girl to the hero and the supporting characters, no convention is unturned. But the writing within the conventions are strong; the filmmakers understand how to work within them to bring out creativity in the artwork, in the action, in the connections with the characters, and when it comes time for the vikings to face off against the big baddie-dragon at the end (as we all can expect), it's exhilarating how the pace keeps picking up just when one expects for it to drop. And, ultimately, as repeated as the message might be, the under-current of 'peace and understanding' vs 'FIGHT' is a good message to send to the kids, with the most unlikely placement of vikings who pray to Odin and the dragons who fight against them (but as we learn in self-defense).The voice-work is also uniformly interesting. I liked seeing Baruchel in this lead part, doing what he could with a nerdy hero; Gerard Butler shows why he should stick mostly to his original Scottish accent (it's also nice, by the way, to hear Craig Ferguson in a movie again; the actors playing the 'kids' all, oddly enough, don't have the Scottish twang, but still work well for what's required of their parts as sort of comic relief. And when it comes time to show the bond between Hiccup and the dragon, the writers don't jump to the quips: the dragons never speak, and all of the direction and attention can be found in their eyes and mouths and face contortions. It's really like the story of a boy and his dog or horse and in this, the heart of the picture, it surprised me with how well it worked. 7.5/10",7,1,5,24 May 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," It's not necessarily a film, per say, as it is an endurance test...
","...meaning that if a viewer can stay tuned, as I could, through the 'Circle of Sh*t' segment, then a viewer can sit through just about anything that's on celluloid. It's indeed appropriate that it's called the most disturbing and disgusting film ever made, as it well could be. As I watched all the way through till the end I got the same feeling as I did watching Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Both films go out on a limb with excesses (although Gibson's excesses were arguably not as faithful to the source as Pasolini was), and I have to say that at least from an objective point of view Pier Paolo Pasolini gets the job done there. With great cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli (Once Upon a Time in the West) providing the sometimes exquisite camera-work and lighting, Ennio Morricone delivering a slight, but melodic tone in the background, and with interesting sets, plus an interesting editing style that doesn't entirely show as much of the grotesque and sex as it could've, the craft behind the film is pretty good. If one were to look past the subject matter, it's actually a very well constructed piece of film art, which is why many consider it important.I suppose it's a unique film, but you couldn't pay me to want to watch it again (unless it was in a film class where the teacher proved himself to have reason to have us watch it). At the core, Salo: 120 Days of Sodom, is interesting as a concept, from which it was taken from Sade's novel - a group of f*cked up fascists during the end of world war two capture some young boys and girls and force them to go under sexual and mental tortures. As in the book (which I've never read and don't really have a desire to seek out at this point in my life), the acts are relentless, and in between the fascists instilling fear and intense degradation, a woman narrates stories that go over and over as she describes everything from eating excrement to helping out a grown man in diapers. By the end, it's a controlled chaos as most are dead and those who aren't look on with binoculars. Now, the problem is with this material, at least for me, it becomes very subjective.I can see the core point PPP's making (it's almost like a twisted satire), and it does remind me how much fascism is the worst kind of ideology there is on Earth...But then the relentlessness of it all becomes very, very close to unbearable (i.e. endurance test). And, reminding me again of 'The Passion', Salo doesn't give any of the characters any other kinds of emotions to work in than those they're stuck with. There's no deviating from the paths and fates of the characters, and without any point of entry into the victims (the exclusion being two girls, who all they say are 'I can't take this anymore' to each other), they're left with the controlled state that the villains have put them in. I suppose the acting by these four, vicious bastards is commendable, but after a while the acts that they thrust upon the kids stops being shocking, and becomes boring. And when a film that is supplied with a talented crew and cast that does whatever PPP tells them to do, and it's boring, it doesn't work for me. The stories by the one woman, in-particular, tend to drag on as her character seems to just think up new ways to entice the heads of the manor into ecstasy. On top of this, there isn't logic to history because if this is towards the end of the war, where are the allies putting a stop to the fascists?I guess, in the end, I found Salo to be one of the more difficult films I've ever seen. I know I'm sort of glad I got through with it, but by the end I realized that PPP committed a bit of a film crime (though certainly not deserving of his mysterious death before the film was released) - there's no room for catharsis. This could be argued by some, however I'd have to say that if there was one it was buried underneath all of the sh*t food and *ss raping. Because the film is a bit one-dimensional, and hope is a lost cause, by the end all one could reasonably be left with is emptiness. In a way it reminded me of Bergman's Cries and Whispers in how it's just a sea of bleakness and despair for everyone involved, but at least in Bergman's bleak world there are moments of sweet (if maybe brief) humanity and love. I can't recommend Salo except for extreme, die-hard film buffs and for nihilistic types (and maybe for those interested in understanding the nature of fascism), and for those looking for what's worse after Gibson's POTC. It's definitely deserved, either way you take the film, as one of the most notorious, soul-churning pieces ever produced, though I wouldn't say it's one of the worst.",6,23,32,8 July 2004
Total Recall," one of the most enjoyable of the Arnold action vehicles
","Total Recall has little, if any,by way of passing itself as being 'art'. It is, but more in the sense of it being pop-art, of the director Paul Verhoven paying tribute in visuals to the story by Phillip K. Dick. And it's also one of the more exciting and quotable of those shameless examples of how to do an action film. In this case, however, because it is a P.K. Dick-based story there are some good social bits made in the process. If it isn't as astute or consistent as Blade Runner or Minority Report, it's probably more due to it having to be a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger than it being a full-on thought-provoking work of science fiction on film. But this does rank up high with the other works of the star, as he is in a complex situation in the film- his mind is scrambled, at first, and everything he thought was right as dickens is not. So he's told by 'himself' on a screen he happened to save for himself that he has to get to mars to find out the truth.There is plenty of good action sequences, but it is more about Verhoven's knack at getting this popularized view of Mars just a little subverted, a little stranger. Some of my favorite scenes involved Scwarzenegger's mishaps and turns of fate as the story and his character took turns. For example, in the scene when Arnold's character wants to get his memory wiped off to Mars and then he flips out in the chair, this is a very entertaining scene in being very ridiculous (try to listen to what he says, or don't as its near unintelligible) as well as following a darker trek in the story. In fact, much of the film works on the strengths of both director and star by having it not too over the top to have some belief in what is going on, but that expectations aren't limited to what might happen as Arnold's character in on Mars uncovering the conspiracy around his messed-up memory.Featuring a sultry Sharon Stone in a great supporting role (another memorable scene comes with her demise, as usual quotable to the bone), as well as a memorable climax involving the arid Mars air and a certain outrageous reaction to it, I recommend Total Recall for genre fans and even those who might be wary of it being a 'Hollywood' take on Dick. It's not great, and per usual PKD fans might scoff at the faithfulness to the source, but it's better than some of the lesser adaptations of the author. Just go in for a good time and it stands up over time (err, 16 years).",8,68,90,6 June 2006
Rocky," Best sports film- A LANDSLIDE
","John G. Alvidsen's Rocky is as memorable a piece of cinema can get.  Who can forget Rocky's run up the steps in Philadelphia and the crowd cheering and Burgess Meredith's confidence.  I know I can't.  Ever.  The tale involves a famous local boxer named Rocky Balboa who is in love with a local girl, Adrian and is content, until he wants more, to be the best champ ever.  So, he decides to take on the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.  With the help of his trainers Micky and Pauly, he trains for his fight, but like most masterpiece's he doesn't achieve the gold (yet).This film has almost everything picture perfect.  Sylvester Stallone gives his ultimatum here as the rough and tough Rocky, Talia Shire is good as the straight faced Adrian, Burgess Meredith gives his best performance ever as the pushing yet focused Micky, and Carl Weathers is great as the over-achiever Apollo Creed.  All the elements are in place here for a not only great sports film, but a great cinema piece as well.  AND IT WORKS! A++",10,2,5,28 April 2000
Don't Breathe," a film without strong follow-through on its premise
","Don't Breathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that you don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat sympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human) monster, and it's directed with some skill. I almost wish it had been made with greater sleaze or a total abandon for logic and taste and become a complete Grindhouse exercise, but the problem for me with the film is that director Fede Alvarez - again collaborating with Evil Dead producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert - wants to have it both ways, to have characters that, as the audience, you don't really like or have sympathy for so you don't have to worry *too* much once the psycho ex-military Zatoichi man is getting his payback... until he wants you to like them.There's this sense in the movie that it's dancing with a grey area of having strong, morally ambiguous characterizations - you'll feel one way about the young woman Rocky and her compatriots Alex and 'Money' (yeah, that's his name, like a thug on SVU or something), but maybe not everyone will feel that way until the peril and suspense and terror kicks in. That's fine, as well as it is with the antagonist (who, in the alternate movie that may exist of his story, he's the protagonist). But the problem is that the characters are set in a realistic horror-thriller situation and yet they carry that Dumb Movie Character logic that carries little logic at all.This isn't the case for all of the film, and for the first half I was with it... up to a point. It's certainly got some logic gaps that you got to suspend disbelief for, and things like 'why if this blind ex-military man has all this money is he on the only house on a dilapidated Detroit city block with no one else living there, like out of Stephen King's Roadwork or something. And the filmmaker and his DP carry a lot of heft when it comes to the direction and the look of the film: they know how to bring an audience in by moving the camera in creative ways, having staging that makes sense, and pacing (in these early scenes) that makes things intense for us just as much as the characters... again, up to a point.And then the movie decides to... well, here's where spoilers kick in: the guy (he doesn't have a name so Sgt Hartman-Zatoichi works well) is not simply some old dude living by his lonesome having lost a daughter to a fatal hit and run. No, he has his special set of I-can-kill-you-with-my-hands-or-my-guns, AND more than that is the reveal that in his basement there's a lair for the woman who hit his daughter who... he is also keeping locked up as she is knocked up with his child so that he can replace his dead daughter and... this comes into play even more terrifyingly in the last minutes when the girl Rocky gets in his grasp and... Jesus Christ movie! It's around here, or just before give or take around the moment when you think a character's been stabbed with a pair of gardening shears but it's revealed he is still alive(?!) (and this after seemingly to already be dead from a no-one-survives-that-s*** fall through a window), that the movie goes into Full Stupid and lazy territory. Again, I wish that if Don't Breathe leaped into completely crazy and bonkers terrain, but it doesn't have the courage for that; it's caught in this nexus of trying to be a legitimately creepy and fearful experience done with direction that tries to sometimes call back to things like Fincher's Panic Room (also a 'bottle' one-location scenario), and being a movie with full on exploitation (the title recalls for me Edgar Wright's DON'T trailer from the actual Grindhouse experience), featuring characters we don't care about that are basically drawn (though with some real emotion from the actress playing Rocky) and thrown into nightmarish, violent set pieces.I don't like when a filmmaker cheats me with information that's dealt out to me. I don't like having the rug pulled out from under me even if it's something that I should take for granted like a character survives something they shouldn't of or a character doesn't kill someone when they have ample opportunity to (you'll know the moment, or moments, when they come). I leave Don't Breathe feeling rather empty and angry instead of elated, which terrifying movies can do - see Green Room earlier this year, also about characters caught way in over their heads, for a much greater example of this - but its ugliness is in multiple ways: in how it treats rape and sexual assault (it ends up being a cheap out to having a stronger 2nd/3rd act), in how it treats bodily wounds (come on man), the logic of having a home security system at all if there's, you know, a RAPE DUNGEON in your basement, and how it treats sound design. Yes, for a movie like this the sound design gets weak after a while.",5,165,281,31 August 2016
Eyes Wide Shut," A Worthy Closing
","Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was his final film made (as many people know) and as it is his last it is no less than a perfect Stanley Kubrick film.  He can still grab you with his terrific filmaking in a sexual odyssey that seems not only extraordinary to his audience, but to himself as well (he took a twelve year interlude between making Full Metal Jacket in 1987 and this film).The acting is also superb, mainly by the real life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the couple who hold many secrets from each other.  The film goes on a little longer than some of Kubrick's past ones, but thats because there is a lot more detail in this picture than hin his other ones, including sexual rendevous, long dialogues and scenes of intrigue.  In short, this is Kubick's last, one of his best, and most intriguing films.",10,5,12,10 February 2000
The Descent," possibly the most effective and scary horror movie of the year
","Neil Marshall is not a name I was familiar with before seeing his latest film, The Descent; he's made movies released in the UK, which got limited to no release in the US, to which it would be rightful to say that this is the best kind of calling card he could have made. It's a horror movie that's made with the eye of a professional, one who realizes that the best way to get an audience involved in what comes in the second to third acts of the picture is to make an equally compelling set-up act with the characters. The cast is also all but unknown to me, but they all too perform very strongly as the tough, hot women who decide to risk it down in a spelunking (if that's the word) expedition. Particularly the roles of Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) and Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) are very compelling once the action really starts to roll.But going back to the professional part of the style- this is the kind of horror movie where you do and you don't notice what the filmmakers are doing. Unlike a recent horror movie like Saw which induces lots of fancy shmancy photography and editing to try to draw a viewer in, the director knows the best way is to not show what's going on. With this case being a cave, where the claustrophobia, consistently dark corners, and the lack of direction and light, marks enough doom that it just needs to be shot in a straightforward telling-the-story manner. At the same time, even with all of this atmosphere induced once the creatures appear and the pace picks up tenfold, you almost might forget really that a 'style' is going on, which is quite pleasing at a time when horror directors feel the need to make things gritty just for the sake of it. This is not to say the film isn't one of the most gory of the year, with enough blood to probably go through two of these newer remakes.The set-up to the film with the girls is quite good (including a beginning involving a certain child that is one of the great modern horror movie beginnings by being realistically horrific), leading one to want to see these girls make it through to the end. The ending that has been apparently changed by Lions Gate for the US release is indeed unsatisfying, though it's lead-up is a plot element that's the only convention that doesn't really work. This is that a particular character near death gives information that's only there so that later in the film something else can come of this, breaking part of the belief within the disbelief (if that makes sense). But, overall, this is likely to become a nifty cult hit from overseas, the best of its kind to come from the UK since 28 Days Later. It doesn't really lie to you about what it is, and within certain conventions everything is put to top notch use with locations, tension, special effects and make-up, and even a couple of amusing points. It's a piece that I would probably in good conscience recommend to any serious fan of the genre.",10,8,15,5 August 2006
Some Like It Hot," a perfect example of a light-dark comedy standing the test of time
","Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is about what makes men different than women. It's funny, uproarious, because men who are big womanizers (they're musicians in 1929 prohibition-era Chicago after all) have to go in disguise as women so they aren't recognized as the men they are by mobsters who want to rub them out for several hits they witnessed. I loved seeing how the actors worked off of one another, especially because they had such wonderful dialog to work with. That is one part of it, and how steady the story actually is (it really never falters from being a classically told story for all of its wackiness that ensues), but it's just the repore of the stars, the power they exude on screen (that is, that Marilyn Monroe exudes) and how funny they are in playing it both serious and fun in a single beat.Now that that premise is out of the way, what else is funny about it? Where to start? For one thing just how Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis have their reactions to how they look or who they are as 'women' ('I'm more of a Daphnme', Lemmon's Jerry says), and how they both react in varied ways to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Her character admits that she's stupid, but is she really? She's playing this 'girl' in other movies before, and yet it's a little varied this time around; she'd love to find a rich man on a yacht, sure, but she'd also just like to find a man who would treat her right. It's here that the fun, and some hidden depth and incredible sexual innuendo, comes out of the relationship between 'Cary Grant' Joe (a great-bad imitation) and Sugar, especially the scene between the two on the Yacht and their meeting on the beach... which is almost all of their scenes. They're quite brilliant.Jack Lemmon also scores very highly here with his performance as Jerry/Daphne. Any moment he has to react to Osgood is so funny because of how he reacts and how Joe E. Brown so consistently reacts to Daphne's expressions. It's surely one of the classic moments in movies at the end, but I perhaps loved even more just seeing how the two actors were in the tango scene (and Lemmon's reaction to that to Tony Curtis, the 'We're engaged!' bit is one of the funniest scenes of its time, or any time). We get to see by Wilder's script and direction how men and women (or men as women or men as men) portray each other or react when trying to court. It's a sex farce that was somehow acceptable (I'm surprised some of the innuendo and dress got by with the censors at the time), but also has stayed fresh, maybe fresher, because of how precise it is in its observations on sex and relationships. It sort of goes between the very dark comedy of love in Sunset Blvd. with the lighthearted Hollywood stuff of Sabrina.The former may still be Wilder's best film, but Some Like it Hot finds him working at the peak of his powers with comic timing and sharp dialog for able and ready performers. Was Monroe ever funnier? Perhaps sexier in Seven Year Itch, or a technically better or deeper actress in Don't Bother to Knock. But she's on par with her male co-leads in delivering the goods as someone who gets how to do this comedy. It's rare for lightning to strike like this in comedy in general- The Producers, Duck Soup and His Girl Friday had it- and this is another example.",10,1,3,22 May 2010
Inside Man," goes a little long not knowing when to end, but it is a genuinely clever crowd pleaser
","Inside Man has the appeal of a slick, cool, not-too-old used car. You know certain things will definitely be there, but you also are hoping some things might be surprising. Spike Lee isn't doing an incredible subversion of the heist picture, particularly the bank-heist picture, but he is putting his mark on it, and this split between common Hollywood stylistics and a personal vision make it a fine little piece of studio film-making. There's also a story at work here, one that does develop the ensemble (mostly of hostages, and cops, and others), while also developing in a way that, at the least, isn't too boring. There may be a lot of elements going on in the film surrounding this bank robbery, and its questionable if the focus isn't on one thing the whole time. But if Lee can do one thing quite well, it's making sure the pieces fit, most of the time.His cast is all top-notch, with his on/off again acting collaborator Denzel Washington in his smart, always interesting form as the hostage negotiator. He's up against Clive Owen's Don, head of a few really well-planned (he calls it the 'perfect bank robbery') robbers, who've taken a heap of people hostage. Owen, to me, has one of his better performances, not an easy feat being under a mask and glasses through most of his role, but his voice (as usual deep and brooding in his English way) is dead-on and threatening. There's also Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer as the 'special interests' looking out for something that happens to be in a certain safety deposit box. If I'm being a little vague then its for the purpose of the viewer; this isn't a twist that just comes out of nowhere, and it could be argued to not even be a real 'twist'.One of the things that had me really attentive was knowing how the structure of the story would go after a while, the bits of general unpredictability of when a flash-forward (err, Denzel's interviews with the ex-hostages), and how it carried a similar lighting scheme to Lee's Clockers. It's a very good lighting set-up. And, like Scorsese with the Aviator, in this very prominent big-studio budget, Lee is able to put in little nods to the audience that this is still his 'joint'. Even if the screenwriter, Russel Gurwitz, doesn't have the focus always together, and after the climax there are a few too many exposition-type scenes, the last scene does give a nice grin to most in the audience. In fact, this is a terrific film to see in a packed theater, as I had the chance to have, as there are more than a few really funny moments interspersed with the more thrilling cat & mouse scenes. Inside Man plays on clichés in a way that reminds me of the Usual Suspects, and done in its own slick, used-car way that wont really break down, for most.",8,3,6,27 March 2006
Pulp Fiction," One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is
","Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you.",10,373,679,20 January 2000
Jack Reacher," good stuff, except...
","Jack Reacher has some solid action set pieces - when they do occur, which includes Cruise beating up a group of guys, a high-speed (really electrifying) chase across a city, and a climax has its moments for sure. The film is above-averagely (no, excellently) shot and edited in this regard (thanks Caleb Deschanel!), Christopher McQuarrie keeps things at a brisk pace, and of course for the precious minutes Werner Herzog is on screen it's electrified with his presence as a true horrific being - almost to the point, perhaps, where I was laughing to myself at just HOW EVIL this man is, The Zec = The Prisoner, as in Syberian prison.But there's so much more time I wish he had had when it's mostly the Tom Cruise, who is fine, neither great nor bad, serviceable more than his usual charming self (it's like, we get it, you're a super-hero bad-ass, what else is there to you), and Rosamund Pike show. The latter has proved herself elsewhere to be a fabulous actress, full of vitality and old-school Hollywood power as a star and even with comic timing (Gone Girl and World's End specifically). Here, I blame the writing for just a very, um, 'okay' actress, more fit for a CBS primetime show than a big blockbuster.If it's on TV it's not a bad watch, but I was glad to get Herzog with his glass-eye on a huge screen. If he had played the guy Max von Sydow meets in the beach in The Seventh Seal, he would've gone running to the hills or swimming off to the ocean. Chess? Hell with that.",6,0,2,6 May 2015
Detroit Rock City," Not the Best, but the DVD helps
","Detroit Rock City works on me as a cross between Suburbia and the Wizard of Oz.  The Story and script was pretty good by having a 4-some of gross-out teens in 1978 going after their Oz, KISS.  Like the Wizard of Oz, they run into a lot of trouble, including the equivalent of the wicked witch (a conservative Catholic mother played well by Lin Shaye).
But not all the elements are in place here for a comedy (actors like Furlong and Andrews aren't the best at comedy), and though there are a few laughs here and there, it doesn't pack a bang like I though it would (KISS which I like doesn't appear until the end).  But, watching the DVD version, I noticed many different scenes and some other things I didn't see the first time around.  A good effort by writer and director wise, but not quite fully dandy.

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Funny flick. Clever.
","Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a funny film that gives new word to 'disorderly'.  About a group of low-lifes (Jason Flemying, Nick Moran, Dexter Flitcher) who have to pay a load of money to a mob boss who also runs a porn shop.  In this escapade, many funny (and crude) things happen, including a retreival of only 2 guns (and lots of money) and a father criminal and his tag-along son.  Clever British crime story from Guy Ritchie who makes his debut as director here.  A good time to watch, unless you don't like English people.  Sting appears in a few scenes as a bar owner (his role was my favorite).  A",8,6,6,30 April 2000
The Da Vinci Code," maybe the best that could be done from the book- a contrived-to-hell (no pun intended) blockbuster with some merit
","What can I say that hasn't already be written or said about Dan Brown's international smash book about the deepest 'secret' in Christianity? Having read only part of it (as it is, arguably of course, an airplane book with a hugely elevated status over controversy and popularity), I can say that the movie, directed by Ron Howard and with a cast of French, American and British all-stars, does what it means to do. It brings some food-for-thought, with enough exposition for three typical Hollywood movies. And, at times, Howard and company (i.e. screenwriter Akiva Goldsman) shave off a couple of parts in Brown's writing that aren't necessary while keeping the thoughtful (as well as, dare I say, silly) nature of the writing. As it is, the Da Vinci Code DOES have a plot that is structured well enough- a symbol specialist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks in a role that basically calls for the basics of his talents, no more no less), is drawn into a case of murders, a conspiracy involving secret, ultra-dangerous sects of the Catholic church (with a creepy villain in Paul Bettany's character), and a search for an item as old as Christianity itself.The film traces parts of Europe for the hunt, and along the way there is information compulsively expounded upon about the secrets behind the murders, the symbols, the clues, and how the entire history of the Jesus Christ is possibly- dare the filmmaker/authors say- corrupted and a lie. So it is here that the controversy has been brought through. But the controversy is no more understandable than it was for films like Dogma and The Last Temptation of Christ; religious groups are BOUND to get sensitive by material that faces against their sternly stringent views. That it's transferred into a murder mystery/thriller that has more twists than the International House of Pretzel puts it up for everyone to contemplate. What helps make the film watchable even as the story goes through more contrivances and surprises than I'd care to count (with the core being a suspension of disbelief of both plot turns and the exposition bits) is the cast assembled. The bulk of the players- Ian McKellan, Alfred Molina, Audrey Tatou, and Jean Reno- are the best that could have been cast, and all that are asked of them are to say the dialog with enough conviction and believability to not be totally dull or just, well, wrong.While the direction by Howard and his crew is not the most imaginative, he is able to serve all of the 'so-called' facts and ideas to use without making it into the overly pretentious. While I wouldn't think of this at all of being a great film or with the ambition even to BE one, it at least tries to have the skills of the common Hollywood thriller while serving up more facts than the same thriller wouldn't think to touch. To put it another way- this is basically Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with half of the adventure, and more than half of the historical and religious implications amplified. As Ebert said, it's 'preposterously entertaining', and to take it as 100% serious is missing what is aimed for, even if not entirely successful. 6/10",6,10,21,19 May 2006
Titanic," Well Done, yet over rated
","James Francis Cameron's Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves.  True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn't had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.If you don't know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn't survive because the story is world-renoun.  So are it's actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron's script about romance on the high seas.  Luckily, the film doesn't go as slow as you may think, but still, that's no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real life.But seriously, this film does have many great qualitites.  The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar.  One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting.  Good direction though.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Overrated but entertaining
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.  A little long but never really boring, Harrpy Potter offers up a nice stew of excitement on this thanksgiving weekend with some great visuals and score (from John Williams).  Yet it is not a great film.  Grade: between A- and B+",7,2,6,19 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," not the best of the 'Potter' movies, but it's got some captivating sights and even extraordinary scenes
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire pushes the franchise into the PG-13 level, and for good reason: Lord Voldermort, played to a chillingly Gothic T by Ralph Fiennes, is much more present not just as an ominous, unnamed presence, but as a vindictive, murderous threat from the grave. He's the Nosferatu of the 'Potter' series, but with a further sense of dread that is the unwavering sense of pure evil in such a world of wizards and magic. But Goblet of Fire isn't just about the evil, or just put-on evil by way of a curse or other dark forces at work, though it's in this that the film works usually at its strongest and most surreal points. There's a whole section dedicated to a new form of competition: get the dragon's egg in the Triwizard tournament. Some of this is compelling, mostly involving the actual under-water part of the tournament, where the suspense level isn't very high but it's highly watchable for its interesting look. How does one see 'magic' happen underwater? If there perhaps is any significant problem, or perhaps just big gripe, to have with Goblet of Fire it's that as an emotional experience of the conventional kind it works much better on a first viewing, in the theater, where the big crescendo happens (murder is a key factor here, of a character I won't mention), and one gets caught up in the first truly significant tragedy in the series, if not the film. But on a repeat viewing, somehow, this is lessened in impact, and if anything there's certain flaws in some of the performances (a father's wailing cries, to not spoil too much for those who haven't seen the movie or read the book, are pretty poorly delivered), and even what seemed like really riveting scenes of competition- and some of the quasi-teen drama developments involving Harry's friends- seem a little more contrived or just not as interesting as before. But on the other hand, director Mike Newell finds ways to make his entry in the franchise watchable in many tight areas. Brendan Gleeson was a great choice for Professor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, who has a look about him where, as with Rickman's Snape, you can't totally be sure what his intentions or alliances side. And there's some moments of levity thrown in in good levels of measure.But, if for nothing else, the aspect of the strange, violent and, as far as a series like this can go at this point as the mid-way movie, incredibly dark presence of Voldemort, with Fiennes's physical prowess going past the fact that he's under lots of make-up (or CGI) and pitting to the most effective villains in contemporary big-budget big-studio movie-making. To put it another way, if the last half hour or so pops up again on TV, I'll be sure to watch it all the way to the end. 7.5/10",7,0,2,15 July 2007
The Happening," not a real 'worst-movie-ever' like Lady in the Water... more like a high-budget/high-on-itself Ed Wood flick
","M. Night Shyamalan, sad to say, was a case of a fluke in Hollywood. This isn't to say that he hasn't had some good moments in movies like Unbreakable and Signs (more-so for the former), but The Sixth Sense, one of the great big wonderkind stories of the 90s has manifested itself with its creator churning out pieces of, frankly, crap upon its unwitting audience. This isn't to say that because his first few hits he wont make more movies- matter of fact he's apparently working on an Avatar picture (not the James Cameron one, the kid-anime one)- but following the Village, which took the ludicrous 'twist' ending to new horrific heights, and Lady in the Water which is, at least to me, a true unmitigated disaster unleashed on to celluloid, The Happening continues the thread of total nonsense in the guise of thoughtful blockbuster stuff.Point of order: The Happening's title first opens up the potential pit-falls for jokes on the title alone (does anyone else not picture a 60s flower-power flick?), and indeed 'something's happening' or 'it's happened' or some variation is said enough times to merit a drinking game after it. But then the actual movie, from its opening scenes all the way to the last, are so ridiculous in nearly every step of the way for the same basic reasons that Edward D. Wood Jr's movies are still totally ridiculous failures: give actors a screenplay that is loaded with laughably hackneyed dialog (at one point the Zooey Deschanal character says, and I quote, 'Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented'), delivered by more or less (usually less) competent actors with straight faces as they are put into a stupid sci-fi premise. In this case a mighty wind of sorts, or rather some chemical coming from the plants that are angry or incensed via nature's wrath or whatever the hell, is attacking the cities and towns of the northeast and the Moore family (Walhberg and Deschanal and daughter) run from it.Yep, that's right, a lot of the movie is just characters running from the wind- with the occasional pit stop for Wahlberg to talk to a plastic plant- and from scene to scene there is just one incredibly laughable inanity after another. To give some very minor credit where it's due, it's not always the fault of the direction; as was the case in the Village there are one or two moments that do reveal some sort of 'vision' in the works, a shot or two that stand out as impressive... and then we get put back into the 'what-the-bleep' clockwork of this overwrought 'message' movie that says, apparently, that what we don't know from nature and probably can't know since we can't really trust science will kill us. And all the while Shyamalan almost creates something inadvertently very entertaining; I can imagine the Happening becoming one of those classic bad movies years from now, so entirely dumbfounding with its totally serious-toned acting, dead-pan dialog and awfully staged violence (i.e. lion feeding, lawnmower) that one can't help but find it riotous.Maybe Shyamalan can continue his career that way, who knows? One thing is for certain: the guy is NOT the next Hitchcock or the next Spielberg. He's lucky the wind hasn't knocked him off his feet completely.",3,13,21,11 October 2008
Castle in the Sky," Miyazaki turns fantasy on its wonderful, conventional head once again
","Castle in the Sky (full title Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is another in the extraordinary works in the cannon of Hayao Miyazaki, who is arguably the master of fantasy in animation, worldwide. It's plot should be able to read through easily, at least for anyone who's seen the main conventional point of either the Dark Crystal or Lord of the Rings (probably the former is a little more accurate). A princess has to get to a location with a sacred object- in this case an rock-amulet- and take it to the main power source on Laputa, a secret castle that can barely be said to exist except in rumor. She goes on an adventure with another curious party, a boy, and the two of them have to contend with pirates and a nefarious man in a suit along the way. The twists are turned on a familiar premise at every step, however, because Miyazaki lets his imagination and influences spring out all over the place. We get vines and clouds and Superman-inspired robots! What Castle in the Sky promises is what it delivers full-throttle; it's action and excitement for a family audience (and it's not to sound patronizing; dudes in their 20s and gals in their 30s will love this as much as the little ones who sought out Spirited Away and Totoro so), and humor in bits and pieces as well (maybe not as much as Totoro, or skewed in a surreal way like Mononoke, but it's still there in a light tone with the pirates). And the design overall should capture everyone's fancy; from the Goliath ship to the little details of the robots to the expanse and crevices of Laputa, to what looks like it MUST have been special visual FX animation, it's all mind-boggling and mind-blowing at the same measure. It might not be Miyazaki's ultimate triumph, but it's still great film-making, a triumph of imagination to deliver on a tale of good vs. evil.",10,3,3,23 April 2008

","In brief, with Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, it's like how you might see a hacky critic say it: I laughed, I cried, I watched the other (first) awesome Doug Jones, and witnessed one of the most gorgeous and moving films of my lifetime. Maybe one of those isn't the usual thing, but you get what I mean.Longer: Del Toro is a filmmaker so engaged with how people make choices in stories and how the world around them and what is inside them is sometimes at odds and other times really not so, and how that steers a story in a particular direction. Fantasy is often his vehicle and it's to the point where he is so engaged with it that he deals with it directly as reality, or at least he gives it that texture; this is a film where reality and fantasy coalesce into something that is so tactile, pure, wondrous and it's unlike something you've seen before while being reminiscent of many things you've seen before. Pan's Labyrinth was one such way of going about that, and The Shape of Water belongs into that pantheon of a master working with a sharp focus on what he wants and having the cast and craftsmen to pull off his vision. The movie may belong to a lot of actors actually - Michael Shannon's sympathetic and yet hateful 'big bad wolf' in this aquatic 60's cold-war spy-tinged fairy tale; Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian agent who actually has a lot of concern for science and what this creature could mean past its 'icky' insides; Octavia Spencer as someone who on the surface appears to be the chatty best friend type (not unlike in a movie that might have come out in the 50's and 60's, whether she would have been played by a black actress I don't know, possibly not), and has to endure the same kind of racism mixed with sexism as nearly all women then; Richard Jenkins, getting many award nominations and deserves them all, as a closeted artist who is not defined by his sexuality (his hair is as much of importance as who he finds attractive, or his cats) - but, with all those noted, it's the Sally Hawkins show. She commands this with a face that is warm and inviting and a little quirky (maybe like a more tolerable Amelie, I'm sure silent comedians or Giuleta Massina from Fellini's films works in there too), and when she listens to people not like her or the typical-to-1962 worldview she's curious and definitely not dismissive. Oh, and she pleasures herself too, so the sexual active part is not submerged, so to speak.So when this Amphibian Man character, the most creative homage to Creature from the Black Lagoon since that film came out, is engaged by her, it's not like some kind of thing that's too overly quirky or about their differences (so, as good as this movie was, it's not Starman for example). It's about two outsider souls coming together, physically and emotionally (but, at times, certainly physically, though the most, uh, tasteful depiction one might care to see), and how the world around them is... well, it's a fish-man, kill it with fire! Actually, that's how it would have been in the previous generation, and Del Toro knows this. Moreover, he connects that to the political temperature of the period, which is, frankly, a mood that is not unlike at all what we have now. It's a distinctly American story too, and coming from a Mexican filmmaker that's not to be underestimated.But what makes The Shape of Water so remarkable, among the towering pieces of cinema this decade, is how seemingly effortlessly the emotion runs through this thing, and how Del Toro and his cinematographer and production designer and composer Alexandre Desplat and Doug Jones and so on, manifests that in total cinematic terms. He brings us through every step like a storyteller should to get us to empathize with most of these characters and even, dare I say, understand and see Shannon's guy as a tragic figure, the 'All-American' who's been force-fed a lot of garbage and not only accepts it but wants to live up to it (a scene where his boss explains what decency means to him is the most 2017 scene that will ever be, but extends past that). This is a world that is not all wholly original and doesn't pretend to be - Hawkins and Jenkins live above a movie theater for (Fish-Man) God's sake - but it's sincere in a way that other filmmakers might have found cheaper, or even to the point of not trusting (or simply seeing at all) an actress like Hawkins can be this person. This is beautiful work on all the levels a piece of cinema should be, alive and provocative politically, romantically, in gender, in just how to LIVE in this world with one another. And, maybe, how to look at how we view ourselves in relation to God, or Gods or whatever.",10,25,46,23 December 2017
The Untouchables," still at the top of my De Palma list; stellar cast with a tight ball of a script
","Among the top five films of 1987, and filmmaker Brian De Palma's career, is the Untouchables, a firecracker kind of Hollywood film that gives the story of Elliot Ness versus Al Capone some great panache. And it's the kind of great film that is so only through the combined efforts of everybody, not just De Palma, even as it is his vision (sometimes playfully homage-like, as I'll mention in a moment), but his cast, crew, and the script by David Mamet. The cast here includes Kevin Costner, in one of his three or four passably good performances, in the Ness part (like his later Jim Garrison role, the confident if a bit conflicted hero); De Niro in a ham-bone best as Capone, with one of the more eye-opening and funny scenes he's ever done (eg with a bat); Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia in juicy supporting roles. And then one comes to Sean Connery, in his deserved Oscar winning turn as Irish cop turned Ness partner Jim Malone, who has the toughest words and the biggest guts of the group. It's in his work here, where he has some of that confidence of past performances into a very real character that makes it quite a piece. Aside from the sheer presence of a star like Connery on screen, there's some depth he gives to the character too, just as De Niro does with his choices as an actor (even if his role is the larger-than-life one).De Palma, at his disposal as a craftsman, has good editors and camera people working alongside him, as well as Ennio Morricone on music (a small 'yey' emits from my mind). Through them his film is a slick, but not overbearingly at all, kind of 1930's Hollywood picture, with a story of the cops versus robbers, in some unconventional circumstances. The centerpiece of the climax, De Palma's homage to Eistenstein's Battleship Potemkin, is operatic and grandiose and puts the drama of what was in real life likely quite different into a spectacular sequence, is as entertaining as it could be. While it's not the only action sequence in the film, one could point to just that one sequence as being a true highlight of doing homage well. In truth it's been a little while since I've seen the Untouchables, and maybe even longer since I've seen it from start to finish (and, unfortunately, never on a big screen). But I wouldn't dare to tell you not to watch it if you haven't yet.",10,1,5,3 April 2006
The Godfather: Part III," like the Star Wars prequels, this film is marked by some as a 'never should have been made'. I wouldn't agree with that
","In giving a wrap-up, a conclusion to two of the most powerful crime and family stories to come out of the seventies, Francis Ford Coppola took a risk that many feel didn't pay off. I almost wish I didn't know what criticisms people had before viewing it again recently (I had seen the film when I was in my early teens, but forgot most of it). Some of them, such as the mis-casting of Sofia Coppola, the long, drawn-out scenes, the heavy-handed dialog, are not entirely un-founded. And I would agree that this is my least favorite of the trilogy. But I do not feel that it is a failure, or a mis-calculation by Coppola and co-author Mario Puzo. In fact, right from the get-go and throughout the film, I was very intrigued by the direction of the story that was being taken, as well as with the characters. At the core, Coppola cares deeply about the Corleone family, in particular Michael (Al Pacino, his most infamous crime performance alongside Tony Montana), despite the sins that have been committed. It's a tale of redemption, of loss, and of what matters in a life dominated by greed and corruption in the legitimate as well as illegitimate places. Coppola understands this world, or at least the dynamics of it, and that's what makes Godfather 3 at the least a fascinating character study.Not to mention, much of the assembled cast (with the loss of Robert Duvall being the only set-back) is still highly dependable- Pacino is great at being tragic, and his subtleties in some scenes rank with his best work (one scene that stuck with me was his confession to the priest about Fredo). Keaton, for her scenes, is alright considering her dialog. Andy Garcia makes an impression fast in one of his early performances. Eli Wallach is an interesting choice for the Don (once again, like with Tuco, an effective take on a clichéd character). And Sofia Coppola, while understandably forced in some of her emotions (or, indeed, under-cooked), is not as bad as some have made her out to be. After all, she is supposed to be just a regular girl, not within the overly dramatic landscape of the criminals and politicians. And the story, which follows Michael's chances at achieving legitimacy at the turn of the end of the seventies while his nephew tries to find the line of a 'good' made guy, keeps a viewer on edge with the style too. To put it as such, Gordon Willis keeps a consistency with his masterful work in the first two films (at least, all three in the trilogies are masterpieces of lighting and compositions, and Willis was reportedly more responsible for the look of the films than Coppola, who focused on the actors and theatrics). And such a wonderful, operatic music score by Carmine Coppola is a fitting swan song, if missing the Nina Rota touch. For me, The Godfather: part 3 (a.k.a. The Death of Michael Corleone, Coppola's original title) is only a disappointment in how there isn't (arguably) the level of ambition in regards to the others. And the violent content, although original in its tactics, may not pack the wallop one might expect. But as a film by itself, this is a drama of considerable merit, and wouldn't spoil the flow if watched right after the first two in one sitting.",9,6,13,17 September 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," One of the better, more entertaining films you'll see this summer, possibly this year
","The Matrix Reloaded is like a high octane video game for Playstation 2 or X-Box, brought superbly onto the screen by the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), with plenty for the audience to enjoy and soak up.  This is indeed a film that doesn't match up quite to the original (what could, really), but what is breathtaking is how the Wachowskis' feel a confidence, mastery of their medium of sci-fi action storytelling.  Even when the film gets all too deep into the philosophical speculations and dialogue (which the first balanced with the action perfectly), it rebounds to get to what the audience wants to see- fights, chases, gun and knife/sword battles, and all the visual effects that can be brought forth in a Hollywood picture.
I won't say too much of the plot except that in the second installment we see our heroes, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, facing the oncoming of the war with the machines, and how they, and more specifically Neo, will be tested to their limits.  These limits make up the sum of the visual effects and action sequences, which are about 60 to 65 percent of the whole movie. And that's what makes the film a worthy watch (not the acting, since it's even lesser than in the first one, as Keanu Reeves proves) is that there seems to be always something to look at, admire, and maybe even dismiss as TOO un-real.Bottom line, The Matrix Reloaded isn't a great movie, like it's monumental predecessor, however it doesn't leave I, as I'm sure it won't leave others, with a sense of money not well spent.  As one character said, 'The choice, I leave up to you.'  Grade: A",6,1,5,14 May 2003
The Fountain," the kind of studio picture that won't do very well at the box office, but has 'cult' written (or floating) all over it
","I wasn't totally sure what to expect from Darren Aronofsky's the Fountain, but I knew from the trailer and the buzz that it would be extraordinary- for better or worse- and it could possibly have been a combination of both. Walking out of the theater was interesting in and of itself, as I tried to process what had exactly 'happened' in the last ten minutes of it, which is so loaded with abstractions it gives Inland Empire a run for its surrealistic money. It's the work of a director who one can tell is so obsessed and drawn by what he wants to convey to the viewer that its bound to not make complete sense. No bother- the Fountain works really on a few levels though, some much more harrowingly and amazingly than others. One things for certain, at least for me (and I do need to re-watch Requiem for a Dream very soon so this could change), this is one of the best directed pictures- or at least most ambitious in vision and scope and purpose- of the last several years.If I didn't find it to be altogether a total masterwork maybe it was to be somewhat expected, or perhaps not. I still can't tell completely, but I think it probably has to do with the filmmaker skirting so along the edge of his unique, otherworldly vision of one man's search for not just life but a belief in it, that it runs the risk of running off the rails into pretentious land. One thing that worried me were the early negative reviews (i.e. 'Zardoz anyone?'), and the comparisons to Jodorowsky made me feel iffy, if intrigued, as well. If there is any one thing though that's compelling about the Fountain it's that we're given really an emotional context for most of the way, and a sort of bedrock that can be sort of fallen back on. Like Aronofsky's Pi- and maybe Requiem to an extent- it's about going past the limits of potential, or not even knowing what the limits are, in a certain goal. At the end of The Fountain I was definitely left with more questions than answers, and not necessarily in the greatest grandiose '2001' way either (befuddlement does need a little more rhythm then what comes out towards the end).But, as I said, I really did get very much involved with the picture, and the struggle of Tommy (Hugh Jackman, in one of his best performances), to try in the present day to find a cure for tumors, in order to possibly save his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz, very lovely if not as compelling overall as in something like Constant Gardener). There's an element of the movie the Neverending Story, I felt, that came into the movie quite well, as Tommy starts to read a book Izzi is writing about a Spanish conquistador in a search for her Queen (also Jackman and Weisz respectfully), called the 'Tree of Life', as said in the Bible. It's here that the theme is really interesting to me, and carries over for a big chunk of the film. What does it mean for someone to believe in something so fantastical that it can possibly be? Can Jackman save Weisz after death? Can death be 'cured' by this possible solution or tree or whatever? Aronofsky might be quite optimistic, or perhaps not, the ending only leaves a certain hint of what may or never be.It's within though this framework that Aronofsky, with his technical crew from Requiem (DP Libatique with his amazing use of lights and close-ups, editor Rabinowitz for the different sense of pacing, and this time James Chindlund's stunning production design), with an added touch of magnificent, original special effects. From what I read not everything was CGI, which in and of itself is unique to me, that they apparently used what bacteria looks like for the certain 'future' scenes and visions. But what had me all the way into the material was how Aronofsky pulled it off- even when a scene or two wasn't very well written (like some of the 1500s scenes) or when they just made about as much sense as a dog leaving a bone alone. One might say that it's too 'trippy' and hallucinatory for its own good, and as I said in the last ten minutes the onslaught of wild abstractions almost got to me. However I could never let go of how strong and commanding the visual style went with the material. And certainly filmmakers shouldn't complain much when seeing that a film like this, which looks like it costs a hell of a lot more than 35 million, cant make do with 100 million or more for theirs.Bottom line, I'm sure it will divide a great many viewer, and unlike some other of the fantastical films I've seen in 2006 (i.e. the Science of Sleep, A Scanner Darkly, Tideland), I'm not sure if it will really improve or seem more illuminating or revelatory on repeat viewings, and unlike Tideland it's not even really ahead of its time as much as it's in its own time-frame. Like its main protagonist, it's uncompromising and daunting in what it sets out to accomplish cinematically, and 90% of the time I was hooked in. And it's a credit to Aronofsky that his main influence, Jodorowsky, comes through in all its weird, mystical glory. I mean, where else will you get Hugh Jackman (in the space scenes with the tree) looking like David Carradine in Kung-Fu? Overall, it'a stirring, romantically charged piece of art.",9,12,22,28 November 2006
Mystic River," Eastwood's 24th directorial effort is one of his finest- the cast is entirely stellar
","Mystic River is, in it's story, a mystery, but the characters that consist of it bring it to the level of a truly effective, touching tragedy. It's rare in a movie-going experience that I expect to feel immediate or emotional with what the characters go through, and the path(s) the story takes them. But something about the effect of the performances made me feel completely immersed in it, and by the end I was trembling. The murder-mystery elements in the story keep the viewer interested, however it's the dramatic elements in the storytelling and how the psychology of each character, major or supporting, is revealed that the film gains it's momentum. Each small or important emotion is played as it would in real life, and every player knows the pains that lie in their characters psyches. Penn's violent, torn Jimmy is one of his finest works in years; Bacon is better-than-usual in a role that requires his sorrow to be mostly buried; Laura Linney and Marcia Gay-Harden as Penn and Robbins' wives each hold their own unique talents. And then there's Robbins, who finds the perfect notes in Dave- the viewer is never too sure what he saw or did that late-night of Katie is murder was real because there's ghosts that perpetually cloud his mind. It's a very complex person, and since Robbins conveys him with just the right anguish, just the right subtly, that it may be one of his very best performances of his career.That such a cast could pull it off, from the script by Brian Hegeland and the direction by Clint Eastwood, is a testament to how skilled they can be. Eastwood is worthy of very high praise here, because he has to be the one to weave it all together. In his actors he knows what to get out of them, that they are far more important for the story than the actually mechanics of the story itself. By allowing the characters to give us a view of their world, we get involved more and more into the story. In a sense this gives Eastwood a chance to explore similar territory he did in Unforgiven, and overall it's just as compelling (though in a different genre).

Zombieland," how to have a kick-ass time and laugh your brains out with people... and zombies too
","Inevitably, Zombieland will be (and already has been) compared to Shaun of the Dead, the other most notable 'Zom-Com' of this past decade (or in that case 'Rom-Zom' due to it being a romantic comedy with zombies). This goes without noting other notable zombie-related comedies like Fido or involving animals like Black Sheep. But if one has to compare apples and oranges growing on practically the same field, here's the difference: 1) as much as I love Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's work (specifically Hot Fuzz and Spaced), SOTD started to not be quite as effective, even as it was being admirably tried out technically, when it switched from a really funny and spot-on comedy and spoof of Romero's film to suddenly taking itself a bit too seriously as a zombie movie. 2) I (almost) hate to say this, but... Zombieland ultimately wins on counts of being so funny- or as the kids say, 'f***in' funny as hell, OMG'- that it hurts, and giving us characters to take away with that we care about when, you know, they aren't slaughtering the undead one by one. It's also so bad-ass you can taste the awesome, something rare to find in movies outside of the Road Warrior.It stars Jessie Eisenberg as a guy whom we may have seen him sort of play before, more or less, as the awkward kid who hasn't had sex and spent much of his time playing World of Warcraft and hooked on Mountain Dew when he got attacked by the first zombie he met - a girl from apartment 406 who got bit by a homeless man. What does this last part have to do with the plot? Well, only inasmuch that it gives the first incentive for Eisenberg's character, here named Columbus after the city he's going to originally, to craft a list of things to do when confronted with zombies. For example, seat-belts, or the 'double-tap' rule which involves shooting a zombie, and then making sure to shoot once more in the head. He keeps this list and lists it almost like out of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket, and as a not-quite-wuss he fares OK on his own... and then he meets Talahassee (Harrelson, good Lord), a seemingly walking-talking-cursing redneck who misses his puppy Buck and just wants a damn Twinkie - and NOT those Hostess Snowball things.It's after they pair up, and subsequently meet two con women (or rather con-woman and con-girl played by Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) who at first just car-jack Columbus and Talahassee. That is until they start riding a bit together and find they need each other way more than they don't. This might make it sound like a squishy story, perhaps with some room for some ample social commentary like a Romero movie. It doesn't really have that. It's more akin to National Lampoon's Vacation, complete with a 'quest' to reach a theme-park in Los Angeles, and maybe running into some hijinks and surprises along the way. If one of those may happen to be Bill Murray in his mansion where he's in zombie-garb and make-up to 'blend-in', then so be it. Holy crap, did I just mention Bill Murray in a zombie movie? Damn straight, and now you know what kind of movie this is.So yes, Zombieland has the things zombie-movie lovers go for first and foremost, which are really effective looking un-dead, some genuine scares (at least the kind that give easily-impressionable girls watching the movie at midnight the screams), and some really solid action. But it's first and foremost a comedy, one that is focused on character and wit and surprise and ingenuity over just satire, and it fires on all cylinders. I don't think I've had this much pure fun at a movie in a while (not counting the kind of a movie-lover like Inglourious Basterds or the 'guy' movie comedy of the Hangover), and its all due to newcomer director Ruben Fleischer and his writers not pulling any punches. Since we believe in the world they're in, pretty much, we can buy whatever comedy springs out, sometimes from simple one-liners like the banter while driving in the car (i.e. Hannah Montana, Willie Nelson), or just the sheer insanity of the climactic battle at the theme park where the rides are used to their maximum, including (yes YES!) a Haunted House! From its opening credits sequence that promises as much and gives an impression of its tone like none other this year except Watchmen, to the odd-couple bond between Eisenberg and Harrelson that works so well you can't see it any other way, to that nearly quirky/awesome way that Columbus faces his fear of clowns while re-writing his own rule on heroics, to... almost every scene with a couple of exceptions, no opportunity is wasted, or just taken upon by its makers. It's so sharp and original a take on a subject nearly beaten to death (pun intended) that its success just shows the potential still there: for all of the horrible and cheapo living-dead product out there, one can go back to this or the original Return of the Living Dead and realize something essential. It's about the people, not the zombies, and the people here, and how zombies are 'treated', simply just... rocks.",10,34,63,1 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," the tale of the classic selfless man's conflicted mind-set and the town that's ingrained in his life
","I should be inclined to say that Frank Capra made his masterpiece with It's a Wonderful Life, and it would probably be the obvious, easy answer to make as a movie-lover. And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day & age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

Enemy at the Gates," At it's core, it is quite good
","When I say that, I mean that it's core being the war scenes, and of course, every scene between the two confronters, Jude Law and Ed Harris.In 1942 Russia, the Germans are closing in and only one person can help in keeping the nazis back, a sniperman Vassili (Law) by killing the Germans by the dozens from a hiding place.  But, another expert comes in named Koening (Harris, in fine form as always) who will fight to the death.  The film has un-needed side plots (a love triangle doesn't sound as real in a non-fiction story) and has the British actors and actresses keeping they're accents when playing Russians (that got annoying after a while).  But when you take every single moment on the screen where we see the duo of Harris and Law against each other in a cat and mouse game, you have a great war movie.  If only the pesky side things weren't in the way.  B+",7,1,2,24 March 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A Splendid job turned in by Crowe and Howard
","Ron Howard brings forth one of his best and most serious films to date, A Beautiful Mind.  It examines a mathematical wizard named John Forbes Nash Jr. who created a discovery in game theory that is still used today for a number of things.  But the film isn't so much about math (what film is?) as it is about the man's struggles with a disease in his mind that drives him to madness yet somehow is able to try and fight it to the best of his abilities, which aren't always as high as they could be.  This man is played by Russell Crowe who gives another top shelve performance to add with The Insider, L.A. Confidential and Romper Stomper (Gladiator I don't really count as a top shelve performance), and he plays Mr. Nash so well it doesn't need to be thought that he's immitating him as much as being him. 
Crowe's Nash starts off in the film at Princeton university where he wants to distinguish himself with an original idea and soon comes up with one that defies 150 years of mathematical practice.  Things look good, especially since he starts dating a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly in an Oscar caliber performance to be sure) who is smitten with him.  But then things start to get troublesome- Nash is asked by a member of the defense depot to break codes that could be in newspapers, magazines, etc to help out the government.  Soon he feels paranoid the Russians are after him, and this leads him into a mental hospital (under Christopher Plummer's care) where he learns the entire consipracy is in his head (schitzophrenia).  Then the plot thickens as Nash battles with his disease, medication or not.Sometimes it's almost too much, but Howard delivers overall a great and compelling tale throughout nevertheless and Crowe shines (the rest of the cast, real or not, are also quite credible) with all the talent he has.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," has its moments, but by far the least memorable of the films so far
","Maybe it was keeping on Chris Columbus as director- he helmed the first Harry Potter and did an OK, if not that terrific, job at it- or in making it about as long as possible (whether or not everything in the book, as someone who's seen the films but not read the books, I can't say, though it feels like they crammed it all), or in making it a wee bit too corny, but Chamber of Secrets is a bulky kids movie. It has an appeal for the whole family, as does the first one, and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes, but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over (unless, of course, you're a hardcore fan). It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel: same characters that like Potter just as much- his closest friends Ron and Hermonie- and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy. Although the film/story does set up 'he-who-mus-not-be-named' in a good and ambiguous way, this is more in hindsight of the more recent Potter stories, where that is made much more clear and sinister. It does have some rousing bits in there, as I recall, John Cleese is particularly good as Nearly Headless Nick (basically plopping a Monty Python performer in the midst of it all, which is the case) and there's always Richard Harris as Dumbledore (I still prefer him over Gambon, even though the latter is still good). But a lot of it seems much too cliché, even coming from the decent lot of Rowling subversions, and the whole bits with the character Dobby is just really cheesy. In short, it's the only one of the Potter movies I don't have a desire to see too soon, and if I ever do read the books I only anticipate it can only go up from here in quality.",5,5,9,15 July 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," chemistry and explosions and shoot-outs and un-witty dialog can't make a good film
","Does this version of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (I say version because to call it any kind of 'remake' of the Alfred Hitchcock film, with no similar plot at all, would be an insult to the master) have its occasional moments of entertainment? I suppose so, but for me that cannot constitute a good movie. A lot of the comments I have read or heard about the film from critics and others who have seen it have all said this, whether they liked it or not- 'Brad and Angelina have such chemistry, they work together so well, they're so good together, etc, etc.' I wish I could say that could make a film a success, but I get frustrated with this kind of blockbuster mentality- if the film has a story, and then it has chemistry, then it will work a lot better than without it. Mr & Mrs. Smith seems to start off with a story, about an un-happy married couple who deceive each other as each being undercover agents, soon assigned to kill one another. Or rather, this is really a premise, a set-up for what should be a better story coming along. When first hearing this, it sounded amusing, a kind of riff on the 'True Lies' scenario for two other stars, Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. But while for that film James Cameron gave them a good story to work with, after about an hour into Mr. & Mrs. Smith, there was no story I could logistically follow, or at least have an interest in following. Although Jolie and Pitt look like they're having a good time throughout, they never seem like they're taking it farther than that. It is a thriller of the most 'popcorn' dimensions, but of actors who have brought much to other roles, I expected a little more. Also, throwing in Vince Vaughn as good measure to get laughs doesn't help matters either.It might be worth watching one night on cable, or even local TV, but I wouldn't recommend Mr. & Mrs. Smith to see in the theaters- it's a film that starts of with earnest to entertain, and descends into non-sense (and not the good, laughable kind). Not a total dud, but it is one of the disappointments for me of the 2005 summer movie season.",5,7,14,27 July 2005
The Departed," '...Do you lie?'
","The Departed is the most entertaining kind of non-stop, intense crime thriller of the year, maybe in the past few years. Some critics have said that it's the best film that director Martin Scorsese has made since Goodfellas. I understand where the compliment comes from, though I slightly resent the subtle criticism in the charge as well, meaning that Scorsese hasn't made a film as great or powerful or entertaining in over fifteen years. I would even go far as saying this is Scorsese's best since, well, Scorsese's last film, or at least since Gangs of New York. Some may forget, or maybe just not really take in, how consistently strong Scorsese's career has been overall, how he keeps on taking chances and still keeping his style so instictually 'cinematic' (he is possibly the biggest 'film-geek' ever), so distinctive, and even so fresh in the 21st century, that his is a career akin to the likes of Kurosawa (many masterpieces, and otherwise very good to excellent efforts). The difference though this time from some of his previous outings- and this is perhaps the correlation with Goodfellas besides the obvious of genre linking- is that it's pure, devilish fun, it goes by quickly but supremely satisfyingly over what doesn't really feel like 2 1/2 hours, and it's cast is uniformly good.Leonardo Di Caprio in particular is so impressive here- and this may be the first-viewing-buzz talking, it might be my favorite of all the performances I've seen him in up till now. Under Scorsese these past several years he's kind of grown up more and more from the oddly pubescent look to him even in his 20's. His performance as Costigan is often very ferocious and tough, but he also makes it a fully rounded character, one that he makes very much his own. He has a dark past, almost too dark to even be an informant for the Boston PD. His whole family is messed up, and there were even links to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). So, what better way then to send Costigan into Costello's wing and see what comes out? Then the flip-side comes with Matt Damon's Colin, who infiltrates the police department in legitimate fashion. Damon's is the flip-side as well in performance quality to Di Caprio; while Di Caprio, even when lying through his teeth, is truthful to the bone and always believable, Damon is pitch perfect as a bold-faced liar, as he never flinches for a moment, even when caught like a deer in the headlights.And the performances end up making a sort of square, with Damon and Di Caprio in their own corners, the bulk of the excellent supporting players (Martin Sheen, Marky-Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga in a breakthrough role) on one, and Jack Nicholson all on his own. That was the first thing about hearing of the Departed that had me psyched, knowing that one of the great stars/actors of the past 40 years was teaming up with someone with a stature and track record like Scorsese's. With Nicholson in the role Frank Costello is at first already a character to feel is the 'man' in the room when he walks in and talks. But as far as performance goes, it's vintage Nicholson all the way, digging into it with the style, vigor, wit, charm, and all that and a bag of shark-grin chips that have made Nicholson so remarkable. His is such a dastardly character that it teeters on becoming self-parody, but both director and actor know how to reel the part in to being someone to fear, while also being someone who's a helluva lot of fun. It's worthy of an Oscar nomination, and not just because it's Nicholson in a movie.As for the director and his crew, they have assembled what could be by the bare essentials nothing more than a genre film with a premise that seems a little cooked-up. But, of course, it is a remake of a trilogy of Hong-Kong police pictures, so that may be why the premise and story feels not completely original, even as it's passing itself off as one. Yet that too didn't detract. If anything, I felt as if Scorsese was doing what very few filmmakers working today- particularly this year if you look at what's come out- don't do, which is to take material, and not just do a simple 'remake', but to do a re imaging, a refashioning, a full-on reinterpretation into the deeper aspects, in this case the morality and sense of loss among all of these characters. There's some religious bits put in, as it IS Scorsese after all, but this time there isn't something like in Mean Streets where it's always there in the background. Here the characters are on, like in Goodfellas, a version of hell, where things all do come to a head; the last thirty minutes had me laughing, cringing, and mouth-agape in equal measures.In other words, go see this film, if you think it might be up your alley, and you think you were burned by Scorsese ever since he left behind modern-time crime pictures ten years ago.",10,8,19,6 October 2006
Die Hard," For god sakes, a reason to see action
","John McTiernan's Die Hard is one of the best action thrillers of todays age. Bruce Willis makes his true breakthrough performance here as the rough and tough Lieutenant John McClane who is visiting his wife out in L.A.  But while waiting for her a Nakatomi towers (40 stories), a group of German terrorists crash the Christmas party and terror ensues.  Willis stealthily runs around Nakatomi barefoot trying to get the bad guys.  A usual cops and bad guys story, but brought to a fever pitch with a excellent villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman is great as this lead man) and Willis as the hero for all heros.  Great action, great intensity make this one of the best action films of the decade.  A+",10,3,7,1 May 2000
Psycho," Shocking
","Psycho is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films ever made and is one of the few horror masterpieces in film history. That's the main-line, given stroke of it. But what it comes down to is that, really, seriously... it's Psycho - the one and only (that we acknowledge, screw off, Gus Van Sant). More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho, just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over, her boss, her boyfriend, etc, all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin, almost against her better judgment, when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog. Frankly, I've had dialogs going in my head like that, imagining the worst that could happen from a mistake or bad deed, and almost taking pleasure in the more morbid aspects (I mean, hey, I directed Jealous Jerzy, what does that tell you? But I digress).So keep that in mind when it comes time for the end of the movie - hell any portion really with Norman and 'Mother'. But mostly that last scene. After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated, clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just 'Mother'), Norman/Mother is in his/her room, and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense, plotting, paranoid, not wanting to swat a fly. Perhaps Hitchcock wants to draw the parallel, though there is a distinction: Marion imagines other people talking, while Norman isn't even in the equation: it IS Mother. Yeah.Such great stuff. And if you haven't seen it before... what are you reading this for ya dummy!",10,4,8,21 February 2000
American Made," Cruise the Gringo
","I don't know if Doug Liman only needs to make Tom Cruise movies from now one, but the reverse is probably true: Edge of Tomorrow and now American Made are the two stand-out Cruise movies since he last paired with Spielberg in 2005 (I mean to say that movies that aren't franchises not named Mission Impossible, those 4 and 5 sequels are a lot of fun, but not much beyond the surface entertainment). Barry Seale offers Cruise a thing that feels almost fresh for him in this day and age like... An arc to his chsrzcter (how about that! Development even if its in smaller doses) But it's also impressive how Seals is a genuinely nice and cool-but-not-completely cool films; if this was done 30 years ago, I could picture Burt Reynolds in this kind of character: the wholly charismatic, polite, sometimes befuddled but confident southern gent who is also a criminal bastard.Will it win awards? Eh no, but it doesn't need to be that either. Maybe its from coming off of the worst Cruise movie in recent memory, The Mummy, but that's not it, or just it. Liman finds an extremely loose shooting style, maybe *too* loose, where his camera is off kilter at many times, but at the same time it isn't incoherent in the mis en scene of it. It has a purpose; we are in the period of late 70s and early 80s chaos but its a chaos that is... Well, sort of half sanctioned by the united states government. We shouldn't be able to believe the story Seale leaves for us - in a typical but fine fashion that does work into the final act of the film in a clever way, or clever-er than usual as far as what Seale is needing to do - but we do, and there's an underlying satire to it all that cant help but make it feel less like another Blow or Infiltrator (though some carry over of DNA is here from that) than a more Southern-baked, less hedonistic Wolf of Wall Street. In other words, it's often wildly funny and twisted, but it is about something very real at the core: American imperialism and exceptionalism.It tickles me to think of all those people in the American heartland who love Tom Cruise coming to what they think is another fun mindless thriller, and it indicts a hero to many in America, Ronald Reagan, who they either forget or choose to ignore was involved directly snd indirectly in a lot of criminal s***. Its almost like you cant help but like or even love Seale and by extention Cruise: hes not fully a drug trafficker and hes not personally training the Contras. He's the guy that gets your stuff from point A to B. Thank goodness Cruise took this movie on!",8,5,10,8 October 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Blockbuster Vomit of a sickening variety
","Think about this: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen cost hundreds of millions to produce, making back its money and then some. In box-office terms it's the success of the year, reaching 400 million domestically and cracking the top ten highest grossing movies ever. It would appear shallow to consider numbers, but I doubt that Michael Bay or the producers or studio chiefs would mind. At the end of the day, whatever the f*** is up on the screen is probably moot compared to the vast amounts of the almighty dollar made at the expense of a product that can be whatever it wants to be. In this case, what it is is a fiasco of incredible proportions. There's barely a moment I cared about what was going on, who was who, what was fighting what, where the sun (yes, the sun) fit into all of the ballyhoo going on, and frankly, I'm not sure if Bay did entirely either. It's what the 'worst-movie-of-the-decade' title is all about.Oh, I'm sure Bay thought he was making a good movie, probably a HELLA-GOOD movie by the look of things, as he always does. He has a frenetic eye that has, for better or worse, given him the clout to go wherever and do whatever he wants in his films. But for Revenge of the Fallen he goes further with the stakes of incoherent storytelling/film-making and wasted characters and (some) wasted potential. It's hard, or just not really necessary, to talk about the plot of the film, except that a piece of the Aulspark (sic) is at stake in bringing an enemy force of Decepticons to fight Autobots and the Fallen, a real baddie alien-robot, is out to destroy the world and maybe use the sun for something. How did I come to this conclusion after watching the movie? I looked it up online. That's how bad it is to figure out.But what wasted potential, you might ask? Well, doesn't giant robot battles fused with a plot to use the sun to destroy everything sound like a kick-ass escapist flick? Oh boy, not in Michael Bay's hands it is not. And let's not forget it's not all on him either - the writers, who just this past summer also scribed the new Star Trek picture (perhaps a sign of how crucial a director is in the process of film-making on a massive scale), throw cliché-feces at the audience in a mind-numbing two and a half hours. It's actually an endurance test just to pick out all of the crappy things about the movie, and it all build up, sometimes at astronomical rates. And it's not just Skids and Mudflap being *stoopid* (not racist caricatures so much as part of the cultural f***-all psychology omnipresent), and not just the rampant ludicrous spirit that has no soul or inspiration to it (save, perhaps, for Rainn Wilson as a professor).No, it's just... EVERYTHING! This is a movie where, despite all of the hard work put in by the crew and all of the hours put in and high-flying action scenes choreographed, its makers seem to have something against its own audience. Everything is amped to 11 - bad sex jokes, bad drug jokes, horrible 'inspirational' dialog scenes, and awful 'new' ideas such as Robot Heaven and robot balls - and all put to Bay's trademark camera-work and editing style, propelling a viewer into scenes that have no proper flow or reasoning, and action that cuts away too fast to get engaged or for us to have reason to invest ourselves in the characters fighting.Even simple things like TIME and PLACE are shot to hell. Take for example two transitions, where our daring-do heroes (i.e. LaBeouf, Fox, Tuturro, Skids/Mudflap, etc) come upon the Smithsonian museum to find some old first-gen Decepticon that's really a jet. They find it and a scene (sort of) happens, then they walk outside and it's... not Washington DC, or is it, since there's a long field and planes. Then, a teleportation happens sending all of the characters to Egypt. Fine, one supposes, until one realizes this is in present time, and day is still day halfway across the world! It would seem one would try to think things through as simple as the logical geography of where the characters are, or the logic of how fast they might travel (Mikaela going from LA to New York in ten seconds, not just movie time), or about what sense there is in the who's who in the robot battles. But there's very little thought put into logic, because Bay has little interest. One almost has to admire how dumb, loud, annoying, idiotic and poorly (or barely present) acted is all turns out to be, like a burrito in a blender spun to a speed of super-volcano-nausea of all of the clichés and formulas of action spectacles that Bay can think of or just pull out of his ass. One may have a few laughs at some of the things in the film, but if it it is never intentional or pleasant... that is, depending on the viewer. One also has to remember how BIG an audience the film had, and how it did, if only in theory, obtain repeat business. It may also sell quite well on DVD.But there is a fact that should be acknowledged: no matter who wins in Transformers, we lose, even if people don't realize or want to fess up. The first film was, as I recall thinking, not a horror-show but just a soulless marketing grab-bag for the line of toys. This time is different. Bay goes past the likes of Armageddon and Bad Boys II. He's entered a league of his own in the I-don't-give-a-crap strata of cinema auteurs. It's a mind-boggling vad of cine-vomit you can take or leave. I'd be surprised to meet the one who takes-takes-takes. For realz.",1,13,58,24 October 2009
The Witch," gets under your skin and haunts you
","Sometimes you can't believe what you're seeing in a cineplex that will more than likely only show the latest from the major studios. A film like The Witch or most other films from the studio A24 - mostly (if not all) done independently and then picked up for distribution - such as Under the Skin or Springbreakers, would normally be relegated to some art-house theater where not many people could see it. But unlike some distributors who think in only day-and-date theatrical/VOD (or just VOD only), A24 puts something like The Witch as basically a mainstream release (needless to say I saw the trailer for months, many times, in front of big horror and other releases). But I love that a film that goes for being all about simply scaring you by its brooding imagery, period dialog and actors who you won't know unless you have every cast member of Game of Thrones memorized (hint, it's the parents), gets to be seen by so many people. It's not about silly jump scares or characters who are idiots... well, not in the sense of the usual teenagers, but let's get to what I mean.This is all about witchcraft, but it's also not the simple 'riding around on broomsticks' shenanigans or anything that comes close to being jokey. Filmmaker Robert Eggers (which is all the more astonishing as it's the director's *debut*) suffuses his actors and crew into a setting that is unmistakably 17th century New England, and it's from here everything else can be conjured up. His story follows a family of Puritans from England who are cast out from their community (we don't know why, no real need to, except that the father and mother are, to say the least, very religious, even for the Puritans!) They set up a farm and are preparing for a long season until they can grow their crops. They have a bunch of kids, an teenage daughter, an adolescent boy, two twins and a baby. Right at the start the baby is taken by... who? What? Sometimes having some ambiguity can work in a film's favor to make the horror from the story and place even more potent. There's not too much ambiguity with The Witch (unless someone wants to warp around things to their liking, or found something I don't know), and it's clear: there is some real heavy-duty black magic going on in the nearby woods, and whether the spirits (in human and animal form) come to the family because they're religious or just because they're evil beings that like to slather themselves with blood is a little more open to interpretation. And in less confident hands it could have become schlocky or unconvincing, set in a period so that either monotonous imagery could unfold (it could have easily been a too-hard-to-take pace wise effort) or all about the special gore effects.Eggers finds the sweet middle ground, and creates a portrait of a family undone by their own religious fervor, while also being true to what were, at the time, historical accounts of witchcraft. Whether those carried much creedence, Eggers doesn't care - he commits to showing these woods and showing something like a goat or even an apple as something deathly serious, and yet loaded with significance. He doesn't move the camera around like crazy, and of course he doesn't need or should have to: the production design is among the greatest in any horror film, not to mention the certain color palette that he and DP Blaschke give to every shot so that it's like the world is drained of color - grays are even grayer, browns dirtier, and blacks somehow much blacker. It's a serious, darkly directed film, but there's always an intensity about it that doesn't make it ponderous to a point that takes one out of the movie.A large part to why the film is so effective and chilling is the acting. The main adults (Ineson and Dickie, rarely below a 10 emotionally speaking, though Dickie has the trickier role as the one who has to try, up to a point, to keep his wits about him) are very strong here, both playing variations on God-petrified mortals, but the movie for me really belongs to Anya Taylor-Joy (her first major movie role, expect to see her in many things to come) and Scrimshaw as Caleb.For the former, she has to carry many scenes all based on why she is a trustworthy person, and she sells it, while for the latter, this boy, it's a role that needs someone to play the period dialog (which is only occasionally obfuscated by the accents) and having to be genuinely scared to death when faced with the evils in the woods. When you have characters who are both 'simple' folk of the Lord while also being capable of being twisted by the same dark forces they can't escape, you need people to sell it. They all do, to lengths not unlike out of Polanski at his fiercest.So combine a filmmaker who wants to make Dread with a capital D his priority, a setting and location and things like just a barn or a door that feel eerie and ominous, and actors who dig in to characters who could very well destroy one another due to their fears (except for Thomasin), and you got a unique genre piece that works just as well as drama as horror, if not better.",10,7,18,19 February 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Two of the shots in this film were equally disturbing and uproarious- the film stands as one of Polanski's crowning thrillers
","Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby was adapted by Polish director Roman Polanski, who in his American directing debut, created a horror film that contained no gore, practically no blood, no characters with knives and other weapons. Just the feeling of constant dredd and confusion over the fate of a woman's child.  Mia Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse, wife of a struggling actor, who finds a new apartment in New York called the Dakota.  Here, they meet some neighbors (one of which is the impecable, Oscar winning Ruth Gordon) who befriend them, invite themselves over whenever, and even bring food as gifts.  Rosemary and her husband, played by director John Cassavettes, think about having a baby, but aren't sure if the time is right.  Then one night, after having a drink that the 'friendly' neighbor brings over, they make love to concieve, though that may or may not be how Rosemary sees it 'this is not a dream, this is really happening!'  From then on, the film develops as Rosemary gets pregnant, is recommended a doctor (Ralph Bellamy) who may or may not be giving her the right medical advise, and as she enters her thirs trimester, she starts to realize something is fishy about her neighbors, and her un-born child.Like Polanski's 1965 film Repulsion, the viewer gets a feeling of something that one could feel in such horror films as Texas Chainsaw Massacre or, more appropriately, the Blair Witch Project- we feel scared or in a state os suspense not because of what we see, but of what we don't see and can't figure out.  Those who want to compare this to The first Exorcist need to know that this is the European perspective of a Satan story, and that this builds more brilliantly on claustrophobia while the other builds on the un-expected with style.  Overall, Rosemary's Baby is a remarkable achievement in the genre, and in the very last moment in the end, the sense of acceptance Rosemary achieves is possibly the most scariest thing about it.As I mentioned in the one line summary, there are two shots that to me represent the kind of startling and, bizarrely, even funny double edged sword Polanski can pull in films like this (see also John Huston in Chinatown):  the one shot of the 'devil' on top of Rosemary will make some drop their mouths open in shock, as did I, but I was sort of laughing at it too, in the manner of how she's so calm in the scene.  Another is in the climax, when the witches are gazing proudly at their master's new bouncing baby boy, and out of nowhere there's a little Chinese guy with a camera taking pictures.  I'm not sure if this is a detail Polanski took from the book, or if he threw it in himself, but it's rather amazing that this person appears in a group of Satan galvanizers.

Jersey Boys," fun if conventional bio-pic
","Jersey Boys isn't quite as 'not that impressive' as the critics said (I don't want to say 'bad'). Still, this tale of how Frankie Valli (not his real name) and Tommy De Vito formed the Four Seasons is still fairly clichéd, especially the character of De Vito as a total one dimensional Sopranos bit player (no relation to the Goodfellas character, though more interestingly Joe Pesci IS a character in the movie as a supporting role). And yet there is nothing wrong with the actor, Vincent Piazza (also seen on Boardwalk Empire) and on the contrary gives it his all and commits to the character, as is everyone else in their respective roles.Actually Valli (and John Lloyd Young's mostly restrained for a musical bio-pic performance, with enough to really carry the movie for long stretches) is a fairly complex character. I keep saying character as its a movie person after all. But Frankie ultimately has to juggle a lot of allegiances and responsibility and problems (with himself as well) and heartache. It's a good biopic-musical with standard direction from Clint. I don't know what he did for the movie to make it stand out from another director except that he has a consistent knack for setting up the camera and getting out of the way... which at times makes it a little too conventionally shot, but it's fine, I was never bored and the songs and performers keep things enjoyable.I can't compare it to the musical but another comment is that the actors all have a generally theatrical quality (aside from Walken, who is a very welcome presence here and actually pulls off an interesting mob character not just a walk on, I think they're from the actual musical), which has its ups and downs. Also must be noted while the fourth-wall-talking is nothing new it works, maybe in part as it comes from a script by Annie Hall writer Marshall Brickman. Guess if you're going to do that again, get the guy who is one of the best at fourth-wall-smart-talk.Again, not great, but not any boring disaster as I maybe slightly expected, and its old fashioned quality (take out the cursing and it could have fit in the 1950s) is fine too... I keep using the word 'fine'. maybe that's all Eastwood aims to be, but I can't help but see him sneaking in some artistic flourishes (there's one shot that ascends an exterior building of a record company and we hear and see all sorts of music going on floor to floor, and its a great 'moment out of time').",7,1,4,1 August 2014
Steve Jobs," 'It's warm and inviting and it needs to say HELLO!'
","The above line, which is the character Steve Jobs' (Fassbender) explanation for why the Macintosh computer at the unveiling in 1984, is his reasoning, and it's the first time we see him in the movie and his super-demanding-behind-the-scenes self. He has to have the computer say 'Hello' to the audience that will assemble and see his prized innovation (which he didn't all innovate by the way, but neither here nor there, at least to Jobs), and it has to break down how people have been shown computer systems in Hollywood movies. His marketing manager cum surrogate mother, Joanna Hoffman (Winslet) remarks, 'The computer in 2001 said hello, too. It scared the s*** out of me.' There's another moment, a key one in a big, meaty exchange (what else does Sorkin love doing more) between Jobs and Wozniak in the auditorium in front of everybody, where Wozniak mentions that his products are better than the man who made them. Jobs agrees. Who is this a-hole? Our hero? Sort of, I guess.Aaron Sorkin once again gives us a guy who is a super-driven, I'll-do-it-MY-way-if-I-have-to self-professed genius, and perhaps it's hard to not think of Sorkin's script for The Social Network with his version of Mark Zuckerberg (whether he really is or not I leave up to you dear reader). I could make a very long blog post showing the differences, but I think it comes down to something more elemental: Social Network is about friendship, or what would-be friendship is and as it breaks down (or wasn't there to start), and Steve Jobs is about marriages. Jobs's marriage to Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marriage to Steve Wozniak, Jobs' marriage to Sculley, and even his sort of marriage to Any Herzfeld. But what about the woman who birthed his daughter ('She's not my daughter', one of the major conflicts of the film), or being a father to his daughter? And like marriages - till death do us part sort of thing - the same arguments and same old BS gets pulled up over and over again, even as technology changes and people age and move on to other companies.So we get three time frames here, which is clever until it becomes a little contrived. That sounds contradictory, but what I mean to say is that on the one hand, Sorkin and director Danny Boyle get to show something that a lot of biopics don't bother with when they go for the 'rise and fall' scenario - Jobs starts out at a point that is remarkable in 1984, about to launch the Macintosh computer, but with people all around him trying to get him to be... decent, to do the right things, to not keep doing s***y things (the Time magazine article, the Dylan lyrics signifying something, the mention for the Apple 2 people, the threat to Andy on the voice), and we see Steve interacting with everybody in the format that is what it is, a Backstage Melodrama. And yet we see the same arguments basically take place in 1988 and 1998. It IS the 'hard' parts of business/creative/personal 'marriages'. In short, this may or may not sound appealing.I feel like I may need to see the movie again for certain little things; I'm still not fully sold that the ending (or at least the final five/ten minutes, his resolution with Sculley and Lisa) don't dip more than a bit into making this character sympathetic - and I don't mean that as a bad thing, but that it feels shallow in a certain way, as in 'we've spent all this time telling you this guy's a d***, many times over, but... maybe he's deep down a really good guy.' On the other hand, it may not be that clear, and as I think on the movie there's ambiguity to certain moments and scenes, and that's what sticks with me and makes me interested to see it again.There's one little scene, where Jobs is talking to himself, softly, and repeating technical details on the iMac. Is he talking to himself to rehearse the lines - the actor as well as the 'player of the Orchestra' as he puts it to Wozniak as what he *does*, which is still slightly vague by film's end aside from the aesthetic side - or is he genuinely concerned to get the tech stuff right, a nerd underneath the sleek exterior? Sorkin, I should mention again, loves gigantic, monumental confrontation scenes the way Ninja Turtles loves pizza; there are more than a few in this film, and a couple of them (Jobs and Sculley in 1988, Jobs and Wozniak in 1998) are the kind that become borderline too much to watch - the cutting back and forth in time is what makes it jarring in a good way, making the psychology and points of view distinct and interesting - but it's almost like Sorkin can't help himself, no restraint in the slightest. Nevertheless, Boyle and the producers got such a top shelf cast that even if this stuff was theatrical-grandstanding I'd be riveted. Fassbender, Winslet, Daniels, Waterston, and for sure Rogen (he's proved himself dramatically before, in Take This Waltz, and here he does it again) all pull off performances that make these words come alive and, really, human all around.What I mean by that last thing is that, it's one thing to read Sorkin's words - he writes what he does, and you'll know it by know from Social Network or his TV shows - but what Fassbender does here is incredible. If there's sympathy that Jobs gets, it's not so much in the writing as it is through just him, finding that pulse beneath the cold 'genius'. And Winslet's Joanna as the 'conscience' is spectacular, and often because she's just the one trying to keep things moving/together. Jobs needs that - how else will he give any kind of 'face' ala the computer screen?",8,7,16,27 October 2015
Crazy Heart," a subtle and moving performance in an otherwise decent little movie
","People have already started the comparison, and not without some reason, of Crazy Heart with last year's film about a down-on-his-luck old timer in his chosen profession, The Wrestler. And sure the comparisons can be made quite a lot, not simply due to the same studio, Fox Searchlight, distributing the films, or that the main characters are practically washed-up in what they do but keep chugging along, or that they have medical problems, or that they're estranged from their kids, or that the woman in their lives is a stop-go-stop affair. The good news is the movies can stand on their own terms, but somehow, at the end of the day, I would probably prefer Aronofsky's gritty naturalism over the first time director Scott Cooper's more slick indie-treatment, with country and wide-open spaces substituting for grisly New Jersey.And yet you should go see Crazy Heart, and it's not just for Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, a country musician, 57, who has been on hard times for a while and whose main problem, alcoholism, prevents him from being an unstoppable musical force (think Johnny Cash with a little extra blues) and kind boyfriend to Jean (Gyllenhaal, also quite good). Well, it could almost be all for him - it's marvelous to see him transform into this character, somewhat reminiscent of 'the Dude', but with a more cynical view of life and his former partner (Tommy, surprisingly done by Colin Farrell), and how we really do want him to get better. It's a sympathetic portrait done by a master of American film acting, and even if you don't particularly love Country music it's a worthwhile venture to see him in it.That's the other thing: the music is actually (and this is coming from a not-big-fan of Country music save for some exceptions like Cash and Williams) quite superb. All of the songs are charged either by a real drive to bring the house down with the joy of playing live, or by the tender moments such as the 'Weary Kind' title track, which may, along with Bridges, get T-Bone Burnett his first Oscar nod. The music is one of the things that makes Blake's journey wonderful to watch, even if, sadly, the story is lacking in ways that other movies (not just The Wrestler) do much better. Only a third act twist seems to be compelling, as the rest of the story kind of coasts the characters along, the only roadblock Blake's drinking.As sometimes happens, it's a towering performance in the midst of an otherwise competent, enjoyable but slight debut feature. But it is something, and often interesting.",7,38,52,31 December 2009
War of the Worlds," think of Spielberg's adaptation of War of the Worlds as his darker relative of Close Encounters
","Upon a first viewing of Steven Spielberg's latest big-action/suspense summer blockbuster War of the Worlds, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is what I love about going to see science-fiction thrillers. In the vein of Spielberg's best thrillers (Jurassic Park, Jaws, even Duel in some circles) not only is the story not predictable like the other dumbed down, less satisfying actioneers, but one can sense who is the real star of the film. Despite the fact that the director has a mega-star (as nutty as he may be off camera at times, Tom Cruise is dependable in good hands, better in great ones), and some supporting players who stand-out (Tim Robbins and especially Dakota Fanning), Spielberg's total control over his medium is without a missed mark. For better or sometimes worse, when one sees a film directed by him, it's not going to be standard stuff on the screen. Like Hitchcock or Kubrick or Scorsese, there's a personality coming through the storytelling, acting more often than not as a manipulator, but not in a way that cheats too much like in films that become forgotten.Examples of Spielberg's mastery of set-pieces of destruction and of stylized horror film-making can be found in, admittedly, greater Spielberg films (Jaws comes to mind, but also Jurassic Park and Minority Report too), but he's not just playing old tricks here, but still making his mis-en-scene and build-ups/pay-offs work well, very well. A prominent example to give from War of the Worlds isn't one involving the hundreds of extras on the run from the aliens, but one in an enclosed space. In one scene, which I won't reveal the circumstances to how it comes to this, Cruise, Robbins, and Fanning's characters are in a basement, and a sinister presence is surrounding them, searching, at every corner following their beats. This is the kind of scene that might be in a slightly different permutation in some of those films I mentioned before, but it doesn't lose any of its impact. The harder work- getting to care about the characters- is placed in so strongly that its hard for the scene not to work. That the pay-off in this scene, and several others, don't flounder is not just a credit to him, but to his team (i.e. editor Michael Kahn, the great cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and of course John Williams).Truth be told, some elements of the film are almost too good or too expectable at times (such as a rather Spielbergian ending, though this may be similar to the H.G. Wells novel, un-read by me), and it is aside from Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan the most violent and riveting action-wise (as un-real as it is, somehow believable at the same time) and probably will act as more of an adrenaline rush to the younger ones. But for one who has grown up on Spielberg's films, who understood really what a director does from first watching his films, this is another fine touch to the lot. Even if you're not much of a Cruise fan it's entertaining- in fact, at the core, that's what the film wants to do with its continuous sense of urgency, to entertain the hell out of anyone, young, old, any race or creed....Having said this though, just know, it might be slightly less effective on repeat viewings, as I've come to see. 8/10",7,6,25,29 June 2005
Mudbound," A rural drama that packs a punch but takes a while to get there
","With Mudbound, a tale of two families in good(terrible) ol' Mississippi in the 1940s and the daily struggles for the men and women getting by in the most rural elements imaginable, I wanted to like it more, even love it. The period feel and authenticity Rees and her team have makes an impression and it's all surely lived in to where you feel the pain and literal dirt for white and blacks (so, in other words, a brief mention of 'A Tale of Two Cities' has textual resonance).  But the first half is rough going with way overdone narration, with too much that gives more information and dictating character beats than near necessary, robbing moments of poetry and grace. It almost gives the impression of a tougher/rougher shot yet far less eloquent version of The Southerner by Renoir. Not bad but not... Cinematic enough. It feels too literal a translation of a book (and it is an adaptation of one, unread by me). Yet, once Hedlund and Mitchell, who don't get too developed before they go off to war and only get some in the scenes when they're in battle (all done in brutal and brief bites), come home from the war, the drama all around gets intensified. The narration gives way to emotional scenes between characters - or just conversations showing an understanding that wouldn't have happened if not ironically for the horrors of war- and all the acting by everyone goes to 100 (Jonathan Banks shows a much... 'Poppy' kind of side to his talents). It may be more of a history lesson than anything else, but the intimacy Rees has with her performers gets the material to its peak too. If you aren't sure of where it's going, or want Rees to stick to the farm scenes and not cut back to the war, just wait and the patience will pay off.",7,1,4,26 December 2017
Love Actually," A trusty cast and some good jokes make it an OK holiday time-filler...
","Richard Curtis, from my perspective, deserves both panning and praise for his first film as a writer/director, Love Actually- it's loaded to the brim with nearly every kind of relationship/romance/infidelity convention you can think of, wedged into eight different couples intertwined together in merry old England.  However, having said that, I can't say I didn't have a bad time during Love Actually, and I didn't feel compelled to walk out or leave to go to the bathroom for a long stretch of time either.  What works about the movie are two things- the characters Curtis sets up and unfolds, to one degree or another in this definitely movie-movie universe, are believable, and surprisingly there is some interestingly dramatic elements thrown in here and there (particularly with Laura Linney, Liam Neeson- early on, and Emma Thompson).  The other thing is the cast, which includes the known likes of Linney, Neeson, Thompson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and some charming work thrown in by lessor known actors like Kiera Knightly (who got a break during the summer with Curse of the Black Pearl), Martine McCutcheon, Lucia Moniz, Rodrigo Santoro, Thomas Sangster as the boy in love, and nice little cameos for Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton, Shannon Elizabeth, etc.  The drawback to some of the performances and stories is that since the story jumps from one place to another, and since we can predict more or less where each character's destiny lies on Christmas Eve, there is maybe a little too much emphasis on the paths instead of a little more depth (outside of the dramatic input of course).  Plus, you can tell the film was not the kind of film released first in America and sold later to Europe.  Yet, like I said, the flaws may be moot to most movie-goers, because Curtis is just out to get the audience into having a good, escapist experience with these people, and the main and supporting players do what they can.  Also, as some other reviewers and commentators have noted, the show stopper is indeed Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, the aging, cynical rock star recording and selling a Christmas single on TV and Radio as the sort of background in the film. Along with being the funniest character of the lot, he ends up garnering some heartedness too by the climax.  I wouldn't bother seeing it again for a while, but I was glad I saw it in a packed audience-type of atmosphere. Grade: (strong) B",8,4,8,22 November 2003
12 Years a Slave," looking long and hard at slavery
","The power of the adaptation of Solomon Northrup's memoir, directed by Steve McQueen and written by John Ridley, is time. Not just the time Northrup spent, or the time that slaves were already there for generations by this point of the 1840's, and that it was an institution completely set in its place, but in cinema. Case in point is when Solomon - aka 'Platt' by the slave-trader who put him away - is strung up following a fight with one of the 'masters' played by Paul Dano, and he would be hung but there's a problem with doing that without the main master on hand. So, Solomon is just left to hang. For hours. And McQueen fixes his camera on him hung up with a little dirt under his feet to keep him up... and people behind him, slaves, children, go on about their concerns and things. Only one dares come up to him, but only to give a quick drink of water.12 Years a Slave explores not only the wholly immorality and evil of slavery, but its pervasiveness in modern culture. It features some of the greatest cinematic metaphors, without any overbearance. Or, maybe, it IS over-bearing, like 'LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON!' and no one doing anything. In a sense Solomon up on the noose is a metaphor for racism in general, that it's such a common occurrence that people get used to it. The institution of enslavement and imprisonment is not too dissimilar here to that shown in The Shawshank Redemption - also about a man put falsely in bondage. The difference this time is that it's not for any wrongfully accused crime. Simply put, if Solomon wasn't black, this wouldn't have happened to him. Or to anyone.Of course this story of a man being taken away from freedom and a family and an artistically nourishing life is inherently compelling n(he works as a fiddler, and music is made as a great point of reference in the film as far as being free or not in doing it). And it works for an audience as well; people can put themselves in those shoes, what if that happened to me? If this was from the perspective of, say, the character Patsy (Oscar winner Lupita Nyongo) then it would be too much for any audience outside of the those who could take relentless punishment. There may be some who watch the movie as it is and find it to be too much. Indeed the first time Solomon gets whipped is almost there, and is so harsh, to get the audience primed for what's to come. 'This ain't no joke,' is missing in subtitles on the bottom of the screen.This might make the movie sound too hammer-on-the-head about its message, but McQueen is a filmmaker in love with classical style. He doesn't cut too much, and every shot and length has its purpose. When he keeps a shot going for a while, like when the whipping of a particular character goes on for a while and to such a manic extent (including a pan to see the results) and it goes on for minutes, it's really about putting us there and the morality of it. If you cut, you lose the tension, you lose the realistic nature of what's going on in the drama. Adding to that the performers - and damn if Ejiofor, Fassbender, Nyongo and everyone else puts in their all, even in roles of limited screen time - are in those long takes and have to play all the emotions of these people, which are on land that once had slave plantations at that.It's nothing short of harrowing, and by the end (spoiler, not really since, again, Northrup wrote a best-selling book about his time in bondage) real tears can be shed when he reunites with his family because there's no false sentiment. This guy went through hell. And we're put there for the catharsis, and for how it relates to today. What do we do if we look away from racism and aggression and horrors across the world? Up on the noose it's about that situation, but it could be anyone at any time. That's the power of the art on display here.",10,0,5,6 November 2014
30 Days of Night," can a vampire flick be occasionally interesting, usually OK, and sometimes really illogical? 30 Days of Night is all that
","30 Days of Night might be a lot better in the form of a comic-book (never read it, heard many great things), but as a film it's derivative and original, really stupid (mostly towards the end) and with some solid thrills in both the classic and neo-forms. David Slade and his crew do an excellent job at creating a little Alaskan community surrounded by the ominous cold and snow, no argument there. It is something to see the baron streets like out of some ghost town in a western painted with splatter spots of blood, and then the shadows of these pesky vampires coming around the bend to catch their victims. And sometimes he and his director of photography get creative in a good way: I liked the over-head shot that looms above a scene of carnage, probably as something closest to the style of a comic book of this variety. It's also cool to see how Slade tries to emphasize the importance of the background, how even if it's all out of focus what you need to look out for what you don't expect to see, which will pounce and tear you to ribbons. This side is worth looking for in 30 Days of Night.But there are problems. I can see how there is already a surge of 'fan-boys' for this movie, as it appeals to a chilling aesthetic if one hasn't seen many vampire movies before. I can also see how people hated it even more than me- it is trashy in the sense that it doesn't stop to make any logic out of how the vampires even get to the location by some wandering madman (Ben Foster, should be the performance to garner him an Oscar- for overracting that is- following his actual terrifying part in 3:10 to Yuma) across miles and miles of endless terrain from some foreign land. But in its own way it's a decent B-movie, loaded with some better budgeted effects and production design, as it lowers its sights into being a survival tale without too much pretense. This being said, it's hard not to look at how Slade and company make the vampires, how they move and attack and eat like they're the infected in the 28 Days Later movies, but at the same time still sort of generic when it comes time for their close-ups and one-on-one time, including having a leader of sorts, going back to the Blade series. And while it might be a little harder to make the connection, I can't look at bloody snow dogs in the snowy wilderness without thinking of the Thing- particularly the scene where they're most prominent.At the least, it stays conventionally pleasant, or gruesome, as it needs to be- it's predictable to a fault, but until the last five to ten minutes comfortably so: we got the hero (Hartnett, who is OK in the role, but is better as a garnish ala Sin City), the tough girl, the big guy who has all the chops to take the buggers on, the young sprout teen who wants to prove himself, the naiive old folk, and Foster as the crazy guy...But then that ending, which makes any logical flaws beforehand look irrelevant in comparison. Hartnett, in an attempt to stop the vampires from getting the lead female, who's hiding under a car, amid a huge blaze set all across town the vampires set up, injects himself with a deceased vampire's blood, becomes one in part, and then goes out to fight the main bad-ass vampire leader. There's sections I could go on and on about this, from the factor of the fire to the other vampires just standing around not doing anything while there's a big meant-to-be-romantic fight to the un-death, to why they all left the convinience store in the first place. But it all comes off as unbelievable, even for a horror movie, and I couldn't help but laughing out loud as suddenly Hartnett comes back to win the day through a ridiculously gruesome manner. It's one of the worst endings I've seen in a movie this year, and almost left me with a worse taste in my mouth from what was previously an alright entry in the Sam Raimi-produced horror-for-kids of the moment.",6,7,14,20 October 2007
Sausage Party," a full course meal of a very dangerous comedy!
","Some of you may be too young to remember (or maybe too old, who knows), but once upon a time a man named Ralph Bakshi made hard-R rated animation that was decidedly not meant for simply for families to gobble up, so at the same time Disney put out something like Robin Hood, he had Heavy Traffic, which was an semi-autobiographical, 'X-rated' look at life in Brooklyn with all the rough edges showing, or in 1975 (his masterpiece to me) Coonskin, which took off from Song of the South to make a scathing satire on race using black caricatures, blaxploitation and other characters like a naked woman with red-white-and-blue body paint. But of course times have changed and now animation is practically never even made much less released at a wide scale (when was the last time, South Park, maybe, or by extension Team America). So, with this in mind, and ironic to say given the subject matter, but thank God for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for Sausage Party.Is it a perfect movie? No, but who the f*** cares? This is one of the smarter films of the summer, if not the year, and surprising in that it delivers one thing in its marketing - a parody of all of these talking-whatever movies (you know from Pixar, 'when the lights go out X is actually alive and talking, and there's an adventure story where one or two characters get separated and have to find their way back etc etc') and with the kind of 'explicit' language that Rogen-Goldeberg and company have put out there since Superbad nine years ago. However if you see the movie it delivers something deeper, subverting expectations that come with something that looks so goofy (the film's directors have credits ranging from Monsters vs Aliens, with Rogen did a voice for by the way, and Thomas the Tank Engine videos!) but is about... religion and the power and susceptibility of beings towards faith.That may sound like blowing hot air like, how can this be anything more than its surface-level crude comedy and stereotypes? But right from the on-set, where the characters refer to the 'Gods' and the opening song (the only main one so it's not a musical) where it's all about praising the Gods and the 'Great Beyond' which is, of course, the Great Lie of being chosen by humans to be taken away as what they're meant for, the writers of the film take an opportunity and don't settle only for the gross-out... this is not to say this is not a filthy, raucous, ludicrous film that includes such things as, well, bath salts that make people hallucinate to the point where they can SEE THE FOOD TALKING (is that what they do, I wouldn't know, haven't tried it, sorry), and stereotypes of every thing you can think of from Irish potatoes to a Jewish bagel and a Muslim falafel and a Mexican (Lesbian!) taco to a Firewater Native American alcohol can (and Craig Robinson... well, see the movie to know about that). Because, yes, they're here in spades! What makes Sausage Party impactful is that it takes a leap to be *about* something, even if it ends up being rather gruesome and very, horrifically, violent (yes, for an R-rated movie this is one of the more violent pieces of escapism - perhaps in its way more honest than something like a PG-13 Suicide Squad despite/because of things like decapitated heads or exploding organs and so on). It even has a point about what it means to be an inspiration to people, that to change minds you can't simply show the 'truth' right away and that different factions can't process that information. If that sounds odd, well, this climax is especially odd and totally insane. But it's also a brilliant conclusion to a very good movie, full of balls-to-the-wall action and a don't-take-no-prisoners attitude towards the food vs the humans. It reaches Inglourious Basterds level catharsis.Again, it's not totally up there with This is the End or Pineapple Express, the landmarks for this duo and their collaborators. On a first watch the Jew/Arab duo were a little one-note as a joke (so are a lot of the characters, which are fine, but these are here for longer period), and it also didn't make sense completely what could or couldn't talk (i.e. why the food AND things like a d**che or toilet paper or so on, what about the shopping cart or a television, where's the line drawn?) But these are relatively minor complaints in a movie that gets by by being so harrowingly hysterical in how it delivers its comedy - these guys have the opposite of fear, which is what you need for comedy. They have confidence in their vulgarity, so who cares if it has like 400 f***s? It has zero of them to give! Add on impressive voice-work (Edward Norton as the bagel! And James Franco gives one of his best performances in a while as 'Druggie') and you got yourself a winner, and a fine successor to people who used animation as a mechanism for delivering hardcore, drag-through-the-mud satire like Bakshi or Mike Judge.",8,21,46,12 August 2016
Wedding Crashers," satisfactory romantic comedy, brings its laughs, and its predictability in tow
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, the stars bringing this vehicle to theaters (there are other notables in the case, but not with the kind of draw of these two), are very talented, and usually pretty amusing. Wilson, for my money, is the subtler of the two, and is more of the leading man, while Vaughn is usually over-the-top in his double-talk, and garners some laughs even when some fall flat. They take the film Wedding Crashers and make it watchable, along with some supporting actors playing strange characters. It's not as wild as one might expect from the trailers, and as a 'date' movie it's rather predictable.The opening twenty minutes is close to genius, by introducing the audience into this care-free, inspired montage of Wilson and Vaughn crashing the weddings, enjoying the celebrations, and going to bed with many women. It's not laugh out loud funny, but it garners a few small laughs, and it a very good set-up for what seems to be a film in this vein. It's not quite the case- we get a story that sort of goes on auto-pilot (to put it another way, I've seen a story like this many times over in mainstream romantic comedies) wherein Vaughn gets dragged into staying for a day with the daughter (Isla Fisher, perhaps the best overall funny performance) of the Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken, of all people), and Wilson goes along as he tries to woo another daughter (Rachel McAdams, a beauty no doubt) who is already in a relationship with a alpha-male guy (Bradley Cooper). This is when formula takes over.While the laughs are there, including a crazy dinner scene (it's like a 30's screwball comedy crossed with American Pie for this scene, one of the funniest), a demented quasi-rape of Vaughn on his first night at the Clearys, and some other amusing parts sprinkled throughout the film, there are flaws. For one, it does go a little longer than it should- a couple of scenes could've been cut, or at least trimmed. At two hours, a romp of a romantic comedy shouldn't feel this over-long (a lot of it for the story of Wilson and McAdams' characters, who have good chemistry, but don't have much room to go in the formula). Another problem is under-developed, or non-developed characters.Take the character Cooper plays, Sack- he's been with Claire (McAdams) for over three years, and yet she is everything that he isn't. He's a one-dimensional villain, someone who is so obvious that it doesn't leave much room for conflict or second guessing about where the film will go. This goes for the Walken character as well, who seems mis-cast in a film where his odd comic genius and timing could come in well, but he doesn't bring much to the table aside from maybe one laugh (perhaps not intentional). Ironically, two characters who score a lot of points when they appear on screen, Will Ferrel as the Wedding Crasher legend Chaz, and Keir O'Donnell as the closet-freak/brother Todd, get very little time to bring funnier bits (they're stuck, again, in the traction of the screenplay, who do what they can in the time given).Wedding Crashers did give a couple of surprises, and it is gleeful, dumb fun for most of the way. But when it comes to the last quarter it starts to drag, the laughs become more diminished, and it becomes more of waiting for the last scene than being entertained. The whole aspect of the lying theme of the film fits in, yet really as story devices. In short, it's a film that brings in its moments well, and gives some good room for Wilson and Vaughn to work in (Vaughn, whom I've always gotten the least of laughs in the pack of Wilsons, Ferrell, and Stiller in their films, actually makes good on a lot of the set-ups and pay-offs of the absurdities). But the script and actors tend to stumble as much as they make it entertaining. 6/10 or a B-",6,4,9,28 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Who has the milkshake?
","Curious that both of the two best films of the year (the other No Country for Old Men)- likely two of the most daring and great of American films I've ever encountered- both are measured, classically told stories of the pit of greed that encapsulates in the soulless. In the case of Paul Thomas Anderson's film, he uses a source which, as one might expect if one's read Upton Sinclair, there are as many metaphors to be had as blood. But not poorly laid metaphors at all, or ones that hit you on the head without reason or proper impact. These are the kinds that enrich a work of art, where they can be thought of later as with the themes, while in the midst of things you're just wrapped up in the solar-plexus of the story, and more crucially the storytelling. Daniel Plainview is a prospector at the start of the picture who has an image of himself, one that must never be broken. He digs for silver, then digs for oil, and strikes it rich. But he wants more. He buys up land from an Able Holiday, who's closest related Eli is welcoming, but at a price that the Lord has set (assumingly). Soon there is much oil, lots of it, and a pipeline as well. Eventually, like CF Kane, he's by himself in his big, dark mansion, without a Rosebud to boot.Daniel Plainview is such a great character because he is, as played to complete astonishment and embodiment by Daniel Day Lewis (reincarnating, ever so slightly, his volcanic performance in Gangs of New York), a servant to a God that leaves nothing in its wake. He and Eli, in a more-than-subtle sense, are kindred spirits: they worship their idols, one being money and one being God, but they also have a commonality, which is that what they want is never really enough, and what they want relies on those around them at their blind will. When the two, after years of 'ups and downs' as Plainview says, have their final meeting in the bowling alley, it becomes less a revelation than a staggering scene of hell. It's one of the most absurdly dramatic endings in all movies.But there's also a greater metaphor, which is the oil itself (by the way, Sinclair's novel is titled 'Oil!' with exclamation point). Anderson's picture is carefully constructed around a man who for capitalism is his lifeblood, for lack of a better term. The oil keeps flowing, and flowing, as does the money. But it's never really enough. There's an inherent fascination with watching a man, like Kane for example, who can never have enough because of a crucial defect in his humanity. No real friends, no real family (a re-emerging 'brother' is a big sub-plot), and a son who, when a tragedy befalls him, can never be apart of his own self-created image. Rarely has a character been portrayed, by the actor as well as the director, in such a way that makes him so hateful, so unsympathetic, but never one we can look away from. It's capitalism unforgiven, if that makes sense.And meanwhile, with his characters of Daniel and Eli locked in to the web of money and religion in the center, Anderson crafts a film loaded with visual beauty. He's a director known for elaborate long-takes and tracking shots, but here it's even more measured, more in tune with a classic epic, as though the Grapes of Wrath were turned on its head. The dialog cuts like a knife, the cinematography has a visionary quality that brings out the spectacle and the personal feeling (less mood, though there's that there too) of the compositions. And the music by Greenwood is unlike any ever produced, with strings and wailing chords that pierce right along with the narrative.Altogether, it creates in There Will Be Blood a truly horrific and yet ever so recognizable truth in the American dream. And like No Country for Old Men, none of the characters have a 'happy' ending. Not that a bleak ending a great films makes. But if it fits, it should be rode out till its logical conclusion. There Will Be Blood can be called all the big words- masterpiece, classic, essential, must-see, and that it's maker is worthy of comparison now (more than ever) to the great filmmakers of old. But it's above anything else a precise drama of conscience, or lack thereof. It's a fine, fine milkshake indeed.",10,19,38,5 January 2008
Ice Age," One of the most enjoyable family films in the past years
","It always seems to be with these computer animated movies, to have a charm all it's own, humor that usually works all around, and (a flaw to be sure) the same plot elements fitted into different settings (notice how friendship, betrayal and a climax involving kids in some way fit into every animated movie in the past 7 years outside of Antz).  Ice Age follows that tradition being the first 20th Century Fox computer animated movie from Bunny director Chris Wedge, and it has an undeniable sweetness that can strike young and old alike.  This also goes with the laughs too.Manfred (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Denis Leary) join together, obvious un-wantingly at first, to return a baby to it's father. That's the plot-line and it works in it's typical way, borrowing from the two good computer flicks from last year as well (Monster's Inc. and Shrek). But what keeps young and old and inbetween alike in their seats is not the story but rather the good natured and silly humor, convinving if not always realistic surroundings and splendid voice work by the three leads.  A fine movie.One more note: while Leary, Romano and Leguizamo show off their capabilities, I jest to forget who steals a good chunk of the movie- a little squirrel chasing after an all important acorn nut throughout the pan of the movie.  Truth be told, he deserves his own TV show. A-",7,1,1,15 March 2002
Burlesque," one of the most entertaining bad movies of the year
","Don't make any mistake that the vote is five out of ten on the scale. This is in fact not a very good movie. That is, when you stop to think about it. The screenplay by Steve Antin was very likely cooked up after a Cliff-Notes stop to Syd Field's book-of-wonders, and not the updated version but the one that gives you Screen writing-for-Real-Dummies (his only previous credit as writer/director is a direct-to-video sequel to The Glass House, a movie me and two other people on the planet saw in the first place). And maybe that's okay. In these tough times of depressing economic circumstances, maybe people need a little PG-13 escapism. Yes, escape from your dreary existence to see (almost) family-friendly risqué dancing from Christina Aguilera and Cher (or, holy-god-that's-Cher?)Ah, the story. The meat and potatoes of it is Aguilera's a small town girl, comes to LA, goes to the magically-out-of-ether apparent Burlesque club loaded with catty girl dancers and a few gay ones (Alan Cumming plays a Joel Grey out of Cabaret surrogate), and run by Cher, Stanley Tucci and sometimes-around Peter Gallagher. The club might close if more money doesn't come around! What to do? How about someone who can dance *and* sing. Gasp! In comes the incessant Aguilera, who in- between going all-out in her quest for acceptance roommates with a clueless guy who is engaged to a girl on the other side of the country, and shady real estate guy. One knows he's shady as Aguilera's character points out to him 'You're not the bad guy, you're the wrong one.' Touche, I guess.Don't come for the story, or much of the dialog, which has lines like 'Alice, hm? Well, welcome to Wonderland.' Actually, that's a white-lie. Do come for that, but not because it's particularly intelligent or wonderful. It's a lot of camp, the movie is. It is Showgirls-lite, which means it's neither anywhere near as mind-bogglingly awful, though not half as ambitious in its intentions. As I said, the movie is kind of 'safe', in a sense. It could raise the ire of some hardcore Bible- thumpers, but that's about it. The sexual content is only on occasion actually sexually charged, and is otherwise playful (at one point Ali does a number where she's covered through most of it, but only by a sheet really, naked except for that and singing a sorta sultry song), like the music video from Moulin Rouge that Aguilera and her contemporaries made, Lady Marmlelade.Again, should I sell you on this movie? That depends. If you think there's something better to see, please, do so, by all means. It's like eating one of those pink-sugar things that's not even a twinkie but the counterpart that Woody Harrelson kept finding unfortunately in Zombieland. Cher, especially, as the co-star (though name above Aguilera), is prominently featured as one of the 'serious' actors of the film, though she too has lines that... well, I don't want to spoil, pshaw! As for her musical numbers, which is one of the more precise reasons that one could be curious to see the film, one is generic and one has no right being in a movie called burlesque as it's not burlesque nor good songwriting ('You Haven't Seen the Last of Me' is the number, which has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself, only for Cher to have one other number than her Welcoming song that comes conveniently as Ali enters the club).Other numbers fare better, at least as far as being energetic, flashy, and showing off Aguilera's actual talent which, believe you me, is not acting. Luckily she's found a platform for her singing and dancing that works for her (unlike a certain Britney Spears from 2002's Crossroads, let's never mention it again). Her fans especially will be pleased to see her stretching her vocal chords and strutting her natural sexuality and appealing features for the camera. In a way these numbers do set off how much of the rest of the movie is either forgettable hooey or ridiculous trash. But hey, it's trash that doesn't kid itself; as far as bad movies go that are still out in theaters- or may be coming to DVD in a few months- it fares MUCH better than something like Skyline.",5,2,5,12 December 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," one of the quintessential POW/WW2 movies, with unforgettable characterizations
","What does it mean to be a solider versus a prisoner? How about the meaning of a Colonel's duty, pride, and everything in a male-centric view in times of war? And really, what everything seems to come down to- in the case of The Bridge on the River Kwai- is that priorities end up being eschewed with moral ambiguity and heroism in the oddest circumstances. David's Lean's masterpiece takes a compelling look at men who wont give in, and when they do they somehow lose a piece of themselves in the process- a big part really depending on point of view &/or country- and how being ultra-tough and stubborn and headstrong may get you killed for the wrong reasons. Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guiness in a very well deserved Oscar winning turn) and Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, who is actually a really great actor as well) both don't want to give in when Nicholson arrives at Saito's camp, and refuses adamantly to work alongside the fellow soldiers on the bridge- he sees it's against the Geneva conventions, and makes it a point of principle not to do it. He's put away for a while, but then finally Saito can't take the stubbornness any more- as he knows he's been evenly matched perhaps- and has no choice (ala seppuku if not achieved) but to let him direct the building of the bridge. But what this turns into for Nicholson, as a further elongation of the principle of the matter for his men and the situation, into a really mad situation.So in this there is also the other main section of the story, where the idea of what it is to have principles starts to pick up via 'Major' Shears (William Holden, the conventional 'star' who grows more interesting in the second half). He's not really a major, but he's done in a quasi-cowardly quasi-pragmatic move to take a major's place when taken prisoner in the camp. When he achieves escape, however, he's caught between a rock and a hard place when he has to go with Major Warden (also a headstrong, 'war is a game' character played by Jack Hawkins), otherwise he'll be dishonorably discharged as an impersonator, already with a criminal record. There's a pivotal scene when he and Warden are on their way to the bridge, which undercuts the whole bond between Nicholson and Saito, when Warden wants to be left for dead after injuring his foot. Does it make more sense to hold one's own sense of duty to a mission, or to one's self, or not? What becomes Shears's gain- a sense of obligation as opposed to being a 'have no choice' scenario- becomes Nicholson's loss. The bridge to Nicholson becomes something abstracted from what is really going on, and his original ideal of not giving in to being a prisoner becomes muddled, leading up to that incredibly tense, maddening climax where his final words punctuate it all: 'what have I done?' But it's not all completely a serious endeavor, and what's so brilliant about Lean's approach to Boulle's material is that it's also a grand old entertainment, where the characters are rich and fully engrossing (albeit with Shears's/Holden given an obligatory 'I'm the star' scene with a blond on a beach that seems from a different movie), and with a scope and direction that is just as ambitious in its own right as Lawrence of Arabia. Lean occasionally lets some visual metaphors in that do work very well (the huge flock of birds flying around, and the bridge itself being a metaphor in itself of colonial interests). But for the most part he lets the atmosphere of a war-time adventure work by itself, with the cinematography and editing sometimes working in ultra-suspenseful ways (particularly with the setting up of the wires around the bridge, and 'go time'), and in a traditional way of solid storytelling. He lets the themes work through the characters, which gives the actors a lot more to work with than with pushing it down the viewer's throat. There's a sense that the boundaries of the typical POW/war movie, particularly from a British viewpoint, are stretched and expanded, questioning the means of the main characters while still showing them, in spurts, to have great merit.And if for nothing else, the acting's really what stands out, especially in the subtle notes and turns that seem over-the-top like with Hayakawa but are really nuanced too (he, especially, has a crux to deal with in suddenly losing his own sense of duty to country as a Brit takes over his job essentially). Guiness, meanwhile, gives something extraordinary in practically every scene, when he's either reserved or having to finally break down and show emotion (it's not the first bridge he's over-seen, hence the extra amount of pride that it'll be a 'British-built' bridge). As Shears notes, there's something dangerous to a man like Nicholson who wont give in, and Guiness undercuts this dangerous quality with the elegance that he's perfect at, and then lets it become full-circle when he meets his all-too-ironic end. Holden, by the way, is also quite good here, if sort of given the almost thankless role of the star who's typically cocky, and only when finally on the mission is there some opening up in relation to Hawkins's Warden; his speech to Warden is especially engrossing.Featuring the catchiest of all whistling in the movies, and a dynamite cast and graceful and distinctively superlative directorial vision, this is one of those rare films about war where character takes precedence over action (compared to the common war movies of the period, it's only sporadic and more suggestive in the violence), not to mention in big-budget splendor, and ends up truly memorable.",10,5,9,27 January 2007
A Hard Day's Night," Ladies and gentlemen - THE BEATLES!
","You know em, you love em, cant get enough of em (depending on the voracity of the particular fan, current or nostalgic), the Beatles are two things at once: a nifty rhythm and blues band that can play (at least in this 'Fab-Four' early era) all sorts of cool three-minute songs dedicated to loving this or that girl, lamenting some loss, and solid blues and rock standards. And they're also a pop phenomenon that unlike boy bands or other pop acts of today aren't made from conglomerated formations. The brilliance of Hard Day's Night is that director Richard Lester takes on the Beatles phenomenon for what it is, makes it an exuberant feast of rock and fun and screaming girls, and at the same time makes of the funniest British comedies of the last fifty years. He mixes documentary style with some of the New Wave techniques from France and elsewhere with a zany rhythm that is distinctly his own. Lester's next Beatles film, Help!, might have more laughs per capita, but it's this film that marks him as something of a minor genius.There isn't much need for plot, and it's a good thing too- plot, unless if it's the kind from Help!, gets in the way of the Beatles natural riffs and jabs and of course the music. It follows one day in the life of the Beatles as they escape from hordes of screaming pre-teen/teen girls, gear up and practice for their upcoming show, and bits of wackiness in-between. Most of this involves Paul's grandfather (played in such a fine toss-up between deadpan and insane/senile by Wilford Brammell), who wanders off or tempts Ringo with the ideals of 'parading' instead of drumming and reading, or just minor technical issues with the Beatles' managers and organizers of the event. There's no nonsensical plot to thrust our stars into like with Elvis; it's if anything probably closer to the madness of that time and place for them than anything else (i.e. the press room, where, according to the Beatles Anthology documentary, THOSE kinds of questions really were asked).Meanwhile, as Lester delivers some usually clear-cut scenes edited without much fuss or muss he also digs into creating Hard Day's Night as a fantasy mixed with this strange reality of Beatle-mania. Seeing the Can't Buy Me Love scene, in its own rough-hewed way, is as joyous as anything in Signin' in the Rain. And then it shifts to being funny while also going for an underlying sense of loneliness with these guys, like Ringo's walk along the riverside contemplating what to do with himself. And then there's just general hilarity that more than likely inspired Monty Python, like when George is thrust into a questionnaire about fashion, or just getting a crazy look at John in the bathtub. And let's not forget the music... OK, lets. Seriously, even if it's not your favorite period of Beatles music (and, for me, they would hit their peak and run with it two years later with Rubber Soul and Revolver), it's still a gas to see them play and enjoy themselves all the while doing it. They don't over-do their theatricality like bands of today, and they never look like 'oh, it's just another gig.' On stage, as with the film itself, energy rollicks it all the way through. You want your classic Beatles, here it is, packaged like a a crispy and nutty chocolate bar of rock and 60s hipness. A+",10,2,2,2 March 2008
Man on Fire," Scott goes to town - and it works
","In April or 2004 there were three big revenge films out in theaters: this film, Man on Fire, Kill Bill: Volume 2, and the Punisher. Out of those three, Tony Scott's film, a remake of a small 80s thriller, rested right in the middle. It might have been as ambitious as Tarantino's film, but thankfully was nowhere near as atrocious as that 'other' movie. In this Denzel Washington is a bad dude, but one with principles that stretch to the point of no return as he goes to town to find those bastards that took away the girl he was protecting (Dakota Fanning). It's a visual stroke of, well, almost genius perhaps: Scott is into shooting stuff in such a way that we're in a daze a good deal of the time, and he flips the screw on us in such a way that we only know what to expect in some of the characterizations. But this is Washington digging into a character perhaps just as irredeemable than his character in Training Day- certainly not with too much more range- and yet we end up identifying with this troubled, brutal man because of something Washington puts in Creasy: quiet (or not son quiet) resolve, perhaps? Certainly Scott's approach is daring enough to keep interest, and indeed Man on Fire has become one of those movies that I have seen several times on television. I recognize it's not exceptional or even too great of a revenge picture. Yet I also recognize a craftsmanship to it that doesn't just go for broke but breaks the bank into a bunch of pieces. It's a glorious but decadent excess of style, like with those flagrant subtitles popping up or those fades and dissolves that do backflips on one another. It's a gritty film shot like on a mescaline trip. It's also got some heavy-duty backup (Giancarlo Giannini, Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony- yes, Marc Anthony), and some really grisly action scenes that reveal as much about the lengths to which Creasy will go as much as the director and writer themselves. It's not something I'd say is at the top of any list, or that I'd immediately rush out to buy. But it's got a magnetic quality for all of its ugly bits and pieces. It's about something, which can be said more than other Tony Scott freak-outs major (Domino) and more whimper style (Taking of Pelham 123).",7,0,1,12 June 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Best film of its era
","Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a landmark (one of the few I might add) in cinema. Pretty much everything in this film is at or close to perfection. And rightfully so, it became only the 2nd (1 in 3 films in history along with It Happened One Night and Silence of the Lambs) film to win the top five Oscars- Best Picture, Actor (Jack Nicholson), Actress (Louise Fletcher), Director (Forman), and Screenplay (Bo Goldman).The story (based on Ken Kessey's astounding, though not too similar, novel) focuses on a rowdy misfit named Randle Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson) who is put in a mental hospital with other people (some voluntarily in) who are not all there. Some of these guys include Danny DeVito (in his first role), Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif (in his Oscar nominated role) and the never forgettable Will Sampson who played the Chief. The film, It's actors and scenes will always be terrific achievements in cinema and is one of my favorites.",10,159,224,15 April 2000
Edge of Tomorrow," largely refreshing and clever science fiction thriller, verging on comedy in parts
","What makes Edge of Tomorrow arguably the best Tom Cruise starring vehicle in the past ten years - yes, I'm going that far (excluding the Mission: Impossible movies I should add) - is context. For a while, Cruise has been playing characters who just come ready-made it seems as bad-asses; Jack Reacher, the character in Oblivion, Knight & Day (that was leaning more to comedy, but the point still stands), Valkyrie. In all of these, we don't get to see much at all in the way of a transformation into him being a 'bad-ass', he just is, and it's gotten tiring after a while. Then enter in Edge of Tomorrow where he plays basically a PR man for the military - a talking head - in one of those apocalyptic societies where aliens have landed and there's a battle for Earth yada-yada. He gets tricked by Brendan Bleeson's General or Colonel or whoever, and is placed right into combat. Where he dies. Because he's not fit for war. But due to a kind of alien-substance-MacGuffin device, Cruise's character ends up going back to right when he's about to enter the combat hell. And this loop continues again, and again.What's different here? Cruise has to *become* a hero, and while this may not be something exactly new in action-sci-fi spectacle movies - certainly it's more along the lines of what you'd pick up in a screen writing class - it's refreshing for this star, especially to see Cruise have to act as the sap who is caught in a bad situation, and has little other choice but to get better (aside from, you know, the film's tagline of 'Live Die Repeat'). In another way what's so absorbing is that the structure of Liman's film, taking off from a Japanese comic book, is that it's like a video game: if you go into a combat zone, you have to progress (I was thinking of one of those Metal Gear games, but I'm sure there's something closer to what it actually is in video games). You have to get to that next level and keep going to get to the final 'bad guy'.The movie is short from being altogether great for the reason of the familiarity of the alien invasion dynamic - albeit the alien designs are rather extraordinary, with their spaghetti-limbs and quick pace - and the climax has more of that familiarity with what Cruise and Emily Blunt are going after to destroy that alien 'source'. But outside of that, Edge of Tomorrow is a winning picture, and the filmmakers have a lot of FUN with the premise and all of these times that Cruise has to go through this combat situation - also Bill Paxton as a scene-chewing sergeant with his platoon of metal-suited soldiers - and Blunt too. The team up works a bit better as well than some of the past Cruise vehicles (again, Reacher and Oblivion come to mind) as far as the two stars playing off each other, finding the dark comedy in these situations, and the gravity in the drama as well. When Blunt's character has to tell about how she went through this Groundhog's Day scenario before, there's weight and substance to the drama.I have to wonder if it'll work as well on another viewing; in the theater there was a real sense of surprise to every step of the movie's logic. I imagine it will be entertaining just by the nature of the writing, and it also must be said that Liman directs the action very well. There's some of the shaky-cam crap - he was the director of the first Bourne of course - but not TOO much, and you can tell what is going on in relation to the spaces shot to shot. It's all in all a case of a star taking it just a little bit easy, and it pays off: Cruise is really appealing in the film, as he goes on this adventure, learns as he goes along, and he and Blunt get great lines to play throughout. In other words, the kind of comedy-action-drama-spectacle that gets shoveled down the world's collective throat with Transformers, but much much better, for the reasons stated.",9,2,7,23 November 2014
Downfall," One of the best foreign films of the year
","Quite simply, the story of Downfall is of the final days of the third Reich, held up in a bunker in the center of Berlin, as Adolf Hitler and his closest minions go deeper into the hole they've dug for themselves (told through the perspective, for the most part, of Hitler's last secretary Traudl Junge). I'm not sure if it is a great film or not on a first viewing, as it is a highly emotional experience along with it being intellectual at times. It's a complex film with a specific look, and the documentary-style that borders sometimes on being too much (depending on the viewer).One aspect of the film right off that fascinated me was the look. Director Hirschbiegel and DP Rainer Klaussman give scenes (I'm not certain all of them) a certain yellow-greenish tint. Perhaps this world we are seeing is meant to look like a sort of death, in a sickly kind of hue inside and outside the bunker. Or, this is just part of the style of the camera, which is often hand-held, and meant to have a Saving Private Ryan approach to the horrors of warfare. The details of most of the victims (many of which not innocent) of battle wounds or suicides are not sugar-coated with any kind of hyper-kinetic style. It's very straightforward, and all the more shocking. When Hirschbiegel shoots a pan across people (sometimes Children) that are already dead, it's certainly far more jarring than could be expected. Spielberg may try for the gritty, 'no-holds-barred' direction of the horrors of war and Nazism, a filmmaker from the country of its origin has a certain advantage.The story that unfolds in Downfall is of course a doomed one at the start (doomed for everyone in the story, the Nazis and the un-seen millions of victims of Europe included). It would be one thing for the filmmakers to punch up the story of Hitler's demise with melodrama, however an aspect to the film that doesn't cheat the audience (German, American, or otherwise) is that the story is somehow objective on one level, and on another tries to find someone to connect with. Hitler (played by Wim Wenders regular Bruno Ganz) is the key character to the story, but by making the protagonist the secretary the story does have something of a portal for a viewer amid the lot of crazed, trapped characters.Hitler is certainly the cold-blooded, Nietzsche-influenced Fuhrer of the lot, and others such as Eva Braun and the Goebbels are proof that what Hitler had in him was infectious not just with his nation at the outset, but also with his closest followers. His generals argue over what to do. The Russians are closing in. Eva throws a birthday party like it's nobody's business, despite bombs coming through the windows. Nazi commanders turn their backs on the Fuhrer one by one, adding to Hitler's ultimate hypocrisy. One brief exchange between two soldiers that caught my attention went as such, 'Where should we go?' 'I don't know; some place where we're needed.' Speaking of content, I must come to the point of the performances. While some actors in the soldier roles and female parts were well-cast and notable - Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl is not too forced, though one may not always find her as sympathetic as the film tries to represent - if Downfall lacked a proper actor for Hitler, it could almost slip into farce (and not the classic kind found in Chaplin or the Three Stooges). Bruno Ganz does what I see only on occasion in based-on-life dramas: he goes so deep into character that one figures that no one else could have been this person in this film. Much like with his followers, when he is in the room in a scene, the attention is all on him, as if he was that most wretched of school-teachers who gained attention through the reptilian parts of your brain. Ganz is never over-doing it when the Fuhrer flips out, and he never makes him seem too unbelievable. In other words every look that gets accentuated in a close-up or in the darkness of a room adds to the tension and horror of the whole situation.When one sees the film upon a first viewing, the story of the Goebbles is likely the most disturbing for any viewer. While Mr. and Mrs. Goebbles' fates are well-documented along with the other monsters, their children's fates make for scenes that bring full circle the insanity of Hitler's own messages- the collapse of compassion, the facade of loyalty and honor, the un-stoppable hatred of Jews and anyone not of 'their' creed, all wrapped together in the climax of the picture.I really was not sure what to expect from a film like this. I wasn't sure if the filmmakers would try and make Hitler seem the least bit sympathetic. They did not. I left the theater with a hatred that possibly spread further, as I take umbrage to his perversion of Nietzsche, and his ironic taste in food (vegetarian dictator, who knew). And one flaw I saw in the film was that even with being open-minded for the aspect of the 'other', from the German's perspective, there were some people and characters presented that I could not find acceptable under the writing and direction (in other words, in a few bits, the stark realism vanished). If there is anything worthy to find in the film though is it's brutally honest about the nature of fascism, and the outcome of the effects it has on a war machine like the one that unfolded with WW2. History may or may not be fogged as to what precisely happened in that bunker, but in a dramatic style not too far of a stretch from Rossellini's own Germany Year-Zero, it's definitely worth a viewing (that is, in the right frame of mind).",10,21,32,9 March 2005
Army of Darkness," Raimi's evolved style of total comic book hilarity
","Sam Raimi's third (but possibly not last) installment in his 'Evil Dead' series shows Ash (Bruce Campbell, a cult hero of sorts) right after Evil Dead 2, now back in medieval times, still fighting against the unpredictably grotesque and bizarre Necronomicon. This is just a set-up though, like with most comic-books, for mostly a series of visual gags, in-jokes, puns, homages, and out-right hilarity and parody. In other words, if you're wanting to watch this for the same reasons you wanted to watch the original Evil Dead, you may be disappointed. This is the sort of evolution that Raimi has taken the series with: the first was a film from a filmmaker 21 years old, with an over-load of visual energy, pumping out one of the most visceral and inventive of all horror films. The sequel went half and half- at times it took the sincerity and true horror of the first film, but it also had a lot to laugh about too, as it didn't take itself seriously for most of it. With Army of Darkness, it's tongue-in-cheek incarnate. Take a scene where Ash has just resurrected the 'deadites' (through some fault of his own, mumbling the last word of his forgotten phrase to stop the curse from the book of the dead) to rise. He suddenly gets pulled down to the ground, and the skeletons from the graves have their way with him, in short, having a fight in the tradition of a Three Stooges skit (blocking eye-pokes and all). This leads up to the skeletons forming their 'army' of the title, and it's more like a wild send-up of Jason and the Argonauts than a real 'zombie' film as some horror fans might be mis-led to believe. By the time Ash gets out his chainsaw wielded on his arm, its become cliché all the way, but expertly clever cliché.There is no 'message' from the film really, it's just a full-blown, ludicrous romp with the middle ages and the occult- and it's all the better (and gets better on repeat viewings like Brooksfilm comedies) due to this. And the film may or may not work for some depending on the stamina and prowess of Campbell, who for me is one of the funniest people working in low-budget films today (he comes up occasionally in big-budget films too), but may be a little too 'ham' for some viewers. Like Evil Dead 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Return of the Living Dead among others, Army of Darkness joins that handful of films that's for a select audience (it's not as graphic with its gore as in the first film, but its still in high gear), to have as a good 'party movie' with friends. A 'gas' from start to finish, to coin a term that does apply well here as one of the better films of 93. A-",8,1,2,28 July 2005
The Last King of Scotland," contains both the conventions and convictions of good thrillers, with a 'tour-de-force' performance
","It would be one thing to make the pat statement 'this is worth seeing if only for Forest Whitaker as dictator Idi Amin'. For some it will be, and in fact some may just go to see it based on the hype he's been building up in the awards season (not that it's undeserved). But the director Kevin MacDonald, along with his DP Anthony Dod Mantle (behind the modern classic as 28 Days Later), gives the film an edge to it that might have been lost on a technical crew less interested in getting part of the psychology into the style. In the core of the Last King of Scotland, which is purportedly based on the true story of Amin and his doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who becomes soon an adviser and soon like a 'son' in Amin's bi-polar mind, is a thriller that does thrill, and also pulls into question what it means to practically become a participant in the madness of a brutal dictatorship. Garrigan randomly picks Uganda to go to after he graduates from medical school in Scotland, tries to be a doctor where needed, but somehow becomes enveloped in the world of Amin after a chance encounter on a road-side. He becomes charmed by Amin's upfront likability and candid manner, plus his vulgar humor and promise of both peace for his people and excess in his domain (he has three wives). But soon this turns to become sour when Garrigan sees the darker side to Amin- a paranoid fear-monger who can flip on a dime on his closest advisers. He knows he has to get out, but it wont be easy, at all.It's a shame then that such pungent subjects- of the towering force that is Amin, portrayed by Whitaker with a look in his eyes that always perfectly conveys what the scene should feel like, and towards the end becomes absolutely chilling in both his rage and even his amiability. Even McAvoy is able to rise to the challenge of his counterpart, as the guy who inspires more in Amin to be 'Scottish', but also becomes wayward himself. His plot line though becomes a little mired in bits that don't seem truthful (who's to say if they are, as it's based on a book likely based on what happened), with his romantic asides the most unconvincing portions of the picture. The whole sub-plot with him and one of Amin's wives (played by Kerry Washington) becomes a little soapy, and puts such realism into the realm of near contrivance (I also would've liked to see, aside from the one scene where Garrigan sees the pictures, the furthest extent of his murderous ways on his people). But when pit into the reality of Garrigan's situation, and the environment around him, it becomes a richer picture. It does have the goods with being an engrossing entertainment of course, and of the two films out now (this and Blood Diamond) set in turbulent Africa I'd recommend this a little more for the style and acting. That it isn't great isn't ever a fault of Whitaker, however. 7.5/10",7,2,4,19 January 2007
Scream 2," A Drop off
","I must say this film isn't as good as the first (if that's saying anything) but it is much better than part 3.  I already knew it was better than part 3, but when I first saw this I was conflicted about whether or not this film was better than the first.  Then I realized it waa almost equal in scares and laughs and surprises.  But the first was actually more original (even though it was inspired greatly by many other movies).  Actually though, that doesn't stop anyone from seeing this movie.  I still recommend this film to teens looking for a few laughs and plenty of scares in the Craven tradition. Just don't go watching this film looking for the best horror film ever made, that's all.  Cameos include Jada Pinkett-Smith, Tori Spelling and director Wes Craven.  A-",7,0,4,12 July 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Coppola's take isn't great, but it's still very good...
","Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic can be considered better than some of the lower ones in the genre due to a few key factors. 1) a mostly stellar cast (Oldman and Hopkins fit into their roles splendidly, Ryder does what she can, Reeves isn't too bad, and great supporting work from Elwes, Waits, and Grant) that does well by Coppola's always keen, if not exceptional, direction of actors. 2) Oscar winning effects and make-up, and a genuine look to the period. To see many of the sets and designs is to be reminded of how good big budgets can do for the story. Michael Ballhaus is also an essential asset. And 3) the take on the Dracula story (while I can't confirm since I've never read the book) seems to take a solid, novelistic approach. While Coppola does give in to some excesses with some of the music and the editing, and some of the romantic stuff in the film is less than great, the film is worthy for fans of the book and genre. As pure, horror entertainment, it delivers the chills. A-",9,6,13,17 September 2004
Die Hard with a Vengeance," THE BEST OF THE TRILOGY
","Don't get me wrong, I like Die Hard 1 and 2.  But this is a terrific action film that not only has great suspense making you think till the end, but good teamwork by Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson that actually make some comic relief.  In this enstallment, Bruce once again plays Lieutenant John McClane, back in New York and on pention.  But now, he has a new terrorist on his hands, the brother (jeremy Irons) of the original terrorist (Alan Rickman).  But it isn't just about revenge, in this thriller.  Great action sequences and cool locations make this a picture perfect summer film. A++",9,7,15,1 May 2000
Con Air," Plenty of action, not plenty of brains
","This film didn't completely dissapoint me, but I felt that this was not the best Bruckheimer film (to say the least).  Despite some great effects and action, this film doesn't have that great od a plot or dialogue.  I don't want to go into the plot here, but one thing I can say is that only one good thing comes out of the whole jail in a plane plot- John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi.  They play crazed criminals, one is a clever mastermind that has a nickname with a virus (Malkovich) and the other rides through three states with a woman's head as a hat and makes the Manson family look like Partridge family (Buscemi).  Looking for those performances and action, you'll find great stuff.  Looking for a bright plot and good character stuff, your really gonna hate this.  I was midly annoyed by it.  B",7,1,2,3 July 2000
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Coens!
","Hail, Caesar! is one of those big, luscious, gorgeous odes to the Golden Age of Hollywood - a certain kind of Hollywood, at any rate - and it's a work that is both great and minor at the same time. It's probably so because of the central plot, the sort of spine of it, is just alright, while everything else around it - all of the moving parts and scenes of 'dreams' being created at Capital Pictures - is so wonderful and hysterically funny and perfectly timed (time and how to have to always check it, the inserts of Eddie Mannix's watch, being a running theme here by the way). It's the Coens making a movie that only they can make, and if the parts are greater than the whole, still, such awe-inspiring parts! Of course a lot is taken tongue-in-cheek, but there are some things underlying the story that are serious enough to get invested in the characters. Or, I should say, the 'Christ' hero of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who runs the Physical Production arm of the shooting of films at Capital, with multiple shoots going on a particular day. On the 24 hours that Hail, Caesar takes place in, there's of course the 'prestige' picture of the movie's own title (with the subtitle 'A Tale of the Christ', an obvious wink and nod to Ben-Hur) where George Clooney as Baird Whitlock is hamming it up as a Roman in the face of this 'Christ' figure. While Whitlock gets drugged and taken away to an underground group (that operates in a nice house in Malibu by the sea), other pictures go on like a mermaid/swimming-dance piece (with Scarlett Johansson), a cowboy picture - at first - but then in almost the blink of an eye the star of that, Hobie Doyle (Ehrenreich) gets put on a fashionable costume drama directed by Laurence Larentz (Fiennes). And of course there's a musical being shot with singing and dancing sailors led by Channing Tatum... because, how could you NOT have him doing that here? I'm sure I've left out other shoots that may be taking place on the lot over the course of the day (and lets not forget, oh it's impossible to do so, Tilda Swinton as *twin* gossip columnists with only slightly varying agendas when talking separately to Mannix, and Frances McDormand in a brilliant one-scene bit as a chain-smoking editor), but those are the ones to really take in. Probably the one with Johannson comes close to being too long, but it's still a gorgeous, over-the-top spectacle that revels in how cheesy we look at works like that today if they pop up on Turner Classic Movies - same with the sailor musical or the costume drama (we also, very thankfully, get to see some dailies from these shoots that are so authentic and yet with that little sly wink the Coens do). In fact the whole movie, when it's at its best, is like condensing a week's worth of programming - both the 'B' movie level and the prestige 'A' stuff - into an hour and 45 minutes, with Tatum's dance number a mini-masterpiece that blends together being a rich satire of such goofy and dopey numbers and being a legitimately fantastic and spectacular number.I enjoyed those parts so much that it pains me to not find the movie one of the directors' best on the whole. It may be seeing it a first time and having certain expectations (the trailer, one of the best in recent memory, does a number on any viewer), such as what 'The Future' kidnapping group entails. Perhaps I expected it to have much darker, weirder, more absurdist/surrealist dimensions based on how they appeared. As it turns out, they're only Communists who try (and sort of succeed, in a way) to indoctrinate Whitlock into their world. Indeed the movie sort of functions as two stories, one with Whitlock and the old blacklisted writers and the other being Mannix having to go around from one place to another as the Man In Charge spinning a dozen different plates (and also his own conflicts at work, which is a nice bit of writing to make him have the most dimension, and Brolin plays it with total conviction and never slipping into caricature, which is easy enough to do here).I can see this probably being a work that I will like even more a second time, or, equally, as with a film tonally this reminded me of from them, Burn After Reading, I find more to pick apart, but it's all the same a movie that you have to see in the theater to get the full experience of it. Even when it gets very, very strange (the climax involving 'The Future' is that for me, among the strangest things the Coens have ever written and shot in their careers) it's still highly entertaining, and the actors are having a blast in all of their roles, including those who just appear in a scene or two (looking at you Jonah Hill, Clancy Brown or, yes, oh my God, that's Christopher Lambert!) The filmmakers lovingly recreate the period to every small detail, from the art design to Deakins' cinematography (a contrast to last year's Sicario by light years) and it's one of those grand old times where they just fill up the frames with sunny, light comedy with the occasional dark-noirish undertone. It's the Coens saying 'yeah, this was all pretty goofy... but wasn't it SOMETHING to behold?'",8,12,26,5 February 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," one of the funniest (albeit stupidest) films of the year
","Anchorman is a film that would hardly merit itself to be taken too seriously, so as a full-on, joke-a-minute spoof, it works a lot better. Ferrell plays the title character of Ron Burgendy, as a man who will read anything on the teleprompter, and is a (in his mind) ladies man to boot. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, in her best role since her Married with Children days), who is assigned to the local news station - soon as a co-anchor - which throws off what these 70's news people (including a great, dimwit role for Steve Correll) are used to. This leads forth into a pretty general story-line for a comedy of this sort, yet a story is the last thing to think about here.Like the recent Dodgeball, Anchorman is superb at doing one thing above all, which is supplying a joke practically every thirty seconds, if not more. There are many scenes that also go down as near comic gems, some of which I would dare not spoil here. However, the film gets a boost from not only Ferrell- who gets laughs by almost anything (including gibberish and mad screaming in some scenes)- but from totally un-expected and worthy cameos. I wouldn't say Anchorman is for everyone (in general, art-film buffs, Shakespeare geeks, and character study phobes might want to steer clear), but perhaps its finest feat is that it's like one long SNL skit - and a skit that surprisingly works a helluva lot better than could be imagined from the trailer. Oh- if you do see it, stay through the credits (as Ferrell's character on SNL, James Lipton, said 'It's a delight')!",8,2,5,12 July 2004
American Gangster," a big, intense American crime movie, led by stars and director in top form
","American Gangster seems on the surface to be what has been dubbed by some critics as 'the black Scarface.' As Ridley Scott's new film details, this isn't really the case aside from the point of 'rose up from nothing became something through crime', which could be said about almost every gangster film including the Godfather. Here Scott and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, without calling attention to it ala Paul Haggis, have made a film about class issues underneath the typical gangster-movie form. Even more than the Departed, one sees as the film goes on an environment of paradox: Frank Lucas was a low-life, a killer, a ruthless thug, and at the same time found time to take his mother to church every Sunday and gave out turkeys to folks in the neighborhood while providing them enough dope to die off in the process.In fact, Scarface has got nothing on Frank Lucas when it comes to moral complexity: here's a man who did rise up out of poverty, learned the stakes of gang life as a driver for the Harlem boss for fifteen years, and then after he died cut out the middle-man as an importer of the freshest product of heroin right out of Vietnam. Then through this there's a whole other level to American Gangster; Scott and Zaillian could have made it simply a saga of betrayals and investigation via Richie Roberts. But the side that one saw in Serpico is amplified here- it becomes all the more engrossing to see how the crooked cops and 'honest' gangster Lucas were linked together, which also leads to an ending that amps up the interest. Lucas didn't get out like Henry Hill, but a good man all the same? Probably not (he ended up in jail again, as the film doesn't point out).So there's a lot of story to explore, and Scott makes it one of the most invigorating, nostalgic (ironically speaking) New York crime films in years, as far as the storytelling goes. And like Heat, Scott gets a lot of mileage from his star power. Washington goes even deeper into the role of the villain than he did in Training Day- he plays him as classic family man, cold businessman, and charming man-of-the-community. He makes it so much his role that you can't imagine anyone else going down a Harlem street shooting a guy point blank in the head. And Crowe also adds some good subtlety to the piece, a flawed man with his family and someone who tries to keep his morality straight (the million dollars given in to the station) amidst total bully-crooks like Josh Brolin's 'special' detective. By the time the two stars finally sit down for one scene, it's on par with De Niro and Pacino.Why not a 10/10 or 4 stars? It is, despite a rightfully fleshed out narrative, with some unnecessary bits (Cuba Gooding Jr, what happened there?) on a two hour and forty minute picture. But Scott does make American Gangster gain momentum as it goes along and reaches a powerhouse climax that is first intense and bloody (it IS Scott after all), followed by a striking human angle. And it holds nothing on Scarface, at the end of it all, as far as being legitimately dramatic without the ham, as the actors and director click for most part on material that just needs to be told without any pretension- and with that dose of significance of real urban crime in the 1970s in NYC.",9,145,211,4 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," has a good mix of whimsy and pathos, an excellent Ferrell performance, if less than stellar overall
","I'd recommend Stranger Than Fiction, especially if you're a fan of its stars. It also speaks to a good career ahead for first-time screenwriter Zak Helm. That it also is that old, over-used statement- the parts more entertaining than the whole- is maybe in part attributable to an inherent structural flaw in the script. After I left the movie I did think about how a person's will may be dictated or not, or what really carries that man to do what he decides to do, or if he tries to do nothing at all (which Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell, does to no avail). Because the story itself is about contrivance, their is an ever-looming air of contrivance in the script too. It's hard to explain exactly, and Helm was wise to avoid certain pit-falls, such as really giving a 'logical' explanation to how the narrator's writing sticks into Crick's head in the first place, or that it might not just collapse once writer and 'character' meet. But there's still some things that I found a little troublesome- for example, does the narrator dictate the little things that Crick does, or would Crick just do them anyway? What I mean is, how much is determined by what is written or not. There is also the air of questioning where these characters are outside of their set spots in the screenplay- and Crick, albeit not without some interest is not really the kind of character I would think would make for a great subject for a book by a presumably well-renown, recluse author (played in the best way possible in the one-note terms by Emma Thompson).For the sake of Crick's central change from being very calculated, precisely so, early on, to becoming a man much more based on how he wants to live his life not based rigidly on structure- even in the structure of 'little did he know', which is kind of amusing as a writer myself- there is that sort of contrivance anyway. Yet at the same time, individual scenes are very well written though, and given fresh life by the cast. Ferrell here, of course, is showing much more of his talents than usual, at doing much more of a grounded, every-day kind of guy who has the extraordinary happen to him. He's always convincing in the part, even in scenes that are awkward or made to really pull up more of his talents than usual. That I would still have a very slight preference for his comedy roles and skills as a satirist/performer may be just subjective, though this- plus his underrated turn in Melinda & Melinda- goes to relay how he can play genuine just as well as silly and fearlessly stupid. Hoffman, as the literature professor who helps out Crick through his crisis at points, is also very good, and their scenes together were some of my favorite in the film. Gyllenhaal works well too as the romantic side for Crick's change in self.So really, it's a worthwhile trip into what was appropriately called by one critic as 'Charlie Kaufman-lite', as it goes to lengths to be an original work, but at the same time one can't help but know how things will turn out in the end, if only from the immense heap of circumstance given clairvoyance, or vice versa, and that it is, in the end, a work out of Hollywood. Marc Foster's direction does go for little odd touches to add to Helm's writing, such as numbers and lines and such on screen in fast fashion to show Crick's mind working in the form of his life early on. And the watch means probably as much as the gold watch did in Pulp Fiction in the sense of what it will lead to for the character. That it doesn't feel though completely satisfying in its sort of original send-up is understandable, but partly forgivable; it's the kind of work that gives talented actors some fun and variety, and there are at least a few truly laugh-out-loud funny moments.",7,3,7,14 November 2006
The Green Mile," A Great Film Experience
","The Green Mile is one of those films that makes you feel proud you went to the movies to see the picture.  Why?  Because The Green Mile has it all: Drama, Romance, Comedy, and everything else in a movie that makes it a masterpiece.  Especially the acting by Tom Hanks as the pleasent prison guard and more especially Michael Clarke Duncan as the miracle prisoner John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled the same)and he not only gives his best performance yet, he gives probably the best performance of the decade. Add that plus a great score, great story (three hours gives it time to expand) and great direction (by Frank Darabont) and you got a great film.",8,2,5,19 February 2000
The Reader," engaging and sad, perhaps too sad, with a weaker third act
","Maybe I should've read the book. Ironic that a film that has a crucial point being illiteracy should be seen by me, having not read the very, very highly acclaimed book it's based upon. I saw the film with my wife and mother, both of whom had read the book, and they claimed they had a more enjoyable experience (if that's the term used for a tragic tale of first love gone bad and/or strange in the long-term) as they could fill in whatever gaps were missing from what was, according to them, a faithful adaptation. Taking the film on its own terms, how it works in telling its story, it's certainly better than the stuff previous 'Oscar-baiter' from Stephen Daldry, the Hours. Certainly Kate Winslet helps every mili-second she's on-screen, and the fact that it's two movies, sort of, makes it interesting when things start to get a little detached.The first half, what could have made on its own an absorbing story of lust and obsession and hills and valleys in a relationship, is about a near-Last Tango set-up where after a mid-30s German woman (Winslet) in post WW2 Germany helps a 15 year old get home he comes back in some attraction, and soon they start an illicit affair kept pretty much to her (Hannah's) quarters. The big thing is reading to Hannah: she can't read or write, so 'kid' reads to her before and after (I'm surprised not during) their sexual endeavors. But, of course, the relationship turns sour since, frankly, the kid Michael gets interested in girls his own age and is screwed in the head over it... It screws with him still when this first sort of movie ends and the second one begins, which is when Michael is a little older, a law student, and watching Hannah on trial for war crimes she committed at Auschwitz.Sound like fun date stuff? Not exactly, though it may hit the spot for the couple looking for that love story where compromises are few and the consequences are plenty (i.e. if Michael comes forward during the trial with information that could help her a tiny bit, which he doesn't, what will that mean for Hannah who does not read or write and did not in fact write the letter she's accused of writing detailing what to do against prisoners). If there seems to be some kind of problem, and this is just a guesstimate from someone, again, not very familiar with the book, is that in two hours, even for something that's supposed to be a short read, is crammed in. We see a montage of Michael reading countless books on tape for Hannah while she's in jail. It's hard to feel any sympathy for her since, frankly, she's a war criminal in the worst possible way. But there is an identification with the boy who becomes a man, and the essential elements of pride and dignity and intelligence that are touched upon.At the same time it's also a pretty good love story, one that starts as hot and heavy and probably immature on one end and transforms into something that is kind of like making constant amends. It's maybe a little too polished at times- the musical score goes away at the mood as if it were Notes on a Scandal, which isn't quite right- and without Winslet or Fiennes or for his few minutes Bruno Ganz it doesn't work nearly as well. The Reader does make for some involving storytelling, of something not usually considered which is the conscience of law vs love or the power of words spoken and stories told when a life to oneself (like Hannah's) is worth nothing much at all. It doesn't leave you feeling very good inside, but you'll feel rewarded for the performances and at the least the reasonably hot sex scenes (it is Kate Winslet doing her nude/sex thing after all).",7,4,9,26 December 2008
Jaws," 'For $10,000 I'll give you the head... the tail... the whole damn thing.'
","I'd love to teach the screenplay of Jaws to a bunch of fresh-faced young'in film students, who may or may not have seen the film before (I got introduced to it at about the right age, 12 or 13, and watched it steadily over the years, including once in a marine biology class in high school - why I don't know, but it was an annual tradition for the teacher, funny especially that the film gets some things wrong biologically speaking but whatever). It's a script that thrives on character development and interaction, and shows that a three-act structure is not really a cut-and-dry thing.Actually what is so lovely about the film is how it's really a two-fer, a kind of prototype of what one might see Tarantino do later on with some of his films - From Dusk till Dawn, Django Unchained - where it's really two movies: first is the quasi-horror-mystery as to what this shark is, which shark ('THIS IS NOT A BOAT ACCIDENT!') and how the politicians - namely the Mayor (who has great hair btw), a spineless weasel who kinda, almost, sorta gets a sympathetic moment in the hospital ('My kids were on that beach too') if it wasn't so pathetic - screw things up. Spielberg, by proxy of a shark machine that didn't work so great, went for what would later become a (over-used?) staple of horror films, especially serial killer flicks, where *we* become the killer in a sense, floating around, looking for victims, and then BAM.The other movie is an adventure movie where the character hinted at in the first half - Surly Mr. Quint (and really, thanks to Robert Shaw, isn't it one of the two or three most 'something' characters in modern cinema? a 'Working-Class Hero' with a lot of layers and demons and a lack of AA sponsorship) - takes center stage as our other heroes, Brody and Hooper, are almost at his mercy, and yet help him and collaborate on this hunt.And what makes the film is that both films work unto themselves, and yet are all of a piece. In an odd way even though sharks ARE very important to the story - where else would we get the Indianapolis story without em - they could be hunting anything really. I don't mean to marginalize the location, the Orca boat, the sea-bound sense of what has to be done physically on the ship ('Know how to tie a sheep shank?' 'You didn't say how short you wanted it.' God this movie is quotable), but if they were out like, I don't know, hunting a mountain lion or a big bear, it would still be the same great characters and the same stakes of life-or-death as well as life-or-death for anyone else.I can't really think of a better man vs nature film, can you? Certainly not any without Murray Hamilton. or John Williams, who made such a score that you could put it on (like other classical Spielberg tracks) a classic-baroque music station on the radio and it'd fit completely in. Matter of fact, it's surprising the shark's theme- 'dun-un (repeat)' doesn't just come out of the shark's mouth!PS: the Shark was named 'Bruce' after Spielberg's lawyer. Guess when you need to take a BITE out of a contract, make sure your teeth are shot-glass sized, eh?",10,3,8,5 May 2000
Kingpin," One of the funniest comedies of the 90's
","Kingpin is a film that might not match up to the Farrelly Brothers masterpieces like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, but it comes close.  The movie stars Woody Harrelson as a once great bowling champ who's career is ended by an injury to his hand for which he must spend the rest of his life with a hook.  But then he finds a new kid, Amish, but promising bowling guy (Randy Quaid) and finds hope for a new future.  Sounds like the setup for a corny drama, but the Farrelly's take no wrong turns in delivering big belly laughs for the overall scope of the movie.  Harrelson, Quaid and even the seductress Vanessa Angel (you might remember her from TV's Weird Science) deliver good laughs, but it is two people who steal the show and make this film utterly hilarious- Bill Murray who gives a new meaning to the word comb-over, and Chris Elliot who gives one of the funniest moments in 90's comedy in a cameo.

Hancock," there are complaints to be had, but mostly it's a fun summer action movie
","Will Smith is a great star in Hollywood, and it's fun to see him in Hancock work his way with a character who's an 'a-hole' (don't call him that, by the way, that's the buzz word) for the first half and then starts to open up and not be so much one in the second half. If for no other reason to see the film it's for him and for people like Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron to show what potential they have with their talents; Theron especially reminds an audience every once in a while that she won an Oscar for a reason. And, it's also for the first half of the way through the 90 minute running time a wonderful dark comedy that takes itself seriously but also pokes fun at a superhero who doesn't give a flying f*** and bums around saving people while also drinking his ass off and destroying lots of property.But at some point when the writers decide to develop the mythology of the character, who is apparently somewhat God-like and is immortal under specific circumstances but also has 'another' like him (I won't say who, spoiler), and they don't give it enough time to really sink in after the somewhat 'twist' occurs 2/3 of the way through. And anything humorous in the first half is gone pretty much by near-movie's end, leaving it in the hands of Peter Berg, the director. This was the aspect of Hancock that grated down at me. Berg and his cameraman's style is to usually not bother with things like steadicams or dollys or a camera simply still on a tri-pod or other and to make everything hand-held and wobbly and oddly shot and (in the case of the hospital climax) just awfully lit and shot. It comes off as more-so amateurish than being intense or realistic, and it definitely doesn't fit the kind of movie it's meant to be placed in (i.e. JULY 4TH SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER, hello!) And yet, even with the problems I had, I wouldn't stop anyone from seeing Hancock, as a good way to kill an hour and a half and to enjoy some of Smith's best work to date. He's a charismatic and multi-faceted actor, but his star quality meshes well, and it's a performance that's worth every minute to see he's on screen for. If only the rest of the movie were as good as he and his co-stars.",6,3,6,3 July 2008
Kong: Skull Island," Kong Rocks - practically all of this does too; a sharp, smart, exciting blockbuster
","Though not without a few WTF moments - and not in the way that is fun but more head-scratching, like a couple of characters dying out of nowhere - this is the most entertaining monster movie since The Host and possibly from Hollywood since... well, the Jackson King Kong (though it also has some debt to Jurassic Park and, to a degree a friend reminded me after seeing the film, Aliens). Aside from what is in the movie in and of itself, which is plenty as an ironic and satirical blockbuster (at least up to a point, in small but enough doses), as a world-building enterprise it's spectacular, and is a step up from the previous entry in this new WB/Legendary 'Moster-Kaiiju-Verse', Godzilla.I think the difference between the two is simple but profound: Edwards was fascinated more with spectacle and the presence of Godzilla, but he wasn't so set on building human characters to connect with (except for Bryan Cranston, who was shamefully wasted after a promising start). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is all about characters, and even gives some time to people who should be nothing secondary ones (I know the complaints already coming, that there are too many, and that may be true - on a first viewing I was fine with it for the simple fact that the dialog given to these military runts and other scientist-types were either funny or clever enough. Everyone has charisma and characters who need to have chemistry (Hiddleston-Larson, or Larson and Kong) give it enough juice in that area.But more than that is that Kong himself is done right by the writers and filmmakers. Unlike in Godzilla as well, here we have a character who actually IS a character, someone who functions in the story, shows deeper wells of emotion (yes, a carry-over from the best of the 1933 and 2005 Kong movies is that Kong is vulnerable), and finds through non-verbal communication how to connect - or decidedly not, quite the opposite - with these Vietnam war hosts. He has goals and real motivations; while they are steeped in monster movie lore, it's sharp and exciting monster movie lore, and things are explained by John C. Reilly here and there (he's the 28-years-gone survivor of being left during WW2, a more innocent-yet-still-bloody time in US history, also with us vs some Asian menace), yet a lot is left to the imagination.How do these prehistoric-ish 'Skull Crawlers' come out from these blasts put out by these helicopters? Who knows? Who cares? The point is these giant lizard things are genuinely terrifying; there's some limited creativity in their designs, but what's exciting is that the direction is all about drawing out suspense. And the island itself has many surprises (there's one point where a creature is revealed as something you would thing you could sit on!) and also with the natives who are... just scenery, mostly, but at least the movie doesn't try to go too far into cultural insensitivity or anything. They're simply there and do what they can for the Reilly character over these many years; Reilly, by the way, scruffy and laughing often and happy even as he is totally terrified ('I've only been here 28 years,' he says at one point up against military/US egotism personified by Samuel L Jackson) is what Bryan Cranston was to Godzilla, only here there is much more and he's possibly the best human presence in the movie.How about the satire, if it is there? I think there's more that could be dissected with it being Vietnam, or more specifically in 1973 as Nixon is preparing for pulling out troops (of course that wouldn't be for a full two years later, but you get the idea). Jackson's Col Packard is trying to hide his anguish at having to 'abandon' this war (he can't bare to say defeat) so this other South-East conflict will do; it's Us vs Them and Us as usual not recognizing all of our might is insignificant when on their turf. It's not the sharpest commentary ever, but it's not without accident it's there either. The iconography is compelling as well: all of those helicopters, blasting away Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid' as these charges drop on the island - asking for it, in monster movie fashion (messing with nature, you fools!), but this time there's the added element of how soldiers and civilians act, and recognizing who is 'King' in the end.This is a spectacular good time at the movies, in case I didn't make that clear. All of the actors are doing excellent work, the kind that you would never get to see back when monster movies were in the realm of square B-movie territory. If anything this would be a splendid double feature with Jurassic Park (aside from the eye-roll at Jackson repeating a 'butts' line straight-faced, as if the movie would be in trouble unless he did it), as both involve charismatic, memorable actors and relatively decent supporting characters facing off against monsters that are from another time and place, with snappy dialog, and visual effects that are out of this world. And the climax - my Kong! Spinkle some 70's Vietnam-Rock icing and you got yourself a blockbuster cake of exceptional proportions.",8,40,82,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," adequate but dull, punctured by heart and awe
","Peter Jackson loves his excess. The man can't get enough - as not even a storyteller but as a spectacle-producer, a showman, he is like a starving kid at a Thanksgiving day buffet. This series is an indication of that, even if it's not all of his fault (it was originally two movies, maybe too much enough, until the Tolkien estate said it needed to be three movies - the studios, I'm sure, concurred). He and his team take what is essentially a children's book (The Hobbit, that is, which Tolkien wrote for his children initially years before LOTR) and make it into a 474 minute trilogy (credit time included), which means that a character like Bilbo Baggins, the little Hobbit-that-could who finds that he can be courageous and has the 'Right Stuff' as it were on an adventure, is a bit diminished in the epic scope and grandeur of what is really, in this case, about the dwarf Thorin Oakenshield and his quest to retake the castle of his father from the dragon, Smaug.The Battle of the Five Armies picks up as a cliffhanger from the previous film - a rather uber-dramatic one at that - with Smaug getting out of the castle and set to attack a town. He does, people die and try to escape, and one man (Luke Evans, one of the more sturdier heroes of the series) fires an arrow that somehow gets through and kills the beast. One may scoff at how the dragon is so easily destroyed after such a build up at the end of 'Desolation' (and that whole set piece, by the way, was one of the highlights of this trilogy). But this is merely the set up, as it was, up to a point, in the book: armies are converging to get that treasure in the castle/mountain, and Thorin won't give it up. So, thus, we get war. Lots of it. Like, most of the film.Thorin is an interesting character in that he is mostly defined by one trait here - until the script requires him to suddenly 'grow a pair' and lead his dwarfs out into battle with the rest of them - which is being a stubborn a-hole. Of course this can be chalked up to the 'dragon sickness', which could make him a victim in a sense. But Thorin throws this off so quickly and gets back into 'hero' mode that we're basically made to think that he can be sort of forgiven for being a stubborn a-hole for most of these films, this one most of all. And it's not that characters don't acknowledge it around him or call him out for it, far from it. But being that Thorin is more of the protagonist than Bilbo really is - or, if you must insist, co-protagonists - there isn't much to latch on to there.Not that Jackson and company don't have other story threads to go on, one of those carried over from the last film involving the romance between a dwarf and an elf (the latter played by Evangeline Lilly, who just has those eyes that make her a good actress, even when she's tasked to play soppy melodrama). I had forgotten how strongly these two felt for each other - or how much of a sandwiched-in sub-plot it was (not in the book, but why carp at this point) - so when they have to face their struggles here in battle, I only felt a modicum of emotion for them to get back together or say 'f-you' to the haters of the other dwarfs and/or the elves (i.e. stone-faced Lee Pace).Or maybe it was effective and I just didn't feel it, it may just be all on me for not really getting into this one, and certainly not as much as the previous two films (and those weren't much either). In 'Journey' and 'Smaug' at least I had a major set piece to hang on to - and the ones with Gollum and Smaug respectively are some of the great pieces of cinema in this whole Tolkien six-film run, to give Jackson/Cumberbatch/Serkis etc credit here. Is there one here? I'm not sure there is, despite the attack on the opening carrying over from the last film. That's merely the appetizer for the glut of CGI action that takes up MOST of the film here. And that would be fine... if it wasn't monotonous.And perhaps it's also on me to get in or not get into this action. But at a certain point, how many times can you see an orc trying to kill someone and it doesn't carry the simplistic weight of a video game. And this isn't even to knock video games, except to say that this is a typical, adequate, mostly well-put-together but still kind of soulless video game. Jackson puts in some of the bigger orcs with features that look cool, or a moment like Legolas jumping up stairs that are crumbling under him that are just funny (intentionally or not), and yet it's all just SO much and little of it sticks.The good news is there's a bit more Bilbo in the film, which gives more time to Martin Freeman who has nailed this character every step of the way and made him a joy to watch. He even makes latter-film scenes with Thorin count, at a point where I thought I didn't have much care for the character (not that Armitage doesn't try, but he's just... okay I guess). Overall, Battle of the Five Armies delivers TONS of effects, TONS of epic, sweeping shots of New Zealand (duh), TONS declarative moments and moments of humor that are hit or miss - and the always dependable likes of McKellan and Blanchett and so on. I just wish it left me with something more than feeling dulled by much of it.",6,10,18,21 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the final installment
","There's something about the Star Wars movies that have reached a grand culmination with Revenge of the Sith, the final installment of the prequel trilogy, and of Star Wars completely as a saga- the storytelling has reached a peak (much like with the other two masterpieces A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back). The visual effects, the sound, the music, all of the background elements are perfectly suited to tell the story. Of course this is how it also went with Episodes 1, 2 and 6, but this time George Lucas has reached a peak with the visual effects that has been increasing since Episode 1. Some of the visuals may be more formidable and concrete than others, however as a viewer I was completely wrapped in the story most of all, emotionally and even intellectually. And, of course, the challenge is to still make an entertaining, compelling film with what everyone who's seen a Star Wars movie knows is the climax- Anakin Skywalker turns into Darth Vader, and Skywalker offspring become separated at birth amid the end of the Jedi and the democracy of the republic. The journey is what counts, and it's a spectacular journey. I would even go as far to say that for one not expecting much from the ashes of the first two entries, this is not only one of the top pictures in the saga, it's also one of the best films of the year.I would dare not to reveal anything crucial to the story, except to say that the story takes shape of Anakin Skywalker (played with a crucial bravado and intensity by Hayden Christensen) and his path to the dark side. All of the supporting and key players- Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, terrific as always), Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, perhaps one of the key villains in recent movie history), Padme (Natalie Portman, a dependable force), and the usual cast of characters (i.e. R2-D2, C-3P0, Chewbacca)- come together to add more to the vision of the film than I could've guessed. One of the only flaws of the past two prequel episodes was the borderline edge of falling into melodrama by way of some of the dialog and characterizations. This time none of that is on the table, as it is indeed a space opera more than anything else. And, Lucas also connects with the Shakespearian qualities of his story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker, and by doing that the film reaches even more power.To put it another way, by way of the hypnotic, strange special f/x, the chilling score by John Williams, and the strengths of Lucas' storytelling talents that have been strongest throughout the films (even during the Jar-Jar and Ewok bits), Revenge of the Sith can keep one on the edge of their seat, almost catching for breath. Would this mean that a non-Star Wars fan could come to this movie and find it a good movie? It's hard to say, as it almost requires that you have seen one or two of the previous films. But should the film be suffice to feed the fans of the series, especially those who doubt Lucas' mind after 1 & 2? Absolutely- at the least for the battle/fight sequences, two of which I would rank up there with the first Death Star attack and Luke vs. Vader in 'Empire'. I guess it's part of that simplicity of a Saturday Matinée serial that Lucas wanted to capture that has made the saga so appealing to millions of people. This isn't exactly the most 'simple' film of the lot, and it's arguable whether the PG-13 rating was worthy from the content. But, as some would argue for Return of the King with the Lord of the Rings, 'Sith' does what is practically has to do- take the story full-circle and give the people a good show, while at the same time making Star Wars, as one big movie, feel all the greater.",9,13,44,19 May 2005
Ray," some good acting, great music, an all-too shoddy script
","The more I watch Ray- it plays a lot on the HBO channels on TV- the more I get the sense that the film could've been better than what was deserved. Taylor Hackford's direction is slick at times, and has a decent hand-held quality, but at times its all for things all too typical in a musician's life ala biography movie. Hackford puts through a non-linear structure in the story, but it doesn't really work to make a real dramatic advantage. Hackford puts in scenes from Ray Charles's childhood into moments that pump up the melodrama (if that's the right word) into being too manipulative for its own good. There are also elements in Charles's childhood that could've been used better for the sake of the story, to help make it clearer about what drove Charles to his demons. 2005's film Walk the Line, not to make too close a comparison, dealt with the subject matter straight on. The film Ray juggles with its subjects over the course of 1948 to the late 1960's with almost too much to show.And, in a way, the film is watchable despite its flaws in the structure and repetitiveness (for a good chunk of the film its really just 'Ray takes junk, Ray cheats on his wife, Ray makes hits, Ray takes junk, Ray has a flashback, etc'). Ray Charles's music is remarkable, inspiring, and stands against music of today as being almost good for the soul even as early on it was called 'devil's music' (i.e. combining blues and gospel, which took some getting used to for people in the 50's). There's rarely a song of his, at least shown in the film, that isn't worth listening to, as it crosses racial divides (and there's a mention of that in the film, nothing too big) bringing the power and soul of his music for everyone (and not just his R&B stuff but even his more country-type music). At the least, the musical performance scenes are worth checking out the movie alone.There's also a certain complexity- or lack thereof- in Jamie Foxx's portrayal. The problem also lies on the bordering of just an imitation of Charles versus a performance. Sometimes Foxx channels in and just does a good acting job, but there are perhaps too many moments and scenes where its too much bordering on parody. I don't meant to downplay it too much; he does do what he can with the material, and apparently prepared extensively for his role by being around Charles and playing the piano for real. There is talent in his work in the film, but it sometimes can't over-come the direction or script. For example, the last twenty minutes or so of the film are a mess; a 'trippy' kind of sequence showing Charles kicking junk, followed by a symbolic forgiving of Charles with his mother. This is just poor film-making to me, as a filmmaker running out of a better way to make a catharsis. That the film has to stop at the point it does doesn't leave much room for other options.I don't deny there is potential in the film, that the music alone makes it worth seeing at least one (if your already a fan for sure, but even if not the music may turn you on to some of his lesser heard recordings), and that there are some impressive acting scenes (Regina King is terrific in her scenes, for example). But there is too much left unexplained, and not for the good of ambiguity's sake, and over-length tends to creep in on it too. It's the kind of film I end up watching anyway now on TV, as its an 'easy' film to watch, however not with the sort of complexity that could've been put into the story.",6,2,6,14 January 2006
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," the Dwarfs steal the show, but there's much to see in this ground-breaker of cinema
","To call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a classic goes without saying that practically everyone has called it such. It is a great film, but there are certain factors that make it so, and without them the film could've gone the other way and become important more for its technical breakthrough(s) than for the content. The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's. This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so). It's tempting to say which are my favorite, or whom I got the most enjoyment out of. There would be three, two for more obvious reasons, one for subtle ones.Dopey, who is almost a perfect re-incarnation (in Disney Dwarf form of course) of Harpo Marx- he's a lovable idiot, with barely two sounds in the course of the film, who (and I hate to sound sappy) brings out the laughing kid in anyone. Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness: the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching. In the new century studios move away from hand-drawn animated films, but it's a good idea to look back to the early Disney films, if not for just nostalgia (or to watch with your kids) to get a sense of the experimentation, the purity of it. It remains one of only several animated films, from any country or style, to have the crucial elements come together- music, voice-talent, usage of colors, and cinematography.",10,13,13,7 August 2005
The Lion King," The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen
","The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++",10,421,498,1 January 2000
Bring It On," Ok, terrific
","(Possible spoilers, references to other things also)I know what I am about to review may not be for everyone, I'm sure that plenty of air-headed girls will think this film is a Citizen Kane for the 21st century, but I am speaking for myself and, or, anyone with a partially functioning brain.  This film, uh, uh, sorta SUCKED.  There are plenty of things in this film to show how it could've been better, for instance, they could've made a right instead of a wrong to maybe make this a good satire like Election.  But, in the end, it turns out to be a mutation making the ninja turtles look like Steve Forbes (although I'm not sure if he's human either).  It is a un-needed cross of nickelodeon marketing to kids (so more will see a PG-13 movie) while having dialogue and things in it better left in American Pie.  Which is unfair, because films like American Pie, Election and even South Park, keep with stuff that might be ok for kids (I think) while not being censored.  Well, enough of that, I had enough of that with Coyote Ugly.  Anyway, The plot surrounds a 5-time champion cheerleading tem the Torros (led by a talented yet misused Kirsten Dunst) who have just found out by no fault of they're own that there cheers are actuallt rip-offs of a black team's (another case of the white stealing from the blacks in a hidden message). Some things happen though to help out the Torros, including the hiring of an illegal choreographer (and not getting any punishment at all) and some other dumb plot lines.  While the dancing is somewhat entertaining, the story to back it up smells more than a indian cabbie driving for 72 hours straight. Wacthing this film, and getting dumber and dumber comedy along the way, i yearned for some good things to come out, and nothing came.  Which is why this might seem good to some (mainly the hot bodied and no-brained cheerleaders whbo try to have a film to life connection) but others should beware like a dog in heat.

Inception," 'Take a leap of faith' - not hard to do here
","I'm sure I'll revisit Inception, sooner rather than later. Christopher Nolan's film has its ambitions, oh sure to be sure. But when one looks at what he is really trying to accomplish here, it's to tell a story and with verve, originality (or at least taking solid cinematic forms and archetypes and using them originally), and a point of view that is astonishing. I still have scenes and images, performances and moments, shots and details of the plot (and a kick-ass final shot especially) rolling around in my head, and I don't want them to go away. Even things about the film that I should find flawed, such as a little clunky exposition and some edits that go by lightning fast work because of what does count: we care about what happens to these characters, or at least Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), and whether or not they'll achieve this 'mission' of putting an idea in someone's head.To explain all of the finer mechanics of the plot... just go to wikipedia, or IMDb's plot synopsis. I'll just say for here that the film takes its own creation of science-fiction variety seriously. And seriously enough to take jaded moviegoers of the cineplex variety along for the ride. It's kind of like a heist plot, though not really, in that 'idea' thieves- people who use dreams, shared via inter-connecting tubes (like the Matrix only more complex)- are recruited by Saito (Ken Watanabe), a big businessman of some sort to plant an idea in someone's head, or 'inception', which has not been done except for once when Cobb did it to a certain someone (he won't mention why, for a big reveal in the last act, though not a twist). That's really what you need to know - that and Ariadne (Ellen Page) will act as the audience in a sense to keep exposition going... sometimes too much on a first viewing.And yet, for all of the characters standing around explaining things, which should be (and is) a big no-no in movies (SHOW don't TELL, remember), it can work here because a) it is such a complex concept, considering all of the calculations of time, as well as the 'rules' of sort, which are laid out so well that nothing can be too confusing for anyone, even if one wanted to, and b) the acting is so good in doing it. There is genuine emotion as well, which is something that some of the so-so or negative reviews find is lacking here (there are a handful out there if you'd believe it Nolan-heads). I say simply that if you don't find emotion during those scenes between DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard, who used such a one-dimensional character to her total advantage here and steals all of her scenes with a beautiful face and haunting delivery- then, well, maybe you got the wrong movie.Sure, there's lots of pyrotechnics and big gun battles, but they work for the sake of this story and the circumstances too. I was worried they wouldn't, that things might be too rigid in the sense of it being dreams, why are there all of these guns and violence and whatnot. But, for me, it ended up making much more sense, in a non-sensible 'Hollywood Movie' way, watching it unfold within the rules. It is much more sci- fi-thriller than a David Lynch surrealist trip anyhow, and on Nolan's terms he bases his own sense of lucid dream logic. I also really liked how the stakes were so high for the characters in dreams: if you die in a dream, for example, what if you don't wake up, but end up in a kind of dream limbo, or something bizarre like that? How do these levels affect you if you're injured or dying? This is not as simplified as in the Matrix, albeit with less 'tells' than showing it happen. Aw hell, who cares? This is creative summer entertainment on one hand, and a brainy-emotionally-psychologically engaging story with a melancholy core. When it gets thrilling, it thrills (hallway fight, anyone), and when it needs to move, it does so, or when it needs to provide little 'ooh' visual wonders like Joseph Gordon Levitt floating along and doing his part in the time-frame, Nolan comes up with wonders there too. It shouldn't require a repeat viewing, yet I do want to go back again, not to have things re-explained to me, which is unnecessary, but to revisit the characters, the multi-layered (literally) story structure, and the intensity of the direction. It's a helluva trip through the 'architecture of the mind', and a very fine return to form to the 'early' sort of mind-f***er movies Nolan's made in the past.",8,14,38,16 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," (Reading Dickens: LOL)
","(This is less a traditional review than some scattered thoughts):First thought/complaint: How in god's name are they out there in what is supposed to be cold and sub-zero enough to give everyone 'exposure' for so long in just regular jackets and coats? Come on, Kenny my man, do better than that. Second thought: while the best Agatha Christie movie of this decade still is and will likely remain The Hateful Eight, this is engaging, dramatic and full of robust performances (Johnny Depp hasn't been this good/sleazy in a decade, even as he has a relatively small role, luckily it's not the size but the keyness of it). It actually helped that I hadn't seen another version of this story - yes, shame on me for not seeing the Lumet one, I'll get on it soon - and the ending was sadder than I expected, which is good. Branaugh keeps his audience on his toes and there isn't a false note in the performances.Third thought: This is not directorially up to par with Henry V and Hamlet, but I'm glad to see Branaugh still has it in in him to make a film full of vitality and visual ideas that are a little wild and a little of the usual (black and white flashbacks, really?) But where it counts, the movie is fully involving and the story shines however you cut it - in that way I'd rank this alongside something like the recent Great Gatsby adaptation: as long as you really get the goods right, and don't go TOO crazy stylistically, what works will shine through (also I mean, Pfeiffer, Dafoe, Cruz, even Josh goddamn Gad are stand-outs, and Ridley's fine too though now she just like has to do a movie where she and Kiera Knightley are sisters, right, like that has to happen now contractually).Oh, and the CGi... eh.... But my positives outweigh the negatives here. Mostly. It's a wonderful whodunit story that kept me on my toes and had a procedural tone that kept me wholly invested. Not to mention, naturally, that giant mustache that is like a mustache that grew a mustache - or, more to the point, the Human Stachipede.",7,5,12,12 November 2017
Defiance," surviving the holocaust in slick Hollywood style with occasional power
","If you want some part of the world or little story of historical significance blown up to heights of melodrama and typical performance heights that emphasize gobs of emoting in some difficult (but conventional) situations, Edward Zwick is your man. He's not a bad filmmaker, and if anything he's very suited to tell this sort of feel-good/sort-of-feel-bad movie about Jews who band together in the woods to survive with hundreds of other local Polish Jews. The bond between the three brothers in the story (Daniel Craig, Liev Schrieber, Jamie Bell) is one of the more fascinating parts of the picture, as are the actors performances to greater or lessor degrees. Their varying methods and ways of going about the business of survival and revenge are the most significant thing to keep track of: one, Craig, wants to keep this community of Jewish refugees together and keep out of vengeance, another, Schreiber, wants only to get Nazi blood, and another, Bell, falls for the nice girl and becomes a leader later on in the film.Significant because, frankly, it's one of the only things in the picture that comes across with conviction and certainty that doesn't feel like a checklist (save, of course, for that 'twist' ending where Zus comes to the aide of Tuvia that has been done in more movies than I can think of, however minorly rousing it is). Because we're in this Bielski resistance camp for the bulk of the picture the drama focuses on little things, little occurrences and strife and the power games between other members in the group (or one member) as opposed to what the film appears to be in the trailer as a riveting action movie. The sad thing is whenever there's action, with a couple of exceptions like a simple revenge killing early in the story by Tuvia, it's filmed in that dreadful whiplash framework where the camera is going up and around and it's all in this cheesy slow-motion; it's either that or the now oft-used since Saving Private Ryan 'seeing-things-in-slow-motion-while-thirty-seconds-deaf' moment with Tuvia. What drama there is around this should be more riveting but comes down to details that don't have ultimately much bearing on the plot (such as a pregnancy), when it should be squarely about the bare-bones nature of survival in the woods in the winter. There's some of that, which is all well and good, but not enough, and certainly not with the kind of daring that these real people being depicted deserve.Some terrific performances, as usual in a Zwick production (the kind that are begging for recognition at awards season but never really get to the top of the pops), and some bits that made me feel happy (i.e. the woman confronted by the wolf). It's also too long, too one note and an ending that feels too easily of the up-note. Defiance is another in a stretch of holocaust/WW2 set films that have been (un)intentionally flooding theaters recently, from indie (Adam Resurrected) to big-budget Hollywood (Valkyrie). This is neither the best nor the worst; I imagine those wanting a lesser dosage of Craig as a bad-ass Jew after his much better turn in Munich may look here.",6,3,7,18 January 2009
Lord of War," some brilliant spots among a few flaws in the script, most of 'Lord of War' crackles with interest
","Lord of War is a film that inspires the historical, almost documentation-like, interest (via a constant voice-over) in a similar way like with Demme's Blow, only here used far more frequently, for better &/or for worse. Nicolas Cage, at times, brings more fascination to the film for a viewer with his narration than does his performance, as his character Yuri Olyev, gun traffic man extraordinaire, tells his first-hand story of the past twenty years. Not that his own story isn't gripping at times to watch, and sardonically funny, but there is something about just hearing Cage's voice, as opposed to hearing it alongside his physical performance (not always top notch, here better than most), and writer/director Andrew Niccol collides his panache with usually incisive and ambitious direction with the narrative.If I could really point out the parts that I thought were keeping Lord of War from being a better movie, even a great one, I would, but it's just certain things sometimes left un-said (maybe for the better of the story, or Yuri's history), or un-tied, or tiny patches of dialog that just don't work for me at times. However, this may be not much of an issue with many moviegoers; Niccol, who's best work to date for me (and I haven't seen Gattaca yet so it's an inconclusive statement) was his script for the Truman Show, which like here takes the right jabs at societies gaping flaws in human nature. Yuri is a terrible man, but he is honest about his dishonesty (again, like Blow), and Cage seems to understand that just as much as Niccol, and while its not his best tortured soul performance (that would go to Bringing Out the Dead), he brings the right amount of humanity that the character needs. There is also a good performance in Jared Leto, and some standard, dependable fare from Ethan Hawke. But performances aside, the juiciest bits in the film (like an un-scheduled landing on a road in Africa, both amusing and horrifying; Cage's trips to Liberia) make it really worthwhile to see in the end, despite a lot thrown in the way of the audience. Perhaps that is one other flaw for me, is that there is so much given to the audience in way of learning about trafficking, as well as Yuri's story, its slightly over-loaded. The parts, in the end, are probably far greater than the whole.However, in a time when parts in films are not even good let alone great, it makes Lord of War a semi-important film for its time. It's a character study as well as a history, a romance as well as a thriller, and a comedy as well as a dark drama. As Hawke's character says to Yuri, 'you know, I'd tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there', sums it up for me.",8,1,9,24 September 2005
Sherlock Holmes," a rollicking good time with a sophisticated blockbuster by Ritchie & company
","Sherlock Holmes has been done and revisited and re-baked so many times one wonder what else could be done with it (my first exposure wasn't even to Holmes directly but through Disney's Great Mouse Detective). So it was about time, I suppose, that Hollywood would tackle this as any other franchise and make it into a big smashing action movie... which sounds wrong, of course, as Holmes and Watson's adventures aren't meant to have super elaborate action set pieces or fights, and are more about the figuring-out of things and Holmes' dry wit and frustrating manner as a cocaine addict and eccentric personality. But luckily Guy Ritchie, making his first real step into a big studio situation (not his crime movies or misguided Madonna-inspired pics) is a success on a basic level: he gets audiences interested in the Sherlock Holmes detective story first, as well as the rapport between Holmes and Watson, and then lays in his own touches to the material.It's another of those stories that, oddly enough like Great Mouse Detective, is as simple a plan as a villain's plot could get: take over England. In this case we have Lord Blackwood (nefariously cold performance from Mark Strong), who it would appear has been practicing dark magic, and has killed five people. He's hanged, but it also appears that he has risen from the grave and puts forth a dastardly plot to 'change the course of the world', as a villain like him would put it so bluntly, and it's up to Holmes to stop him. While figuring out what's going on in the story, the detective work of it all, is fascinating, it's not entirely the true draw of the film. If there's any invention in the plot it's in the ways that Blackwood uses confounded technology from a turn of the 20th century period that works on a level that's fresh for 2009 audiences.No, it's Robert Downey Jr and, also, Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, watching them on screen interacting with each other, interacting with others, and figuring out what's going to happen next (mostly this is Holmes, and nine times out of them he figures it out in an instant and spends most of his time explaining it away, accompanied by visuals), that makes it most compelling. Downey couldn't be more equipped to play a character like this, and like Iron Man it's a character that has more nuance and more going on under the surface than we might think looking at him. There's snark, there's sarcasm, there's a bad-ass bravura and a sense of entitlement to both characters, but in Holmes we see Downey (minus the coke habit of the original Doyle creation for a PG-13 rated film) tackle this iconic figure with the intelligence and grace found in previous versions, but his own spin on it as well. And Law is up to the challenge of Watson, even if, arguably, the roles could be reversed for the stars and played just as well.The action set-pieces are good... not always terribly original (oh, big guy vs. normal sized guy, haven't seen that before), and the final confrontation on the scaffolding of the bridge may go on a tad too long with the exposition. But all in all Ritchie gives a lot of the fights and action real excitement and energy; my favorite was Holmes, in an act of clairvoyance for the audience's sake, shows what he'll do in slow-motion and narration to an opponent in a bare-knuckle brawl, and then just does it in regular-speed film. It's a creative angle on it without going too predictable. Oh, and did I mention the music is just about perfect here? Listening to the few songs, and most notably the old-time charged Hans Zimmer score, adds pep and inspiration to a lot of scenes, the twang of the guitar or violins and other instruments usual to find in a blockbuster, but a welcome treat.Sherlock Holmes is fun times, a kind of one-shot graphic novel turned into a movie that deviates from prior times with the books and stories, and still works as entertainment. It's not high-art. It's Robert Downey Jr. smoking a pipe, looking joyfully mad, and a stylish (and satisfying) revamp on Victorian-era London. 7.5/10",7,1,3,27 December 2009
The Waterboy," Sandler's best since Billy Madison
","I really liked the Waterboy.  It was crude, raw, and utterly funny.  Adam Sandler gives his funniest yet since his 1995 cult hit Billy Madison.  In this feel good movie, Sandler plays a dumb waterboy who gets on a football team and becomes a damn good tackler.  Everything in this film is funny, from beginning to end.  Henry Winkler has his best in years as a down on his luck coach and Kathy Bates is Dead Pan funny as mama.  Great all around. A+",6,29,47,30 April 2000
WALL·E," adorable and haunting, delightful, joyous, and ultimately funny
","I never thought I'd say this but... WALL*E is better than Toy Story. This might not seem like such a high claim given how many other wonderful movies from PIXAR have come out over the past 13 years, particularly the ones by Brad Bird (Incredibles and Ratatouille). But since Toy Story blew open the front door for CGI animation, and stood as the pinnacle of awesome, great entertainment and film-making, I wasn't sure if anything could top it. WALL*E does by far, and then some; I'd even say that this is probably the best Disney movie that, technically, they never made. For years Disney, the studio joined at the hip (and now, practically, submissive to whatever PIXAR wants in animation), didn't want to do WALL*E, as it was a somewhat bleak science fiction movie with 3/4 of the movie not featuring any distinct human dialog at all. And, no cute animals talking either; the closest we get here is a cockroach, and, thankfully, we only get cute chirps and squees of joy.It was a risk, but after waiting for so long to make it, Andrew Stanton has what critics have been dubbing the 'M' word: masterpiece. It works on the levels that satisfy simply for the levels of a comedy. WALL*E the character is one of those classic character straight out of Disney movies that you don't see ever done this well, or at least this purely: he's wholesome, innocent, curious, lovable and loving to the robot that comes to earth, Eva, looking for any signs of life, and we want to cheer for him every step of the way. It's a quasi-Chaplin character, if Chaplin were obsessed with a video of an old 1950s musical (somehow, in the post-apocalyptic world of 2700, still intact), and only wants to hold Eva's darling hand, despite getting into mishap after mishap and eventually leading to his trip out into space. No quirk of behavior, no amazingly adorable physical bit of comedy is unturned, and every one works, even ones that you don't see coming.At the same time, it also works as a science fiction parable, one that works splendidly for our times without pushing it down our throats. Its message is one that is general, which is why when poised around satirical overtones on the AXIOM ship- where WALL*E finds Eva bringing a plant to the ship's captain and then stopped by a HAL-9000 type of computer- it's enriched by a context we all know very well. Taking care of the planet and taking care of ourselves physically are points that are put forth without being preachy, and there's lots of good humor to go with that too (the moment when the pudgy captain finally walks, put to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is one of the funniest damn things I've ever seen). AND, it's also an incredibly touching love story to boot; two robots who can't quite seem to get together until one sees how much the other cares for the other. The simplicity here, too, is awe-inspiring, and like a silent film brings on the tear-ducts in the final moments of suspense.So, it's a superb comedy, a fully-realized and somewhat original science fiction story (then again what is original entirely), and the best date movie of the summer. On top of this, director Andrew Stanton and the vast PIXAR team have gone once again another leap forward with their technological skills for all use in telling the story. I don't care who you are, adult, child, old dude in a wheelchair, this is top-notch film-making, some of the finest one will see in this new decade of the 21st century. While points ahead to the future of animated movies, it doesn't stop or go corrupt in basic film-making. For those who would be wary of a movie with very little dialog, don't fret: there's enough 'pure' cinema here to suffice. It left me speechless, in-between laughing and crying and whatnot.

The Good Shepherd," has the makings of something greater, but it's too under-stated and secretive to really let a viewer in
","I really wanted to love the Good Shepherd, but maybe like the main character of Edward Wilson it's a hard one to love even if one can admire/respect it in some ways. It's a film cluttered by being both too long and too short, where the pace feels plodding at times and with some unnecessary beats, and at the same time not developing quite enough on the points that could be more interesting. It's one of those films about a government agency (in this case it's inception) that I ended up liking more for what good things I saw than for the overall whole bang of the picture. I do have to give credit where it's due, however. Matt Damon, on a roll it seems after Syriana and the Departed, is at his most under-stated (and rightfully so, probably taking cues from Robert De Niro, a man who has under-stated sometimes as his bread & butter) in the role of Wilson, a man who sacrifices his own sense of truth for the honor of protecting the country, even if it means putting his own family into complete doubt about his character.Psychologically I was always in tune with what was going on, and like last year's Munich there's a good sense of demystification that goes on with how an organization is run/starts up. And De Niro has assembled such a top-notch cast it's hard to complain on that front (with great character actors like John Tuturro, Michael Gambon, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Joe Pesci). What ended up tugging me away from seeing this as a better film was the storytelling, or the sort of pull from really feeling connected with the material. Things diverge around in sub-plots, and sometimes it's gripping (like the torture scene with the Russian where LSD is used to try and reveal his name), but sometimes not so much, as with Wilson's affair with another woman. This side of it is a little murky for me- Angelina Jolie's character has an interesting start, with her practically jumping all over him when they meet, and once they marry and have a kid she becomes the dour note of his existence, even as he loves his son. I would've liked to have seen more about her, why she decided to be with him in the first place aside from the ultra-ambiguous 'you look like husband material' line. It's also saddening, on the character-actor front, to see Joe Pesci (who hasn't acted in 8 years) in such a thankless part; I thought he would be there for more scenes, but it seemed like De Niro added him in as an afterthought.What is compelling, however, does show De Niro as a very smart director with enough class to not spoon-feed the audience 'things' that happen. It's got a main part to it that is worthwhile to tell, which is Wilson's connection to his son, and Wilson's connection to a Russian counterpart to his CIA operative as a Russian operative nicknamed Ulysses (there's one scene I love that involved a violin, I won't say which). A lot of what the Good Shepherd brings makes for some good talk after it ends, but more so about what didn't work then what did. It has the makings to be one of the finest epics ever made in this decade, but sometimes even someone like Damon almost becomes TOO understated in his part- bordering on wooden- in being secret to the point of inertia. In the end, the Good Shepherd gives enough to subvert the spy film specifically on choices of mood and character, but it's also confused in how it decides to spend its time getting to the story that really counts.",7,8,13,27 December 2006
Finding Dory," Pixar does what it does, and they shine often
","Hey, sometimes a sequel that's very good is good enough. That may be the take-away to have with Finding Dory, which follows up on Finding Nemo 13 years after that film introduced children and adults around the world to Marlin, Dory, Nemo and the other sea-bound characters (though the events take place about a year after the start of the first story). Sometimes a sequel is hard to pull off, even (especially) if it's by the same group involved in pulling off wonders with the first one. What expectations will we have? Can the jokes all work if there's no surprise anymore to things like Dory's short-term memory loss or her catch phrase 'just keep swimming' diddy or her whale-speak? As it turns out the people at Pixar are high-functioning geniuses because they do make us care about Dory, who was a heartfelt but ultimately comic foil (sometimes a helpful one) in the first story), as someone who has full agency for her own tale and in this it's... finding her family, of course.It's familiar, yes, we've seen this before. Maybe a lot of kids coming to see this - and who knows if you may take them to it as one of their first movies ever - won't see it as tired or hackneyed as something adults have seen many times. It all depends on the ingredients the filmmakers put into the story that counts. Here Dory finds herself coming to California at a marine park full of fish in aquariums (and helpfully the voice of Sigourney Weaver, no really it's her, is there to welcome everyone to the park and she becomes in a funny way like some minor God in this realm to the fish), and her mission is simple: find her parents and use the clues dug deep in her scattered long-term memory to find them, with the help of some new under-water friends like Hank the octopus (well, septupus since he has seven limbs, one is lost but hey Ed O'Neill), a near-sighted whale-shark (Kaitlin Olson) and a beluga whale (Ty Burr).The filmmakers never pass up a chance for comedy, and I'd say nine times out of ten they're successful with big laughs for the audience as a whole. Whether the kids will be laughing at some things more than the adults, and visa-versa (I don't think they give a darn or even know who Weaver is, for example), but once again applause must be given to how deftly Stanton and his writing team balance out major comic-peril and behavior related comedy with some dark-sad moments too. And Dory, again, makes for an unlikely compelling protagonist. It seems odd to make her the hero of a story as someone who can't remember anything - it worked in Memento but that was a noir with tattoos of memories written on someone's damn skin - since in order to have forward momentum you need to remember things that can take you from A to B to C. Some of the fish friends help, and sometimes those conveniently times long-term memory flashes (including an incredibly cute little Dory by the way) help her along.If I feel at all hard on the film, which by the way keeps consistent with the first movie's gorgeously rendered sea world of creatures and environments and small details that make up everything here and yet is stronger than what was available in 2003, it's because Pixar continues to set the bar so high for themselves. If you're the Picasso or Van Gogh of your medium, then as much at it may not be fair to judge the still wonderful works as flawed it's still something to point out (not that this movie doesn't try harder or swing for the fences more than the majority of kids animated fare out there, with the exception of Disney animation studios).If there were two main issues, aside from little pieces of familiarity that stuck out (or the occasional gag that didn't work for me, like the, uh, mentally challenged seal character, hey guys, if you already have an 'off' bird character, don't get greedy with two), it's these: Nemo and Marlin are in the story and are supporting characters which is fine except they aren't really given much to do, and while their story was told in the first movie aside from comic peril situations (albeit well times and executed with Brooks always game in the role) it doesn't add much to the story that's here. The other is the third act reaches too far into upping the ante moment to moment and there's an air of anti-climax since, well, the real emotional climax is already found, and you can sort of guess where that's coming too (also by this point Dory's memory loss is not really taken as much into account story-wise as it could/should be).And yet Finding Dory is a charmer and a full delight because the filmmakers are sincere with how they present this story and is one of the must-sees of the summer. To put it another way, it is great, just flawed-great if that makes sense and the 3rd best Pixar sequel for what it's worth.",8,4,19,17 June 2016
Stalag 17," the perennial 'feel-good' American POW movie
","Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 relies on folds of comedy and a cynical attitude to elevate a story that seems out of a crime novel. Here we have a cast of characters, and the undercurrent is 'who's the rat?' in a bunker as the secrets shuffled around (i.e. that there's a tunnel for escape) and the Germans know right away. There's fun in that, and in being able to 2nd guess who the informant really is- at one point I thought the old adage 'it's the quiet ones you got to watch' would come forward- but Wilder is brilliant at transforming this as some solid suspense and dramatic tension while ALSO making a really snappy (sometimes) dark comedy. It's a movie about personality, despite the plot being somewhat important, and with the actors themselves delivering a lot for the characters' sakes.William Holden is the first given attribute as the star, playing the sort who, for a conventional movie-goer audience, seems easy to peg: too full of himself, sneaky, has the motive to be the informant. But as the layers come into focus, he's more than meets the eye, and Holden (against his better instincts, as he didn't want the role originally) fills it in with his subtle swagger and great sarcastic touch carried over from Sunset Blvd. Then there's Otto Premminger, a big surprise as he is mostly known as a director, as the Commandant, taking up and stealing every scene he's in (only Erich von Stroheim in Grand Illusion beats him out as tour-de-force Commandants). Then there's supporting work from the desperate 'clowns' (Robert Strauss's Betty Grable obsessed Animal and Harvey Lembeck's Shapiro), and the cool Don Talyer in a turn as Dunbar. They're all at their best.While it almost appears to be more entertaining than it perhaps should- considering, as Cookie's opening narration says, movies about the army have been glamorized and this story is different- it's kind of like the Hollywood 50s answer to something like A Man Escaped. Bresson's film is cold and detached and immediate in dramatic impact, while Stalag 17 wants to be a big hit. There's a lot of humor, some unexpected, some that are meant to be big laughs (i.e. Animal and Shapiro's scheme to get into the Russian prison), and they all connect. It's simply a really entertaining movie that has transcended its period, thanks to Wilder's faith in (and more than likely proponent of) an ironic, witty sensibility to otherwise dark and gloomy cinematic terrain.",10,26,32,9 April 2008
Arrival," a short review for a very good movie you all should see
","1) I wonder what China will make of this movie.2) I hope that cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year and Selma) takes it as a high compliment that I thought the whole time watching this 'damn, Roger Deakins, you're outdoing yourself here!' (thinking this was his 3rd collaboration with Villeneuve) 3) Amy Adams is incredible, some of her best work yet, even if so much of it is based around her giant blue eyes. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker also give strong supporting work (and hey, Michael Stuhlbarg too while we're at it, and even a particular Chinese actor gets a great scene), so a well-rounded cast surrounds her.4) I went in expecting Close Encounters and got a... reverse version Solaris I guess (and I mean Soberberh's Solaris). This is a welcome surprise and one I suspect a lot of viewers will embrace, though some may leave confused.This is very good stuff, bordering on great, and it warrants a rewatch, though the one mark I'd say against is that it's more effective intellectually than emotionally. The ending is wonderful, but it's so much slipping around in time that you lose the thread emotionally. But Arrival is ultimately made as a film as a rebuke to the countless 'sci-fi' spectacles that are an excuse for showing off militarism and destruction. If anything this is a really strong movie to watch considering this election week: here's what happens when communication is actually engaged, and when governments engaging in aggressive action without trying to see the 'other', literally, and it's a sobering message right now.",9,13,38,10 November 2016
The Terminal," a good piece of humanist comedy, nothing more, nothing less
","The Terminal is sort of like a a Frank Capra tale spun into 21st century America, with it a sort of divide between the naive innocence of ordinary men, and the cynicism of the outside world. It also is akin to E.T. as being about an outsider who comes into a strange situation, gets befriended, but in reality is really all on his own on his quest. There is a sweetness to the film that works well, even when all plausibility at times goes right out the window in return to try and make shamelessly entertaining product. Steven Spielberg here has a film that is meant, in a way, as THE film for airline movies, as it can be geared for kids and adults, though like airplanes its not always the best experience.Tom Hanks is genuine for a lot of the performance, and at least a little fascinating, as Viktor Navorski, a refugee from a country made up for the sake of the film (though, apparently, his accent is for real). He's stuck in the airport, not able to leave into New York City or back to war-torn home. So, he sticks around, he meets the janitor, he runs into a emotionally weary flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones, not the best she's done but cute enough), and gets to become familiar company around the huge terminal. It's a huge place, with adversiting that almost makes it like a insular Times Square. During this Viktor goes from befriending the workers, to befriending the attendant, which leads to some romantic interest- or maybe not. Who knows with Viktor's true intentions to stick around for his chance to get into New York City. The reason he ends up telling is, actually, one of the most touching moments in the film, maybe even in the better of Spielberg films.This isn't, however, overall anything great in the filmmaker's cannon. Maybe not a 'minor' work, but it's often with too much whimsey. Or maybe not; it is a film that is meant as a crowd-pleaser, or a heartwarmer, but at times isn't too sure how to balance between some of the believability the script needs at times (i.e. why is the focus sometimes squarely on Navorski, when its a security station meant to focus on everyone at the airport). The visual styling is impressive, with some cool camera sweeps and tracks in the immense set. But it doesn't add up to anything that marks it as a great film. It also doesn't hold up as well as Spielberg's other films on repeat viewings; on a first go-around it is sheerly entertainment, but once seen again certain scenes bring out some groans. It might be even more enlightening or fun for kids, as it is on that sort of E.T. level. And Hanks' performance, which only shows some dimension towards the last twenty minutes, is good enough, though could've been more.I guess in short I'm saying that the Terminal is reccomendable, especially as a 'date' movie of sorts, though I wouldn't say to start off with it as the first Spielberg ever. That being said, Kumar Palau (the janitor character, also a Wes Anderson regular), is the best thing about the movie.",7,0,2,14 January 2006
The Blind Side," nothing to really get too worked up about - not even Bullock can elevate it past its 'safe' quarters
","I'm sure Michael Oher is an inspiring sort of story. In fact his real story, the one glossed over in the film version The Blind Side, is kind of fascinating (unlike in the film, Oher was taken by several families over the years, some black, until winding up with the Twohey's as seen here). That he could make a difference, if only for himself, is a fine feat. But there's something about the movie that is sanitized, kept in the Hollywood bakery to make it fresh for a G-rated mass consumption. It's not even offensive to any great degree, except for the fact that the filmmakers relegate the main character to a secondary kind of role (rather, if he does have any real personality in real life, it's whittled down to make him a cypher, a character that does what he's told and never questions anything - not even why he becomes a football star).Oh, it has its moments. And Sandra Bullock has that feisty kind of 'All-American-Woman' spirit, the kind that wins Oscars (you know the kind, re: Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich). And her acclaim for the role isn't unearned as she puts a lot of passion and personality into the part, at least as much as the script allows. And Kathy Bates has an amusing if bizarre cameo as the lone DEMOCRAT of the piece (something she mentions like she's sad to be Satan coming through the door). But it's the character of Oher, and the actor playing him, that brings the film down. The film itself has its conventional pleasures and beats, but I couldn't help but feeling they left Oher out to dry, like a symbol of something for white people to rally around. Again, it's never too offensive, and its heart is in the right place (think of it, perhaps, as a sign of burgeoning White Conservative Guilt peeking out as opposed to garden-variety liberal kind).Yet characters outside of Oher don't bring much to the table either. I would've liked to have seen some other personality come out from, say, the high school football coach, or understand more about where Oher came from aside from the usual 'oh, it's a bad ghetto' thing. It's ultimately neither too stirring as a human saga nor as a sports triumph, but just run of the mill. And yet for another audience, children, it's a fine little piece of fluff (tell me the director wasn't thinking of a children audience during those plucky scenes where the little boy acts like an agent for Oher in front of the college recruiters).",5,9,16,26 February 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Exceptional
","This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.  It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins.  But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable, showing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie.

Centurion," Marshall takes a stab at medieval fantasy
","Probably a 'better' movie than Doomsday, though not as fun, and certainly nowhere near the high quality of The Descent, which may probably be the only masterpiece Neil Marshall's got. All the same, it's some bloody good action for the most part, and Olga Kurylenko by proxy of a character literally tongue-less doesn't have the kind of poor acting she had in Quantum of Solace. Also, Michael Fassbender is always made of win. As is lots of gore and violence, sans the CG blood.All this said - after seeing Marshall direct the episode of Game of Thrones in season 2, where the battle happens at the Lannister castle... I forgive this film some of its problems as it served as a 'trial' run for Marshall's best direction yet. If nothing else, Centurion is an interesting film to see the seeds of what would come in mastering that kind of wild, heart-felt and action-packed style of direction.",6,1,5,8 November 2014
The Big Short," who knew Adam McKay wanted to be... Oliver Stone(!) a fiery polemic
","Yep, this really happened - or at least some of it, some of the time, with celebrities breaking the fourth wall (one of them in a bathtub!) not included - the banks, wall street, mortgage casino-rollers f***ed this country out of lots and lots of money. Trillions of dollars lost, in fact, gone in the air like some fart in the wind. The Big Short could easily have been a documentary, and some of the editing reflect that; this is often cut together in staccato, rapid-fire, sort of floating-over-a-place-and-mind style that one can see in many Oliver Stone movies from the 90's. It's hard not to see it, and one may think it borderlines homage and just ripping-off for the sake of this narrative. But then again this shouldn't necessarily be a story told with subtlety - or, rather, there is already a film that has some fire in its belly but is more subdued, 2011's Margin Call, which is about much of the same material as here but contained in one 24 hour period. The Big Short is an epic story of how a group of people saw that our country was going in a bad, bad direction... and saw to profit from it.Are guys like Jared Vennett and Michael Burry, MD (can't forget the MD), and Mark Baum guys to root for? That's sort of the provocative point of the movie, and I'm sure was a cornerstone of the book (also from the author of Moneyball, which was also about rigging the system for the favor of the main subjects). The movie goes into further depth about it, but in short: the economy collapsed in 2008 (no s***), but there were signs that there was a housing bubble, in spite of what many economists and the press saw. It was all build on the 'sub-prime' mortgages - this is where the joke explanation via bathtub comes in, but one should be able to get the gist without it - basically they were crap mortgages given to people who couldn't afford to pay per month. And it wasn't just one or two or ten, it was thousands bundled together, all these homes put together. So what did people like Burry and Baum, who had investors for their company, decide to do after some investigating into the numbers? Bet against the system - put up 'shorts' so that, if/when the sub-primes went bad, they'd reap the benefits in millions - billions, really.In a sense it's like watching the lessor of the evils of the finance world. These guys work in high finance and the world of stocks, but they aren't exactly stockbrokers (Brad Pitt's character, who advises two young hedge-fund wannabe-richers, is out of the stock game and more into fresh seeds, a slightly underwritten character but Pitt's presence makes up for it somewhat). They were on the outside and maybe, kind of, sort of, had a conscience about it near the end. While watching the trailer one may think Christian Bale is the main character - certainly the qurkiest with his 'Super-Cuts haircut and no shoes' as one of his colleagues observes, it's really an ensemble, with Baum given, to me, the most depth of anyone.To be sure, Carell is acting his head off here, but he's given a juicy part to play; it's the opposite of the inert, super-weird DuPont from Foxcatcher, as he is fiery, mouthy, ready to complain and speak without any filter. He's also racked by grief from a dead brother who he feels guilt about not saving, and keeps going with his plot to make these credit-default swaps (basically a gamble on the mortgages not working out), and the s*** gets deeper once it gets into those dreaded things called CDO's. It helps that we get to see a character like Baum, and to an extent Berry (though he sort of fades as a smaller presence in the second half of the story), because McKay's style as a director is super kinetic and rapid-fire charged. Almost, one could say, too much.This is editing that is hyper and bouncing off into different cross-sections; a character may talk about something in the world and McKay and his editors show it, briefly, or maybe more, or we see other things going on in a room in flashes. Like Stone, he's going full-hog into showing the way a mind may bounce around and sort of stream-of-conscious about a place or theme. Other times he can calm down enough to just keep it on the actors, but there's still a nervous energy to how he's keeping the shots, things moving about from one angle to another, the hand-held and the zooms moving about to such a rhythm that is not sloppy (I should hope anyway after so many films under his belt, albeit comedies up till now). It kept me on edge, but that's the right choice for this material; it's angering and heart-breaking and, unless you've lived under a rock for the past ten years, know that things went seriously, seriously wrong just across the board from banks to Lehman and Goldman and (come on!) rating agencies and the government.It may be looked at as manipulative just by how it frames its messages. I don't even know if it'll be a film I'll revisit more than once or twice because of the intense emotions and thoughts it brought back to me. But it's an important film all the same, and that it contains some excellent work from Carell and Bale, and some serviceable stuff from Gosling and Pitt and a few others, makes it worth seeing. Just decide over the Christmas holiday if getting riled up about the financial crash and lots and lots and LOTS of unadalterated greed and presented like a buckshot blast to the solar plexus is your cup of tea.",8,2,8,24 December 2015
Platoon," War films like this
","'It's a lovely f***ing war.' This acts as the true repudiation of all of the Gung-ho Ra-Ra 'we're gonna win this time' action films of the 1980's, but it also gets to have it's cake and eat it by being a muscular, hardcore damn (and damning) action picture, photographed by Robert Richardson in the days when he was still coming off being a documentary cameraman and before he got into his spotlights. It's Full Metal Oliver Stone, so much of what he was as a young 'grunt' in the 's***' that was Vietnam but also what he was in the intervening years (it took him a while to figure out what kind of movie it was, about 7 years after he left he wrote a first draft, another 10 years until it got made).I don't know if necessarily Stone had Rambo and the Chuck Norris pieces of crap or all those other movies where people were returning to Vietnam to 'win again', to fulfill some kind of vision that America didn't really *lose*, but there are two aspects of this movie that do a wonderful job of giving the middle finger to the military industrial complex and even military movies: Tom Berenger's hard-ass Sgt. Barnes, who gets s**t done and is a tough motherf****r, but also shirks responsibility for his rage and in killing innocents in full view of others and cold blood (maybe a minor plot-gap - sure Elias might stir hell up and report him, but even if he's gone no one else would speak up about a, you know *Court Martial*-able crime? oh well, I'll let it go I guess), and yet you completely understand who he is and what he's doing, why even if he is a true antagonist in his brutality he's human in his monstrosity, if that makes sense (see how he chugs Jack Daniels when he makes his 'I s*** on all of you' entrance to the other grunts talking about whether to take him out or not).The other aspect is the climax; this is one of those major, hyper-realistic and hyper-violent and intense action set pieces with lots of gunfire and explosions and chaos, but a) you can understand everything going on (it'd be nice to show this sequence to action editors and directors today), and more important b) the Americans lose. The VC take over the military camp and the whole perimeter, and there's no choice but to call in the planes to drop some bombs on the area. It shouldn't be overlooked: the Americans *lose*, which encapsulates the message of the movie. Of course there were war movies before that didn't celebrate one side or the other - All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory - but a lot of those films were exceptions.Though Full Metal Jacket came out a mere six months later - a coincidence I'm sure - many other movies, great ones, came out due to this one being released (Casualties of War being the most notable to me, but also Stone's other war pictures; oddly enough he wanted to also make Born on the 4th of July years before and only Platoon made it possible). I don't even know if it's his best or my personal favorite, but it certainly shows a filmmaker screaming out his concerns and passions as an artist about a place and time that is also meant to stretch beyond this war and to others; when Sheen gives that on the surface preachy narration at the end about 'we didn't fight the enemy, we fought ourselves,' it can be spread out into other wars, other times people who thought they were in the right, the Barnes and Rambos, didn't see the BS (or accepted it, said 'screw it' with a giant machine gun).Last note: Willem Dafoe's Jesus pose makes for a helluva poster, but in the context of the scene it's in... is it earned? There's enough operatic-horrors going on, which is fine, but it comes off as a bit much. But it's Dafoe so, I dunno, he's awesome.",10,2,6,12 September 2000
Scream," Like wine
","Like wine, this horror film has grown better with age.  But to see if it is still fresh and delictable is to be seen.  If it is your first time watching this movie you will love the comedy and thrills.  If it is not, it might seem like something you've seen before.  Still, this is a good horror effort by Director Wes Craven (who gives one of his best films yet) in telling the story of a killer going after some teens, specifically Sydney Campbell (Neve Campbell is very convincing) who's mother was murdered exactly one year before the killings.  Very good, very chilling, very repetitive.  Drew Barrymore highlights this film in a overglamourous cameo as the first victim.  A",8,6,9,10 July 2000
Halloween," One of the best horror and independent films ever made
","John Carpenter has created a masterpiece with Halloween.  Not only a terrific horror film, but a terrific independent picture as well (the film only cost $320,000).  The pictures revolutionized horror movies and all movies by scaring you to the bone with a character who heard voices in his head and couldn't be stopped.  Though the film goes a little slow, thats good because it gets the pace to a good tempo and that is what makes a good horror movie.  Along with great performances by Pleasence and Curtis (her first film), this film needs to belong in motion picture history.",10,9,18,10 February 2000
Wonder Woman," ::Blazing guitar solo::
","Seeing this again... man (or woman)... I want to rate this even higher for the parts I like, even for the opening on Themyscyra (sic) because I bought in even more to the emotion of how it was played so straight by the actors and staged by Jenkins. Gal Gadot is the new Christopher Reeve, and in her own way even more badass because of how much she makes Diana a force to be reckoned with while keeping so much vulnerability just under the surface. She and Chris Pine are a wonderful 30's or 40's rom com couple, though more adorable due to Diana's mix of awkwardness and strength, often in the same breath..... But that climax is still not impressive on a technical level. I don't even mean how the conflict has to come to a head, I get all of that, and I even liked the I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE (cue guitar lick) moment because Jenkins is not only not afraid of cheese she doesn't know what the word means, but it connects with the key theme of the movie. I know so many of the final battle scenes or fights that happen with these comic book movies have been called bullshit but a) there were less than zero stakes because (Spoiler) we know Wonder Woman doesn't succumb to evil because of her appearance in the previous DC movie that takes place 100 years after this one (and I so wish it didn't exist due to the continuity errors it places with this), and b) the CGI is laughable, with David Thewlis (who you ALL owe it to yourselves to see on Fargo s.3) not being good at turning total evil HAM.So in short: the parts I liked before I liked a little or a lot more (the 'No Man's Land' is the one part, mostly when Diana first appears, that, just iconography-wise, is cool), and the parts I didn't I felt so, so, so embarrassed. Hence this review and half a star bump. It's also the best DC comic book movie since Batman Begins. So there.",8,8,14,18 November 2017
Paths of Glory," One of the best (anti) war films ever made!
","Stanely Kubrick's Paths of Glory is a great example of when Kubrick was at his best- and only in his twenties. This depiction of World War one with Kubrick as director and Kirk Douglas in perfect form, it takes the viewer into the objectivity of it all. What happens in the trenches, if just from a bird's eye view? His gliding camera in these scenes is remarkable. Then when he moves into the courtroom scenes, and the following awaiting of the soldier's last call, it becomes heartbreaking, and it becomes one of those rare stories that never loses its relevance. And the last scene shows that Kubrick, contrary to his de-humanizing nature in his films, reaches an emotional peak equal to De Sica or even Dreyer. It gets better every year. A classic of anti-war sentiment.",10,2,3,13 February 2000
Despicable Me," irresistibly cute and clever on a silly cartoon level and a few dark edges, no more no less
","Sometimes a movie can just aim to be adorable fun, and Despicable Me is nothing else if not that. The film features a hook-nosed villain named Gru who has a bunch of little yellow pill-shaped minions all with one eye and speak gibberish and who adopts a few cute little orphans so he can infiltrate the lair of a nerdy would-be villain named Victor (or 'Vector' as he tries to call himself), and who ultimately loves the little rascally girls who just want the big guy to take care of them. It's like a fluffy little dark comedy, if that can possibly be combined, where the movies doesn't lose its edge entirely, but over the course of the story it gets fluffier, a little more heartfelt. But, thankfully, it's always funny. Maybe it's funny in that silly old-style cartoon way where we see characters who are no good doing crazy things like trying to scale the walls of other no-goodniks. Or, as it really is, it's like one of those cartoons on the Cartoon Network only extended feature-length (think, perhaps, Dexter's Laboratory, which had a character wanting nothing but to be an evil mad-scientist and usually did pretty poorly at it; Gru as Dexter's bald uncle). Others out there may also think back to Lemony Snickett, which also featured a curmudgeon who becomes the ward of some kids and the kids start to get the better of him. This isn't Lemony Snicket, however, nor exactly Dexter's Lab or other cartoons. It's entirely familiar, but its original in its details.The movie is aimed at children for a large part, but it also has a lot of jokes and just a general attitude at times for the adults. Gru early on is a Grinch-like character (there's an obvious connection to Seuss stories, a Lorax t-shirt seen included), and has a lot of mean-spirited quips at people or little tricks like a freeze-gun that are just delightful to watch. It's fun to see a character be as bad as he wants to be, and at the same time isn't very good at it - and, too, neither is his exercise-suit wearing nemesis, Victor. But it's pretty clear once those little yellow minions come into the fore-front, as do those little girls (especially the really small one with the love for her unicorn and bedtime stories about kittens) that it's a cute-fest. You want to hug this movie once you give in to it.And whether or not you give in to it will probably determine how much you respond to it. It's a treat for kids, who will want the high- spirited comedy and the progression of the story of Gru becoming more and more likable (unlike the total grime of Lemony Snickett's character). For adults, the story will be familiar, especially if one's taken their kids to see something like it recently. Everything is done in good fun, and even the ending with its Bee Gees music playing during a dance recital is meant to give everyone a big smile. It's a minor treat following Toy Story 3, and a welcome respite from the likes of The Last Airbender as entertainments for the 'family' this summer. Oh, and Steve Carrell is great by the way as Gru.",7,3,6,18 July 2010
Back to the Future Part II," In the middle
","I think that this film belongs in the middle of the trilogy not only in chronological order, but in good order as well.  This film is better than part 3 because it has some funny gags in deja vu fashion, and not as good as part 1 because of a few flaws.  Story continues exactly from part 1 and has Marty and Doc going 30 years into the future to find that there is a new generation of McFly's but it gets complicated after that (and even more than the first).  Plenty of laughs, but consistency is somewhat missing (in part 1, Claudia Wells played Jennifer and in this part, Elizabeth Shue plays her and messes up the flow).  Stil a visual delight, especially in the dance sequence and chase on air boards.  A",8,6,10,14 July 2000
Carrie," one of the more entertaining, chilling, and tragic stories ever about High school
","Carrie is from a novel by Stephen King, and directed by Brian De Palma, and it can more than likely be found in any horror section of the video store. But to me the film may lend itself more to being a kind of weird, darkly satiric take on High school life that only really gets into the outright horror in the last twenty minutes. For the most part Carrie could just as well be a fable about the ugly duckling or some other kind of outcast. Nothing in the film or story is necessarily subtle, but it's hard for me to carp- all of the one to two dimensional characters are brilliantly played, and through such fantastical material there is a truth reached that might not be struck with a different cast or director. It's a unique blend of theatricality, style, and some very realistic, harsh notes about societal repression. That it's fun, and funny, at different times also puts it a notch above other genre material (certainly above other King adaptations about the mawkish loner with special powers).Sissy Spacek is in a career-making performance as Carrie, the awkward girl that everybody in school (at least all of the juvenile teen girls in gym class) teases to no end, who's own paralyzed way of being among people works against her. The first big chunk of the film is really dramatically satisfying and heart-wrenching with, aside from the obvious 'trait' Carrie possesses, could happen to any loner teen. After an accident in the girl's shower, to which taunting reaches a high peak, all of the girls (including the likes of PJ Soles, Amy Irving, and the very sexy b*tch Chris played by Nancy Allen) get detention under the only one who really cares for Carrie (Betty Buckley), and so the girls plot revenge involving the senior prom and a bucket of pig's blood. Meanwhile, Carrie still gets her ultimate repression by her bible-thumping, very nuts mother (Piper Laurie in the most successfully over-the-top performance of the film). As the prom nears, a near iconic line 'they're all gonna laugh at you' pops up, and becomes the crux of the last grueling act of the film.De Palma has only a handful of films that come close to this one for his sheer love for over-stylized, prolonged scenes that almost start to comment on themselves. And there's a really wonderful element to some of it, it's almost akin to Sergio Leone's the Good the Bad and the Ugly in just trying to see how far he can take his style before it might implode or get to just the right height of suspense. Obvious enough are the Hitchcock lifts in parts of the style, most notably in the climax with the split-screens and very similar music cues (all he's missing is Bernard Hermann). But his style works to making scenes already with a satirical tinge funnier as opposed for just shocking edginess. My favorite was the scene showing the gym teacher working the girls hard out on the field, this reaching almost a cartoonish side to it. And, of course, what would a 70s horror movie be without an amazingly explicit, slow-motion jump-cuts in the girl's locker room? This style works best with King's material, adding an extra emphasis on the emotional manipulations and cruelty, and rigid, constricting structure, that school imposes.Sometimes, too, part of the enjoyment in seeing a film like this is not just the take on a telekinetic getting her vengeance on her teasers and pranksters, but how it all fits well into a psychology and general outlook on High school. Certain scenes with the supporting characters are good at this, like with a very amusing John Travolta and Allen in the car. This is the kind of take on high school life that likely inspired other films like Heathers and Donnie Darko, but Carrie has a kind of timeless quality to it too. On the other hand, if you are looking through the store and want Carrie to be a genuine horror film- once it truly transitions into that section, it's (appropriately) gory, lavish, and unexpected; I had already seen this climactic scene somewhere before seeing the whole film, but it still kept me on my toes, particularly the final confrontation between mother and daughter. One of the best King adaptations and a very good turn from director and cast.",9,4,7,30 July 2006
The Queen," God Saves?
","This rating is probably a little more generous than the film truly deserves, which is a shame since it comes from director Stephen Frears (of The Hit and High Fidelity among many other notables), and of course carries a serious pedigree with not only Helen Mirren but James Cromwell and, the one given the most character to play with Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. They all are in service of a story which is not really that interesting, or as captivating as it thinks it is.Of course the death of Princess Diana rocked the world with grief - or many parts of it, I can't speak for all if it, I just knew what I saw as a kid on TV at the time - and the whole narrative thrust of this film, which mostly takes place in a week's time give or take a day, is 'What will the Queen DO to respond to this national tragedy?' We're told a lot of things about how the Monarchy usually acts, and especially in this case it was tricky since it was the 'English' way was to keep grief as a 'personal' matter (of quiet desperation, Pink Floyd might say, but I'd say more like upper-crust, stuffy reserve is more like it). And, also of course, Diana's life was made anything but impersonal by the media.I think that how much you personally care about the Monarchy, what you think of its relevance for modern society (as in the past 25/30 years) matters watching The Queen because they are the chief component of it. And from what Frears and company show here, they were very sympathetic; what is it they DO that would keep them away from the (arguably) over-reaching frenzy of the public in their reaction to the Diana tragedy? Well, lots of hunting and walking the dogs and reading newspapers and tea time and other such things. For me, it doesn't exactly make them, or the Queen, seem very conflicted, and that's the problem with the movie.I actually would have been intrigued to see a Tony Blair movie, just about him, from seeing his work here: Sheen does an excellent job, as does the writing of him, to make Blair much more conflicted and have to deal with he pressures of public perception (and also the fact that he becomes sort of a glowing figurehead with his 'People's Princess' remark). But his story is squeezed together with this supposed conflict of the Queens, which doesn't make for a terribly compelling arc. For most of the movie she is reluctant/hesitant/won't be in public to mourn, then she sees a giant elk, sheds a tear, and decides to do it. While she starts in one place and ends in another, and does have lots of conversations (like with the 'Queen Mother', even more of an old-time blue-blood than she), there's too much telling and not enough showing of the change.Mirren is it goes without saying a tremendous talent, and I understand why the old-stuffy AMPAS gave a figure who was old-stuffy like Queen an Oscar (ironically they didn't give it to the most deserved that year Judy Dench for Notes on a Scandal, I imagine because they might've reasoned she already got hers... for playing Queen Elizabeth for 8 minutes in Shakespeare in Love). But it's not a character that gives the actress too much to do - or, rather, she has to do a *lot* to try and make her at least watchable and have these internal problems to deal with. Maybe they do show up and my own lack of concern for the monarchy showed, but it's also worth as a criticism to point out the movie didn't do enough to make me care as I should.Perhaps as a longer series this could work better, where we could see Blair and the Queen as (co) protagonists dealing with British affairs in their time (there's a hint about the troubles Blair would come across in the early 2000's as part of the Iraq war effort, at least that's how I read into it). As it stands it's not bad, but it's not terribly memorable either, except as Oscar-baiting regal drama with the occasional wink and nod to the audience about how stuffy this group is. From Frears, I would've expected more though.",6,2,3,6 March 2016
Blow," Cocaine, They Started that. Your Welcome.
","That statement was said by Denis Leary who, not surprisingly, co-produced this drug epic with Ted Demme who not only directs this film, but Leary's special No Cure for Cancer. Watching that special, I would've never expected a movie this good and serious, but it is. And unless a better film comes along this year, Blow might just be the best film of 2001.In this bio-pic, George Jung is a guy who starts out by selling pot in the California area. After a while though, he progresses to selling cocaine in the late 70's and early 80's with the infamous Pablo Ecobar, and becomes a multi-millionaire (Jung, played by Jonny Depp very well, explains that if you bought cocaine in that time period in America, there would be a 85 percent chance it was from him). But then we see how things change with time, especially with Jung, which makes this movie even more fascinating and excellent.While Blow is stylish, smart and hard edged with good stuff, the film also has compassion and feeling, in-particular in the third act which gives this movie a clever turn. Also with brilliant acting from the cast (the ensemble includes Depp, Paul Ruebens, Penelope Cruz and in a twist of a role from GoodFellas, Ray Liotta as Jung's dad) and a well told story, this is one of the best bio-pics and drug movies of the 00's.",10,77,109,2 April 2001
1408," like a very good feature-length episode of the Twilight Zone: surrealism and 'gotchas' at every corner
","It's a hit or miss thing with Stephen King movies. Sometimes there's an exceptional effort by someone with a really strong vision (eg Kubrick, De Palma), but then there are also some big blunders (Dreamcatcher comes first to mind). And then there are those that sort of lie right in the middle, as decent, unpretentious but unremarkable efforts that chill or spill into your living room or movie theater. 1408 isn't a great thriller, but for King fans it'll likely be one of the most faithful- or at least feel faithful- efforts to date, and as such it's pretty creepy and a sure-fire 'gotcha' machine. The premise is vintage King: a cynical writer (Cusack) who's books go over the paranormal (with the exception of a personal book about a father and son), and gets sent an anonymous postcard about the Dolphin hotel and room 1408. The manager warns him, fervently, to not stay in the room. But he's insistent to the point where there's no turning back. Slowly, but extremely surely, things start popping up in the room, out of Elsin's own consciousness, perhaps, and as well with the environment changing (fix that heater!), and even a pint-sized version of the hotel manager (who doesn't want to see Jackon ala Indian in the Cupboard?).It all leads up to a few good twists and turns, but good being the important word here. Unlike the unsuccessful pot-boiler Identity, which also (regrettably) starred Cusack, this isn't contrived for the sake of it. The sudden images of a man with an ax swinging at Elson, the images of ghosts jumping out of the windows (one of them, which I found extraordinary, was shown with the same marks that come with an old movie print), isolation enhanced by a lack of windows to either side, and that bottle of booze. Spiked? Probably not- this is a thrill-ride predicated on lightning-fast imagery, but too fast (it isn't Saw thank goodness), and Elsin's past, notably the death of his daughter. It's usually a conceit that the filmmaker puts in to have the central character to have a dark past loaded with sadness, but here it works effectively in how gradually it all comes out, and how the fear/acceptance of death is something just as, if not more-so, terrifying than anything else the room has to offer.As I said, not a great film, as sometimes it has that feel of an all-too well-oiled machine by director Mikael Håfström, edging on feeling like there's a checklist somewhere of things to happen in the room to Elsin. But, as mentioned, it doesn't come off as being too unsurprising. On the contrary, there is some originality to how the special effects team- via Cusack, going through many modes of acting like it's a powerhouse audition- bring out the best of what can be offered with a horror-show amusement park. It may be in part like a ghost house, but it's a fun and exciting one, and more watchable than any other PG-13 horror film I've seen in a while. 7.5/10",7,111,165,24 June 2007
Raging Bull," possibly the great American biopic of the 1980s
","That's entertainment.That, and one of the most influential films for me in my life, in films and just in general. Only a handful of pics have the same emotional and visceral impact seeing it at 26 the way it did when I was 12. In fact it's even deeper now some of it; when Jake confronts Joey in 1958 in the parking garage, this time seeing it, after seeing the scene countless times, it got to me and a few Jack-tears welled up. But not crying, whaddaya want, ya basterds.I could go on about how it's got the greatest boxing scenes in any movie. I could go on about Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are the B's-and-E's of movie acting at the time. I could go on how Scorsese's influence of the Clash made the movie that much better, if only subliminally. But hey, why go on. You should just see it. Preferably on a big screen where every PUNCH and EDIT get to you in Scorsese and Schoonmaker's kinetic, pile-driving cinema.",10,5,11,13 January 2000

Straight Outta Compton," powerful and entertaining, if less than great
","Straight Outta Compton is about Three guys growing up in the hood of the Compton section of Los Angeles - Eric Wright (Easy E), Andre Young (Dr. Dre) and O'Shea Jackson (Ice Cube) - who come together through some various reasons (trying to get out of selling drugs and getting almost run over by police-driven bulldozer; the frustration of continuing with the basic R&B dance music of the day; writing lyrics that will push the envelope) and try to make some rap music that challenges the norm. There are ups, there are major downs (including death), and in the end it's all like 'wow, we came THIS far?'This is a refreshing, hard-R rated trip into not simply a little rap group who sold a few million records and burned out after a few years (technically anyway, Dre and Ice Cube went on to monumental careers). This is a piece of modern history that has to be told: how 'gangster rap' came into its own in worldwide public consciousness. Like much of the best aggressive music for young people, though certainly not exclusive to them, it addresses what's going on in the world that group's in, but here with the added social-political edge: what are cops doing? What has happened to where people have to be 'thuggish'? Or, in a sub-textual level, do people from places like Compton act super-hard and angry and act super-tough to make up for what little power they have in their neighborhoods? But anyway, back to this movie...This is a blend of the conventional (but often quite good and challenging) musician bio-pic, with the highs and lows and egos that become too big for everyone and how money comes into trouble and so on (not to mention the manager who isn't all he says he is), and an all-too distressing look at how nothing's changed with regards to urban/COP violence and conflicts (and actually, I think as a reaction to Obama honestly, has gotten worse). Arguably, the cops are really the villains here, certainly for this group of people, though Suge Night kind of takes over that mantle in the second half with his scenes of thug-life.What makes it so compelling is that we really get invested in these three main guys, and manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) - Dre, Cube, and Easy E - and then we see how invigorating and exciting it is for them to get together, which makes them coming apart so sad (though inevitable). These aren't card-board gang-banger types; even Easy-E, who has maybe the least talent of the three main guys (Ren and Yella are kind of less than one-dimensional), they have humor and pathos to them, they care about how their messages are getting out there, not being censored, and then... sure, the parties, the women, the drugs, they're there.In the third act - 1993, as soon as it comes on the screen is actually the cue - is not as strong as the first two-thirds, when even as the group comes apart the individual sagas of how they try to keep going on as solo acts is fascinating and funny and frightening and so on. But somehow in the last half hour the film becomes rushed, and the feeling that a LOT got left on the cutting room floor becomes more apparent. And there's one cliché involving someone getting rather sick - spoiler, it's Easy, another spoiler he died in 1995, this is a matter of public record and all - that doesn't gel with the rest of the movie. But until then, Straight Outta Compton is a spectacular look at how real art and discourse can come out of a place as hellish as Compton; these guys made real protest music, and it resonates today for good reason. If nothing else, the movie does a masterful job of getting the audience to care about what the music has to say.One last thing: 98% of this cast fills these real-life roles so well it's hard to see anyone else, certainly with Ice Cube's own son. The 2% exception are two scenes with Snoop Doggy Dogg. When he comes on screen, it's a wonder why they didn't just get the real-life Snoop to come in as himself.",8,8,38,18 August 2015
Mary and Max," the joy and pain of connecting in (friendly) love
","Mary and Max is like opening up a graphic novel, meant more for adults than children (not that it's explicit, just... adult), and finding something that justifies the reason for this medium to expand as it sometimes does. In other words, this is a film that takes animation, claymation in fact, and takes it to another level of possibility. There are a lot of funny things that happen in this story of two pen-pals - one, initially, a 7 year-old Australian girl, and the other a 44 year-old man in New York city - who first connect over a cartoon show and find they have some things very much in common. This is a story that is profound and moving for the depths to which it explores the fragility in human beings, how vulnerable some of us can get, and what being on the 'outside' really means in society, being on the margins as being a woman, or mentally ill, or 'ugly' whatever that means, or unable to control oneself.Something about this style of animation that Adam Eliot implements is fascinating to see unfold. Only occasionally do we see characters talking, with their mouths moving. Perhaps this was a challenge that the filmmaker gave himself and, especially, to see to what lengths he could take voice-over narration (usually a big no-no if you take a screen writing class, to which I wonder if Mary and Max would be thrown out as 'improper'). The film is mostly presented as the series of letters that Mary and Max are writing each other over the years - she starts off as a little girl with a dysfunctional family (well, more than others, though abusive more in the sense of neglect) and a sense of wonder about the world around her, and questions of things like being bullied and, frankly, what sex is; he is diagnosed later with Aspergers, but we can tell early on that something is 'off' about this single, lonely, dejected Jewish man who has an imaginary friend who for a while now sits in the corner reading self-help books.Their relationship has its ups and its downs - a stint in a mental institution brings a time gap (Max sometimes, or, no, almost all of the time) freaks out and gets anxiety attacks at the sorts of questions that an adult has to answer truthfully to someone like a little girl - and yet the narration, both from a third-person perspective and then the letters (voiced brilliantly by Hoffman and Collette) really is exceptional work. We see everything that is being described on screen, so it's not un-cinematic, and at the same time the words being spoken provide a nice counter-point at times to what we're seeing, how Max may see things in his 'way' and Mary with her attention to her looks or that boy across the street who stutters and is Greek and has an interesting smell about him. It's the sort of thing that were this a graphic novel no one would question the structure. But as presented, it's really incredible how it all holds and unfolds with great pacing and attention to character and detail.Much of this relies on both the humor in the writing, the voice work, and the exaggerated style in the animations. Mary's mother, for example, is one such a piece of work, a drunk who is kind of a harridan but fascinating to watch. Or that one older woman who sometimes cooks for Max (despite the hair, which he picks out). Some of Eliot and company's work here is nightmarish, garish, bringing out the fears and horrors of the characters to the forefront. And yet there was rarely a moment I wasn't completely, emotionally invested with these two people. So what if they're animated? When Mary is teased and goes through her hardships, it's difficult to watch (I almost felt tears welling up myself, mostly in the childhood scenes). This isn't simple manipulation - it's carefully, even spiritually, bringing us along into these character's level of awareness and how they feel things.I wondered at times if this would work as well if it was live-action, which it could have been. I think the animation adds to this story and shapes Mary and Max into the unique experience it is, though one I wish would be done more in this medium. There are several visual quirks and possibilities given that it's stop-motion animation - water is depicted really Styrofoam bubbles - but, ultimately, it comes down to the truth in the characters, and yet... no, there is an extra element that it being this way brings, I'm sure of it.Perhaps a certain innocence is evoked too? The fact that animated characters come together due to an animated cartoon in their world - and their hand-made and, later, collectible figurines? There's a lot to Mary and Max I hope to explore in further viewings - how much Judaism is satirized here to great effect, even as it's still a serious matter when a character is mocked for being Jewish, for example, or that neighbor of Mary's who can't get out of his house - and it's such a rich, harrowing experience that I can't recommend it enough.",10,2,6,13 May 2015
Shrek," Fascinating and amusing summer fare
","Shrek is the 2nd animated film from the PDI/Dreamworks team which before brought the public Antz.  While that was directed towards adults, now we have this- Shrek (by the way, a little inside joke is that Shrek is yiddish for fright).  A new comedy for kids and adults.  And surprisingly, it works for both.While the film brings a unconventional (with a conventional formula) story in the mix, it's best parts are with the animation skills by the people at PDI, but also with the voice talents: Myers brings a keen type of Fat Bastard voice in Shrek (some lines also sound like they came from Austin Powers movies); Murphy shows that if he starts to run out of good movies, he can always go to voice overs; Lithgow has not been this good in years and Diaz may be annoying at times but is cute throughout.  As is the film which is so far the most workable (as I would call it such) in the summer regime and my first real recommendation for this season.  A",8,1,2,20 May 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the best suspense films of the early 1990's
","Silence of the Lambs is a film that will always be memorable because of 2 things (in my mind)- 1, Hopkins brilliantly mixed type of Socrates meets Dawn of the Dead zombie charicature and 2, an argument will go on like who was the better Darren on Bewitched, Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling (and version of herself in 10 years Julianne Moore).  I feel that Jodie Foster is very good here as a FBI agent who has to get in the mind of Dr. Lecter (Faba beans and all) to find a killer.  Story latter patterned out in The Cell, which while that was better, this film is a tad better than the sequel by having you sqeam in your seat while getting memorable catch phrases and (dare I say) laughs.  A little note (and not too uncoincidentally)- Dead Director George A. Romero appears briefly as a Memphis agent.  A",10,3,6,9 February 2001
Vanilla Sky," Pretty strange, but entertaining and slickly crafted
","Cameron Crowe's (originally Alejandro Amenabar's) Vanilla Sky is a film where reality and dreams (er Nightmares) are blended together into a maddening yet almost refreshing look at one man's trip (that would've been a good explanation) through love, death, and other things in life.  This man is played by Tom Cruise who runs half of a magazine business in New York who has a affair lover on the side (Cameron Diaz who isn't that bad in her scenes), but then falls in love one night with another woman (Penelope Cruz) and then the plot unfolds from there.  You can try to follow along with where the film is going, but be warned that at some point the film diverges into the stranger, and more surreal, though it's explained at the end. Worthwhile despite it's shortcomings, with actual human characters enriching the atmosphere.  Jason Lee and Kurt Russell also star. B+",8,1,4,16 December 2001
Black Panther," One of the better Marvel movies
","What does empowerment mean for black people? While this is not exactly the central question for T'Challa, there is a part of this question for him. He has to not only be a king but know how to do it. Does he stay an isolationist, clinging to the world he was raised in and all of the vibranium included, or share the knowledge and tech with the world? Information and resources, wealth, science, that leads to people becoming empowered because they have what they didnt.This is in direct contrast with another kind of empowerment, through dominance and wiping out oppressors, and that is what Killmonger represents. But does he come from some place that is inhuman? Not really; Eric is from a world of pain, of heartache and loss, and by how he decided what made the most sense - getting jacked and becoming a super-soldier (no, not that one, sans what Captain America's got) - it charted how he saw becoming a ruler. Can one become empowered through revolution? It's arguable, and that's the key thing. 'Kill white'? He wouldn't be the first, or the last.But Killmonger (what a name) is the villain when all is said and done because he doesn't see change being possible in others, whether white or black or whomever. All he sees is the chaos and anger of the world, and sees it as a personal struggle. I didn't see it right off on the first viewing until Double Toasted in their review pointed to it, but there is a stark Trump parallel one could make with Jordan's character.... Though with a bit more of the Malcolm X and less of the, you know, white supremacist side. But then again, supremacy is supremacy and so is demagoguery.These sound like some heavy concepts for a Marvel movie and they are, but the brilliance or Coogler's movie is that he smuggles (or it may just be out in the open and direct) in an action-filled spy epic with Shakespearean overtones (and all the soap-opera that comes with Mr Shakespeare and his royalty epics). This doesn't mean it's without some flaws, both technical (there's some poor CGI in the third act, and in other parts too, though not all bad), and in the plot (mostly in some familiarity with Winston Duke's character, though he fills him with personality to burn). I'm not even sure it hit me emotionally as Civil War or Iron Man as far as Marvel movies go.But as far as movies I've rated a 4.5 out of 5, this is one of the better ones. It has a lot on it's mind, and it has a great way of bringing these ideas to the largest possible audience - not to mention, with both race and gender representation - it's the most woke movie ever made.",9,6,18,3 March 2018
Any Given Sunday," No Story Needed
","Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday is a fictional chronicle, but carries a lot of meaning about today's contemporary sports.  The tale has fake teams with fake players (except for Lawrence Taylor).  Al Pacino (great as always) plays Tony D'Amato, a burnt out coach who has to deal with a bad team full of players who only want money and fame to play the game.  Jamie Foxx is terrific as a hot shot football player who as a star quarterback takes the spotlight from Dennis Quaid, a living legend who's days are numbered.  Quite intriguing, quite cool, and quite hard-hitting, this isn't Stone's best, but he gives his best here.  A",8,4,9,29 April 2000
Iron Man," supreme comic-book entertainment; it's also more jaded, and funnier, than most in its genre
","Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it's pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride, and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the 'anti-dude' as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.",10,23,43,2 May 2008
Mother!," tell your children to walk this way, with caution
","With mother! a story of taking care of a house, having to let in unwanted house guests and feeling the awkwardness settle in more and more, and why being a *strong* woman is so crucial in this world (by this I mean that by showing us scene by scene how women like Lawrence get ground down by not just the men but by other women too - 'Be a mother' of course is always the words spoken especially without asking), this is wildly intense stuff. This by the director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan and Noah is not a surprise. What's surprising is that, on a first viewing, I'm not completely sure it's all... cohesive in its approach to how human beings... are.Yet, two-thirds of this is a masterpiece, the first two-thirds I should say, with a harrowingly compelling performance by Lawrence and a... almost too spot-on casting of Bardem as the Poet who can't help but be both a charismatic AND terrifying presence (especially in those close-ups). It's claustrophobic and deeply, darkly, nightmarishly, even black-holey surreal in its approach - akin to Polanski (a brew of Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant, but still all Aronofsky), maybe some Bunuel thrown in there (a house where they can't leave you say or where people keep coming because... why? but still all Aronofsky), and it is basically PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE: THE MOVIE, a series of scenes where Jennifer Lawrence is stuck in that painfully awkward position of the social contract and probably the most bitter satire of toxic masculinity as far as, well, everything's about the man (except for having kids)....And then it gets into the last third. I don't know what to think about that except... well, that was intense, and unpleasant, and possibly really, really pretentious (the very last scene, I get what you're doing man but... man). It's not a film that you immediately know what you're getting from minute one and it's a filmmaker, a writer-director, who is going TOO far and not reigning himself in and is unloading his id (and probably ego too) onto us all... and not all of this, again, is meant to be pleasant. This ends on such a depressing note, as if (without spoiling too much) a cycle will repeat itself, I'd almost say Requiem ends in a sunnier light (hey, at least they're *alive* by the end of that). To get something like this, with vision and fire and violence and (yes) pitch-black comedy, in a major release on thousands of screens is welcoming and encouraging - final cut certainly helps, but nevertheless - and that this ambition when it comes to what is technically a 'bottle' film is... art.",8,5,19,15 September 2017
Creed II," more than adequate sequel, goes the distance and gets (enough) there
","In many ways, an objectively superior sequel in the Rocky series than Rocky IV, though it's (largely if not completely) missing that film's sense of bombast mixed with some WTF bits. You know the plot of this going on, and honestly you shouldn't really be trying to get something wholly *original* by the eighth Rocky film (or, I should say, Rocky IV: Part II, or The Next Generation, etc). With one small exception on a particular story beat, I called what would happen five minutes in.In this case, that's fine: what matters is that the filmmakers give the actors some extreme-but-believable melodrama to play, and this does that in spades, and delivers on exciting fights that tell stories unto themselves (and boy these do, in some ways the fights are superior in choreography to the first Creed, if not, obviously Coogler lacking, better shot). As much as, again, Jordan and Thompson deliver, and Stallone continues doing some of his top-tier work in his flagship creation, I found the Dragos captivating most of all.Here are our antagonists, out for payback on the newly crowned Adonis, and I'm sure somewhere (whether it got buried in another draft or survived here and I missed it I don't know) there's a message about Russia vs USA for this decade that is timely. But I completely understood them - Dolph gets to play a human being here, unlike in IV when he was a comical-sweaty-steroid-packed killing machine - and there's a message about what it means to be the losing side and living with that that makes this not a cookie-cutter narrative.So it is manipulative, it isn't as earth-shattering as what Coogler did, but so what? It's highly enjoyable and packs heart where it counts as a drama long before it should be considered a sports movie (and that ending... Damn it, Sly, you're not gonna get to me, uh-uh, no sir....)",7,2,6,25 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," not all bad, but like, seriously Snyder and company, really?
","So, what is this movie? It's easy to try and say that a movie is ONLY great or ONLY bad, and that's not good film criticism. Though I won't get into every nook and crany here, it's unfair to slam it as a complete waste. There's clearly a lot of work put into a movie like this and people who put together the sets and costumes and that jar of... well, nevermind. This movie is neither horrible, something to really hate and write letters about, nor is it anything to be especially blown away by. By the end I felt like I got Novocaine shoved down by eyes and ears, and that's not the way to do spectacle, or coherent storytelling.Some pros? Excellent casting; Ben Affleck, totally contrary to any fears from the talk early on by fanboys and geek-trolls, fills the role of Bruce Wayne better than Bale did (still no Keaton, but for his age it works), and Jeremy Irons knocks it out as well. Eisenberg... is acting in a totally different movie, and may even be miscast, but it's one of the most wonderful pieces of ACTING that I've seen in a long time. Gal Godot is fine and beautiful though she isn't given much to do. And some of the scenes with Holly Hunter were OK.The rest of this is full of what the f**k. You're going to pull out something this weird and ambitious and just... DULL? I almost applaud you for it, but I can't, and I get why the Justice League stuff is here, I do, it's in the title, but it jams up the story into having to be THIS thing instead of it just being Batman and Superman (which, yeah, it's stupid for them to fight in the first place - have them have a squabble HALFWAY into the movie, and then go from there and have an actual collaboration, show them really trying to save the city or cities from destruction). It's a whole lot of sound and fury signifying very little; for all of what it's meant to line up for an entire franchise to come, and it is that down to the letter, it's not a good sign for the story *on its own terms* when this isn't organically linked but feels crow-barred in. Some may disagree, and I still understand the nature of building up a world for DC characters (a world I like very much in the comics), but in this story? With these two characters and the crazyass stakes Luthor puts forward? It doesn't add up.And while it's no surprise how far blockbusters of this size and budget and mammoth Noah's Ark sized proportions fit in so much stuff, the CGI and visual effects are not convincing. Like, this is to the point where the DC animated movies (I'm looking at you Dark Knight Returns and Superman Doomsday) are more, well, I don't know if *realistic* is the world, but there's more consistency to the tone that is going on. Yes, in a 2D animated movie it's less of a nightmare than to watch the last 30/45 minutes of this movie where Superman is dispatched by Lex Luthor (nevermind why, it's stupid) to fight and kill Batman because of this or that and then Batman almost kills him but doesn't because stupid reason (that is shown again after being the opening scene of the movie) and then there's Lex Luthor's actual plan and the Wonder Woman shows up and then-and-then-and-then...It's that kind of story, where it should be more of the consequence-follows-action route, but the story is less about filling audiences with wonder about what these two major figures of pop culture can do and is more about where the cogs in the plot will take them next, and how the ugliness of the world bogs them down too. Rarely have I seen a major motion picture in the past several years, comic book or otherwise, have such a grim color palette outside of, I don't know, Children of Men or The Road, and be so serious about it (except for Einsenberg, who to be fair is having the time of his life in a movie where no one else is really allowed to... well, maybe Irons has a satisfied goofy line or two).",4,106,213,24 March 2016
The Emperor's New Groove," One of the best feel good comedies of the year
","Disney's The Emperor's New Groove is one of those family films that anyone can walk in, see it, and feel good afterwards.  Mainly because it's funny, and mostly entertaining.  Story follows a spoiled emperor (David Spade vocals and gives some great charm to the character) who gets his life twisted around when a revenging advisor (Eartha Kitt voices) turns him into a lama (though by accident).  Then the fun begins.  Like The Road to El Dorado (another animated feel good comedy from this years batch), this is a family animated/comedy that isn't in perfection, but it doesn't matter much when it's this enjoyable.  Good natured songs by Sting give this film a boost.  A-",8,1,2,9 December 2000
Blade Runner," One of the best looking films of the 80's from Ridley Scott
","One thing can't be denied about the sci-fi epic Blade Runner: it's look of the future, while possibly not totally original, is original in tone and has things to look for in nearly every scene.  At it's worst, Scott's picture is eye-candy, but tasty bits of candy I add.Ford plays the title character here, as an ex blade runner who is recruited back to track down the androids who are becoming human.  Then the plot unfolds with him changing, and things around him as well.  The story and characters may not appeal to everyone (it might grow on multiple viewings as it did for me), yet the action, intensity and feel with grab anybody interested in good moviemaking.

Monsters University," how to scare (or fail) 101
","A minor film from Pixar, but all the same massive fun, lots of creative monsters and exacting detailed animation, and on a more concrete level it actually does something I have never seen in a Pixar movie, almost as if they were smuggling this in under the radar in one of their franchise efforts: for the first time we have a story without a very clear antagonist. Yes there is the d***ish jock (voiced aptly by none other than Nathan Filion) and the serpentine dean (Helen Mirren, nuff said), but really there is no 'big bad' here, no Sid or super computer or bear that smells like strawberries. The enemy here in as least pretentious a way it can be put is failure. both the main characters Mike and Sully have to face this their own ways, with Mike facing the potential failure of just not being scary, and Sully as not living up to the Sullivan name (hes a bit of a legacy you see). The heart of this movie is in part in the usual way of Pixar taking a formula or just straight up another movie (Toy story 3 was a prison break out flick, bugs life seven samurai, this time its revenge of the nerds and back to school) and how the underdogs get inspired against all odds. But the other chunk of heart and where it struck a chord with me was that its about what happens when you go to college: you're faced with great possibilities and even greater challenges, based on what you put up for yourself, and it will make you (un?) prepared for the rest of your life. Some stretches of the film I wasn't sure what would happen next just due to what one characters morality would effect on another. Yes, monsters university is silly kids stuff, maybe more-so for kids than anything aside from the cars series (not to say this film doesn't have some sophisticated jokes amid the 'aw mom!' stuff with one of the frat members at O.K., you just have to listen close). And its only a little better in terms of some parts of its story than Monsters inc. At the same it also does another incredible feat I only realize now typing this: this is one of the rare prequels you can see without necessarily the original. The filmmakers set up this world from the get go, what getting a scare means (or in the real world, what you are good at.. or not) and taking it from there. hell, just writing this out I like the movie more. It's not great, but within its dimensions it sets out winningly what it wants to do, which is more than can be said for other films this summer. Its vibrant, colorful, and has something to say and, again, without the basic black-and-white good and bad guys aside from genre conventions. 8.5/10",8,0,0,25 June 2013
Ben-Hur," still a gigantic achievement in epic film-making
","What distinguishes Ben-Hur as a powerful film in epic scope is not simply that it is shot and stylized and acted and executed in action sequences to iconic effect (though there is that to a degree), but that it's human dimensions stay intimate in scope. I was expecting what I had heard about with Ben-Hur, and got that- the vengeance plot, the chariot race, a story of redemption with Christ as a background figure and major presence- but I wasn't expecting such things revealed like the devastation left on a family by leprosy, and the disintegration of one's morality by the cloud of vengeance on one's mind. Even if you're not much of a Christian (and even as a non-practicing Jew as I am), there are some deep chords that are struck with the material for an audience that is going in not expecting a lot of sermonizing. Only in the final reels, as we see first-hand the 'Christ' as he is sent to die on the cross, does the film get overbearing with the symbolism and heavy weight of the circumstance of this being a 'tale of the Christ.'This isn't to say also that with Judah Ben-Hur having the strife in coming to terms with his family being at first, he thinks, dead, and then later as made deformed thanks to the Roman's imprisonment, that this is all the film is. It's also grand spectacle, a film that takes you along on its epic ride with imagery that pierced the public consciousness so strongly that you've seen the scenes as parodies or referenced before you've even seen the film. Surely we have the chariot race to contend with, which has been so influential on modern action sequences and chases that Lucas copied most of the choreography for the pod race in Phantom Menace. And to give credit where it's due, you could show that same sequence in any theater today and it would unquestionably bring down the house, not just for its technical achievement but for the visceral impact (i.e. the downfall of Ben-Hur's rival by his own undoing).But there's also other great images; possibly my favorite are the scenes with Judah Ben-Hur as #41 among the rowing slaves, all moving at the whim of the drum beat. That in and of itself would make Ben-Hur a must-see. But then there are more emotionally impactive places and settings, like the valley of the lepers, Judah's struggle across the desert (and the tastefully done angle of Jesus' back only), many others that would take too long to mention. It's all so massive a production that it's almost TOO big (according to Charlton Heston the budget, at 14 million then as the most expensive film ever made, would today cost something like 250 million), and it's a credit to William Wyler that he never makes it too dull, even as supporting characters may verge on leaning to overacting. With only calling attention to it at certain moments (and sometimes not at all with a more subtle effect), Wyler is a virtuoso here in corralling all aspects of the production under his firm handle.And then there's Heston, who gives one of the very best of his (now late) career. He's full of bravura and gusto, and seems like a guy- for those guys who crave action film stars- who can get things done in the right mindset. But he's also excellent at conveying the tragedy of this character, a very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need to get his respite. Underneath all of that machismo and the swagger that eventually became old hat for Heston, is a strong presence at the helm of Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd, too, is also very good as the boyhood friend turned rival. In fact, most of the actors here are very good, from Hawkins to Hazareet to Jaffe to O'Donnel and so on, as they all contribute to the epic scope. It's massive and directly concerning the efforts of then Rabbi from Nazareth to bring peace and love to humanity. Despite it being not-too-thinly veiled religious fable (and not without a couple of things noticeable as parody in Life of Brian), Ben-Hur is a great success for its time, surviving today in good, not-too-dated tact.",10,6,12,11 April 2008
Casino Royale," not an all-time champion Bond film, but one that makes me anticipate Craig- and more Bond movies like this- in the future
","Casino Royale goes back to the basics in the sense that it's from an Ian Fleming novel, the first time in many years that the franchise reaches back into Fleming's old bag of tricks. That the filmmakers also decide to transfer the story- however much it sticks to the original source I can't say- from communist villains to just plain terrorist dealers and the like. It still has the formula going for it, but not cranked up as it has been in the Pierece Brosnan James Bond films as of late. And it's great to see that the sense of humor is not too keyed up on itself, but rather back to the sly, almost sophisticated lines and moments of innuendo. It's also overlong by at least five minutes, if not more, and despite a good romantic angle in the story with Daniel Craig's 007 and Eva Green's Vesper, that too could've been trimmed just a little. But the dramatic power is matched only by the ruthless abandon of the action from director Martin Campbell; not even as twisting and double-crossing a plot like this can get can get in the way of the real delights of a Bond film, which are exploited well.In fact, I'd say if for nothing else go to see the films to see Craig run, and then run some more, and kick ass and take as many names possible. The franchise decided with Craig to go back all the way to the beginning to Bond's first major assignment after making rank, by taking devious part in an ultra high-stakes poker tournament with its main guy Le Chiffre (Maks Mikkelson, excellent as a tearing-blood villain who may or may not be the middleman-bad guy). But even before this we've already seen Bond at work chasing down a hired-gun in Madagascar (quite the almost opening action sequence if I do say so), and another at an airport, which is the highlight action sequence for my money. These action scenes are done unpretentiously, and with an equal voracity on hero and foe- it's really a question of who can get who off one's back, or run faster or drive harder during these scenes. And in all of this Craig, if not as handsome as previous Bond stars, is assuredly up for the challenge of being rough and gritty in all of this. It helps to see him in this almost cold and detached secret-agent mode, as it does help make the romantic sub-plot- the usual one- with a little more depth.This romantic plot unfolds already after Bond's first semi-rendezvous with a lady in the Bahamas, with Vesper, played by Green in the great tradition of sultry leading ladies. But this time, being that she's not as big a star as some of the more recent Bond ladies, adds to her appeal. You might wonder what side she's on at first, but it's hard to question her vulnerability. One of my favorite scenes of the film, following a daunting fight in a stairwell, is in a shower, but not at all in the usual seductive way you might think once Bond enters into the shower with her. It's actually really touching, showing Bond's humility in calming her down after being frazzled like that. The romance then unfolds as one might expect, though perhaps to far too quick and extreme lengths (then again, what else do you expect from 007). There is a climax that does lean more to the emotional than the usual catharsis of 'he kills all the bad guys, yey', and actually helps to make the Bond character much more cynical and ready for detachment from his love interests than before thought.But I'm making this sound a little more ponderous than I should. Casino Royale isn't a great picture, but for the bulk of its time on screen it's extravagantly good entertainment, even when scenes are meant to be more about psychological tension like in the poker game scenes. Seein Craig and Mikkelsen face off at the table is just as enthralling as a good chase scene is. And it assuredly makes me anticipate more adventures with 007, particularly with Craig, who I think should now be poised for a great career as both Bond (for however long it will last) and as a leading man too.

Toy Story 3," few trilogies can be considered whole and complete, but this is now one of them
","Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.This is the kind of third movie that makes it a trilogy- it's hard to see it going on to a fourth film and having any kind of the same resonance- and one that seems perfectly fit together in terms of a progressing story. But where something like Star Wars saw the second film as the darkest and third one coming into (somewhat) lighter terms, this is not quite the same with Pixar's baby. Toy Story 3, with it becoming a prison movie in more than just a sense (the toys get sent to Sunnyside Daycare, run by a cute-looking but ruthless bear voiced by Ned Beatty), and what happens in said prison. To be sure, other cute things abound in the movie, from Peas-in-a-Pod to (yes) Totoro from Miyazaki's movie. But in that prison, and other things that happen such as the trip to the junkyard/landfill, it gets dark.And yet, Pixar continues their outstanding method of storytelling and entertainment: nothing is even scaled-down for kids, and nothing is too sappy for adults. A couple of obvious song choices aside- 'Dream Weaver' for when Ken and Barbie first meet, and 'Freak Out' as Ken hilariously tries on a wardrobe- there's nothing that doesn't work for kids and adults, equally, and often more-so for adults than kids (I wonder, for example, when Buzz is reset and becomes El Buzzo and speaks Spanish if the wee little ones will be able to read the subtitles). When it's funny the humor is aimed at sophisticated one-liners and, yes, sophisticated (or just well-timed) slapstick, when there's action it's intense just as in the previous Toy Stories, and when it's heartbreaking it'll make everyone in the audience cry. I wonder if Pixar has some kind of magic movie-voodoo to get the old adage to come alive: you'll laugh, you'll cry- and sometimes in the same breath! The new toys are great additions, but they never detract from the classic cast. And even with them, and the great dynamic of the daycare center and its prison atmosphere, we never get lost in the shuffle of toy conflicts and desires and dreams halted (Lotso's backstory is like a twisted version of Jessie's story from Toy Story 2). It would also be a given to say that the animation keeps getting better, a little higher quality in stylization and panache, but the animators and filmmakers also aim higher in a number of ways. The opening of the film, with its grand depiction of what's going on inside of Andy's mind as he plays with his toys, an Old West-Sci/fi hybrid complete with a train full of troll orphans and Hamm as a giant flying pig-spaceship-weapon, is so epic as to seem like it's out of a much bigger Summer Action Blockbuster than it should be. Or rather, Toy Story IS this summer's big Blockbuster, and it's epic enough to be qualified as a kind of mini-masterpiece - that is, until the rest of the film unfolds.At the least, Buzz dancing to Spanish Salsa music, and that end of the movie, make it one of the high points of Pixar's career - and this is following WALL-E and Up!",10,23,33,18 June 2010
Trainspotting," One of the Best films of the 90's
","This film has almost everything- Sex, violence, drugs, language and Iggy Pop.  The novel of this film is completely a waste of time, but when it is put on the screen like this (especially by Danny Boyle) it gets good.  The actors are electrifyingly good, especially Ewan McGregor's breakthrough performance as a Scottish youth who's trying to get off heroin.  His journey to get off drugs is funny, sad, and thought provoking.  And only in this film can you have a man swimming in a toilet.  A++",10,2,8,18 March 2000
La Vie En Rose," a case of 'star over substance'
","There isn't necessarily anything very horribly wrong with La Vie en Rose, but then again there's nothing very spectacular either. It's simply another entry in a long line of musician/star biography dramas where it's almost paint-by-numbers when it comes to the story: guy (or girl in this case) rises up from dank misery and, sometimes, poverty, bad parents, strange childhoods, etc, get past adolescent hardships and adversity, and become worldwide sensations. Then come drugs, bad relationships, more drugs or drink, the little up of fame crashing down into decay and, sometimes too, death. With the exception of a couple of twists here and there, the story presented by director Dahan of Edith Piaf, one of France's 20th century darlings, this is the formula for this film treatment as well. This one might have a few more diva touches than what we've seen lately in America with Cash and Ray Charles (i.e. some tantrums, drama backstage with drink and bad boyfriends, etc), but that's about it.With the lack of any surprise in the narrative, and Dahan's direction being competent but not too daring (montages, color me shocked!), he relies on his star to do a lot of the heavy lifting. To his credit, he has a girl who's up to the task to take on such an embodiment of struggle and minor triumph as with Edith Piaf in Marion Cotillard. She embodies such a person as Piaf through the many stages of her life, through her younger years avoiding prostitution to sing in bars and clubs and building up to a chance meeting with a teacher who pushes her to stardom on to her later years where she struggles against health problems, drink, and her relatively young passing in the 60s. She's up to the task as someone who's bright and funny and also very melodramatic when it calls for it. In a film that almost isn't worth the effort, Cotillard is willing to go through the motions with the kind of mendacity I haven't seen since Whitaker in Bird.So, do see it if you are a fan, as it features many of Piaf's quintessential songs (often sung by her, I couldn't always tell if she or Cotillard sang them, if it's the latter she's also excellent there), and for such a star turn as here. Aside from that, it's just same old story, with a couple of perks if you're a die-hard of the musical bio-pic.",6,3,6,25 March 2008
Before Sunrise," the kind of conversations we all have in reality, yet projected here in a purely cinematic fold
","Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable ('I have to tell you a secret', Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody en Espanol
","Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlet Johansson) are the two main characters of Woody Allen's latest romantic comedy, but part of the ingenuity of the film is that the third name, Barcelona, is a character itself. Aside from the locales and hot-blooded, romantic atmosphere with Spanish guitars and wine in the night and gorgeous architecture during the day, which Allen and his DP capture wonderfully, the other characters Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) seem to spring out almost naturally out of this balmy city and country. It may be Allen's last international film for a while (according to reports his next film will be back to New York), but it's maybe the best at evoking this effect of a place on the characters (or, in spurts, its Jules and Jim inspiration).Vicki and Cristina, as we learn from the Barry Lyndon-esquire authoritative narrator, are on leave from New York City in Barcelona for the summer, Vicki for studying purposes and Cristina as her friend whose looking for something new creatively after a bad acting experience and an ex-boyfriend. Almost immediately after shacking up with friends Judy and Mark (Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn), Vicki and Cristina are approached one night by local painter Juan, who tempts them (or rather Cristina) with a week end in Obejo. Cristina falls for him immediately, but Vicki, already engaged to Doug (Messina) back in New York, is resistant to his charms - which, by the end of the week end, gives way to a passionate encounter.But after this, there's more complications, and not just with Vicki and Juan (or the surprise arrival of Doug to Barcelona for an also surprise wedding) and their suppressed affections. There's also Juan's ex-wife, Maria, who had a volcanic relationship and who comes back into Juan's life while Cristina is staying with him. To say much more would reveal and spoil a lot more of the fun and romance and questions Allen raises about monogamy and the complacency of marriage. Which, on the surface, might not sound like the 72 year old filmmaker is pursuing anything new to cover, as he's explored marriage, infidelity, and, as Maria Elena says at one point to Cristina, chronic dissatisfaction with lovers.And yet when it's at its best, and here's the surprising part, Vicki Cristina Barcelona is Allen's funniest, most intelligent and well-acted romantic comedy in many years, maybe even in this decade (which maybe isn't saying a lot since this and Match Point are the closest he's reached to greatness since the 90s). It works because of the actors dedication to the material: Cruz is a total tornado of a presence here, with this and Volver her best performances to date; Bardem, again, shows his layers in Juan as a man of romance and love and lust but also tenderness and humor and rage and all these things that show how great an actor he is; Hall is very good in a part that some actresses might sleepwalk through if not coached and coaxed right; Clarkson, for just one or two scenes where she reveals her own fractured marriage to Vicki, is great; and Johansson, who as a given is stunning in her appearance, reveals again in the context of a Woody Allen movie how underrated she can be as an actress- when used right and not just as ho-hum window dressing.It also works because Allen knows how to write dialog and relationships so brilliantly, maybe better than anyone working in film today in terms of simple but all-too-complex revelations on the trapped nature of the human condition, the struggle of what love is and what it is to be an artist, or simply how to function with someone that you love, but don't 'love' in that same way one meets a sweeping-off-your-feet romance in Barcelona like so. The scenes he writes here are so good, and are so cool in being a kind of Woody-version of a Spanish soap opera (hysterical couple and three-way included, though not graphic), that he almost gets in the way of it with the narration. This last part is the only real significant flaw, as unlike in Husbands and Wives, where Allen used narration in a documentary style and to shorter bits of effect, here it takes some getting used to having a person talking as if reading excerpts from a trashy romance novel, and pops in giving those 'and then she never felt the same way again' kind of notations to a character or scene that are just unnecessary.If you love classic Woody Allen romance comedy, and you also are interested in how he's starting to get a little riskier, a little more interested in the existential angles of his characters that he's touched on off-and-on for years and has only finally (Match Point and Cassandra's Dream) opened up in full bitter glory, this is the pick of the rest of the summer, maybe even of the year. Overall, you just don't get rom-coms this smart, or just plain funny and perfectly PG-13 outrageous, as Vicki Cristina Barcelona gets.",9,5,15,25 August 2008
Sweet and Lowdown," One of Allen's Best
","Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown is a well done effort.  It looks at serious issues in a funny matter (but this is not a comedy) which Woody knows how to do terrifically.  Also, his love for the 30's and jazz bring out the best in this filmThough the acting is good, the character Emmett Ray, played by Sean Penn (in a well-deserved Oscar Nom) us not very likable.  Emmett Ray (as we find out) is a fictional character (though planned out as a real one) who is the 2nd greatest guitarist ever.  He is also narcisistic, self-indulged, and odd. At least Penn plays him to the best.  But this teaming up of Allen with Penn is a great one and the film itself was likable.",10,1,2,24 March 2000
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," works, up to a point, as overloaded soap opera, then loses sight as poetic war ensues
","I barely remembered the first film Elizabeth (though I remember still that I liked it, however without much enthusiasm to see it soon after again) before I decided, based on a few surprisingly good reviews, to seek out the 'sequel', which follows Queen Elizabeth in some of her most formidable and turbulent years in power. And it turns out to be... what I expected, with a couple of points of merit. It is, actually, not too much unlike the also recent The Other Boelyn Girl, and there's a commonality that will make some want to see it a lot more than others. The performances by the female leads are fantastic, and there's some male eye-candy for the more fashionable and iconoclastic characters (for the former, Cate Blanchett re-assumes her role, and for the latter we have Clive Owen here as Walter Raleigh, a handsome pirate- need to emphasize this again *handsome*), and it's beautifully designed. It rightfully won its costume Oscar, at the least.But the director Kapur is not without his excesses, and isn't entirely sure which movie he would prefer more- perhaps history, as it would seem, doesn't discern the two sides. Elizabeth might quietly have a 'thing' for Raleigh, but she cannot ever show it, despite him being, in a perfect world as they say, the most promising prospect to help her conceive and continue on with kingdom of Britain. But there's also her most trusted assistant, played by Abbie Cornish, who is also smitten with Raleigh, and they end up marrying and having a child behind the Queen's back. There's a lot of tension, too, with the Queen's cousin Mary (Samantha Morton in maybe the best supporting role of the movie, which maybe isn't saying much), who wants to take the crown for herself. Her plot against her, as it turns out, is seen as a treasonous turn for the Spanish, and so they put forward their offense against the UK.Now, for all that Kapur can do with the material, the best choice he does is to let the scenes of human romantic turmoil, repression, and the shortcomings of Elizabeth beside of her strengths, ring out for all their melodramatics are worth. That makes The Golden Age tolerable, even watchable in a guilty pleasure sort of way. But then when the big battle scenes at sea come, it turns into a mess. He just can't seem to direct those scenes without mucking it up with pretentious visual poetic-theatrics that bog down everything to a crawl. And because Kapur can't leave one side without the other, he's left with an enjoyable but turgid muddle on his hands, with a fiery and (color us shocked) complex Blanchett performance at the center. In fact, if you have any reason to see it at all that doesn't include an interest in costume/period pieces or old-school English history, see it for her.",6,1,1,9 April 2008
The Deer Hunter," Not the best film of 1978, but close
","The Deer Hunter was one of the group of films that, in a sense, got me into more mature dramas and other types of films almost a decade ago. I remember liking the Deer Hunter, particularly the bulk of the scenes in Vietnam and of Walken in his iconic role as the Russian roulette doomed Nick, even though the wedding scene did seem to 'drag' for me. But watching it again I'm struck by how the grandiose nature of the picture, all of the deep and sorrowful emotions let out through the toll of war on these men, still holds up for me. And the wedding scene, upon a second look, is not as overlong as I thought but a rather brave example of how a real wedding goes on in all of its celebration and bittersweet moments (the scene at the bar where the soldier says 'f*** it' is memorable for me). The Vietnam scenes are likely the best in the film, with a heap of horrific suspense with bits of sick humor (if one were to look for it). Later, there are the roulette scenes, but also contemplative ones with De Niro in the woods, and maybe the most heartbreaking of the scenes with John Savage's Steve at the hospital. It's a film that did deservedly give Michael Cimino his (at first) big reputation for creating a touching, violent epic story of the toll of that most recent war of the time. If it's not as great as the other Vietnam film of the year, Coming Home, it might be because there are some scenes that don't work as well, even with co-stars like John Cazale (sadly his last film) and Meryl Streep. But the amount of things that do click in the Deer Hunter do make it one of those possible 'essentials' for the baby-boomers; it's also, as well, a jolt of a scar war movie at times.",8,2,4,17 June 2006
Identity," Identity is Mangold trying to do something of a Stephen King work, which has it's hits and misses
","Identity has one of those spectacular starts to a suspense movie where a bunch of characters wind up in the same place due to a series of shattering, if overly-fantastic, set of circumstances.  A family driving in the car gets a spare tire from a shoe on the road dropped by a woman, the mother steps out of the car and gets knocked by another car which has an ex-cop as the driver and the passenger as an actress.  They go to a motel, where also a cop is transporting a prisoner.  But then things start to happen...The suspense works when the performances do, which is a good lot (maybe half) of the time thanks to the usual style of Cusack, Liotta, and even supporting players such as McGinley and Busey.  Yet, the other half of the time, which makes up the third act, comes off as hokeyness.  There is intrigue in what unfolds in the psychological aspect, but there's too much of a feeling of the story becoming convoluted.  It's basically a try from the director of Copland and Girl, Interrupted, to try for a Stephen King type of story- the ending should remind viewers what I mean.  Possibly worthy for a future night viewing when nothing else is on.  C+",5,1,5,26 April 2003
Beowulf," an unlikely epic blockbuster done in CGI meant for 3D; it's brutal and fun
","Robert Zemeckis and his Imagemovers team and CGI people and 'motion-capture' folks have turned out another following the Polar Express in 2004: once again the technique of a fully realized animated feature wrapped around real-actors performing only animated over. It's a little like a mix-and-match method of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, only this time with Toontown completely bleeding over LA. Speaking of bleeding over, Beowulf is not the kind of movie that will work well for the wee kiddies, the ones who maybe just have gotten a taste of Lord of the Rings; despite the PG-13, had it been animated by someone else like Ralph Bakshi, it would definitely get an R. While not on the same level of relentless video-game violence of 300, Beowulf does contend to bring in a similar contingent of an audience, while also likely alienating many who might have loved the original epic poem in the murky middle-English text. Transformed into a tale of a flawed monster killer who keeps on reminding us over and over 'I-AM-BEOWULF!' as he ascends into a position of total power as a living legend, Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman leave it more as a director's film, making little moments of nuance and strength in the epic action-movie sort of way.To be fair, Beowulf isn't very complex, which is just as well for many of the people who will go see it. There's also not much intended humor either, albeit somewhere in the similar ballpark of unintended laughs as 300 (if, perhaps, with a slightly better filmmaker at the helm). Story: Beowulf (Winstone, who's voice is about as commanding as imaginable) is called by a Danish king (Hopkins) to slay Grendel, a man-monster living in a mountain, who comes down to demolish all the people in his path based on noise vibrations that tick him off. He does slay the beast, and when Grendel's mother finds out, she goes also on a rampage of some slaughter. When Beowulf goes to confront her, he knocks her up (and why not when it's portrayed by a consistently nude Angelina Jolie), and she bears a son (not quite) unbeknownst to him. Then his son is born as a dragon, who also as Beowulf is an old king ravages the town. Take 3! Inbetween this there isn't much else story, save for a tiff between Beowulf and Malkovich's character, and some allusions to adultery in the King's marriage to the Queen (color us shocked). The reason to watch the film isn't for it's poetry in language, anyway, but for the rip-roaring sensationalism of the piece visually, as a kind of pop-art throwback to both folklore and video-games of the present. Luckily, Zemeckis has gotten rid of the 'dead-eyes' syndrome that plagued the Polar Express. It doesn't mean from time to time the characters come off a little wooden, even if it is behind layers and layers of silicon detail. What works best is seeing Zemeckis and his technical team make it as something of a marvel: when watching the shot where it pulls back all the way through the village, through the woods, and to the mountain and cave where Grendel groans in agony, the shot and the audio of the dissipating banging and singing in the King's hall makes as much of a stand-out as anything in Zemeckis's arsenal.Add to this the imagination in the fantasy elements: Grendel is one of the great creations in the realm of computer animation, right up there with Gollum and the new-and-improved Yoda; he's an abomination, with no skin and lots of deformities all very close up in 3-D, but there's a very real human quality to him too, tortured and retarded, led on by the (as a contrast) slick, golden, and attractive mother. Then back to the dragon in the climax, who is a combination of all three, and even if somehow the dragon doesn't quite work as well as Grendel, it comes close. As a piece of drama, it leans towards the silly and pompous, including a five-minute fight sequence where the animators avoid an R with the dreaded shot of Beowulf's crotch. As a piece of skillfully controlled work of eye-popping maneuvering, it almost completely makes up for the flaws in the material. It's a must-see in the sense that you should see it on a big screen, with the glasses, and as close as possible. How it is with flesh and blood characters is just so-so.",7,2,7,22 November 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," a marvelous clubhouse of a movie where we're all invited to laugh and feel happy
","I made a diorama in third grade of Fantastic Mr. Fox- a book which I loved fondly- and seeing this film brought me back to that, only better and bolder, but with the same handmade quality of someone awed by the world they read. It's also wildly funny and cheerfully light-and-heavy all at once. It brings director Wes Anderson's concerns as a filmmaker to light, as usual (dysfunctional family, idiosyncratic touches with the characters, absurd child-but-adult-like comedy), and in a setting that is a fantasy that anyone can attach to. Children will latch on to it because of its cute/creepy designs, and its raucous energy. Adults will eat it up because, like with Where the Wild Things Are, it brings us back to a time when we just want to have a fun time and do things, even if we might know or thing they're wrong, or maybe just to dance at very odd moments.Mr. Fox (George Clooney, who else?) is a sly guy with a quick mouth and a caring manner. He is a wild animal though, which is why he breaks the promise he made to his wife to not go out and steal chickens after their first child is born. He can't help it really- those nasty trio of farmers, Boggis Bunce and Bean- have all of those chickens and deliciously alcoholic apple cider just waiting for the taking. As it turns out, this makes the farmers angry as hell (or rather Bean mostly, who at one point does one of those manic 'destroy everything in the house' reactions Kane might appreciate), and they go and destroy the Fox home and all the outlying areas.From there it becomes a battle of wills and, sometimes, real fire power and acorn-bombs and a rabid dog and other wild craziness. Oh, and the stop-motion. Thanks be to someone out there: there's filmmakers still going through the painstaking but endlessly creative process of frame-by-frame film-making where it takes dozens of hours to get just a few seconds of film. People like Anderson and Henry Selick seek out the limitations so they can break through them, or toy around with them as much as possible.With the characterization of 'Mr. Fox', Anderson and his animation team gives us creatures whose hair is always slightly blowing in the wind (something that must have been hard to attain being shot frame by frame), have eyes that are motorized and look like real human eyes almost, and water (or apple cider) when it flows becomes rather dreamlike and appears like we haven't seen it before. That all of the characters have something amazing to their features, be it the way Mr. Fox gnarls his teeth and then does his trademark whistle or to how Rat clicks his fingers like a West Side Story villain, there's something happening every other second. You might figure out how this is all done, but it's not as much concern as what they do with their creations, like kids with action figures making an epic on 8mm film.Fantastic Mr. Fox has the childlike wonder, the modestly dazzling sets and production design (art-Anderson is basically the way to put it by now with his films, from the title cards of species identification to maps and chapter-headings), and an original sense of perspective when it comes to action scenes and simple little camera moves that comes off extraordinary in this setting. But it's also, mostly, hysterically funny. It's not a crude funny like the Hangover or too bizarre like the Men Who Stare at Goats. It's sometimes just plain awkward, or just totally unexpected, or built around an absurdity that comes up and down like the explanation of how to play Whackbat, or Mrs. Bean and her blindness. Or just a line of dialog ('He's just another rat found in the back of a Chinese restaurant') sets off a belly laugh that's hard to contain. This is, at the least, the funniest of all the Dahl adaptations, keeping to the surrealism of animals and humans alike, while sticking to a perfectly dry, off-handed approach by its filmmaker.As with everything else in the movie, the comedy feels home-grown, not in a Hollywood lab where everything's tested. This goes too for the excellent voice work that brings Anderson/Baumbach's dialog to fruition. In the theatrical trailer, when first seen, the voices of Clooney and Streep and Bill Murray almost distracted from the quality of the animation. But in full context, they all work, even Anderson himself as a real-estate agent creature. And the outdoor-not-in-studio recording of the voices does add something extra: you feel like there's something real going on, not just in fantasy, thanks to the actors and their 'on-set' work. I'm sure some extra ideas or expressiveness came out of this, because the performances are a great part of what makes this world so tangible: we know these people and animals, sort of, at least as much as any other Wes Anderson movie.And sure, they're foxes, but why not connect with the theme while we're at it? The film is lovely and insane, smart and silly, lovable and (for a few moments) a little scary, with a kick-ass soundtrack straight out of a record collection (and musical store) that connects just right right this spectacular place of someplace-England. And hey, why not some existentialism to top it off: 'Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?' How indeed? 'I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.'",10,67,97,22 November 2009
Speed," WOW. Thats It
","Speed is a terrific thriller/action film that gives new meaning to the word 'suspense'.  This and the fugitive are the only true thrilling movie of the past decade.  Keanu Reeves, actually not that bad, plays a cop who is going after a mad-man (Dennis Hopper who is great as the 9-fingered terrorist) who has put a bomb on a bus which will explode if the bus goes under 50 mph. This wouldn't be much of a problem, but in LA it is as much of a problem of pising off Hopper in this movie.  The most action packed, thrilling movie I've seen in a while, maybe equal to the terminator.  Favorite Line (after Hopper's head get's knocked off) Reeves- 'Yeah, but I'm taller.'  Terrific entertainment.  A+",8,4,7,30 April 2000
Son of Saul," Son of Saul is groundbreaking, and a near-masterpiece of looking at horror through cinema
","One of Martin Scorsese's great axioms is 'Cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out'. That came to mind while watching the Cannes Grand Prix winner Son of Saul, which is all about perspective and what the filmmaker chooses to put in to a film but most specifically in the foreground in focus and the background out. It's what is called in cinema-speak 'shallow depth of field' (the opposite, a wide depth of field, can be seen in most shots of Citizen Kane for a counter-example), and in the case of Laszlo Nemes' direction it's a relentless experiment that pays off very well - putting his protagonist, a Sonderkommando (or a Jew put in charge of cleaning up... the bodies, the gas chambers, doing menial tasks, anything), into the focus for pretty much the whole time.It's the sort of cinematic experiment that in a way reminded me of Birdman - long takes, keeping things going even when it should in all likelihood cut - but where Inarritu was all about keeping up the pace of a shot to get into the space of theater people, this is all about keeping things completely Harrowing and Horrifying. And even when in this Auschwitz concentration camp we don't see (like at the star) Jews being gassed, the horror is still there because we can see it on Saul's face, what he's holding back from letting out about his desperate situation (in a way it makes it more horrifying for the audience; by showing it it might be easier, by not showing it we may imagine it ourselves, or try not to).What happens with Saul (Geza Rohrig) is that he sees a young boy who has not quite died from the gas, though is put out of his misery minutes later by doctors. He knows this boy, and we soon learn that it's his son... or is it(?) I'll get to this ambiguity in a moment, but firstly the important thing with Saul is his relentless attitude toward the boy's body - first getting it out of the hands of the doctors (who will likely burn it up first chance they get) and then to find a Rabbi to say the Kaddish, the mourner's prayer, over his body before a burial. He won't stop until he can do this, even (unfortunately for some in his group of Sonderkommandos who are plotting an uprising) at the risk of his fellow prisoners.I wondered after the film ended if it would work in the same way if Nemes and his astonishing cinematographer Mátyás Erdély had performed conventional coverage - shot, reverse shot, wide shots, close-ups, etc. To be fair there are a few moments where it moves from a shot looking at Saul or from his point of view and looks to see what he sees, though these moments are packed with significance. But I think that is in large part what makes this experience so unique and one of the must-sees of the past year; it's one thing that this actor Rohrig conveys so much with this character, with his desperation and focus and drive, almost to obsessive degrees of checking every other Jew to see if they are Rabbis; it's one thing that we're seeing all of these monstrous acts (whether it's the bodies being moved around, the ashes being shoveled, the Nazi doctors bullying Saul at a crucial moment). But it all comes down to presentation: how we see this horror is what sets it apart the most, in conjunction with everything else. We know what is in the frame and what is just a little off-center, but we don't forget that it's there, and that is like a constant kick in the gut.I want to say the movie is probably great, but it just misses the mark of being in my top 10 of the year because of something that happens near the end of the story, or in the last act, with motivation (if such a story as this, which unfolds like a nightmare documentary of atrocities and behind-closed-doors hush-conversations). I can see why the filmmakers might want to try to make it unclear if the boy is or isn't his son, or to even make the metaphor that Saul is trying to save ALL of the children, but in the scope of such an incredibly grim, brutal, whatever-word-you-want-to-put-it it doesn't feel quite right. It may for some, and I don't want to take that way from anyone's experience, but just the very end didn't quite work for me on that ambiguous is-it-or-isn't-it level.But as a work of art this is one for the ages, and even more remarkably that a first-time feature director sustained the intensity and point of view for the full 107 minutes and didn't make it feel like it wasn't earned or didn't fit the material. It's a truly unique work, even as I'm not sure I can visit it again very soon for the simple reason that it does its job almost TOO well, akin to United 93 or the Russian film Come & See, also about truly unspeakable acts filmed in such a way that 'you can NOT look away, even though you wish you could.' 9.5/10",9,2,6,7 February 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," it's not horrible to see it once, but it won't have much of a place in my DVD collection
","Live Free or Die Hard will attract, and has already attracted, masses of fans of the Die Hard franchise or simply the 07 summer blockbuster crowd, looking for big huge explosions and John McClaine (Bruce Willis) as the cynical New York detective out to kill a lot of people (and there are a LOT of people this time around, by hook or by crook or car smashing into helicopter) in his mission to do whatever it is the screenwriters get him to do. Which is fine. But personally, the movie comes off like a bag of Doritos or a McDonalds burger that has 'New and Improved' in big letters on the outer box, but the contents are stale and left out in the open air for much too long. It's not necessarily 'good' for you to start with, but it should be something to make you feel good in the sense of more primal thrills. Yet I call shenanigans on this one this time. Like Superman Returns or particularly Terminator 3, the studios via the writers are left to their own devices to think up a gimmick or situation, not so much any kind of story, to pluck their big headliner hero into, and the idea is that whatever this is the audience will be fine with it as long as they get the basics of what's expected.It's not that the fourth Die Hard installment doesn't try and go for big action. On the contrary, it's got more heavy-duty action than at least the last two Die Hard installments, and probably just as much as the first. But there's a catch- actually a double catch- in the movie this time. Instead of the real work being put into the script and casting and THEN the big action set pieces and violent fights, it's the other way around, and there's a sinking sensation even from the first few minutes that this will be all too formulaic. To give some credit where it's due, it's like looking at a used Jeep that's been re-assembled a couple of times: you'll get around in it, but it's not the most enjoyable of rides. The 'new' ingredient mentioned before comes in the form of the threat this time being a high-tech scheme/plot to overthrow America by way of overriding the already over dominant presence of technology itself. The ideas behind this, of governmental control, of the abstract power of computers, are only thrown in of course as stuff to set up the picture, but there's more potential here than is really tapped- and it's potential that is already fishy by already seeming to be there as a device unto itself, no pun intended, as opposed to actually leading to other things in the movie (ala in Die Hard 3 the ideas of racism, the 'other' and so on).The only thread that continues through all the films, and maybe to a more successfully ridiculous degree this time, is money. This time the big-time ex-White House terrorist played by the practically straight-faced villain Olyphant is after billions and billions, or maybe just wiping out the system altogether. But unlike in at least the first and third installments (I haven't seen the second one in a while), it's left goofily as just a sidebar to lead up to an uber-conventional climax in an airplane hanger with the key players. Really though, even if this weren't necessarily a Die Hard movie, and it still had all the same plot elements, it would still feel re-cooked: the father over-protective of the daughter not seen again until needed for the plot; the obnoxious sidekick- here so obnoxious it hurts even in supposedly funny scenes from Justin Long; the sassy female 2nd banana to Olyphant played by Maggie Q, who is almost a ninja cyborg as opposed to a human being; the 'man in charge' at the government agency two steps behind the protagonist and antagonist; and, disappointing considering it's Kevin Smith, the oafish secret guy who pushes the plot just a little more along.I'm not opposed to big mega-buck franchises pumping out another feature from a series I've admired for a while, and I'm sure if there are others in the future (matter of fact Indiana Jones 4 comes out next summer), I'll likely be there again to plunk down a few bucks and see what comes up. But with Live Free or Die Hard, as stupidly watchable as it can be in its big-bang action sequences, it's like a watered down treatment of a blockbuster for a series that should be the toughest around. When I was younger it was a lot of wicked fun seeing a high-octane movie like Die Hard with a Vengeance (still my favorite of the lot) with Samuel L. Jackson doing as much cursing as he did in Pulp Fiction. In this installment, the 'F' bomb, considered a big no-no for the MPAA, is actually dubbed over (in lieu of a PG-13 rating) if uttered once or twice- with the perennial catch phrase cut off by a gun-shot- albeit still allowing for more 'S' words than a sailor on sabbatical and enough ultra-violent moments to make probably the original director of Die Hard wince. It's a double standard, which is bad enough, but heaped on with a predictable plot that runs its course before the movie ends it leads to almost a kind of indifference. In one word, it's 'Eh' movie-making.",5,6,16,2 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," above average comic-book sequel
","X2 was a movie I revisited before seeing the 3rd X-Men movie, and I'm reminded how director Bryan Singer, in one of his best films here, can have control, style and even moving artistry for this kind of popcorn entertainment he's now done with these two films (and will do soon with Superman perhaps) while still making it witty and dramatically engaging. That's not too common in a time when studios will gladly shill out pieces that have the painstaking (well, maybe not so much in 06) special effects and technical side to it while not having jack-s*** with the story and dialog.It helps with X2 that the actors are good professionals rising to the occasion and then some (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, even character-actor Brian Cox as Stryker brings real menace). And I liked how the relationships and/or trouble some of the characters are expanded upon with this story of a battle between the mutants and the darker forces at work. I could go on about the specific details of how certain action set-pieces are well done, or how the conflicts with the characters are proportioned well for their fates or personalities. But it comes down to something simpler- it's got that mix of a certain social attitude and relevance that isn't pushed too much into your face, just enough as the subtext for 'Hollywood' appeal. Some scenes are more standout than others (Famke Janssen's plot line has the most relevance and depth, as her's is an unintentional 'to be continued'). Overall it's an exciting time, especially as a kind of nothing-to-do movie on the weekend- as are the others in the franchise. X2 is the kind of sequel, at the least for fans, that does have the appeal of trying to top itself from the first and not going into complete wastes of logic and style. A-",8,1,2,27 May 2006
Lucy," Luc Besson's comic-book movie
","I think Luc Besson really wanted to make a comic book movie, but since he is now his own sort of 'brand' of movie-maker, he probably couldn't get a hold of, say, the X-Men or DC or even Star Wars, and why should be anyway. Because with Lucy he decided to just make ALL the comic book movies in one, with one character. This rating means not that it's really an entirely 'good' serious action movie or a serious look at how human beings are part of this great long thing called consciousness and have evolved for years and years. I'ts more like a colossal, memorable guilty pleasure.Lucy is a fairly crazy look at super powers, and how a humans brain, once going last the ho-hum 10% functionality and by tens of percents, once tapped, we can, oh I don't know, have 'Force'-like powers to push people away with the swipe of a hand, see through walls and people, learn things with instantaneous ability, and control people's actions. Oh, and once nearing the 100% mark, a super computer with the ability to time travel and look back into the beginnings of the universe. Besson has some balls, but I think what keeps this from being totally pretentious garbage, for me, is that it's not taking itself entirely seriously....or, if it is, Besson doesn't pretend he's not making a genre movie, and complete with nasty Asian gangsters (led by Choi Min Sik of Old boy, a welcome presence and he plays every scene to the subtle-over-the-top hilt), and race-against-the-clock suspense. There isn't quite so much action as I expected, or at least from the maestro behind LA femme Nikita or Taken. Or perhaps I could just see that Besson was committing so much to the premise and exploring the bullshit science that I couldn't help but chuckle as Scar-Jo contorts on the ceiling as her body is racked by the mystery drug that, after seeping into her blood following being turned by the Asian gangsters as a drug mule, gives her the initial powers.We see what happens inside of her body as she is given this new drug, and then later when she needs more of the drug how, say, her face starts to melt and she falls apart like some wax figure. The special effects and science here is matched just right for pure wild fantasy. And most of all its good how much the Hero commits to her character, especially early on when she is just a frightened woman put into a terrible situation (when she sees someone shot, at first, it really shakes her up), and then at first when she is finding this power that turns her, in slightest terms, like the Terminator.If there is a problem its that she is so monotone through portions of it that, despite (or because) of the demands of the script, she has less to play with except for her dead-straight voice. Better is near the end where it just gets So wild that she is becoming the Matrix or something. So, in other words, Lucy is kinda stupid and doesn't make sense If you try to think about with full sincerity.But if you look at it as just pure unadulterated fantasy, And a quick one at that at 87 minutes, you'll get something... different from it, that's for Damn sure. It's like if five of Grant Morrison's most eccentric comics were put in a blender and splat onto celluloid (plus an expository Morgan Freeman).",7,1,10,1 August 2014
Amélie," cute, weird, it's France
","Amelie is a film that may appeal more to some than others; those who are devourees of the French cinema food plate will really enjoy this one, those who don't might still find it amusing in it's visual humor and Tautou's incredible charm.  And that overall is what makes this somewhat even is Tautou's performance as Amelie, a sad waitress who hasn't had the most normal or happy life she could ask for who starts to give joy to others around her and thus to herself.  Lighthearted throughout with the main drag being the constant third person narration (it almost makes the story better to tell in a book than in a movie, but what can you do?)

The Sixth Sense," Well done thriller
","M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is the best thriller of the year because it has an old fashioned ghost story put in with today's modern thriller.  But what really sticks this film out (besides it's over 200 million gross and six academy award nominations) is the acting.  Bruce Willis fits in well as a troubled psychiatrist trying to help out an even more troubled boy (played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment) who has a gift in which he sees dead people.  Filled with surprises, scares and great entertainment, this film is worth a look see.",7,2,11,18 March 2000
The Producers," Mel Brooks, at his absolute finest
","Mel Brook's The Producers is his best film to date and is personally my favorite Brooks-film.  Everything in this film gets together greatly to make one big insane batch of comedy that may be repeated, but not matched.The acting is a big element here (so is Brooks' Oscar winning script).  It includes the great Zero Mostel as a low-life broadway producer, who with a nervy accountant (Gene Wilder in his best performance to date), concoct a plan to make more money from a plot, than from a hit.  To do this, they get a crazy Krout (Kenneth Mars) and a hippie actor (Dick Shawn) tocreate the worst musical ever- Springtime for Hitler (a gay romp with Eva in Berlich's garden). Wow.  Mel Brooks brings great originality and hilarity in this film that takes nazis, transvestites, and producers named after bagels into one big bundle.  Best film of 1968, and possibly the best comedy ever.",10,2,4,31 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," good news, it's a Star Wars movie. bad news... not too much (but some)
","So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this 'Episode' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It's a movie made for the fans, but it's not necessarily a 'fan-film', if that makes sense. It's the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it's a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead).First of all, the first act of this movie is magnificent. New heroes are introduced, one of which, a deflecting Stormtrooper for the newly formed First Order named Finn (though it's technically not his real name, and oddly enough his given name is an in-joke for ANH fans), is remarkable. I loved this character as someone who did seem like a new presence - not someone who is a space pirate or destined for something greater, just a guy who was raised to do just one thing and has a conscience and decides to act on it. As played by John Boyega he's the best part of the movie overall for me (yes, even with mother-f***ing Han Solo and the new cute droid BB8 included), and he gives Finn passion and fire and occasional humor but is a fully formed character; he's fulfilling the promise seen in him in Attack the Block, and I can't wait to see more of his character in the next episodes.Likewise Daisy Ridley, a new actress relatively, is very good as Rey - though she at first is another character (or I should say archetype) that's familiar via Joseph Campbell as the Hero Destined for a Journey, Ridley gives her spunk and equal fire to Boyega, and it's a joy to see how they meet and join forces in the first act. Everything about this opening is so strong, a lot of it told without dialog (and when it does come in it feels simple but just right somehow) that it's a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up. And it's not that the quality jumps off a cliff, but, for me, this first act of shaping this new world, the new evils (Adam Driver as the new sort of 'Darth' Kylo Ren), hits its high point once Han Solo (Harrison Ford, acting like he'd never left the role, he's just there) and Chewbacca come in to the picture.In a way the 'spine' of the movie, in other words the events that lead everyone from point A to B to C, are really close to that of A New Hope. At the same time, I got the feeling like Abrams, probably knowing this would be his only shot at making a Star Wars movie (whether he wants to do one again is his call, but I believe he's declined), has put EVERYTHING he'd want to do in a SW movie in one film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Abrams passion for thios world comes through in almost every frame. But it almost feels a little cramped by the time the last act comes around and as our heroes face off against Kylo Ren (following the death of a pretty damn prominent character, sort of in keeping with the family-tragedy line of the series, I can't even bring myself to say it), there's the 'Starkiller' Base, which is basically the Death Star on steroids.It's a much darker film than I expected. Matter of fact, the third act has the sort of pacing issues to the point I almost forgot about the Starkiller Base plan, and it had not really much urgency considering its level of threat. It's also a little unclear just how FAST a particular character gets Jedi-Force powers (the explanation of Rey having them is fine, but it seems like just how quickly is too much, as if she would need more, say, training to do ALL that she does, and comes off more like a story contrivance). And by the time it gets to this section of the film, where emotions are really high but callbacks are still done - even to things like, say, a trash compactor, or an Admiral Ackbar appearance - it's a bit much.The number of gripes that I can ponder over are many... and yet I still recommend the film highly. For all the little faults in the storytelling or little bits of deus ex machina (at one point involving a split in the ground that separates two characters in a dual at just the right moment), this is a full-bloodied, extremely well directed, shot with fire in the cinematographer's cortex (and a lack of unnecessary lens flares!) Star Wars movie. In the ways that ultimately count, in the spine as I mentioned, its familiarity is in keeping with how this saga has been unfolding over six films, with familial bonds and the mystical element of the Force guiding things in directions of good and/vs evil. It does what the 2009 Star Trek film, also from Abrams, did so well: reintroduce us to this universe with energy and spunk, give fans and newcomers what they want, and allow some new actors to act their buts off while giving veterans a chance to shine.Oh, and BB8 is cute as a button. If only R2 had more screen time for them as a buddy-droid team...",7,31,82,17 December 2015
RED," unapologetic fun, with its share of flaws and lots of charm from its stars
","Red is based on a graphic novel by the great comic book author Warren Ellis. To say that his first adaptation to screen isn't like the book very much might be an understatement (I've yet to read it, but it's missing things like, say, the ensemble, and much of the humor). But this isn't always a terrible thing, if the director's intentions are in the right place. For the movie of Red (or RED, with each letter coming out to be some kind of CIA thing), it's meant to be a romp with aging action stars and the gifted actors who are above 50. It says a lot of the faith in a project- and the durability of its players- when the youngin' in the group is Bruce Willis (not counting Mary Louise Parker, who is really just along for the ride). And all of the actors, almost despite the silly nature of the script at times, are game for what's doing in a story of CIA operatives brought back into the game of things.Frank Moses is living low in a setting not unlike the one Willis was in in the Whole Nine Yard movies. He finds one night, however, that a small militia is at his house at night and opens fire. Why is he targeted? What about other operatives like the in-old-age-home Joe (Morgan Freeman), or the stay-at-home lovely old lady with a big f***ing gun Victoria (Helen Mirren), or the (putting it lightly) paranoid and (putting it exactly) maniac Marvin (Malkovich). And what about this 'average Joe-ette' in Sarah, who is really along for the ride as she's been having innocent conversations as Frank's pension planner? And why is she sticking with him for so long and getting into it as much as she does?This last question is the only one that really stuck in my craw. Like another spy-on-the-lam-on-the-lover movie this year, Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, it is questionable to a fault, even with the suspend-disbelief nature of the material, that a woman who doesn't really want much to do with this guy ends up not only getting into the swing of the killing-things but also falling for Frank. This is the weak link in a story that should have a believable relationship at its center, and it doesn't really. I didn't buy the two of them together, even as Willis and Parker weren't giving bad performances... not very good either, but acceptable.So what else is there? The other actors, for one. Malkovich plays this ex-CIA guy, living in a bunker and still reeling from the every-day-for- 11-years acid trip he took and thinking anyone following him is out to kill him (and helicopters man!), with total dedication and raucous insanity. It's a pleasure to see him at work, and it's one of his most sheerly enjoyable performances, one where he isn't quite coasting but is knowing what has to be done to take the p**s out of the material. Mirren brings some class to the material too and is fine to watch, though she comes in just a wee too late to really make an impact like Malkovich - her firing lots and lots of guns does make for entertaining viewing. And Freeman, also not quite substantial a role, albeit his final scene in the movie is as good as anything he's ever done (by that I mean his best work, a mixture of hilarity and serious pathos).The action goes at a brisk and cool pace, and there's a bad-ass stand- off between Malkovich and a bunch of thugs in a docking station (sure, not believable, but it's funny, that's what counts here). The director Schwentke does go overboard with the music- it's goofy, TV style- and, again, the main romance doesn't quite click. Everything else is good, solid escapism, with well-choreographed fights such as one between Willis and Karl Urban that has a bit of adrenaline to go a long way, and likable 'serious' actors getting to have some fun.",7,1,2,12 December 2010
Flight," 'HOLD ON!' with Zemeckis' daring, full-blooded live-action comeback, and Washington in great form
","Man, what a comeback for Robert Zemeckis to live action! This is a hard-hitting drama that, from the look of the trailer, would appear to be just about the 'hero' factor of a man: what is a hero? This is a subject that with the right approach can really be commandeering. In a sense this is like Zemeckis' Taxi Driver, only substituting alcoholism (with some drugs, though the booze is the key) for insanity. Who can make a difference in this world? Can a pilot who goes on drinking benders and sniffing coke with an ex-wife and kid he doesn't see? Instinct, apparently, can kick in at the most odd and desperate times - such as when a plane malfunctions and it goes into a state of chaos. What we see with Captain Whip Whitaker, who is a risk-taking but courageous pilot, is gray area. This is not a guy we can entirely root for, and this is good. It's further complicated, and this should be the most complimentary sense, with Denzel Washington's casting. With a few exceptions in his career (i.e. Training Day), Denzel plays a guy the audience can root for. And hey, a hero-pilot is someone people love to lionize like Sullenberger 'Sully' from a few years back. But what if the guy is just messed up, or has some internal demons? The script makes reference possibly to a history of familial alcoholism; when Whip returns to his father's old farm, he, in a fit of attempting-to-get- sober, empties and throws out bottles and bottles and cans and cans of liquor. Was this all his? Zemeckis leaves this part off. Good.Washington is likable even when he is a lout. This could be a criticism that this drunk isn't a *bad* drunk, per-say. Irresponsible, sure, and aggrandizing. But it gets perspective when he's paired against another addict, who is recovering after OD'ing on heroin. The clean-up for this character was perhaps a little too quick, and there is a scene in a hospital stairwell in the middle of the night as Chip recovers where a cancer patient comes along, dropping some God-philosophy, and never appearing again. But these are faults on a small enough level that they don't really knock into what the main vision is of the film: this man, and his very real struggle: what's going to happen with the lucky but sad fact that six of the 102 passengers died(?) I really admire Zemeckis working in a gray area morally. There were hints of it in Forrest Gump (Jenny's character as not really what Forrest saw her as, and Lt. Dan's struggle to a 'life'), even Back to the Future (she's your MOM, dude!) But here it's like Zemeckis and his writer say 'screw it, let's go into it full-hog'. And the path of the character is so compelling because we care about him much more, or I did anyway, because of his flaws, of his (non-existent) parenting and his fight against the cover of lies he's surrounded himself in: the booze, the coke, the two (or was it three) mini-bottles of vodka found on the plane, and the ensuing investigation. Even the man most in Whitaker's corner, played by Bruce Greenwood in a straight-laced but well-played exasperated performance, doesn't know what the hell to do with him after a while.In a sense the film is like the best episode of the TV show 'Intervention' never made: we see this character in full dimensions, and it goes further with the performance by its star. You almost take a guy like Washington for granted when he does studio stuff like (as of late) Book of Eli or Safe House. Whip Whittaker is a character, full of pain but also dark, biting humor, warmth, charity, some madness, and Washington plays it all full tilt, but with a lot of subtlety and notes where we just have to watch him, every second of a scene where Zemeckis stays on him. It's almost more about his face, how he changes from cocky-asshole drunk with a buddy like John Goodman's character (who almost comes in like out of a Hunter S. Thompson book, almost not used enough), and when he is sitting at a meeting with his union rep and lawyer (Don Cheadle, grim-faced as usual), the movie is really about that: what is going to do - hell, like the Avengers, man: what is he PREPARED to do?",9,6,11,3 November 2012
Final Destination," 'I'll See You Soon.' One of the best films of the new year
","James Wong's Final Destination is a weird yet immensly entertaining horror film that has plenty of scares and a cool twist- the killer isn't some guy in a mask or a guy in a dress.  It's death, literally, coming for you.  The plot (spoilers I think) involves a kid who is going on a trip to Paris and on a TWA flight (I think this is a odd coincidence to TWA flight 800 plane that crashed in the summer of 1996).  But, the kid has a revelation before the flight begins that the plane is going to crash.  He gets off, and so do a few other kids in the comotion.  Two minutes later after the plane takes off, the plane crashes (talk about a messed up revelation).  But it gets better after that with the death.  Very clever, sometimes even funny, and always frightening, I think (unless nothing else comes along this year) this might be the best horror film of the year and definately one of the best teen slasher movies to come around in a while.  Best part- the mortician Tony Todd telling the kids that death is one mother****er you shouldn't mess with.  Reccomended.  A+",7,1,2,30 July 2000
Kagemusha," the 'dress rehearsal' that makes wonders on its own
","It took a couple of times for me to really take everything in with Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha. The first time around I got about as engrossed as possible with the visuals, but at the same time got confused with some of the historical-side stories in the film. Which clan attacks who, which clan will dominate, who's flag is who's? But I did know the central story of Kagemusha, the shadow warrior, who is made by the (hidden) late Lord Shingen's advisers into the Lord himself to fool his enemies and even everyone else around him, was worth telling. So on the second time around as the story wasn't as much of the issue I watched the film to really get more into it, as it is a three-hour epic (Kurosawa's second longest film, minus the unseen cut of the Idiot), It's not necessarily a dense film though, which adds to the appeal of it- each scene has enough nuance and irony to cut into the impending tragedy that looms over the Takeda clan.It's been said, most of all by Kurosawa himself, that this film was a 'dress rehearsal' for his late masterpiece Ran. Ran is the more artistically overwhelming and incredible film, but Kagemusha on its own two feet is still a staggering achievement for a director with many great films. And he pushes ahead from his 70's films as his third color film, taking from his impressive storyboards (you can see the reprints in the Criterion DVD package), creating scene after scene where colors are heightened and returned and made precisely for specific moods and settings of the scenes. Him and Bergman are the first directors I can think of who were able to move from expressive black and white films into color and still make the personal style of certain scenes challenging and powerful.Take the scene when Kagemusha is having the dream, surrounded in a sort of field of different colors and smoke, and the armored samurai pursues him. But the greatest sequence in the film, one that does go on par with the best sequence in Ran (the burning of the castle), is the final climactic battle-turned-slaughter. It's ironic that for a director synonymous with the samurai drama that he doesn't show any contact from the bullets to the charging samurai on horseback. It's all in the aftermath, the horses in slow-motion in the last throws of life, and body after body strewn with blood. Following this with Kagemusha's final stand as he runs madly through the field towards his end, it all marks as one of the supreme set-pieces ever done depicting the horror of sacrifice and futility of war. It's not one of the easier Kurosawa films in some ways, but it does contain really strong performances, as a fine interpretation of history. 9.5/10",10,0,2,3 May 2006
Rear Window," In the mid-fifties, Hitchcock brought remarkable suspense by reverting to the logic of a silent film (with an observer behind the lens as the hero)
","Many reviewers and critics have commented on Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the voyeur in Rear Window (the mere thought of a voyeur in a suspense film conjures up images from other classic Hitchcock films), and I felt that voyeuristic bug as well.  But I realized something that I hadn't thought of as I watched it for the first time- this is a return for Hitchcock to his skills as a master of silent-film chills.  As L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart in one of his most infamous performances) is in his wheelchair viewing out one perspective to other inhabitants in the apartment, the audience views right along-side him.  So, for more or less 50 percent of the film, the only sounds we hear are the sounds of mere realism, as Hitch's camera keeps a close eye on things.  As the thrills build in the second hour of the film there is considerably more dialog than the first hour.  This could, and occasionally does, present a challenge for the audience member that could either be accepted & payed off or resented- can one sit back and just watch things unfold as in a film from the 20's?  Personally, the experience of seeing these events unfold and increase was near electrifying.  Along with Stewart's performance, which ranges from amusing to terrified, compelling to frightened (i.e. Hitch's 'everyday man'), there's Grace Kelly as Lisa, who carries her own beauty & inner conflicts, and Raymond Burr as Thorvold, who could have things going a little better with his wife.  If we empathize with Jeff, it's because we become as much apart of his mind-set/POV as he already is, and that's the ticket to the film's true success.  Not only is there a magnetic kind of skill to which Hitchcock (and cinematographer Robert Burks) presents us with the apartments' supporting and minor characters and how their fates are played out against the enclosed backdrop, but the psychology of Jeff becomes parallel, or against, to the audience's.  This is the story of one man's temptation and compulsion to be involved with those he can see (much like movie-goers have with any given film), and how perception of the realities around him become ours.  Rear Window may have become dated for some movie-goers, particularly since the theme has been played on by other movies and TV shows (like The Simpsons for example).  Yet there is a certain effectiveness to it all, even in the earlier scenes, that holds an edge over imitators.  A+",10,57,83,15 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Minor flaws aside, LOTR proves itself one of the most successful trilogies in modern film
","In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end.  The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.  There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole.  Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up.  In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it.  It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place.  Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)",9,17,28,18 December 2003
Munich," Not your typical 'revenge/action' movie, but an absorbing, potent look at the cost of taking lives
","Steven Spielberg has here his best film- or at least the best in his 'gritty' sort of tradition that was hinted at in the Indiana Jones films, went full bloom in Schindler's List, and matured further with Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report- in many a moon. He uses his perfected skills at maneuvering the mis en scene, using some manipulation, but dealing as seriously as possible with a tense, haunting subject. I've seen many reviewers say the film is haunting, has a haunting quality. Indeed this is true, and it is certainly a running theme in many of Spielberg's best films. And much as it was as well with his two films which he won best director Oscars for, here he deals with not so much the difficult, intensely emotional, and seemingly un-ending power struggle between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but about the increasingly horrifying existential crisis for a man who to the government that hired him does not exist.This man is Avner, played with the utmost conviction by Eric Bana. Spielberg must have seen something in his eyes that could make him work in this role, and he does- when one looks at him, one can see the conflict that only grows deeper and darker as the film reaches its third act. He's been hired to track down and kill, with his team (which includes great character actors like Matthieu Kassovitz and Daniel Craig), the eleven Palestinian terrorists who killed the hostages in the 1972 Olympics massacre. Things go well, at first, at least under the circumstances, as Avner also gets a little close with his 'source' giving him the names of targets for hefty sums. But as they close in closer, and as the tension is consciously squeezed tighter into paranoia, things aren't going quite as planned.What makes a film like this work so brilliantly really is not what could be turned by another director into something more routine, and, indeed, condescending. Spielberg, when working with his rare R-rating to the maximum, doesn't shy away from giving us the full lot of what goes on in these raids, these bombings, shootings, plans of killing and striking back. But along the way he also gives some food for thought, so to speak, like an intriguing scene of dialog between Avner and a man in Athens (not to say too much about it, though Al Green is playing in the background). And certain scenes rank with Schindler's List showing Spielberg with a full grasp of what he MUST show the audience, however some might find it to be eye-widening or cringe-worthy (as it was for me). With his usually intuitive cameraman Janusz Kaminski, he creates this world as hellishly vivid as possible with a hand-held camera, and different color saturations for scenes (plus the lighting, which has now become Spielberg/Kaminski's trademark for the past decade).And, in the end, it comes back down to what we care about with the character(s), and the protagonist's story. Avner knows he has a job to do, getting paid immensely for something (much like the Kurtz job in Apocalypse Now) that does not 'exist'. But the questions raised about what may or may not come of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict of course cannot be answered in the course of the film, only raised to a certain extent. If there is any message to the film- and I'm sure being it a Spielberg one there is (and perhaps I didn't fully comprehend it on the first viewing, being wrapped up in the pure film-making aspect of it all)- it may be that killing, taking life, even if it is OK'd by certain interested parties, will affect the soul, and the souls of those around you. That the message coincides with a taut precision with the characters, and the impeccable storytelling, makes it all the more worthwhile. The controversy around the film may be more from people who haven't see the film than those who have. Once seen, and the initial ideas of what the film might be about are gone, the story can be watched on its own terms.",10,17,34,23 December 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Everybody's got to dream, young girl. If you don't dream... ya go
","A good, simple question to ask about a movie that now has a kind of hollowed, pop-culture (not simply cult, like full-blown, mainstream) status in the industry - the kind of flick that's crossed over to the point where Kruger, via the sequels, is like the horror movie Mickey Mouse, a verifiable commodity as much as a scary boogeyman - does it hold up? For the most part, absolutely. Wes Craven knew how to make a helluva concept; indeed, that's in large part his legacy (look at the premises for Scream, Hills Have Eyes, People Under the Stairs, they're fantastic 'log-lines' in industry parlance). How he develops them, by himself as a writer or with another scripter, is the key thing.The great thing about Nightmare on Elm Street is that when it intends to be a horror movie with its sequences set in dreams - a good 20/25 minutes of this film are the nightmares, if not more - it's scary. Or it sure does try its damndest for 1984. And as a younger person, this first one was a legitmiately good time in the dark or with friends. It would come later for flicks like 4-5-6 (especially 6, good god) for the laughs, and those are enjoyable on their own. But this original, and to an extent 3 and 7, are meant to get under your skin. And for the budget they had, they do a lot with it.The blood supply certainly helps, but also the stunt-work and the effects are incredible; the shot of Kruger poking through the wall to look over his main target, nancy, is massively impressive, and it hasn't dated. Certainly as well the other main set pieces like the body in the hallway at the school being dragged by seemingly no one (that was the image that stuck with me seeing it at a too-young age) and the attacks on the other teens. But what's really crucial is atmosphere is built, piece by piece.This isn't a guy in the woods with a sack or hockey mask, nor is it some creep over a telephone (not that Freddy won't use a phone - he does, and it's the only goofy moment in the movie with him). These are dark, boiling furnace rooms and cellars, creepy alleys where Freddy can stretch his arms wide so that his finger-knives can get you quicker. The camera and editing in these scenes, like the opening and other parts - Nancy does, indeed, go down to the cellar, making this quintessential horror in that sense - is taut but it takes its time. There are a few jump scares, but they feel earned in a way; leave it to the dream aspect to make them acceptable.The acting is good too, especially from Langenkamp, who sells this teenager who is half sure she's in control and half nuts that she might be losing her mind, and Depp in his debut is solid. I think the only issues seeing it today come in a few story choices that don't totally make sense. It might not be distracting if the rest of the movie were lessor, but because so much of this is potent and effective (even the knives coming out of the bathtub, in-between the legs, is an obvious but awesome image), when it falters it shows. How Nancy is able to put together so many traps in her house, for example, is something that seems implausible, even in the scope of a 'slasher', and I'm surprised just how blase the parents are. Maybe Nancy's mother's reaction has some point to it, and she may have a little more depth than the other adults, certainly more than straight-arrow cop John Saxon - but just when she gets interesting she drinks herself into a stupor and (very, very quickly, like as soon as Nancy leaves the house for what seems like a couple of hours) all the windows have bars over them. For... what reason? Foreshadowing? But in the grand scheme of what Craven is trying to do, these flaws are excusable. This is still an awesome effort in the ways that count; setting up a real, original threat that is like taking a Luis Bunuel premise and setting it in a demented-haunted house; the characters are not all completely worthless (even the idiot-jockish guy is more like Bobby in Twin Peaks than the jerks in Friday the 13th flicks); and I like how the concept of fear being the driving force behind Freddy's power as the conduit, something that would get more developed in part 3. It may not be my favorite slasher, but it's up there, and is certainly Craven's legacy. 8.5/10",8,1,4,3 April 2000
The Truman Show," One of the best films of the year
","The Truman Show is a dark drama that is well done by director Peter Weir, writer Andrew Niccol and star Jim Carrey as the dramatic lead.  I truly believe Carrey should have gooten the Oscar.  His performance as Truman Burbank, the simple yet always wathced (for many years) on television by millions of viewers, person should have got him the Oscar for best actor. He doesn't portray the usual goofy comic guy, but this time a simple man who is in the media crossfire, and he doesn't even know it.  It's like putting a guy who thinks everything is normal in a wrestling ring full of actors who improvise.  Well done dramatic composition that looks at how sick we have become.  Inspired by Twighlight zone-ness. A++",10,3,6,30 April 2000
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," probably my favorite of all the films
","Francis Lawrence was somehow the best (or just a right) choice for this installment of the Hunger Games series - and it seems like he did a good enough job that the producers gave him the two parter of Mockingjay - and yet it is easy to see from I am Legend. Not a flawless film, but it showed a director who knew how to put someone we care about as an audience almost inherently (Will Smith, Jennifer Lawrence) in harms way of some really f***ed up scenarios. What's different from that film to this one is that the source material isn't changed around to fit something else, it's just kept to what the book was and how strong the story and action set pieces got underway. In other words, it's loaded with superbly staged action, characters that get fleshed out more than before (both heroes and villains and one that may be in-between), and the politics of it is striking. Yes, for a blockbuster like this it can get political.Catching Fire picks up a little while after the first Hunger Games ends when Katniss and Peeta won the game (yep, both of them, one of those last-minute things/twists but it worked). What sets this off well is a scene early one where Katniss is called in to the office of President Snow (Sutherland). It's still one of those scenes you remember well from this series, where it's all about intimidation, where Snow doesn't ask but tells Katniss she must act a certain way with Peeta on camera to 'convince' the romantic angle, or there will be consequences (the way Sutherland responds to Katniss' 'I'll convince him' with 'No, convince *me*' is as sinister as acting can get). So the first part is watching Katniss and Peeta having to still put on a front of things to the world watching the winners, but also seeing how absolutely awful things are for people in the districts. And yet it doesn't seem that far off from something that could be seen in the real world: say, a badly-off urban area, or a militarized city, surrounded in fear and intimidation (except when there's rebellion, in some small and big gestures).All through this first part Lawrence is still acting in ways thats more about responding to people with looks, or downplaying what could be bigger emotions from any other actress. This works since she needs to save the BIG stuff once the story takes the major turn (though not something people will see as unpredictable due to the nature of sequels): there's an ANNIVERSARY hunger games planned, and it involves the past winners in a drawing... so Katniss is back in! It's from here that we get a sort of Hunger Games part TWO in the sense of seeing the games all over again and of course the thought is how they can do what they did in the first film better or different. What's surprising is if there was any thought that Lawrence couldn't direct this to top Gary Ross - it certainly wasn't difficult from a filmmaking stand-point.By this I mean that unlike the first movie, which was really an R-rated action movie edited down to PG-13 in a matter of how the cuts were jagged and unsettling (and not in any effective way), Catching Fire delivers really shocking action beats and moments of brutality, but nothing seems like it is cut or shot in a way that is disorientating or shot in a way that is 'off'. Lawrence gets these actors from one place to the next and yet finds time for people to sit down and have good talk. There's also the trap that could be easily fallen in to in a translation of this material, which is much smarter and sharper than the average YA lit of today but has the potential to slip into s***, but Lawrence and Hutcherson work really well off one another this time, and the additions of actors like Jena Malone and Jeffrey Wright take things up a notch: you believe these people more as people than should almost be conceivable for a genre piece.The other great addition here is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He plays Plutarch, a new game-maker chief (ok, not the most subtle name, but then how about Peeta or Snow). Like Sutherland he relishes in under-playing things at times, just delivering a look says enough than having to say extra things, but at the same time his presence as this guy who seems TOO smart in some ways, how he talks up things to Snow, makes him the most welcome addition in the film. It's actors like him and the others brought over from the first movie that sets this apart from other movies.There's high velocity thrills and kills, and you get some crazy special effects and even (yes) monsters (I still remember leeches at one point being a major threat in a mud pool or something). But it all comes back to the characters and the stakes in the time-frame for them, and most of all about the IMAGE that's presented. There's satire here, not really buried but on the contrary fully present and out there. In a way its obviousness is part of why it's kind of brilliant (if not like all-time great or anything, it's still got some sappy moments and a cliffhanger that is both devastating and kind of over the top); you know it's right here in society, but it's taken to another level in a way that takes from other science fiction stories in a fresh way.",8,2,7,30 November 2015
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A great duo in a good movie
","Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is a sleeper hit of a film because it brings a great duo into a good movie.  Without the characters Bill and Ted, this movie might have not been as good, but thanks to their crazy antics (and a performance from George Carlin that is one of his best) this film pulls through.  Especially because they are a group that is stereotyped for their time and they are going on an adventure in the past.  Not all the performances are good, but that is something you wouldn't look for in this film.  One of the best films of the 80's.",9,0,0,15 February 2000
The Matrix," One of the greatest achievements in Science-fiction film history
","Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix is an unbelieveable achievement. Not only in  the visual sense,  but in storytelling, the way society is, and much more.  And, Keanu Reeves is almost good here.Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A. Anderson, a regular Joe who is just working it today's society.  The other is Neo, a comuter hacker who has broken every single known computer hacking law.  But, he soon meets Morpheus, played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne, who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world; we are living in a world called the Matrix, which uses out brain energy to trun us into batteries.  Unbelieveable to be sure, but it is incredibly original story wise, as it sprawls into something every average movie goer can appreciate- hard boiled, visually and bloody packed action, gore and violence.The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in technology and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing, sound, sound editing and visual effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.  True, some might find the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes.  But if you can like the story and the action, you've got the key to a fantastic picture, otherwise it is another action flick (great action never-the-less). Kudos to everyone who worked on the film, making one of the best films of the year, decade and of sci-fi film history.  A++",10,16,30,5 October 2000
Godzilla," Human beings fight for relevancy in the realm of Gojira's return
","There's a monster that is making seismic shifts in the ocean... and coming up to land. No, wait, there are TWO monsters! But then there is a third... only this one is different, and is less interested in messing up humanity's s*** (maybe some other time, though it's hinted at for sure). This time it's about a fight... As for the humans...Gareth Edwards' Godzilla is average blockbuster stuff, with a boring mid section, mildly engaging but still drab climax with a few - it must be said very and gigantic - impressive special effects, and a strong first act highlighted by a very entertaining Bryan Cranston performance, who almost feels like part of another, better Godzilla movie we won't get to see. Aside from his enjoyable over the top acting, his character was the most interesting as far as exploring the mystery and even mythology behind these Radioactive beasts.And then he just leaves the movie, for reasons that should be obvious, and we are stuck with... Ken Watnabe as the lamest scientist I've seen in a while (he is there in the role, but he's one-note), David Strathairn relegated to being a military stiff, a usually decent Aaron Taylor Johnson doing passable work as the stone cold hero (he even saves a would-be short round!), and is mostly like everyone else left to spew out clichés, and Elizabeth Olson is good and believable, for the few minutes she's allowed screen time to hit the same concerned mother-wife notes.I mention all the actors because it's clear that Gareth Edwards, who previously made the low-fi fifteen grand movie Monsters that did a lot with so little, has assembled a top shelf cast and has a massive budget to work with. But the script he is working with is just too rote, what we've seen in other, sillier, dare I say better Godzilla movies of yore. Lets see: monsters of some radioactive hidden origin come up, as does the big bad green one himself, and they duke it out in a city. Only this time why have any fun with your cast when such dreadful things like radioactive creatures and such? Why not make it look drab and gray and ugly as possible? There are little things to like about the movie, aside from the aforementioned Cranston acting, such as a small set piece right before the third act gets into the swing of things where soldiers fall out from a plane seen from afar in red streaks and the scene is scored to the same space-flight music by Ligeti in 2001: A Space Odyssey. And, to be sure, sure the special effects, when they aren't obscured inside of TV frames or in darkness, are impressive. Hell, when Godzilla does take up space and becomes large and in charge, for a few minutes here and there, it's engaging. Yet I can't look over how the results are just too same old same old, and on the flip side I don't think Edwards and company get us invested enough in the humans. It's a given that it's a step-up from the last time, in 1998 with Roland Emmerich, Hollywood tackled Japan's Big One. I just wish it had more... something to it, like characters.",6,7,11,7 November 2014
Casino," 'Hey, better here than, uh, up there, y'know what I mean?'
","Casino shows that GoodFellas, the milieu if not the overall tenor as this is more of a full-blown epic in Las Vegas can still be well done when people like Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi do it right.For a long time this was among the top, top favorites from this director. I don't know if it's still one of THE bestest of the best, but it's still massively enjoyable and after all these years there's still things to love about it. And, actually, though he got the Oscar for Goodfellas, Pesci might actually be *better* here, more nuanced, crazier, more on-fire, more F-bombs. So much underrated material here.

Life," a film with good craftsmanship and acting all around. that said...
","Life works like an efficient and competent B movie with some A-movie window dressing and talent up until it's final minute. And while I'm sure people will immediately jump to the Alien comparisons due to the trailer, I thought of a lot of different sci-fi movies that I'm sure the writers behind Zombieland (a much better take-off, and funnier, than this film by a mile), so in its first moments it calls to mind 2001, and some of the camaraderie of the people on the ship and their functions as various scientists and engineers and, well, Ryan Reynolds, was like Event Horizon at its most entertaining, and I'm sure some Gravity worked its way into the script as well (the outside space scenes, and how the ship looks and moves, feels very much in tune with filmmakers who saw that movie and, naturally, it takes some time to translate that phenomenon to a 'take' on that).Now, this is for those who have seen the film (though I'll keep it spoiler free): I didn't like the ending, or I should say the final minute and what may be a denouement (the climax itself is thrilling and for a moment I thought Sony might make up for the wasted potential of their last sci-fi release, Passengers). It's not the spirit of it in and of itself, it's the execution of certain details of where actors are at a particular moment. It felt like it was a Shyamalanian-ish 'ooh, twist, gotcha', only it leaves things as... I dunno. Empty, actually, and that the studio asked for two endings and tested both, and this one somehow wound up not testing *as* bad, so they went with this. It just left me feeling 'ugh' - though having 'Spirit in the Sky' over the end credits feels like an extra cheeky kick in the groin.The rest of the movie's alright as a straight-forward, very science-filled piece of science/action fiction (until it isn't, which is... half an hour in) with a capable and spot-on cast. Actually, because of the cast alone (especially Gyllenhaal,n Bakare as Hugh the scientist that sets off nearly all of what's to come in the film, and Rebecca Ferguson who gets more emotionally intense in the last reel) and that the movie *is* well-paced, I'll bump up its rating a tad. But it could have been more than it was.",6,2,8,24 March 2017
Heat," pretty tight for a 3 hour crime epic
","Heat comes on TV, and you have see what scene is on. More than likely you'll get something really worth watching, sometimes for five minutes, other times for the whole running time. I was too young to see Heat in the theater, but soon after TV made it available. It's a film that takes to the professionals on both sides, and we have a great deal of empathy for both of them, for the tired but spot-on detective (Al Pacino) and, yes, even the ruthless criminal (Robert De Niro). Michael Mann's script is key, but it's a sense of the story, of the mood that all of those locations in Los Angeles brings, the streets, the little crevices, the diners, the architecture, the concrete and steel.There's also philosophy to Heat. It may not be a deep essay like Godard, but who'd want, or perhaps expect, it to a big Hollywood production? It's simple: Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner. This is the stance the super tough and least vulnerable criminal mastermind in 90s American cinema Neil makes, and its potent enough to match up against the hard-line stance that a detective has with his prey. The plot moves at a good pace and the wheels keep going along and Mann has these powerhouse sequences here and there (most notably the big bank robbery that turns into a battle with machine guns on the street outside), and of course the cast is large and amazing throughout (a who's who from Val Kilmer to Natalie Portman to Danny Trejo to Wes Studi).But what makes Heat endurable for such a long length aren't the actors but its substance. Mann's film is about something, about the conventions of cops and robbers, and that's what makes it work as well as it does. Sure, seeing a match-up of titans in that diner scene is enough to recommend it, but a combination of factors, of cast and direction and script, of danger and action and quiet moments, make it a kind of modern classic.",10,3,6,25 June 2009

","Star Wars is a film that started it all.  Not only the beginning of a 6 movie saga, but many other things as well.  The film takes many things as influence (Shakespeare's Hamlet, Flash Gordon serials, old voodoo stuff, and Stanley Kubrick's 2001) and it turns it into a terrific movie experience. Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes 'May the Force be With You'.  So, all hail to George Lucas for creating a timeless masterpiece such as this and for many other things (by the way though, even though I think this film is well done, Episode 5 is my favorite).",10,2,4,19 February 2000
50_50," a genuine surprise
","FAR exceeded expectations. May even be one of my favorite films of the year - combines some of the comedy one might expect from the Rogen/Goldberg camp, but with really surprisingly strong drama that is carried a lot by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of the most reliably strong actors of his age (which is pretty close to mine). Jonathan Levine takes a very personal story by Will Reiser, who had his own cancer story, and doesn't do too much to make it overtly funny or melodramatic. Like his previous film The Wackness, he knows when to add a little style (when Adam takes his first weed in a while at the hospital, the world around him is in a fog, but he's so glad to be alive even when he sees a dead body go by he laughs), and then he knows when to just let the actors take the scenes where they need to go. Everyone feels like real people, which seems to be a rare commodity coming out of Hollywood, though a strength is that it doesn't feel like it's been touched by a lot of hands or committees. In fact, this is the movie I was hoping for out of Funny People, the Apatow film from a couple of years ago which also had Rogen as the buddy of a guy suffering from a possibly deathly ailment and going through some serious existential business. Here the stakes are really felt since the lead guy, and most around him save for one big exception are good people who want to do right and sometimes just find it so hard (Bryce Dallas Howard's cheating girlfriend, who still feels human even as the closest thing to this film's antagonist). In short - a film that's funny when it wants to be (and is), and is genuinely sad and heartfelt when it must be, with especially Levitt and Huston pulling their weight as top tier talent (though Rogen and Kendrick do their fare share too). 50/50 is that little dramedy which could really make an impact on the people who won't feel shy or turn away from what's been advertised solely as a 'cancer comedy', which is not entirely accurate.",10,0,2,18 October 2011
Hart's War," Nothing special, but a good get away war/courtroom pic
","(Possible Spoilers Ahead)Hart's War tells the story of Lt. Hart (Colin Farrell, not Bruce Willis as some might assume), who gets imprisoned after getting set up on a drive through outside Berlin.  He's put on a train and sent to Stalag 6-A, where a Colonel McNamara (this is Willis) is the leader of the other soldier/inmates.  Soon though, two black soldiers are in the camp (one Terrence Howard), much to the dismay of one of the soldiers.  And even sooner enough, the white racist officer is dead, and the black man is put on trial for the murder but it could be just a frame for something bigger Willis has up his sleeve.Not much war action, but when it comes it's adequate, performances with much capability by Howard, Farrell and sometimes Willis depending on how stone-wallish he looks, and a well realized plot.  Flaws are spotted however, in the form of slight unbelievability in the set ups these soldiers have in moving around the camp/escape attempts and other things in general. In total, passable and watchable ww2 fare.  Grade: B",6,1,2,24 February 2002
Deadpool," what a (very good) Deadpool movie needed to be
","As I left the theater I told my wife, 'you know, Deadpool is kind of like the Muppets of comic book-superhero movies'. It wasn't the wisest comparison (maybe filthy f***ing Bugs Bunny is far more accurate, but I digress), in large part since the Muppets are family entertainment with an edge that can appeal to adults and yet still be good fun for kids, while Deadpool is hard-R action carnage with sometimes (ok, a good lot of the time) lines that will make many, many, many teenagers laugh (and some folks who get a few key references to things outside of this decade). I think I was just responding to the total irreverence of the whole thing, not to mention the constant breaking of the fourth wall - it's not something completely groundbreaking on its own (Spider-Man talks to the audience, for example), but here it's aware of many of the faults that have come up on comic book and super-hero movies, including its own franchise. For me one of the most cathartic moments of this or any recent movie is seeing a short but noticeable image of an action figure of Deadpool from the 2009 Wolverine movie. Which sucked.Why it did is for reasons outside of the 'not getting the character' right thing (though that's part of it), but suffice it to say what director Tim Miller (first timer! impressive that) and the writers (previously of the also super-self-conscious/meta Zombieland), needed to do was to take the p*** out of the genre while also delivering a story that had some heart to it... wait, heart, in a movie that has the 'Merc with the Mouth' Wade Wilson,, the guy who goes through Weapon-X-program-stuff and comes out with the skin of insert-TJ-Miller-Joke-Here appearance? Sure, why not? If I can take it back to the Muppets one last time those movies had heart to them underneath as well. With this Deadpool movie, there's only a couple of scenes where there's no sarcastic lines or quips or just outright 'I'll talk s*** till the cows come home' stuff, but they do help to give the movie some grounding and keep things moving along well.When I say it's hard-R, I mean it - if you take your kids, make sure they know what they're in for and that despite the appearance of the Xavier School, this is very violent and bloody and with limbs flying and heads rolling and little tiny hands regenerating and... too much said. But for me, at least in the first half of the movie before it got to the climax (which I'll get to in a moment), it was refreshing to see how violent it got. I'm not completely sure if it was Miller and the filmmaers' intentions but I suspected all of bodies laid to waste in sometimes horrifying ways is some kind of comment on how bloodless many of the comic book movies and other X-Men films can get. Sure people die and get stabbed by Wolverine and so on, but there's no consequences. Deadpool is the kind of movie where Colossus (that one big Russian metal guy who was in the other X-Men movie that I don't remember the name of) tries to tell Wade not to hurt any people on a highway where a big gun-sword-battle has happened, Wade says nobody got hurt... and then a guy just falls from up above in the background from his wounds. Oops.It's a big comic spectacle that works better as a comedy, and somewhat as a love story, than as an action film. I say this despite a relatively coolly shot and choreographed opening sequence on a highway - which gets sort of cut back to in time during Wade's introduction in flashback - since when it gets back the fights and stunt work later on, the big climax included, it's just acceptable. The real skill of Miller and his team is in letting Ryan Reynolds take this character where it needs to, which is being a constant talking-s*** badass; by the time it comes down to Deadpool facing down the man who made him who he is, 'Ajax', the tension isn't fully there just for the reason that Wilson has the ability to regenerate from his injuries (it's one of those they-worked-on-him sort of things).But what's further surprising is that the romantic side of the story works more than I expected thanks to a wonderful set up between Reynolds and Monica Baccarin as Vanessa. They trade barbs in such a way that you wonder if they'll run out of steam; some of their lines are crude, a lot of them very nasty and sex-related, and yet that made it endearing to me when things do get serious between them (the conflict of course that Wilson gets cancer, and all his troubles flow from there). If these actors didn't have good timing and chemistry it would falter, but they don't and so it doesn't, and by the time that the characters get reunited near the end the same spark is still there as are the real levels of sorrow about why they've been apart and what's kept it that way (some of it is Wilson's own doing, the sort of 'look a way I'm a hideous beast' cliché, which I forget if it's even a cliché).Could it have been less low-brow? Maybe. But it's smart enough to be exactly the kind of self-reflexive comic book movie that goes after all of the bulls*** with these movies, from the budgets to Jackman and beyond, and makes its own identity. I found it a lot of fun.",8,7,20,11 February 2016
The Replacements," 'Major League' on the football field
","If you think about it, a lot of this film owes a credit to the baseball comedy Major League which showed a bunch of nobodies on a loser team who pull through.  If you think about it (after seeing this film of course), The Replacements is just that formula on the grid iron.  Still, just because it is copied doesn't mean it isn't fun.  It is.  I just wish there was a little more originality to it.  The characters work though, which is a big help. My favorite was Jon Favreau as a crazy tackler who will attack if he sees red.  Not exactly your model football/sports film like say, Any Given Sunday was.  But it also isn't a waste of time and talent.  Which is not un-fair. B+",6,1,2,5 August 2000
Thirteen Days," An old Fashioned Nail Biter
","Thirteen Days brings back the good old fashioned (and I mean good) nailbiter film here and even if you know history (thus knowing the outcome), there is still some good stuff here.  Things that might've not been known to the average American back then now are revealed in thrilling tension that is only slightly eased by Kevin Costner who doesn't need to really be there (and has a stronger JFK accent that JFK does in this movie).  The look at the Cuban missle crisis here is the heart of the movie and it works pretty good.  Not great but good, and if your looking for a historical thriller, this is the one for the season.

300," one of the most elaborate, yet shallow exercises in 21st century epic style you'll see this year
","300 comes way of Frank Miller, the ultra-famed comic book artist and author (behind the neo-noir Sin City), and Zack Snyder, who brought us the remake of Dawn of the Dead (not a shame nor not a necessity from the original), and it's what movie audiences probably salivate for when it comes to action epics from a time period dozens of centuries ago. But because it's Frank Miller, and he's never one to skimp on being garish, gory and a tad shallow with his take on certain topics, be they 40s pulp-fiction clichés or Batman or a Spartan battle like here, it's the farthest thing from naturalism. Snyder knows this, and decides to go for broke, albeit extremely faithful to the source material (and I say this having not read this graphic novel but having read other Miller works), and it becomes another case of a comic-book getting pumped up like some kind of wild cinematic toy, in this case probably with steroids. But to say that it pretty much becomes style over substance would be too easy, because the problems that come up in the film are not just in the substance, but also in what starts to hit the viewer over the head. Not that there aren't a good many memorable, bloody and exciting images that could only come from the f***ed up mind of Miller, but there is still the all-too basic qualities to the substance too.I know I shouldn't make too much of an issue with something like substance in a film that supposes right away what its audience is: men, more than women (although I wouldn't count them out as fans entirely) into seeing men be MEN, warriors out for the kind of glory that comes with legends. The basic legend for the battle of 300 is that there were about 300 Spartans, led by Leonidas (Gerald Butler), who was the ambitious king who decided to take on the king of Persia, who claimed to be a God, instead of submitting Sparta to the rule of the Persian empire, and with it going through extremely brawny moves to not stop till the last Spartan laid to rest. More or less that, anyway, as Miller throws in certain, or make that extreme, 'peculiarities' with both sides. The Spartans, for example, consult an oracle, who is some girl that contorts around like she's in an emo music video, and there's a deformed hunchback-outcast, who turns on the Spartans and tries to bandwagon with the mega-pierced, sexual-maniacal 'heathens' that are seen as the Persians. The Persians, by the way, may not have the greatest/most blood-thirsty of warriors, but they do have ninjas with masks, and a rhino, a deformed-barbaric homunculus, and a few 'clumsy' elephants. Plus, that king/God, who's ultimate shame is that he's proved by his own people to not be a God, I guess, by Leonidas's last throw of a spear.So, as one might gather, there is a lot of 'things' going on in 300, though as far as stuff with historical pertinence, not so much. There's a fairly predictable and straightforward sub-plot with Leonidas's wife (Lena Heady) back in Sparta having to put up with a traitor in her midsts, though one she succumbs to partially. But for the most part, we're submerged into characters who redefine what it means to be 'one-dimensional', and while the acting is never actually all that bad, even from the usually barking Butler, the words Miller gives them don't do much to make it sound anything more than, well, a comic-book. Which is OK in bits and pieces, until the feeling of being practically detached from reality wears thin, including getting inundated with narration, lifted by Snyder likely from all those narration boxes one sees all the time (and somehow seemed to work better in Sin City) and during some of the BIGGEST dramatic action sequences. It may sound like the substance is a bit too much to bear and that I, as part of the audience, took it all too seriously. This is not exactly the case, really, as the storytelling in and of itself is fairly strong and worthwhile to tell- it's just that not taking it seriously makes it enjoyable in the shallowest ways possible. This is sort of amped up to 11 by how Snyder puts all of this together technically. It's another stepping stone for the world of combining CGI and live-action, where blood and body parts and heads roll off in a disgustingly enthralling way, and where environments are almost TOO dark &/or lush. There are actually very great images as well, unexpected ones, like when we see some of these walking abstractions of violence and mayhem from the Persians, or some kind of goat-man during the Persian's strange orgy scene. Even the battle scenes, sometimes, are worthy of the best parts of Braveheart and Gladiator. Yet sometimes there is too much, as with the narration, of pushing the boundaries with the style- slow-motion, for example, gets about 3/4 of the attention for all of the battle &/or anything remotely action related in the film, and Snyder's tactic with his DP and editor is to speed up for a moment, then slow down, speed up, slow down, over and over during a battle scene. It comes very close to completely abusing the usage of 32fps in action, for no good reason no less.All this aside, I'm still glad I saw 300, at least the one time on a gigantic IMAX screen where the contorted camera angles, machismo-rousing moments, and the epic sweep of a production done in such a weird way made it a fun, gory trip. And yet, it doesn't inspire to go back to it more than once, and its pleasures, however in a guilty way (I couldn't help but getting a kick out of the dead-pan manner of some shots and exchanges between the characters), are brief and not very lasting.",7,24,43,14 March 2007
Ran," My third favorite Kurosawa film- deliberately paced (not painfully so), heavy on tragedy, and glorious in overall artistry
","I would agree with Ebert's review on a point, that Akira Kurosawa, legendary director of such samurai classics as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, and Kagemusha, as well as human dramas like Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and Red Beard, could really best direct this film in his old age. There's something about his version of the doomed King Lear of Shakespeare, his Lord Hidetora Ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone in old age. Not to say that directors can't make great films when they're young, or in middle age, about a man in the dark days of the golden years (About Schmidt, Tokyo Story, Bob Le Flambeur, and Kurosawa's own Ikiru come to mind). But it's clear that Kurosawa must've seen or felt or understood at least an element of Hidetora's character, something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal. At one point when Hidetora is in a wandering, dazed state he says 'I am lost', to which his companion/caretaker Kyoami responds 'Such is the human condition.' Was Kurosawa lost as an artist and filmmaker as he tried to get his epic (which at the time of it's filming was the most expensive Japan had seen, and got some extra backing from outside European backers) off the page and onto celluloid? Hard to say, but the end result displays that even in his later days he could create a work so wonderful, so sad, so brutal, and so human that it will remain timeless. If Kurosawa deserves praise for look of the film, the pacing, the editing, every single painstakingly storyboarded (painted) shot, and his direction with the two battle sequences as well as with the quieter, more compelling scenes with the actors, the man who plays Hidetora deserves some as well (like any production of King Lear, including Godard's wild treatise with Burgess Meredith in the lead role, the actor is as important as the writer). Tatsuya Nakadai, who had roles in past Kurosawa films as a young man in Yojimbo (the gunslinger) and Sanjuro (the opponent), is awe-inspiring. Early in the film, after a mind-shattering dream, his character decides to split up his kingdom unto his three sons (Jiro, Saburo, and getting the first castle and all control, Taro), he still feels in control, and has the look of a Lord with just the right level of stubbornness and, unfortunately, naivety. Then, as everything he owns crumbles before him, there is one scene that struck me as remarkable, and then for the rest of the film I couldn't take my eyes off of Nakadai whenever he was on screen. It involves the first battle sequence, in which one of his son's comes to take over a castle, and killing all of Hidetora's men. Look at Nakadai in the scene where he's sitting down stone-faced amid the chaos going on outside, and then as he somehow manages to walk out, the fellow soldiers making way for him. He then sees one of his sons, the betrayer, and he doesn't say a word- he's already decided that his son Taro has gone too far with his position, as he rules over his domain and scares the peasants right out of the picture- and he simply walks away, as his family continues to crumble under corruption of the mind and heart.It's a sequence like that though, where the great Lord makes such a radical change, where Kurosawa and Nakadai have some of their greatest time ever on a screen. As the filmmaker treats the battle, up to a point, like a feudal-Japanese version of a Eisenstein battle (no talk, no sound effects, just the eerie, sorrowful score here applied by Toru Takemitsu) with devastation and visceral nature taken to a poetic, thoughtful level, the actor's eyes and body language are, well, indescribable almost. And if Nakadai gives the finest male performance of the film, credit is equally due to the pivotal female character, Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), who is like a Lady Macbeth taken to the next level. This is a character that's seen Lord Ichimonji destroy his castle when she was young, and now that she has her son(s) right in the palm of her hand, she'll have her revenge in guise of ego-feeding. I may not be able to recommend Ran on one level, despite it being on the painter's equivalent of a splendorous, seething portrait of royalty. Kurosawa takes his time telling the story, and to some it might even feel longer than his epic Seven Samurai. This is a work heavy on emotional nuance, on how the characters (in particular Hidetora) look unto their surroundings, how the presence of destruction and war and slayings are traumatic as opposed to being 'cool' in a stylistic way. If you're looking for a slam-bang action thriller look, elsewhere. But if you're looking for a mature film about life, death, loss, and the bonds that are kept within families, the mind, and how we accept and give forgiveness (a blind character named Lord Tsurumaru is stunning from a certain point of view), this is it. As well for the Shakespeare fan it's an absolute must-see, and it may even turn some onto Shakespeare's classic due to the fact that this film, much like Throne of Blood, contains none of the language style used in the source.",10,125,150,16 August 2004
Cube," the existence and escape of an inescapable prism - one of the smartest sci-fi/horror films of the 90s
","A fully realized but perfectly mysterious environment is created in Cube. It's a system that is hard to fathom, an intricate one but seemingly simple with the use of mathematics, but the human element, really, is the thing that keeps the characters not able, until the last fifteen minutes, to really get themselves together and get out of this 'place' that may have been created by humans or aliens or even cyborgs, or nobody at all.Cube is a great film about people with their own 'personalities'; it's appropriate, and a sweet touch, to have the opening title to homage Ridley Scott's Alien, as it's about a group of people thrust together who get picked off one by one in a claustrophobic environment. Only this time, with its set-up like the beginning of a new life itself, and the people each reflecting a stand-point that can help, damage or be neutral to the chances of escape, there's no one real 'villain' except each other.Vincenzo Natali takes the audience by the brain and doesn't let go - not the balls, mind you, though if he wants those he can get them from time to time. This is about as close to a science fiction 'No Exit', or a translation of ideas from multiple philosophers like Nietzsche and Descartes (the latter name-dropped in the film and used as a basis for mathematics), but as 'brainy' science fiction it doesn't kid those looking for just a pulse-pounding horror film either. And for anyone wanting to compare this to Saw, by the way, break it down this simply: Cube is smart, Saw is stupid. Saw starts with a semi-clever premise and shatters it with shoddy and ludicrous storytelling and characters that no one can care about. In Cube, it's just so bizarre and mechanically inspired a set-up that the characters have to be rich to keep things interesting - and they really are.Cube will make you think while it has scenes of sensationalized killings, but they're not very rampant or frequent, and rely on what we know is going to happen and taking time with the scene- or just springing the unexpected trap. The opening scene, for example, is a staggering example of taking an audience right off its feet, much like when one first sees the chest-burster in Alien; when the guy goes into the room, and we think we hear or see something *swipe* downward, only to suddenly notice that the man's entire body has been sliced into a dozen pieces, it slowly dawns on us what is going on - and if your jaw doesn't drop at that, I don't what to do for you. Or, on top of this, good old fashioned suspense with the group of guys and gals going downward into the room that can be triggered by a single voice-sound.If there's any one minor flaw it could be that a couple of the performances needed some tweaking, or perhaps went a little 'too much' in their intended paths. These two I mean Maurice Dean Witt as Quentin, the cop who with one or two little exceptions is in the same mode (ANGRY/PERPLEXED black dude) in the entire running time, and the actor Andrew Miller playing Kazan. Aside from that, the performances are quite amazing, and the characteristics of the actors make these characters fit into this warped situation all the better. And the script itself is terrific, its lines of dialog always important line-to-line be it something descriptive about one of the people or that sobering 'confession' from Holloway about designing part of the outside but still having no idea what this *is*.But at the end, you'll remember Cube the most for putting you in an unfamiliar world with the most familiar types you wouldn't (or would) want to be around in a situation like this. It's not simply about figuring out a puzzle or a game like some BS Saw-movie contraption. It's about morality and choices and the nature of construction of the mind and the soul. Deep stuff that entertains and attracts one in despite its closed-quarters and potential for being 'stagey'. an",10,1,3,2 August 2009

The Thin Red Line," Great Example of a war picture
","Thin Red Line is a great example of what a war film can be.  Unlike 1998's Saving Private Ryan (which I thought was the best film of 1998), this film doesn't have a plot with a big beginning and ending (even though that would be nice).  It just chronicles a group of soldiers and their battle in the South Pacific, and with themselves.  Good character study, and some good monologues by Sean Penn don't make this the best war film ever, but it isn't bad either.  Pretty good effort by writer/director Terreence Mallick who returns to the screen after a 20 year absence.

Green Book," Just okay when all is said and done
","So, let me get up on the soap box here for just a second ::steps up, clears throat::It may be because I have inhaled as much of the non-fiction of James Baldwin the past two years, or that I have simply paid halfway attention to whats going on in this part of this decade, or that I live in the general area that Tony Lips did (the tri-state area in the North-East), but I think Green Book underestimates the racism of the North at the time. It's often been a misconception, usually by white people (and maybe at one time when I was much younger), but just because you live in the North and around liberal areas doesn't mean that things are less racist.Indeed, it's that more subdued racism (what MLK dubbed those 'white moderates') that make a lot of trouble. From socio-economic segregation of a sort - notice that in the Bronx neighborhood Tony's family and friends live there are no black people, and the 'No Coloreds' signs are not up but they're just... Not there, and not allowed. Not really, anyway.To the movie's credit, it does touch on the fact that there is this racism that is there with working-class Italians (not that it's any great revelation in American cinema - Do the Right Thing was made decades ago and dealt with Italian caricatures, literally making pizza, being face to face with African American people with much more insight and drama/comedy etc); there is one telling beat where Tony comes home as two black handymen are working on the Lips' family kitchen, and they're given some lemonade in two glasses. When they leave, Lips puts the two glasses in the trash (and later, Linda Cardellini's wife takes them back out). This is good visual storytelling that makes the point clear: once Lips gets tasked with the plot of Green Book, which is to drive the good Doctor (Mahershala Ali) across the mid-west and deep South, there will be problems but not just with those they come across.... But then it's kinda-sorta dropped for a 'feel-good' movie about race relations.I don't know about you, but in 2018, living in just everything that's going on now (in daily news, a campus in Mississippi got vandalized with numerous nooses hung about for tomorrows Senate vote for example), I'm not sure if that's what we (white people, even more than blacks or other minorities) need to see. All this said, the movie does a good job, at least for the first two thirds, of getting an entertaining buddy story between these two Characters, with a capital 'C.'And to the actors' credit, Ali and Mortensen tap into the cliches of a, well, bouncer at the Coppacabana and classically trained PHD pianist (fluent in multiple languages, which does pay off at a key point by the way, nice writing), and whenever they are on screen I believed the actors in what they had to emote or tried to do. It's even got funny scenes and beats and lines, and while I can count the number of laughs (at least five, at most six), they are genuine laughs. Farrelly knows how to get two guys working together on screen - he's known since Dumb & Dumber - so that part is fine.But then there's that last third in particular when it hunkers down into hammering its message about race relations (if you've seen the trailer, that scene in the rain with 'if I'm not black enough and Im not white enough' etc is a cringe-tastic as it seems) and the simple attitude that after two months Tony Lips is now way cooler and, more crucially at the end, all the rest of his friends and family there for Christmas Eve are magically okay now with the ::insert Italian slang word for racist epithet here:: coming to dinner. But this is all without any real work outside of a few goopy scenes where the good Doctor helps Tony write letters to Mrs. Lips (sorry I forget his real last name right now) so he must be awesome outside of the brilliant piano playing.The movie does go a ways to make Ali's character flawed too in some basic ways - as a musician on the road he's become a loner, estranged from a brother and divorced - and in one way that I don't think is meant to be seen as a flaw, but comes up as a 'huh' bit where Tony has to get Doc out of a bind when he is... Caught in a gay moment with another man at the YMCA(?!) Okie dokie! So that also don't be a big deal since hes just Tony's boss and no judgment and we'll just leave his sexuality as something that doesn't get any more screen-time because RACISM needs to get the top shelf over homophobia and that entire grenade which... What was that??As far as the sort of if not feel good then *don't feel bad* kind of movie released by a big studio, it's not as tone deaf and potentially harmful as a Crash; it has more of the feel of a better(ish) thing that Stanley Kramer would have made (down to, if Poitier was around he would be ideal for this part): it doesn't shy from the issues, and on the contrary it tries to show what everybody (even the racists) know, which is segregation-by-law can't be sustainable.But when it comes to depicting more essential details about character, about really digging into Lips past his love for his wife and not being *that* bad because, hey, he turns down offers by the local mobsters for work even when he's down, right(?) it doesn't hold as much water. Should I wholly believe Lips wont throw out again glasses that happened to touch mouths of black working class workers, despite himself being working class, because he got Lessons in Life (and visa-versa he gives the Doctor some 'Street Life' lessons)? Not sure that I do.Why the six star rating then? When it means to be simply well-acted and more character-driven entertainment, it works - not to mention the greatest product placement for KFC in cinema history - and I enjoyed seeing these two do the absolute best they could with what they had. It's a mild recommendation. But compared to what else you can see from this year - Blindspotting, Blackkklansman, Sorry to Bother You, to an extent The Hate U Give - it's weak tea.Thank you. ::steps off::",5,65,132,8 December 2018
Fantastic Four," a disappointment as far as comic-book adaptations go in this day and age
","What makes Fantastic Four such a grave misstep of a summer blockbuster is that potential for a better movie is squandered. This potential lies mostly in what was likely a better screenplay- co-written by Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost (which was, in truth, the reason I decided to check out this movie two years after its initial release)- before the producers and other 'committee' members that usually go over and make up their own 'bits' to put into the movie took over. There are kernels of a more entertaining flick here, even as just a goofy B-movie (certain lines of dialog, like 'the clouds are accelerating' or Thing's line to kids 'don't do drugs). But there's just basic problems that end up becoming all the more apparent and actually annoying as it rolls along.For one thing the characters have been dumbed down, either by aforementioned producers or whomever (maybe it was even Frost for all I know), for a mainstream audience; they're like the fantastic four for the pre-teen mall crowd (i.e. the scene where Johnny Storm goes snowboarding with the nurse seems like it should be on one of those monitors that plays in the food court). There could still be some interesting things to have with stock characters, with one of them at least, Ben Grimm/Thing (played in maybe the only half-way decent job by Michael Chiklis), being compelling in the traditional conflicted superhero fashion of person vs individual powers. But the actors chosen are really all but second-rate, as the characters ask to be played by stars, not so much TV people (yes, even Jessica Alba, as sexy as she can be stripping off to go invisible, ho-ho); Chris Evans also makes it in my un-official book as one of the most annoying performances in any movie in the past few years.And finally, there's the actual craftsmanship being Fantastic Four, which feels the most lax. At a time period when the comic-book adaptation brings out from filmmakers their strongest gifts at making exciting action sequences, spectacular special effects, and fun comedy amid the high momentum of thrilling moments, Tim Story just doesn't cut it with the rest of them (i.e. Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, Chris Nolan). Maybe this should've been expected, as it is his first huge summer action movie, but nevertheless his skills at making action seem dynamic- chiefly with what should be a harrowing rescue scene on the Brooklyn bridge- is close to nil, and seems to not have much input into making the intentionally comedic moments, or just slight moments of wit, worth even a chuckle. And unfortunately Story isn't even outrageous enough to make Fantastic Four an awesomely bad movie, where there can be some guilty-pleasure to be had in over-the-top performances. Timing seems to be off in several scenes with the fantastic four dealing with their conflicts of newly found powers, and doesn't even have a kooky enough villain in Doom.All around, it's a let-down, mostly as one looking at the writing, which I almost feel a little sorry for (the writers, I mean, not necessarily the script as it appears in the final product), and the filmmakers don't seem to know that it lacks the dimension in character or the punch in action and visual splendor to even sit in the same crowd as a Spiderman or Batman movie.",3,7,11,17 May 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," too decently directed to be bad, too ham-fisted and stupid and vapid to be any good. an uncomfortable middle
","Twilight: Eclispe, the third in the series, this time gets David Slade, formerly of flawed but still impressive outings Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night, at the helm of the vampire-werewolf-insipid-romance 'saga' everyone loves to hate (or just hates to love I guess). And it turns out to be one of those rare cases where you watch a good director working a bad script. To face facts, all of the scripts- via the Meyer books- are terrible, hackneyed, trashy. The results this time are the 'best' of the series, however technically- some decent action and a couple of well-acted and (perhaps from the director's input) well-written scenes. But the more it tries, the more it draws attention to how vapid and s*** the main characters are. I'm reminded of that scene in Annie Hall where Woody Allen goes up to the couple on the street and asks what they do to keep their relationship going: 'Well, I'm shallow, and he's shallow, and we have nothing interesting to say.' 'Ah, so you've found something that works for you.' Why should anyone care about Bella? Perhaps cause she breathes, and has some thoughts, but what are her interests? What does she care about, aside from precious old-high-schooler Edward, or maybe 2nd-tier bare-shirted Jacob, or at the bottom of the rung her limp noodle father? If you had to ask what she was to someone who saw this movie, one might say indecisive, manipulative (or manipulated by proxy), and sees nothing ahead of the future. Perhaps she missed out on extra-curricular activities after school. But again, I kept trying to find something, anything, to latch on to to make me care what would happen to her, or what would happen with her and these two guys, who don't give her any great shakes either. That Kristen Stewart isn't a terrible actress (just, in general here, dull or annoying), makes more apparent how screwed up she is. But being screwed up doesn't always make one interesting.Perhaps more interesting are the men in her life, but of course those are 'Team' Edward and 'Team' Jacob. This time the filmmakers do try to throw some in-jokes our way as it goes with them ('Where's his shirt?' asked by Edward is maybe too knowing, especially before more shirt-less happenings go on in the runtime), and there's actually a halfway nice scene (not great, just nice) where Eddie and Jakey have a heart to heart about how they really feel, what things might be like without what's-her-name screwing with them and them screwing her metaphorically back. But really, it's just more of the same, with a plot in the story that makes things all the more obnoxious on Bella's end. So many people end up dying, or turning into vampires and then dying or being killed, and all because Bella has to have her man. Looking at them, they're a little *too* Ossie and Harriet. The kind you can't stand.Again, unlike with New Moon especially, Slade knows how to direct actors.... sometimes (Jackson Rathbone a MAJOR exception, being creepy like an incestuous love-spawn of Harpo Marx). And he knows how to even get some cool action going on, once or twice at least, such as in the big climax where the wolves, looking less ridiculous than the last film, attacking the 'bad' vampires out to get Bella. And he gets a fascinating flashback with one of the female Cullen vamps. But at the end of it all, is it worth it? Still, not really. If you're looking for a technically proficient and competent film that only some of the time has dialog making one laugh to oneself (or guffaw or belly laugh or LOL), then be my guest. But if you happen to be more like me, looking for the unintentional hilarity of teenage romance gone idiotic and morally questionable for young women in the guise of crappy vampires, you may be disappointed. The more Slade and company try, the more I just wish it were something else, like, for example, not this.",5,7,11,6 July 2010
Click," A Sandler Carol; some laughs, but way too much 'message' to recommend
","Now here's something rather paradoxical. I saw the trailer for the new Adam Sandler vehicle, Click, and it was by and large pretty funny, while obvious, and giving the impression that it would be a straight-out comedy. The set-up to the film isn't bad at all, and is sort of promising. But there's something troubling about what is even more obvious as the film goes along. It may be a matter of minutes depending on how soon it might click, no pun intended, what is going on with Sandler's character Michael. And Christopher Walken's ominous, crazy character as the kind of guide for him also brings ahead some clues. It's typical, of course, but it might have been able to bring some more creativity than ended up happening. As it is, I found myself feeling uneasy throughout the third act as Sandler's character has his remote fast-forward through many years and events leaving him in a perpetual sadness until you-know-what with a formula like this finally kicks in. That a lot of this is really overly sentimental and very movie-message like is disappointing, as the filmmakers try to turn around a usual Sandler comedy on its side for the 'Carol' side of it. That it's all wrapped up in this schematic of the film's structure really brings the film down in a way I haven't seen since Sandler's worst film 8 Crazy Nights.Luckily, when the film IS funny and Sandler and his hit or miss screenwriters get some jokes that work, they do almost as well as those of his (compared to this) classic 90s movie work. True, there are only so many times one can watch a dog have his way with a cushion, but the gag works once or twice. And there are some unexpected bits in a kind of unspoken way in Sandler's films that do spark up some laughs from the practical one-gimmick. Sometimes, too, I even found myself having big laughs when no one else in the theater had them, which I took as a good sign. Plus, the cast is, albeit a little 'uh-huh', not too bad at all for what they're required for (which includes, yes, Sean Astin in a speedo). In fact, if the entire film was just from the first turning point of figuring out the remote to when it 'turns' on him, so to speak, it would be a very good (though short) movie, with at least one or two memorable bits. But in its total running time, my patience wore thin far too many a time, leaving me at the end remembering too much what didn't work than what did. In short, it's one of Sandler and company's lesser works.",4,6,15,23 June 2006
Pineapple Express," truly, insanely and shamelessly entertaining pot-movie spoof on action movies
","It's a given that when you go to a Judd Apatow movie now (and he's only directed two, but they're still 'movies' anyway, despite the growing stable of directors) you'll know what to expect more or less. After 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and to a lesser extent Forgetting Sarah Marshall, there's an expectation- if you're tuned into the sensibility of off-the-wall, filthy but improvisational comedy- for it to be good, or even awesome in whatever 'fold' of comedy its in. Pineapple Express, for the Apatow fan, is as awesome and dumb and illogical and purely enjoyable as comedies get this year, let alone for its 'fold', which in this case is the pot comedy cross-pollinated with ridiculous 80s action flick.It's awesome, for one thing, because the screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (also responsible for Superbad) don't give a crap about making anything too, um... should I say realistic? Maybe plausible is more the word in this case, as realism implies that there isn't spoof going on here, which there is, in the kind of subtle AND over the top craziness that one loves to see done right. In this case the movie starts out with an amazing opening scene set in '1937 - The United States', where a secret government test is being done on the effects of marijuana on a soldier (which, oddly enough, make the soldier act and talk like someone in the 21st century, which makes it funnier), and there's a slight reefer madness tint to it.Then, after the initial set-up- where Dale (Rogen), a subpoena deliverer and frequent pot smoker, gets in hot water for seeing a murder take place by a villainous drug dealer caught in a war with 'Asians', and then implicates his drug dealer Saul (very uncharacteristic James Franco) by leaving 'evidence' behind of the film's title- the writers kick things off into a sly, really insane take off on 80s action thrillers. Make no mistake, they're true to the sources: this might be one of the most violent comedies ever made, a hard, capital R where the least violent bit was shown in the trailer with Franco badly, uproariously kicking his foot through the windshield during a high-speed chase.But one might ask, is the cartoonish violence enough to make it awesome? Not quite - what really clicks for a viewer who wouldn't touch pot with a ten foot mouthpiece are the actors and how much serious fun they take the material. Rogen and Franco, the latter of which giving his best performance yet (yes, best performance, see it and see what I mean compared to his so-so Spiderman parts), click instantly and work off one another in that great, somewhat predictable buddy-comedy mold. They bond, they argue, they separate for a bit, and then finally come back together for that show-stopping finale. To reveal what happens there, of course, would ruin all the fun, but everyone involved in the cast (Danny McBride, Rosie Perez, Gary Cole, Ed Begley Jr, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson, and all those Japanese or Chinese or Vietcong I can't remember) pitch in for scene after scene that never fails to rise some laughs.In fact Pineapple Express is so funny, so relentlessly action packed and loaded with the kind of dialog that's brilliant for being so natural in its crude and stupidity (again, an Apatow trademark), that it's incredible to think the director is David Gordon Green. This is almost akin to, though not to make a complete comparison, Terence Mallick or Darren Aronofsky helming a Mel Brooks production. What compelled him to take on a raucous pot-action comedy that continuously tops itself I can't totally say (save for just wanting a change of pace in genre and control over material). But it's equally incredible that he manages to get in some moments of his own sensibility into the film in those little moments when Rogen and Goldberg don't have a lot going on, when the visual aspect can be emphasized. Not to mention, on top of this, he's able and ready to direct 'genre' material without making it too serious.It's an artistic statement AND one of the most memorably brutal climaxes in recent movie history, and I loved nearly every 'what-the-hell' minute of it. Where else will I get to see bullet-strewn drug dealers and ears partly chopped off treated with the reverence of the Daily Show?",10,12,26,7 August 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," As with most things when it comes to modern (unoriginal in plot) films, it's all in the (ahem, straightens tie) execution.
","This movie takes a little while to really get started - by this I mean the first half of the movie is going through the motions as far as story goes, with the set-up being that Wick owes one of those 'blood oaths' to a criminal scumbag and, after the guy sets his house on fire (as if he expects a smile to come from Wick with this task), he has him go kill his sister in Italy, who sits on some worldwide-criminal-council thing - but once it does, and it really does about 35/40 minutes in (and even more-so once Wick comes back from Rome to NYC), it's a violent pot of fun.There's not much to intellectualize with this kind of filmmaking - like in the first movie, you get what it advertises, as Reeves kills a lot of people. I think what carries it over from being potentially boring or dreadful is that the execution is excellent. Chad Stahelski, who co-directed the first bone-crunching/guns-firing-knives-stabbing extravaganza, returns as solo director working from what must have been a thin script from Derek Kolstad. By this I mean not just in dialog, though Wick is a decidedly 'talk-less-action-and-looking-listening-more' kind of action anti-hero, but also that the director, who was a stunt-man for years, set out to craft this film completely during the shooting, with some minimal editing. What sets it apart from other action drek is Reeves as a formidable presence (the less he does, too, the better for us all), and how the director and his DP choose to shoot it, favoring comparatively to today long(er) takes and a flow to the action that is kinetic without being overly so.In other words, if you somehow dragged yourself out to Jason Bourne last summer and left with a migraine headache, then this is the opposite of that. Once the action gets to New York, and the villain character fully puts his set-up of Wick into motion (how Wick didn't see it coming is a flaw, but I'll let that go for now on this viewing), everyone is out to get Wick and the intensity comes from all of the staging. I can't stress enough that if you love action direction that has clarity and UMPH to it, this is your kind of movie. Not to mention there's the added bonus of having Laurence Fishburne as some pigeon-cooper type who also has his own underground homeless(!) criminal element going on. I wished there was more of him, as he plays this character with a perverse joy to everything (even how he wears a robe), but hopefully there's more to see in part 3 - and yes, there will be a part 3, I can assure you.The highlight I must mention before I wrap this up: a sequence involving mirrors at a museum. Oh goodness is this spectacular work! Again, there's not exactly 'story' here, but there is a progression of events and how the characters move in this environment feels less like a rip-off of a, I dunno, Enter the Dragon style climax than a part homage and then partly doing something else (at times the way the director uses color is absorbing too, like out of the best parts of Skyfall). I could watch this sequence over and over for how assured the staging is, how we always know where the characters are or, if we don't, it's not for too long, and how visceral the action is maintained in this setting. I could recommend the movie on this scene alone - that there are other set pieces that come close to its virtuosity makes it almost a must see.To close, I don't want to rate this TOO highly; at the end of the day, John Wick Chapter Two is action junk, a comic book with little on its mind but to get its guns-and-punches audience frothing at the mouth. But it keeps being an intriguing comic-book for adults, and it builds just enough from the first movie's quasi-mythology (once again Ian McShane is the 'manager' of this hotel that is exclusively for hit men and criminals it would seem). This is a world that is not entirely meant to be in a reality, but creating its own, and that kept me interested despite the familiar beats.",8,15,31,9 February 2017
Jackie Brown," Tarantino brings a toned down version of Pulp (re-review in 2010)
","'One of her brothers was a bad outlaw...' It was satisfying to see Jackie Brown on a big-screen, finally, as I had originally meant to see it when it came out in 1997. It also was fitting that the print of the film screened hadn't been updated or changed since 97, so there were parts that looked scratched and worn - ironically a Grindhouse-looking print for a QT movie that is the least Grindhouse-like movie he's made. The violence here, one of the things that people expect in his movies, is toned down; only once, when a particular character is killed in a car is it bloody or really shocking. The other few kills in the movie are off-screen or far away. That doesn't mean they don't have an impact - if anything, you feel it a bit more due to it popping out.The whole movie carries restraint to it, but this is a good thing. Tarantino isn't concerned so much with plot- though it has a kickin'-good yarn spun by Elmore Leonard to work off from - but with the characters, hanging out with them (he's said that it's 'his' Rio Bravo - just chilling out with some guys who happen to be in a story with some danger and action to it, but more-so talking about what will happen and seeing how the dominoes fall).Another thing I noticed this time, after seeing the film so many times I've lost count (though it's less than the number of lost-count-times than Pulp Fiction, more than Reservoir Dogs), is how masterful Samuel L. Jackson is here. This may be my favorite performance from him, or at least the most he's given per capita seeming to do so little, as he exudes a brooding, intelligent menace for Ordell, a guy who is, if one has to pigeon-hole him, the 'villain' of the story. But he also epitomizes the gangster-style of the Wu-Tang song 'CREAM' ('Cash rules everything around me, cream, get the money, dolla dolla bill y'all') and is serious as a heart attack about it.And yet he's not someone I outright hate as a villain or detest; he's like a cool-ass mother*****' snake who gets done what he had to get done, and is on top of everything until he isn't. Jackson makes the guy look cool, though dangerous, and he has especially great scenes in the final 20 minutes of the film where his ponytail hair is let down all like a crazy samurai and he gives his threats in a hushed tone to Robert Forster in the car. Really excellent work.Also reminded again: Pam Grier in a red dress. Oooh. Just saying.",10,5,14,26 February 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," It grows on you- it's one of the most delightful exercises in the ridiculous in cinema history
","For years I did not watch or listen to Monty Python, and in retrospect I can't entirely remember why. I remember seeing a couple of scenes from 'The Holy Grail' on television when I was younger (the notorious 'black knight' scene and the harem of girls in the castle) and not finding it uproarious as I might have expected. Maybe I'm just not into British comedy, I thought ignorantly. Then I finally gave into it, as I got to be a big fan of Terry Gilliam's films, and discovered as well that John Cleese is one of the funniest people to ever come out of Britain. Life of Brian was surprisingly witty and fun as it dug its claws into a subject of some controversy. Then I went on to this film, and it took two times to watch the film until I found it to definitely be a truly masterful effort in the delirious.The first time some of the jokes and gags and puns and visuals flew over my head, but as an emotional experience (if one could call it that) was immediate- many of the parts were funny as hell, even if I didn't think the whole was. The second time around everything fit, I laughed harder at the jokes I laughed at before, and I was officially a fan of the movie. Like another comedy classic than came out a year previous to Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles, the whole story is rather inconsequential when it comes to the set-pieces and actors in the various roles. King Arthur and the knights see a strange, God-like figure in the sky (my biggest laugh the first time around, one of many genius illustrations from Gilliam) who tells them to find the Holy Grail. So off they go, and encounter a plethora of trials and tribulations along the way.In fact, the whole film is an act of stream-of-consciousness (as was the television show, Flying Circus) where the animated bits are instrumental in taking the shape of the story, or 'skits' in the film. My personal favorites were the 'black knight', the knights who say 'ni', the 'killer rabbit' (one of the great comedy surprises I have had recently), and the boy who 'just wants to...sing!'. But even when a weaker bit might come along, it may be a bit that doesn't lack the fine visual detail and look provided by Gilliam and Terry Jones, or with some form of wit (i.e. I didn't find the 'bring out your dead' scene as extraordinary, but I wouldn't doubt it's original).Although many say that Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which starts and ends with total disregard (and fitfully so) for all logical rules in storytelling, that it's one of the funniest films ever made (which it very well could be), I feel only very slightly reserved in recommending it to anyone. If you're in the mood for a bloody, moody, very low-budget dip into medieval satire by five of Britain's most talented writer/actors (not to mention to 'token' American), it's for you. But it may prove too silly, and maybe too sporadic, to work as a whole. One thing that I can say without a doubt, however, is that it serves as an audacious move in post-modern comedy. To put it another way, Monty Python (not just this film but the TV show, movies, and albums) were a major influence on the guys who do South Park. It's crude, odd fun practically by necessity- you know what you're getting right when 'Dentist on the Job' is just 'accidentally dropped in before the movie even starts! A+",10,8,13,6 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the Best Films Ever Made!
","This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever).  The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience.",10,1,7,4 February 2000
Aladdin," Quite good
","Aladdin is upbeat, fun, funny and good entertainment.  And oddly enough, it's all due to Robin Williams.  He brings charm, humor and fun to a character that hasn't been seen in animation in a while.  The story is the tale of wonder- a street rat who wants to win the heart of a princess, so he finds a magic lamp with a genie (voiced amazingly by Williams) who grants him his wish, but consequences come around.  Great fun, especially for kids, who will learn knew characters thanks to Williams impressions. A",10,4,9,21 June 2000
Incredibles 2," What a sequel should aim to do. Not perfect, but so what
","Yes, it lacks the gigantic heart of the first movie (or the rather adult conflict within the family unit; here, Bob kinda feels like 'damn Im emasculated by my wife' for a scene and a half, but then thats dropped because Super-Baby, who is never not funny and steals the show in a fight with a raccoon, takes center stage in the sub-plot), but so what? Brad Bird is 5 for 6 (and even the weakest one is still pretty good), and shows why he's one of the vital comedy/action filmmakers around. I also dug how for a few scenes this kind of turned into hypnosis-laden V for Vendetta for kids (when it is already a bit like Fantastic Four meets Watchmen for kids).I kept wondering who the voice of Eleanor was; when I saw in the credits it's Catherine Keener, it suddenly makes sense why the character for the first two thirds of the movie moves exactly like Keener does. I also found there's a point Elastigirl and Eleanor have a conversation about gender roles and it suddenly occurred to me, 'wait... This is happening in *this* movie? Will anyone point to this movie being woke as a heart attack?",9,14,24,25 June 2018
A Walk to Remember," Fair as a date movie and chick flick, but uh...
","A Walk to Remember is puzzling as well as corny even if at moments it seems like it could be a decent movie.  It brings puzzlement to me how Mandy Moore who plays the lead girl in the movie is the 'plain Jane' type in her community.  I'm not saying she did a bad job in her role, but in any real community (yes even in Virginia where this story takes place) does anybody really think that somebody who looks like Mandy Moore would be the outcast from all the preppies?  Maybe if the film had flashbacks of her as a kid being the outcast it might be not as undoubtful to see her as an outsider, but come on.Truth be told, there were times in this movie when I thought it wasn't half as bad as I thought it would be from the trailer and commercials.  In this Nicholas Sparks based story, West plays a popular kid who gets in trouble and is sent to do some community service type things, and Moore is there volunteering and soon it unfolds with them getting sort of romantically involved, then more so, then she changes him forever, and, and... 
In total, I can see a group of teenie-bopper girls feeling and not feeling the way I did after seeing this movie and it depends more on the person whether or not they like this.  As for me, I won't watch it again unless I'M the one on the date and know I'm getting action afterwards.  Grade: Between C+ and C",6,1,4,27 January 2002
Inside Llewyn Davis," the Chilly Blue palette of the folk of NYC
","Once you get used to the washed-out, chilly-blue color scheme, it's another sad-funny tale from the Coens, mostly sad for how much life, bad luck and sometimes his own choices kicks the (albeit sometimes d*ckkish) downtrodden folk singer Llewyn Davis in the teeth. He's a captivating protagonist, possibly for all the wrong reasons (in another hands): he's not a 'cool' person to be around most of the time, he's prickly, he doesn't get along very well with the women in his life (well, certainly one, played by Carey Mulligan, her very best work yet, like revelatory), and yet he's very talented and has some soul.But it's a soulful film, about a subject that doesn't get touched on enough which is the creative person who just can't seem to breakthrough. What happens to those who have the good stuff but can't get to that one next step, or connect with a wide audience like some of Davis' other contemporaries do? What happens when the Man With The Keys that can get you into the business says, 'I don't see a lot of money here?' As a creative person/artist myself, this movie had the air of a documentary in that sense. Well... Bob Dylan can rip you off, apparently.Oscar Issac gets his breakthrough here, I must add. He makes this guy compulsively watchable and even if we don't always like him he is a real person, he's someone with a lot of warts and Isaac doesn't shy away from showing that (via the Coens' blisteringly comic/dramatic script). And for all the moments that spark out as being piercingly funny - any of John Goodman's scenes, talk about stylized, over-the-top dialog being performed with just the hint of humanity and devilishness - it's more drama than comedy. There's a scene where Davis goes to see his father, who isn't doing too well. How this unfolds, how the shots go between father and son as he plays him a song, you almost want to cry watching it. If it's not one of, you know, the Coen's top 5 best or whatever that means, it's an impressive, quality film that will last and be a kind of genuine document of that period in 1960/1961 when folks was a thing that could matter.And the morale of the story is.... take good care of your cat.",10,1,1,11 November 2014
Sin City," not quite going along with the pack of others- I recommend Sin City, but...
","...I think that maybe I have seen too many movies in this vein and style, or I have been privy to too much in the realm of dark, violent, and intriguing noir stories, but there's just something about Sin City that doesn't quite make it a masterpiece, at least for me. I wouldn't dare tell you to not see the film, especially if you're in its target area (if you look at the IMDb votes, the primary 10's are given by those under the age of 18, or 18-29, mostly males), and for auteur Robert Rodgriguez (his number of credits practically solidifies him as one), he has here achieved a different style that stands out pretty well in today's muck of Hollywood films. What can be criticized, I think, is with Frank Miller, who is more of the brain, brawn's, and flaws of Sin City as writer/co-director of the film, and originator of the comic books this film is practically copied and pasted by. I have read a couple of the Sin City comics, and I have no doubt that Miller is a gifted artist. But as a storyteller, he's hit or miss for me. Not that I am unaware of what goes into these noir stories- there's the consummate anti-heroes (haunted cops, big tough guys with a heart), the strong femme fatales, and the twisted, corrupt villains. Yet even in the best parts of Sin City there's something, well, too expectable. Not to say the actors don't do what they can or there's not enough juice in it. But at times I felt Rodriguez, through Miller, was so faithful to the original text (he called it a 'translation' as opposed to an adaptation), some of the real interesting parts were left behind. There is something in Rodriguez/Miller that speaks of talent and strength, but also total dependence on standards in the genre(s).There is no question that the content in the film is rather graphic and surreal in the violence (the ripping off of various body-parts, blood sometimes red or b&w or yellow), and on the visceral level I mentioned it serves the brutality of the stories. Take Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, whom he plays with perfect stone-cold, calm insanity. He is likely the most violent character in the film (Marv is violent, though mostly by defense), even if we don't see him committing these violent acts. Scenes involving him and Marv (Mickey Rourke, also one of the highlights of the film) are well shot, but somehow I felt a kind of by-the-numbers quality as well. It's strange to say it, and many will not feel the same way (many have commented on the film's brazen originality, which I do and don't see), there is something about the film that tries so much (and maybe too hard) to be easily liked.Rodriguez, in keeping with a very similar storytelling style of his friend Quentin Tarantino, is confident, but because it's a familiar style, it doesn't make the last segment- That Yellow Bastard- as exciting/unpredictable as it might have been as the last segment. The Big Fat Kill, which Clive Owen and Benicio Del-Toro's characters (I preferred the later's performance, Owen in his one-tone voice isn't as effective as Del-Toro) should have been last and made for a more effective ending. The story itself involves strippers, a bad-ass cop (Jackie-Boy, Del-Toro) who barks up the wrong tree, a scary hoodlum (Michael Clarke Duncan), and a possible gang war. This segment includes some of the better parts of the film, however overall feels like the weakest. There's more interest in the core of Marv and Hartigan (Bruce Willis, also good) in their stories, but with the Big Fat Kill there are, like in the other parts, flashes of genius without a distinct direction.It's not to say that Rodriguez doesn't have his strengths as a filmmaker, but one can sense when the style shifts in Tarantino's directed segment. Throughout the film, Rodriguez and Miller test with the possibilities of different colors amid the black and white texture used in the completely digital backdrop. Aside from the Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl, not quite as terrifying as Wood's Kevin), the usage of different colors isn't as fulfilling as one might expect. Except in the Tarantino scene; it reminded me of a cross between a crazy scene in an Italian horror film (Del-Toro being a zombie in Owen's head space) while including a color layout of an art film that was unique. This is one of the best scenes in the film, and something about Tarantino's direction- even within the confines of Miller's writing- rises a little above (some of) Rodriguez's work.I've realized more on the subsequent repeat viewings- which do reveal there's more to take in than at first is apparent- that Sin City is, more often than not, a good success of style over substance- the film should've received an Oscar nomination for visual effects, and even cinematography, as it is of a highly professional quality. Rodriguez and Miller, in being so in love with the technology and look of the film at their disposal, at times miss what possibilities are in the actors, what they can do with the story. Aside from some exceptions, the performances in the film are less than great, trying to sound too much like how one would picture it. The difference between a modern film-noir like Pulp Fiction and a modern film-noir like Sin City isn't necessarily with the story, but how real the actors get with the characters. 'Pulp' does that, while Sin City doesn't as much, at least to me. It's got a lot of skill and juice, at times excellent, but there's something missing in it. A-",8,3,6,7 August 2005
Saboteur," American quasi-remake of the 39 Steps with a few twists, not least of which the Statue of Liberty
","It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock repeats himself, and he wouldn't want it any other way. Like some great big old rock band that goes out on tour and lays the same songs with only minute variations in the set-list, Hitchcock's films carry so many similarities- not least of which the running 'Wrong Man' theme, which was even a title of one film in the 50s- that it's easy to point out how much Saboteur resembles the 39 Steps for good chunks of time. Even more-so than North by Northwest, which I was sure was the next-generation knock-off of 39 Steps, Saboteur posits the everyman hero, played by Robert Cummings, being set-up to take the fall for a murder, and all authorities are on the alert for his presence. He somehow narrowly gets away from a car while in handcuffs and gets through a river, holds up very briefly in someone else's cabin out in rural area, hitches along with an unlikely blonde beauty (Priscilla Lane) who wants nothing better than to turn him in, and then finally the two become both the heroes.Sound familiar? That's mostly the set-up for Saboteur, and it's sad to say that even with a bigger budget, Selznick and Universal studios backing, and some minor star power, the 39 Steps is still better overall in this variation on a solid Hitchcock tempo. In Saboteur, despite the changes made for war-time pride and the enemies being dangerous threats (i.e. tantamount to terrorists) and very well-acted threats by Otto Kruger and particularly Norman Lloyd, Hitchcock relies a lot on strange supporting turns to keep things interesting on the cross-country trip from Los Angeles to New York. Sometimes this is interesting like with the blind cabin owner, who's also Lane's father. Sometimes it's just ho-hum like with the truck driver (charicature at best). And while Cummings and Lane make a good, typically Hitchcockian couple, Cummings is no Robert Donat, and is only good in that conventional wrong-man hero kind of way (to be fair, it also wasn't Hitch's first choice). A couple of short monologues about war-time pride also feel a little dated, also sadly.This all said, when Saboteur works, and it often does, it displays its director going to town on expressing his 'camera logic', as Norman Lloyd quoted Hitchcock in an interview. Which is to say that everything makes so much sense with the style here, with how to tell the story, that it becomes a wonderful surprise to see how much Hitchcock does experiment, making things just a little more abstract like with the fire near the start of the picture (that shot of the black smoke rolling in on the background is just fantastic), or how he deals with Frank Frye reaching for and finally touching the button and setting off the explosion at the docks. But, without a doubt, it's the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie- from right after the explosion, through Radio City and the dueling gun battle on screen and in the theater, to the ferry to the Statue of Liberty, and then that wildly successful sequence up at the top and clinging on for dear life- that make it something close to a must-see for just cinema lovers in general.Somehow, Hitchcock has a way with making quintessential sequences like the Liberty Statue, and it even found its way into North by Northwest being close to a collection of the hits. Saying Saboteur isn't one of Hitchcock's best films is taking into account the picture from start to finish as it does have a derivative story and characters, even for the Master. But this also goes without saying that it does contain some of the sharpest direction, and some of the most stunning even-for-21st-century 'how did they do that' suspense, in the director's career. 8.5/10",8,0,1,11 August 2008
Gangs of New York," An American Epic...
","...Gangs of New York is indeed an American epic, telling not only a tale of revenge, but also a tale of a time capsule, A New York not many know about, with the Civil War always looming over.  There will be many a filmgoer that will consider Mr. Scorsese's work in Gangs of New York as rubbish, and true everyone can have their opinion on the landscape of 1963, but one must remember that the director, like in all of his films, has crafted such to as real and extent as can be shown in a 100 million dollar picture such as this.  As much as Scorsese took cues from avant garde and Italian filmmakers for much of his films, he also took cues from epics and Westerns, and to my view has crafted the best motion picture of the year, incorportating a saga of the city he came from and his themes from his previous pictures, most notably his references to Christianity (and for instance, his theme of destruction such as seen in Raging Bull, can be identified with many scenes, not least of which the climax).The seeds for the revenge take place in 1846, when a battle is fought against the Irish and the 'Native' Americans over the five points (parts of the slums of Manhattan), where in which William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis in one of his very best roles) slays Priest Vallon, whose son, Amsterdam Vallon (played as an adult by DiCaprio) is then taken to an orphanage until he is set out in 1863, which is when the plot unfolds. Along with the skills of Scorsese he has his actors all in great shape, Day-Lewis especially, Diaz somewhat redeeming herself after The Sweetest Thing from this year, and DiCaprio shows that every now and then he can act. Some may also criticize the way the history is represented, that the facts were skewed to tell a Hollywood story and isn't really credible to the story of the draft riots and the gangs of downtown.  I think that they may be missing the point, though I do defend the factuality- facts are always going to be skewed for a big budget picture just as this, the key is to look past that and see it as how they did in the sense of pure dramatization and if it doesn't come off as clownish or inane, and this is not the case for Gangs. 
For those looking for something insightful, daring, maybe even exhilarating, or just want to be entertained by more action after Two Towers, this is a definite pick for the holiday season.  Salud!  A++",10,0,3,20 December 2002
Windtalkers," Average, low-pointish war-fare from Woo and Cage
","(Possible Spoilers Ahead)Nicolas Cage is a marine in WW2 assigned to protect the code of the Navajo, and the soldier with it, at all costs.  Some interest pops up in earloy Navajo scenes and some decent photography spread out doesn't save this damn too typical war picture, which gives Cage and his fellow cast members (American and Native American alike) the most standard of war movie characterizations- supportive woman, nurse of course, back home writing letters (Frances O'Conner), friendly buddy (Christian Slater), racist (Noah Emmerich), et all.  Even the war scenes contain the obligatory music at inapropriate moments, give my ring to my wife, different race saves the racist, all drenched in blood.  At the end, Woo needs to go back to the movies that brought him to America in the first place and to leave his 'anti-war message', as he calls it, behind.  Grade: C (because it does try in the war action).",5,0,0,16 June 2002
Spectre," at times Spectre is a lot of fun. other times its just... over-elaborate, even for 007
","The opening sequence of Spectre will surely be a reason many people will want to get a copy of the movie after its theatrical run once it's on DVD and online, or even to just tune in if people know it'll be on TV. In one of those super-long (maybe too long?) tracking shots, Bond, in a skeleton mask during the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City, goes into a building (with a girl by his side at first), then as it looks like there's about to be some lust he breaks off to get to his actual target: some sinister figures in a building next-door. Then it goes into one of those BIG action set pieces, mostly involving a helicopter that Bond has a BIG fight in, and has to do BIG maneuvers to make sure that he doesn't take out civilians. It's one of those sequences that the public goes to 007 movies for, and I'm sure Mendes knows this. One is almost tempted to say he, so to speak, blows his wad there, but this isn't to say Spectre, the 24th Bond film, is poor by any means. Just... flawed, to say the least.This is the movie that actually, without spoiling too much, ties together the Daniel Craig Bonds that we've had so far, with the villains and the love interest in Casino Royale, Vespar Lynd, in the mix. There's really two plots which eventually converge: 007 tracking down through Rome and Austria (and eventually Tangiers) what significance a ring with an octopus insignia has and who is connected to it - semi (not really) spoiler, it means everything - and then as the new M (Ralph Fiennes) has to contend with MI6 being folded into MI5, and a new surveillance program taking shape. Oh, and MI6 may not really be what it is any more, and a whole new government program to be the 'new' spy organization takes shape.If this latter part sounds at all familiar, it should be if you've been to the movies just this year; I could've sworn I saw this very similar storyline for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, which also dealt with the 'new' taking over the 'old' and the spies we know and love having to go rogue. That doesn't happen right away in Spectre, but it's certainly in the air. The other thing that will seem familiar is... well, a lot of things, mostly if you're a Bond fan by any stretch (casual watchers may miss things, not unlike people who went to, I dunno, Star Trek Into Darkness and only, maybe, knew about Khan). The real 'sectret' part has to do with a Figure in the Shadows (that old, treasured cliché) who is played by Christoph Waltz. What does he have to do with 007? Do they know each other? All in good time, if you see the movies, you'll find out.But, again, it won't be any big surprise if you've seen other movies, like Thunderball as the primary example. Once again Mendes has visual flair and capable, stylish filmmaking (and a new DP in Hoyte who is really remarkable, barely a shade less than Deakins for Skyfall), and Craig is game to play this character the best he can. But for all of the build up of the first two acts, it felt like the third let itself down, or let me down or both. It's not that it doesn't build to something elaborate - on the contrary, it's something SO elaborate it's over-elaborate, in both how this entire Spectre organization functions and the actions that Waltz's character takes from one scene to the next as he finally takes charge as a villain. The trouble is too, as much build up as he gets and as much as Waltz soaks up playing this guy, there's not enough of him. Or, maybe there is enough, but what he does is things that we've seen Bond villains do before - or, to the point that we've seen certain elements that have been *parodied* in other films. All that's missing are fish with laser beams attached to their heads.This isn't all to say the movie is bad in any way. Spectre will deliver for fans of the franchise and just those people wanting some escape with the Martini-gun-toting-super-sex-being that is this hero. The filmmakers clearly love this world, in making characters like M and Q matter more than they might've in the past which is all well and good (Fiennes and Whishaw do well when they can), Monica Bellucci shows up and is great to see as the oldest (but, sadly, briefest) of Bond women, and the ending feels almost like the entire end to the franchise itself (not that it would be, it'd be like saying that there are no other organizations to monitor surveillance in the world oh nevermind). I may even watch it again on TV some time, but as it is plot gaps and/or set-piece over-compensation got the better of this movie.",6,11,22,8 November 2015
Braveheart," Gibson's best as director- melodramatic in better than expected measure, with bloody violence
","It was too much to take in upon first trying to watch Braveheart when I was younger. It's story is not terribly complicated, in fact it almost resembles (when taking it out historical context, which is not completely accurate to the film anyway) a 13th century Scottish version of the Mad Max series- Wallace's wife gets killed by the English, he gets revenge, and then some; he faces off in battles to finally gain freedom for Scotland. Clad in blue make-up, using his 'they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!' speech, charging ahead, and getting into a truly bloody battle that is only rivaled in 90s war/epic movie-making by Saving Private Ryan, this was what I remembered most from Braveheart when also first writing my comments. Seeing it today it's a totally different experience, as taking in the story it's very well told, with excellent performances that emphasize- unlike in Gibson's Passion of the Christ- that he can really get belief out of melodramatic performances. And when he does get his cameras up into the nitty gritty of violent confrontations, be them small (when he first takes his vengeance on the British after his wife's slaughtered, which itself is a very powerful scene) or large (previously mentioned battle), it's with a vitality and viciousness that rarely gets into Hollywood productions. There are even moments of fun (flashing the British, to 'kiss arse') and close-to-poetry (Wallace's death). It's a handsomely done work that should stand the test of time in Gibson's oeuvre. One of the best films of 1995.",9,6,13,28 April 2000
True Romance," Tarantino's most 'personal' writing; Scott gives commendable direction to all-stars
","True Romance is the work of two men, known for making movies (as TBS would say) for guys who like movies, and have one of the pick of the litter in the genre from the early to mid nineties. Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought, though that's not what we as the audience are left with, and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script (from a Roger Avary script originally) very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie (as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball), with all the cut-aways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crime-drama-thriller, then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script, and the cast performing them, Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.The story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula, among others- Clarence (Christian Slater in one of his finest) is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit, loves kung-fu movies and big guns and such, who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love, and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head (provided by Val Kilmer) to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl (Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time). He does, and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine, and high-tail it to LA to sell it, as the original (mob) owners of the coke follow after, with explosive results.For fans of the actors, in particular the supporting cast, True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies, on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of know-ables: Christopher Walken as a gangster (who would've thought?), Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops, a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film, you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen, or how many obstacles get in the way of love (and Elvis!).",10,125,162,20 September 2003
Happy Feet," what Mad Max/The Road Warrior was to the action/exploitation picture, Happy Feet is to the animated family/comedy/musical: Miller's back!
","Wow, was all I had to say after leaving this movie. I mention the director, George Miller, in the opening one line because it's of note, at least in my line of thinking, to notice where the bending-genre-conventions comes from for Happy Feet. We have seen this, to be sure, in the Babe pictures, where a pig went to great lengths to show that he was more than what his environment defined himself as. But there's even the sense of the outsider coming to save the day, against all odds, ala Mad Max in those crazy Australian films. And, like all of those previous works, Happy Feet actually works, very well, and not just for one set. Going into it maybe my expectations weren't too high, despite seeing Miller's name on the credits- his first directing a practically all-animated (computer no less, in a time where it's as common as bugs in a tree stump)- because seeing commercials I thought it would just be another cute kids movie. It also has penguins, which I thought would be sort of appealing, and the possibility that Robin Williams might finally get some good voice time in more than one role. Boy does he ever, but the film has much more for its whole audience, including even some political commentary amid the wild comedy and set pieces.What I ended up getting was some kind of bizarre, unique hybrid of the central concept of Dumbo (the loner cast-aside from his world, has to use his individuality, likely an influence of the Babe pictures), the jukebox mania of something akin to Moulin Rouge, the facts and environment of March of the Penguins (to be sure, as one can't separate one without the other), and even current events. We get the story of Mumble (Babe voice EG Daily, and Elijah Wood), who is born from an Elvis impresario (Hugh Jackman) and a supportive mother (Nicole Kidman), in a world where all the penguins sing, not just for mating but for some kind of right to live and hunt for fish. Mumble, however, can only dance, fantastically (in style via Savion Glover behind the scenes), but it doesn't sit well with Noah (Hugo Weaving), head of the elder penguins. He's first cast out by his fellow penguins for not fitting in, and being a terrible singer. He meets up with outsider penguins (headed by Ramon, voice by Williams, in one of the roles), and tries to appeal back to the group of penguins- knowing that aliens are involved somewhere. But when he's rejected again, even more harshly, his journey to find the aliens goes on, which leads to...Oh, what's the use. To go on about the plot would be fruitless, but you might get the idea from reading this how silly the movie sounds- at first. But I think Miller and his team are going for a smart ridiculous spirit, one that is actually successfully irreverent for all ages, which is one of the toughest things that any filmmaker can try for. Even tougher is to see Robin Williams tackle roles and actually succeed comically. But it's his best, most rip-roaringly hilarious (and I don't use the former term lightly) performance since Aladdin. He goes between a solemn narrator, Ramon the penguin, and Lovelace, the possible link to everything with the 'aliens'. The musical side of things could be a challenge too, as it is in the Moulin Rouge mode of not being at all original-songs, but done in an extreme, over-the-top manner with the visuals. Imagine dozens and dozens of penguins singing 'Somebody to Love' by Queen, sounds risky, but it actually works, well. In fact, Happy Feet does what Moulin Rouge did better than that film actually went for- it's a pop-culture shake-up for characters who see humans as aliens, most especially due to a lack of food.But then there's even the touch of political commentary, which is most surprising. It would be one thing to have an over the top fantasy comedy with bits of romance thrown in (and there's even some genre-breaking with what ends up between Mumble and Gloria), but it's another to be making a kind of underlying point to it all that while lost on the kids won't be lost to some in the audience. This is even something that goes back to the Road Warrior, only here it's perhaps not as explicit- one could read into the 'leader' penguins who cast out Mumble with his 'outsider' friends who are not at all like the others, or the significance when Mumble finally comes back from his self-imposed mission, as being like the now- and the control over what the fish does to the group. But that's only a side-bar- however interesting- for what's really appealing about Happy Feet. It's unexpectedly, even outrageously in its silly way, funny, and it's based totally on the characters, and building on it how ridiculous- yet within the logic of the picture believable- how singing/dancing penguins can be in this world.Too often, especially in 2006, the slew of computer-animated movies for kids that just don't seem appealing. Granted, I'm not a tot anymore, but just on the level of anything in the subject matter being anything more than 'hey, they're animals, they make stupid jokes, its worth it' is lost on me. Happy Feet stands above all the other animated pictures of this year, including Pixar's work, by delivering truly successfully excitement and absurdity in equal measure, while not doing so to a lower common denominator. I can't wait to recommend this to most of the people I know, and they're not even kids. Miller- welcome to the 21st century!",10,7,15,22 November 2006
Her," heart-shaped hard-drive
","We all want to be loved, and love someone, and this is the simple but solid emotional point that Spike Jonze hits at in Her, like a musician playing a high spirited but melancholy song of sweetness and heartache (something the protagonist even requests his iPod to play). The film takes place in some point in the future - or, since we are never told exactly when, it could just as well be an alternative reality where people just need that one extra step being already hooked up to their devices - and is about a man who writes love letters and cards to others for a living. He's good at it because, well, it comes from inside him. But coming off a divorce that's left him 'confused' as he says, an 'O.S.' Operating System, an artificially intelligent super computer that with a few simple questions is meant to be 'made' for that person, it's tempting enough to try. Going into the film, I thought it would be a sort of 'rom-com' only with a Hal 9000 (and can you say 'wackiness ensues' more than that). It's more complicated by how much Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson, so she sounds like the perfect gal already) is, a side from being a super organizer (she reads and organizes emails and correspondence), an emotional creature. But in a way this dug deeper than something Kubrick just scratched the surface at: if you can really 'be' there for someone, though not in full physical form, what does that do to the real human being on the other end? Joaquin Phoenix, aside from Jonzes delicate and mature screenplay and poetic direction, is the reason to see the picture. He imbues this 'Him' as a kind of sad dope but one that's a genuinely caring and nice fella but not always connected with his own emotions or knowing quite what to say. He is awkward with those glasses and mustache, he plays his oddball video games (an adorable aside in the film, a few times really), but projects a haunted, morose quality without it becoming tired or trite. At the same time he shows the happiness Jonze wants to portray in a relationship, whether it's with his current 'gf'. Or his once wife (Rooney Mara, and we get to know her so well mostly only through dialogue-less flash backbacks, with some editing input by Steven Soderbergh). He also plays well on some of the moments of comedy that do pop up in the film - it is Jonze, so as it is such a personal film the light and absurd comes in with the gloom - a part of this world But, like us, wondering 'what the hell is this now? Her does science fiction and technological 'if' material so well because of its subtlety. when you watch something like, I don't know, Elysium or even Minority Report, we know it's a future place and the fantasy is big and flashy and sometimes we know we are removed from that experience. Jonze wants this to just be like how it is today, and the sci-to 'catch' is there, for the most part, as a means to explore how we see and feel and experience one another. I left this film questioning so much how I can approach potentially expanding AI in the future (And now we have systems winning or at least even friggin playing on Jeopardy so it's only a matter of time emotional components are worked out). What does one do with the infinite possibilities with a self aware being. and as in Being John Malkovich, there's always another layer of chaos and wonder that is under the surface waiting to be explored, and in the third act the entire concept of an AI of this magnitude is given a frightening element: being in thousands of places at once but still 'here' at the same time, including love. But it doesn't ever quite 'feel' frightening, and that is a key thing that makes Her special.Another director might take the narrative into more conventional territory, like if Samantha and her other O.S. beings (which, after a while, they are) took over the world real Skynet style. It's still Tim Twombleys story, his journey into finding some semblance of peace with himself and the world, and if it feels at all like a personal film for Jonze it's because he sticks with that painful, powerful point of it all being about you, your other, and growth (along with the help of pleutonic friend Amy Adams, another fascinating character who we understand almost immediately). Her is must-see stuff, something with pure sentiment (not sentimentality, that edge is so fine to walk on), and an approach visually that also takes this premise and does it seriously, so when a guy is running around and laughing with his little 'pod' of a person, it isn't implausible and a joke, it's simply something 'there' in the world. That's remarkable.",10,9,18,31 December 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," one of Danny Boyle's best!
","When film can uplift someone emotionally by having two characters who should be together, (mostly) want to be together, and who are as the cliché goes 'made' for each other, and it's done without false sentimentality (different from sentiment, which Slumdog has in spades), it can be one of the best things in movies. Danny Boyle's film is one of those and, like another masterful take on romance from this year (WALL-E), it utilizes cinematic style, urgent and sometimes feverish and joyfully passionate turns with the camera and editing, to take us to incredible heights.In fact, this is very much a Capra-esqe picture, but in a manner that doesn't insult today's intelligence or betray any of the characters' genuine emotional components. Boyle plunges us into the story of Jamal (Dev Patel, as older Jamal, in an outstanding breakthrough performance), who lives a young life in the slums of Mumbai and Bombay and other places, with only his older, mischievous brother Salim, and a girl named Latika. They're the 'Three Musketeers' of the story, but they go through a series of circumstances and events that pulls them apart, brings them together, and tears them away once more via gangster connections with Salim and Latika's basic imprisonment under the mob or whoever's control.Like in any strong love story, we got to have someone to root for, and Jamal is one that makes us root for him so much along the way (not least of which when he is in the midst of his nail-biter of a shot on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire') because he is a good person, a genuine one, so much so there may be one or two scenes we might wonder if Latika is 'good enough' for Jamal's overwhelming desire to be with her, to take her away from all the terrible elements of slum life. But ultimately, they're a as pure souls as are, in their own rotten way, the criminals, and even the (eventually) conflicted brother Salim.A lot happens that I could go on more about in Slumdog Millionaire, but it's moot to try and go into the big plot points or even some of the surprising twists. This is just absolute, crystal-clear terrific storytelling by a director who trusts his actors to find the ripe nuggets of truth with the characters- what makes them basic and honest or dishonest- when faced with the various clichés or conventions or a story like this. And on top of having a great cast, and having such a wonderful and varied taste in music (some Indian, some not), and of a deft attention to the plot as it skips from back and forth from the interrogation of Jamal to childhood and back in little flashes, it's also as dazzlingly filmed and executed via cinematography as anything from Boyle's cannon.He's never one to lack appropriate style or to push the envelope just a little further to make his stories so absorbing (Trainspotting and 28 Days Later come to mind as prime examples), but rarely has one seen so much attention to the raw power of the characters and the actors as in here. Even with Millions, also dealing with mostly child actors, Slumdog Millionaire gives Boyle a showcase for his talents as a provocateur with the camera, as a constant experimenter, while making sure we don't lose sight of those he's got in his sights. It's more than just appropriate to use such force as a filmmaker for such a tender and tragic/hopeful story, it's almost required. Boyle reaches up to that and then some: some of the shots in this movie are hard to lose out of your mind (that sudden vision of the blue Hindu child during the massacre is one, but there are countless others), and I for one can't wait to revisit them again.

Mad Max: Fury Road," pure cinema - about time, but worth the wait
","What do I mean by saying that Mad Max: Fury Road, a heavy metal action movie about a group of women led by Imperator Furiosa (and that other guy, Max his name) trying to find safe haven away from the barbarians (especially a Darth Vader-style slave-master) of the post apocalyptic wastelands, by saying 'pure cinema'? It might be unfair to filmmakers who may just love to hear their characters talk. and dialog-driven films can be made cinematic in the right hands. But what I mean to say is that George Miller really would have been perfectly at home working during the silent era, when all you needed to show were images of things happening, frenetically with the occasional dialog, to get your point across. I've seen Fury Road twice in a week and I have to wonder if Miller really wanted to be Buster Keaton or Abel Gance when he was going to the movies. Not to say westerns don't figure plenty in the framework - they have since the original film, and certainly the Road Warrior is nothing without the Cowboys vs Indians aesthetic.But Miller eschews a ton of exposition at the start and puts the characters right into the thick of the story: Furiosa goes to get the gasoline for Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, formerly Toecutter oddly enough in Mad Max 1) and goes her own path - she wants to get to the Green Place with ladies that are 'property' of Joes, and she will stop at nothing to get there. Max is along for the ride, one of those great, wild visual touches has him strapped to the front of a vehicle with a grated mask over his face - and is once again the reluctant hero for this journey.We find out all of this along the way really, which shows how economical Miller is in his storytelling. He doesn't waste any time, and all that matters is keeping this bad motherf**** of a movie on a roll. The first major action sequence, a chase of the war parties against Furiosa, would be the climax of any other film. For Miller, it's just the start, and even when character try to take a rest (certainly in the first half) there's still tension and suspense going on. And when I mean by pure cinema, take the moment where Max first confronts Furiosa and the women by the truck. He has a gun on them, we know it's loaded from an incident we just saw, but they don't, so there's a level of tension for them but not so much for us. Then the gun gets wrestled away, a fight ensues (a manic fight, but cut beautifully), and yet the chase is still technically underway with the vehicles off in the distance.Very little of that, and other scenes in the film, need any dialog, though characters do still speak (Max, going back to the Road Warrior, was Miller's Man With No Name, the Ronin, the dude who says little but is a big man of action). When characters do talk, there is humanity given, even some dark humor (Nicholas Hoult's character is a good example of that). But what's so mesmerizing and awesome about Fury Road is Miller pushing the envelope even further and, in a way, correcting some things that he went with in Beyond Thunderdome. The movie is bleak but not hopeless for the characters, and there's barely a moment where the stakes aren't super high. Even a moment that is relatively calm like, yes, trying to pull the tanker out muddy sand with another vehicle a ways behind firing a machine gun this way and that (the driver's got blood in his eyes, woops), is kinetic and sensational.And throughout we see two things here that are refreshing: a style of direction and editing where you can always tell what's going on, which vehicle is in relation to the others even/especially during these bug-f*** crazy chases, and this seems to be a welcome thing during an era where action movies are cut too fast and shot too close. Miller has a method of controlled mayhem and fiasco, and so it's a film with about 3,000+ shots and barely a one is wasted. The other one is Charlize Theron. It's really her story - kind of like Eli Wallach in Good/Bad/Ugly, with Max as Clint Eastwood - and her performance is rough, powerful, sometimes stoic but also sometimes incredibly emotional, and she's not afraid in the slightest to show vulnerability just as much as the courage and bad-ass-ery. It's one of those woman action heroes and performances that'll be up there with the greats.Miller started in Ozsploitation with the first movie, and as the Maxs have gotten bigger in size and budget he hasn't lost the spirit of making things madcap, from the gnarled vehicles and character designs to a man who plays guitar that shoots out flames while on top of a rig (and drummers on the back). Why does this guy keep doing this? Well... he loves it, that's why! If you can dig the idea of seeing that, then you should dig seeing the whole thing: it delivers compelling heroes, nasty villains, an unforgiving landscape, and details that'll make you want to come back to see what you missed. At 2 hours it almost feels like 'that's it'? And last but not least, Hardy is a fine new Max, making his own of the role that previously got Mel Gibson his career kick-started. He may not have the same level of charisma as Gibson perhaps, but the devilish fun and cunning is still there, the wild gunslinger who will kill you if he has to but would (deep down) rather not, is there in Hardy, and I can't wait to see more of what he does with the role in future films.",10,11,25,23 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Born to Kill meets Peace.
","Do any of you fine people remember Full Metal Jacket? Pvt. Joker in Vietnam has a helmet that features the words 'BORN TO KILL' on one part and right by it is a peace symbol. He is asked about it by a superior officer who finds it to be a sick joke, and Joker responds that it's part of the 'duality of man, the whole Jungian thing.' In that sense, Hacksaw Ridge is the most Jungian war movie ever made, and I'm not sure if that's entirely a great thing. It may be fascinating after the fact, that it could be a film that's worth talking about after it ends, but while watching it this dichotomy is bizarre. I think part of this too goes back to Francois Truffaut's quote about war movies, that it's very difficult, close to impossible, to make an anti-war film when the action itself makes war look like a bloody good action movie.Platoon was one of the only films to be anti-war and have action in it that was well shot and executed. Hacksaw Ridge isn't that really. Its first half actually does, what I found, a decent and compellingly dramatic job of showing this guy Desmond Doss (sic) and how in his upbringing around a drunk PTSD'd father (a terrific Hugo Weaving) and nearly killing his brother (and, later on we learn, his father too in a fight), it's actually clear to see why he would embrace non-violence so strongly. Even if the guy never picked up a Bible in his life, his experiences inform his worldview, it's just that the word on killing- thou shalt not of course- extends to Doss in a way that is his total conviction. He even has a fairly sweet romance with a girl in the film and all that is fine; if anything the first half of the film, including a training sequence with Vince Vaughn in a role that reminds one how he can do dramatic work (and be funny while doing it), is engaging.But that second half is where Gibson gets to let loose and get into being BLOODY MEL Gibson (ala Bloody Sam Peckinpah, though not anywhere near Peckinpah's real innovations in filming violence in such an eye and rhythm that revolutionized things, this doesn't do that). The battle scenes here could lay claim to being the most gruesome in the history of cinema - at the least somewhere Spielberg has to be going 'damn... that's a bit much' - and maybe some of that is part of who Gibson is as a (sigh) artist, going back to Braveheart and on through Passion and Apocalypto, a man who seems as compelled to show ALL of the brutality the way that Doss was compelled to never pick up a gun, not once. And objectively, this action is intense and, maybe, in a few moments, exciting and intense as hell.The message of this character can't help but contradict how this filmmaker sees war, and this dichotomy, again going back to that 'Born to Kill/Peace' ideal, is taken a little too literally to the point where Mel's/Desmond's man Jesus is taken into account here. Another thing structurally is that Hacksaw Ridge feels its length over almost 2 1/2 hours the most in the final stretch, the last half hour, when Desmond becomes a superhero practically speaking (ironically Gibson in interviews has put down superhero movies of the modern era). Is it true that he saved 75 people at this battle? I take the movie at its word, but there comes a point where it makes its hero SO heroic that it strains credulity. I'm not talking about whether it was true in real life, I mean more-so in the scope of the film's interpretation of it. Not to mention, Gibson *does* indulge in the kind of violence that I have to wonder if the real Desmond Doss would recoil at, including showing a (I think) Japanese general committing Harakiri at the moment of realizing the battle really is over. Uh... okay! If all you're looking for is a bloody, gory, maggots-all-in-the-corpses-and-there-are-the-rats-too action-war movie, then certainly it's inarguable Gibson delivers, and it's a step up in quality from the (I know I'm alone in this opinion I don't care) schlock that was his last film 10 years ago, Apocalypto. But that split between the hero's convictions, religious or otherwise, and how much this film basically revels in this brutality of the flesh, is hard to take. I felt exhausted by the end of this, for good and bad reasons. 6.5/10",6,7,20,27 November 2016
Warcraft," if you're a hardcore WoW fan maybe there's something in it for you. For me... nope.
","In this story of orcs vs humans, the audiences lose out whether they know it or not. If this is a 'passion project' for Duncan Jones, and I can believe that it is, he has some damn nerdy, generic passions. And just because you may immerse yourself in a game doesn't mean you can immerse yourself the same way in a film, and tone matters so much in this kind of instance.I confess that about 75/80 minutes in I was tempted to walked out (I stuck it through but nodded off near the end). It wasn't going to get any better, and it probably wouldn't get much worse, but damn if I was going to let me and my wife's dinner plans wait any longer through this dribble. Suffice to say I feel confident in saying I saw the movie even if I didn't see it until the credits rolled. Once you've seen one dumb-lazy ass sequence you've seen them all. The only saving grace here is Ben Foster, and even he is wasted somewhat.and lastly about that it's unfair to compare this to Battlefield Earth, which a few critics have done. That was really entertaining, as horrible and miserable an experience that was/is/will always be, and Warcraft, for how much money and time and effort was put into it by its special effects and make-up crew, isn't. Maybe closer to Dungeons & Dragons from 2000, with the same obsessive interest in nerdom, but at least that (I can't believe I'm giving that film some credit) had the capacity to EXPLAIN certain things, little things that would make elements like magic make some modicum of sense, and an actor going full-hog for so-bad-it's-funny entertainment like Jeremy Irons. Foster comes close but not enough.A unique specimen in Hollywood blockbuster terrain, though nevertheless a wasted one, and I don't know if the extra 40 minutes (excised from the theatrical version) would do much to salvage the mostly wooden acting and fantasy mumbo-jumbo.",3,15,30,17 June 2016
The Runaways," grungy and formulaic, nothing special and yet worthwhile for its niche
","On occasion, the atmosphere of watching a movie at a theater in a certain circumstance adds to the ambiance. Case in point, The Runaways: I saw it at my local cineplex, where, unbeknownst to me since I last ventured into a particular screen, the one where The Runaways played on (good old theater 8), the sound had gotten a little worse. It was crackly, though one could still hear voices and sound fx and music reasonably well, and on the side of the frames of the 2:35:1 aspect ratio, there was some black fizzle or something. For a more prestige picture or big blockbuster, it might have been a hindrance. For the case of The Runaways, it was just about perfect. This mid-1970's trip through a kick-you-in-the-ball girl rock group complimented the flaws in the stereo-sound and the picture, and it was like listening/watching a worn vinyl LP. This coupled with the attitude of the performances, and some of the songs featured, made it like a near Grindhouse event.That the movie itself is less than great was to be expected. This is one of those rise-fall rock and roll band stories, one you know well if you've seen at least two or three by now (pick your delicious poison, be it The Doors or even Dreamgirls - 'The Fabulous Stains' from the early 80's wouldn't be far off either). And it also has a distinction of being a rise-fall story for a band that was around for only a few years, a less-than-revolutionary girl version of The Sex Pistols, who all wanted to rock but came from different backgrounds and were beat down before they could fully develop rock star egos by a grubby manager/producer.For the Runaways, we mostly get the stories of Cheri Currie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kirsten Steward). Many will know the latter, since she's made several big hit rock singles, but some in the audience (unless you're already a big Runaway fan or fan of the movie Foxes) won't know who Cheri Currie was. Perhaps that was the appeal for the director, first-timer Flori Sigismondi, that we get a view into the lead singer and how she's actually got a family and a place she's coming from, as opposed to Joan Jett who (by the appearance from the film) just came off the streets and immediately had to play guitar or die or go to prison. Certainly that, too, has a bit of the cliché to it (un-attentive mother, alcoholic father, same old same old), but the filmmaker is able to straddle the line between Currie, Jett and producer Kim Fowley (unmistakably hammy Michael Shannon, maybe too hammy in some scenes).Here's the thing that works for the film though: as a real gritty rock movie, as a saga of characters rolling around LA (sometimes right under the Hollywood sign), getting wasted, trashing hotel rooms, getting into madness, being rockers who can stand up to those 'men' that Fowley says don't want to see girls on stage. Subsequently in the story in the film, he exploits them for all he can, usually when they aren't noticing until it really affects their appearance as rock and rollers as opposed to beauty queens (or, of course, Currie as one). Again, some of these story elements are familiar, but this is not what makes the film so appealing - I didn't go to the Runaways to get a super-insightful script, save for a few little nuggets (i.e. they trained in a trailer!).I went to the Runaways to see rock and roll and rock as it blasted away without care back in the 1970's, albeit shown here as a brew of glam (Bowie) and punk (Pistols) and eventually with Jett and the Blackhearts as a straight up rock and roll band, and that's what I got. I was heavily impressed by the performances of Fanning- who can be legitimately sexy and make it both right for her character and uncomfortable for an audience member to see it in the flesh (and boy it is fleshy!)- and Stewart, who flexes her chops while on leave from the Twilight camp. As mentioned, Shannon is a little too over the top, as he was in Revolutionary Road, but that in and of itself is kind of a marvel, as he isn't taking it seriously, but still has a good time. And the music... ah, for the right fan at the right time, it's blissful to hear and the be blown away by even a movie version of The Runaways, who make one want to rush out and buy any song they recorded. Who knew a revealing, raw-cum-conventional bio-pic would be their best advertisement in years?",7,23,38,21 March 2010
The Breakfast Club," Sweet! One of the best film of the time
","The Breakfast Club fits it's generation like a glove.  Today, it is a classic in teenage film-fare that shows a group of 6 who wind up in detention on Saturday and it changes they're lives.  The group- (Emilio Estevez: the jock, Judd Nelson: the punk, Molly Ringwald: the princess, Ally Sheedy: the basket case and Anthony Michael Hall: the brain).  These 6 talented people bring the best out of John Hughes' script.  This was their breakthrough, and so was it for 80's movies.  A+",8,11,20,20 June 2000
Gladiator," Enjoying the spectacle even more on DVD
","In my first review of Gladiator, I said it had good action.  I think I was a little too subtle with that, because after watching this movie for the first time in a year on the grand DVD, and I see why this film won best picture (though I still feel this is 2nd best to Traffic and Traffic was snubbed like Saving Pvt. Ryan in 99, only that Gladiator isn't mediocre like Shakespeare in Love is).Russell Crowe, as in all of his films commands the attention of the viewer every minute he's on the screen (though once again, Tom Hanks did it better though and also deserved the Oscar, but I'm not mad about it) as a man who is changed as he goes from respected general, to disgraced slave, and then back to respected Gladiator.  Smart, exciting moviemaking all the way, with Scott delivering good direction to the scenes and the rest of the cast being good deliverers to the film (fans of old film stars Reed, Harris and Jacobi will find this a treat).  Even better than I thought it was back last May, and with time should become a classic like Bravheart, though that is better (I also was a little subtle with Braveheart's spectacle).

Contact," Sometimes boring but also sometimes fascinating
","Contact has it's moments when you feel like you just might fall asleep (and some might feel a bit of anger due to it's anti-climax type of climax), it is also pretty well made and has some good wonder to it.  Jodie Foster stars as a woman who has been looking for life out in space for most of her life with radio signals, until finally, she hears one coming in.  That starts a chain that leads up to the creation of a spaceship sent by the signal and so on, and so forth.  A lesson in faith, si-fi, and how we feel going into 18 hours of darkness (so to speak).  Based on the book by Carl Sagan.  Best scene though, the scene with the whole lot of crazies in celebration over the sending of the signal.  B+",7,2,5,6 April 2001
Donnie Darko," A good film, with a fervent cult following, but it shoots short of greatness
","Without a doubt there is an audience for Donnie Darko, which is perpetuated by the cult that it had gained following its release (and re-release as a director's cut, unseen by me). I also have no doubt that Richard Kelly, first-time writer/director of this film, is talented. But after seeing the film for the first time recently with its strengths I also found parts to become a little 'much' (pretentious may not be the right word to use, some would say it though), or at the least trying to be weirder (or surreal if you would put it that way) then it needed. The story is an unusual one, as is its central character played by Jake Ghyllenhaal, however Kelly tries to cover too much ground in one sitting of less than two hours, and also loses much of his conviction in the little coherence of the story by the last ten minutes (especially the last five, although it is not elusive or misunderstood by me, that's not what I had a problem with). There is also something off about how Kelly injects his dream-like projections in the film, which I'll get to in a moment.First off, I would like to point out what I did find commendable in the film. Kelly is a very good director of actors, and out of Ghyllenhaal he does get a truly tortured soul to emerge through. Although one might find a similarly troubled character in a film like The Good Girl, he does make Darko his own. There are also good performances from Jena Malone as a sort-of love interest of Donnie's, and even by Patrick Swayze in a surprising and funny role as a motivational speaker. Also, Kelly knows how to set up certain scenes and let them work well in his 1988 setting (the introduction to Donnie's school was one, where there was an interesting collage of images against a cool 80's new-wave song), and creates some dark comedy in Donnie's rebellious nature at times (especially against the forces of authority). And in the first third/quarter of the film, Kelly sets up a story that attempts to dig into a kind of adolescent mood that follows many outsiders in high school movies.Where I did find that the film went into territory that is questionable is how Donnie's strange phenomena is explained, or not explained. The elements of time travel, paranoid-schizophrenia, the controlling power of hallucinations, the end of the world, etc, are all jumbled up at times and Kelly doesn't seem to know where to go except to make things seem 'cool', perhaps, in a dark way (maybe like a high schooler Fight Club). A problem I had though is that, unlike a controlled and smart surrealist director like Bunuel or Lynch, Kelly doesn't take the visions and ideas anywhere except to a muddled point. There are so many ideas about topics and behavior that one almost loses sight of what the story is working to, which I won't reveal but is a little too obvious.In a way, the end result reminds me of seeing a student film at a university- you appreciate and get entertained by scenes and lines and such, but you see more talent that will later emerge than actually present. In short, like with 2004's Garden State (also directed by a first-timer Zack Braff), the hype doesn't entirely suffice, at least for me. Maybe it might serve more on a repeat viewing, or of the director's cut (which are really just the deleted scenes on the theatrical DVD incorporated in redux style). For now, I give it a B grade, however I would recommend it for most high school kids looking for a 'head-trip' who are still vulnerable to masterpieces like Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou.",7,23,43,10 June 2005
Born on the Fourth of July," 'You can take your Vietnam and shove it up your ass' Stone's 2nd best film to date
","Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July to me is better than Platoon, or at least more psychologically moving and cinematically compelling. While Platoon, Stone's totally personal account of the Vietnam war is quite accurate and superb in many ways, this film is better if only because it's not Stone's story. He takes the tale of Ron Kovic (who wrote the book with the same name as the film and scripted by him and Stone) and turns it into a blisteringly awesome and ultimately harrowing picture that has performances, scenes and direction that top Platoon (maybe it's a sign that practice makes perfect)Anyway, the tale centers on Ron Kovic (played to a utter T by Tom Cruise) good old-boy-type of American kid who decides he wants to fight for his country in the Vietnam war even if he has to die for his country. He fights, witnesses horror and makes a tragic mistake and comes back home a crippled from the waist down veteran, who has to endure the emotional and physical pain of just being a veteran of Vietnam in a country where they are put down more than revered. All this, and more (including one of the most volcanic scenes I have ever seen between Cruise and Dafoe on a Mexico road) lead him to become a anti-war activist.In making the big theme of the picture Kovic and his feeling on the war, Stone depicts his journey excellently by showing his desire to be in it, his confusion afterwards, his eventual hatred and then placement in being against the war all the while still being a patriot. Not only does it work as a saga/war movie, but also as a 180 degree change tale. Must, must see for all Stone fans and for anybody who wants to see what Cruise can actually do with proper direction and script.",10,129,173,20 November 2001

Macbeth," a film soaked in blood and the wonders of Fassbender and Cotillard
","The things that Justin Kurzwel's new film of Shakespeare's Macbeth are the sense of place that feels so authentic as to bordering on documentary-level, which is then off-set by the surreal, hellish sense of color (various shades of red make this so vivid as to be piercing to the senses at times), and then the performances, which are authentic to the point of feeling like these actors could leap off the screen.Surely if you haven't seen the adaptations by Welles or Polanski, or still the best Kurosawa's Throne of Blood, see those first. But it was playing near me in the city, it has Michael Fassbender digging so deeply as well as Marion Cotillard in the titular role and Lady Macbeth respectively that you feel like they almost forget they're acting in these parts, and thus it was a foregone conclusion to see it (David Thewlis also has a few good scenes as a certain obstacle in Macbeth's path). Luckily it's directed and presented with a firm degree of darkness and intensity, and while it may be SO much of a dirge into the dirt and heavy Scottish accents that you'll pray to get sunshine outside the theater, it's some strong art.",8,2,6,17 January 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," empathy for the struggling working man - connect with it, if you can
","Sometimes (maybe often times, or not even 'maybe') it really does make a difference when you see a film at a particular time in your life. Case in point, this movie, which got Will Smith his third(?) Oscar nomination playing a down-on-his-luck father trying to support himself and a five year old son and hustling medical equipment while also being an intern at a brokerage. At the time I think I saw the trailers and the reviews and thought 'eh, looks like Oscar-baity pap, pass.' But also at that time - and here I'll get personal so bear with me - I was actually doing not too badly post college; I didn't have any debts then (my parents said they'd take care of any student loan debt), and had a steady job with my family's business. Since then the family business closed, I went to work at another place that didn't work out, drove a cab for a while, and now I'm working as a deliver driver for a diner - and during this going to graduate school for screen writing, getting that, and then getting saddled with the student loan debt (and debt from financing for the most part myself for a feature film, which is a story in and of itself for another time), and then becoming an adjunct professor, which is not as steady an income as it comes. This may be in too much detail, but the point I'm trying to get at is... life is a struggle. Things aren't always handed to people, and this isn't necessarily a race thing (I can't say for certain if Will Smith's character Chris Gardner was white things would be necessarily easier - certainly being black in America makes rising to the top harder, again another thing to talk about for another time and maybe I'm not the one to write about it, at least not right now).The struggle of survival is something that crosses lines into something that is fundamental, and certainly it requires some empathy - I don't think this is necessarily for the sociopaths out there, or people who might dismiss it for, say, a guy like Smith who has wealth playing an 'average Joe' - but I think it hit me harder having lived through a life where having to work day by day, having to make bills down to the last minute (or maybe not paying them quite on time), and simply the sheer horrible-indifferent beast known as *bad luck* made me see Gardner even clearer than when I was fresh out of college.Now, does this make The Pursuit of Happiness some instant classic ala Bicycle Thieves, also about the constant, existential 'pursuit' of staying alive moment to moment and beat to beat? No, not quite. But then I didn't quite expect that anyway; this is following a character through a longer timeline anyway, as Gardner is at this firm as an intern and sometimes his luck as he has his son (along with his son, played by Jayden Smith at a time when he was more natural an actor than now it seems), and so the rise-fall-tiny-rise-fall-fall-fall-eventual-YES-success story is not too hard to see coming around every turn of the corners of the film. This is also not to say it's not hard to compare it to De Sica's film (also by the way this comes from an Italian filmmaker transitioning to Hollywood): one scene where Gardner and his son are at a restaurant with a moment of respite from life with a meal see a better-off family in the place and looks are exchanged. Class structure in action.But it's the emotion that's poured in by Smith and how everything is kept at this 'what-do-I-do-next, and then what' narrative that goes between what Gardner has to do and how he *must* always be a good father (this, too, creates some drama), that makes the film work so and connects with me. I don't have a son but that doesn't mean I can't empathize with this part either (ironic to see this here and then ten years later Smith as Deadshot with the 'all for my daughter' part of his character that didn't ring as true, but I digress). He's playing a regular guy who is smart and listens and tries to do his best, and yet he doesn't make him a superman. He can get hit by a car while trying to get back his medical device a homeless man took from him; he can get stiffed $14 from a local 'friend'; he and his ex (Thandie Newton in a wonderful if under-utilized part); he can get angry or distracted at the wrong times. If we empathize with him it's because his character *does* have flaws and has to work through them to get where he needs to be (or as he says, he has to work so much harder just to get ahead).So, again, this may come down to timing for me connecting with this so much - maybe at another time I'd think 'oh, please' - but at any rate, Smith gives a performance that is perhaps his most convincing as a dramatic actor, with flashes of his charisma but channeled into someone who is more like the audience at large coming to see him than those surrounding him in lush Hollywood. It's imperfect and occasionally sentimental, but it rings true more often than not, and that counts. It's a nice block of studio neo-realism, if that contradiction makes sense.",8,0,0,26 August 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Ford and Connery, Nazis, quite the adventure movie
","While not my favorite in the Indiana Jones trilogy, The Last Crusade is a significant improvement over Temple of Doom (one might almost say you need Doom to get to Crusade, to go back to the greatness of Raiders), and it acts as as much a matinée-serial style action picture while also having a bit akin with a James Bond picture. This is actually as much to do with how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas craft the story, villains (including sexy femme fatale), and the action set pieces as it does with the casting of Sean Connery as Harrison Ford's father. There are of course some amazing set pieces of chases, fights, and all encompassing with a nice fast pace. This time, however, there is a bit more mystery and intensity I'd put more with one of Connery's films than the 1930's serials. This is also not at all a crutch to the film- if anything, Ford and Connery are what really make the film work a lot better then in would without, for they work so well off of each other, with enough comedy sometimes just based on a glance or a look from the older icon to the younger star. Starting with an swift and over-the-top beginning with a young Indiana Jones (with a good River Phoenix in the role), the story shifts gears and goes into, well, the religious. One may remember an ark of the covenant as the set piece in the first film, so this time we're given the holy grail itself, giving immortality to anyone who drinks from the cup. At this point in the story, and other points, it could be easy for the filmmakers to dip into some religious ballyhoo. Luckily, it doesn't go too deep into that, as the side of the antagonists- the Nazi's (watch for a funny moment involving, of all people in a Spielberg picture, Hitler) and an American entrepreneur- and in the adventure that ensues through the desert. Capped off with one of the very best action pieces in the series, a chase involving a tank and the usual cliffhanger style, the movie does start to take a breather as it comes to a close, there are at least a few surprises (i.e. a certain death scene) in store - and, most impressive on repeat viewings, the 'Three Challenges' that Indiana Jones must face in this Biblical quest for the Grail. Boasting a sharp script and a gaining momentum that differs from the other films' non-stop action, it's definitely one of the more entertaining works of the power duo in the 80's.",10,1,4,14 April 2006
Back to the Future," Old Man Peabody owned all of this!
","This is a memorable sci-fi comedy that will always be remembered for it's amazing visual effects and dolorian time machine.  Plot (if actually memorable) is about a regular teen (Michael J. Fox in one of his best performances) who is friends with a brilliant yet crazed doc (Christopher Lloyd is terrific as this Doc) who creates a time machine using a flux capasitor and 1.21 gigawots (what the hell is a giawot!).  But suddenly, McFly finds himself in 1955, 30 years earlier to his present date.  And not only does he have to get back to the future, he also has to reunite his parents after a incident.  Great fun with this cast and tale, with some great direction by Robert Zemeckis and from Steven Spielberg's Amblin entertainment.  The best one of the trilogy (though the other 2 are questionable).

Goodfellas," my favorite film
","'I'm an average nobody...I get to live the rest of my life like a shnook.' So says Henry Hill, in one of the truly amazing denouements in film history. Here's a man who could've been easily killed off- at first by his wife, then by his own crew- and evaded it by sneaking out the 'easy' route. Yet Hill hasn't changed. He'll always complain about not having the good life anymore. The wrap-up makes totally clear what this saga is: the American dream realized as a given, and in the form of a corrupted mind-set.Goodfellas is the 'if-you-put-a-gun-to-my-head' favorite movie for me, and by that token appropriate as there are many a gun pointed at a head during the film, and sometimes with a big result (the most shocking when I first saw it, and still brutal on a big screen, is seeing Sam Jackson's brains splattered all across the room like it's some ritualistic slaughter). It's true bravura storytelling, without a single shot or moment that needs to be excised or missed. To say it's a 'perfect' movie might be overstating it; what is 'perfect', after all? Scorsese does strive for- and arguably succeeds- a kind of perfection in balancing comedy and drama, like a tightrope walker going above a bed of hot coals with a rambunctious Pesci threatening with scissors like the Oklahoma Kid. You're almost afraid to laugh, and a good many times (especially if you've seen the film dozens of times like myself) you almost feel apart of the group of guys laughing about stuff that *shouldn't* be funny. But then there's what could be the greatest shot of the film, where we see a first-person of all the small-time hoods introducing themselves ('what's up guy?' 'I'm gonna get the papers, get the papers'), where it's like we as the audience are let into the clubhouse, following them along into the back-room as they unload coats...wait, he needed suits, not coats.It's endlessly watchable as a kind of raucous, dangerous pop entertainment, and it feels as though it's gone by in much briefer time than has actually passed in 146 minutes. Maybe as part of a subjective thing I can kind of relate to many of the characters, not so much because of what they do in their criminal deeds or Hill's mistress or feeding people to lions and whatnot, but the little ticks of behavior (a little note like when Hill rushes out of his coked-up girlfriend's apartment, laughing maniacally, is like any given day with my brother).But a personal connection can only be so much to recommend this motion picture like no other. As one of the benchmarks of cinema of my generation it's got everything that many somewhat-to-big-time-sophisticated moviegoers look for: over-done classic scenes ('Am I a clown' is the 'You're talking' to me' of the movie, and probably not even as great until the 'last week this prick asked me to Christen his kid' line), iconoclastic techniques with the camera and editing (everything from the freeze frames to the music and narration to the shots that have the intensity of coke or full on rage and adrenaline in beating a guy's face in with a gun), and performances that should be considered essential to see for anyone becoming an actor years and years from now.If there was ever an American film that could absorb, entertain, enthrall, and interest me on all fronts of style and substance as much as Goodfellas does on every viewing.",10,1,5,12 January 2000
The Bourne Supremacy," a solid action movie, if not precisely as memorable as the first film
","As much as I'm anticipating the third 'Bourne' film to come out into theaters, and as much as I'm not all aboard Paul Greengrass's style of film-making (mostly in due to United 93), The Bourne Supremacy works best as an adaptation of a book that, ironically enough considering the director, is good to bring along on an airplane ride. It's efficient and keen in how it observes the characters having tense talks on the phones (Joan Allen makes that work much better than expected, maybe the one improvement over the first film, as great as Cooper can be), and pretty well acted by its supporting players (one of the best scenes involves Julia Stiles, who was hinted at in the first film, who gets an emotional scene in a tunnel with Damon pointing a gun at her head), and it's even got one of the best car chase/smash-em-ups in the new millennium (the chase sometimes pops into mind when I'm in a tense traffic situation). But somehow it's nothing too groundbreaking, which maybe makes it just good and maybe just slightly unsatisfying for its potential. Not that the Bourne Supremacy needs to be a bold artistic achievement in the realm of international espionage thrillers. However if one feels that something it's lacking- and it's not quite because of the shaky camera-work, though I can understand how it can be seen as a negative- it's not to be unexpected. There's not the same suspense in the (anti?) hero's dilemma of identity, and so it mostly amounts to high-tech cat and mouse theatrics and a whole lot of attitude to go along with the potential of danger at every turn. It's not a film that I disliked in the slightest, and I might watch it late at night if it should strike my fancy. But as far as big smashing summer blockbusters go, it could be better.",7,0,1,17 July 2007
The Great Gatsby," may be a mess in part, but in other parts is faithful in tone and spirit to Fitzgerald with excellent performances
","I was reminded of this latest adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's seminal work on wealth and identity in the early (and beyond) 20th century. Baz Lurhmann directed it; it's hard not to tell, and especially if you've seen Moulin Rouge you know how he will take this time period (like Shakespeare and just uh, musical Paris in 1900) and make it into a fiasco and fresco of images. It's hard not to when dealing with the high-frenzied party world of the early 1920s in the Jazz age, when people with money had a lot of the (illegal but who cares) hootch, and a person like Jay Gatsby could make a name for himself as... whatever he wanted. Of course, he was a bootlegger in this story, but that's if you look at what he technically does. He's much more in the eyes of Nick (Tobey Maguire, with DiCaprio as Gatsby): he's mythical, and charming and rich, and then... other times completely out of control and unable to really connect with what to do with himself, especially when it comes to his long lost love (Daisy, Carey Mulligan is really great in just that way of being delicate but smart).The frenetic style is not unexpected for these early party scenes, but they can get so crazed that I grew weary of the anachronistic use of the music; for some reason in Moulin Rouge this worked a little better since it seemed all a delirious fantasy about LOVE (in capital letters) with only a vague sense of the place and time. In Gatsby it's clearly this period - oddly enough DiCaprio appeared before this in Django Unchained, another film by a director who revels in music from today in a period setting, but there it was done very much with a wink and a grin, a audacious black comedy. But here it's a dark drama at heart about the failure of the American dream in the midst of being able to achieve it initially: become whoever you want to be, reinvent yourself, and it can be great. Or, if it spins off the wheels, not so much.There is conventional stuff that can't be avoided if really delivering Fitzgerald's story, which includes how Daisy is already with Tom, played by a very great Joel Edgerton, especially in how he gets angrier and more intense in a particular argument scene that is, for me, the real centerpiece of the film. But for this second half of the film, when Luhrmann gives us less of the full-blown, Jay-Z soundtracked spectacle, we get the story of this love-that-cannot-be, and with scenes that vary between tender admission (the 'you can't repeat the past' dialog between Gatsby and Nick), the awkward reuniting of Jay and Daisy, and that giant argument scene. This and other stuff IS faithful to the book, and the actors help sell it so much even with (or despite) the Luhrmann over-flourishing.But maybe this material in 2013 could only be made (or sold) as this frenetic spectacle. And you do get that, and it is so much it becomes too much. And maybe that's the point and I just didn't get it or respond to it. But The Great Gatsby is still a good movie because the story at heart is so incredible and deep and you can read so much into how characters who lose sight of what they want, or know what they want and muck up getting it - and it's all under that watchful 'eye' of the billboard en route to Long Island from New York city - that it breaks your heart. When it goes for it, this cast (DiCaprio gives it his all, which could have been funny in the wrong hands; Maguire is just the solid core, as he should be in this story, constantly watching and as the audience's eyes) sells it excellently. I'd watch it again, and is a good adaptation if not a great one of a book that lives up to the hype.",7,2,3,18 October 2015
Shark Tale," An over-rated Hollywood churner that squanders a cast with only minimal interest
","While Sharktale may appeal to an audience out there, it's hard to tell for which one. The film is not a failure, but thanks to the mega-hype by the Hollywood system, with marketing railing up the walls and the stars of the film (only recognizable by voice and oddly shaped animation on the faces) trumped to bring in the kids and adults, would have to do a lot to live up to it. As it is, the filmmakers bring in not just movie references to not only The Godfather but many other crime films and shows, but urban/hip-hop culture, and corporations like the Gap, Krispy Kreme, Burger King, etc. But the film is such in love with the in-jokes that it leaves the story and characters on the cloth-hanger. The jokes that do work are the ones that aren't as over-the-top as the others, or at least those that don't involve flatulence and over-emphasis on 'bling-bling'. This is not to say that there aren't ways to make such elements funny- Shrek 2 just skimmed the line on what was tolerable. But Sharktale gives the audience a story that involves a lot for kids to digest, despite the conventions and clichés of it (little fish wants big things, bets all his money at the sea-horse racetrack and loses, blow-fish boss orders execution, then has a run-in and takes credit for a mobster's son's dead corpse, becomes a celebrity, and is under pressure with the other son who's a bit of a wimp, and with his love interest). As for the adults, the gags and puns sometimes doesn't work either, as did in Shrek or Finding Nemo. Some of the ideal wit that emerged in Dreamworks' first CGI feature, Antz, does come through, like an (all to brief) Abbot and Costello riff by the fish played by Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. There's even a funny bit with a shrimp cocktail.One big problem in the film is that the casting, while somewhat efficient, isn't utilized properly. Actors like Will Smith and Jack Black can be funny, but the lines and jokes they pull in the film lie kind of flat in the water. This might not be so for some of the kids and adults in the audience. However, Sharktale does depend on a varying sense of humor. The ideas being some of the casting is of interest, like small roles for Michael Imperioli, Peter Faulk, and Katie Couric. But then they don't get much to do. Are they just there because they're celebrities, or does the script give them something to do? From my point of view, the script doesn't deliver, at least with the kind of abandon it used to.In fact, Sharktale seems to compensate such things as a marketing-tested script and mis-casting with the usual extravagant and detailed animation. If not for the huge budget to cast the stars, implement the hip-hop soundtrack, and get the CGI, wouldn't this film be made under a direct-to-video or TV standard? There seem to be two double standards that also got to me as I walked out of the theater- 1) in order for the 3-D to work, as in a classic like Toy Story, the character shouldn't be 2-D. When an actor like Robert De Niro has only one emotion throughout the whole film, and changes at the end of the last act, the character as well as the actor playing him is reduced to something of a video-game caricature. 2) If the message of the film is to accept who you are and not to lie in order to get to the top (an admirable message for kids amid all the phooey in the story), then why would the Sykes character, played by Scorsese, have on the 'bling-bling' and hip-hop language he hasn't had through-out the rest of the story? Even just as a stand-alone film, aside from the lineage of CGI in the past ten years, Sharktale is just nothing new. It's the kind of film you're glad to see once, so that you know you saw it, and know why you liked it or dis-liked it. C-",4,14,28,1 October 2004
The Birds," both absurd and completely terrifying, a film of massive intelligence and enthrallment
","What a repeat viewing will bring: The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's blockbuster entertainment that somehow can appeal to the 'art-house' movie-goers as well. Meaning that even more than with Psycho, and certainly on a much grander and ambitious palette than North by Northwest, we have Hitchcock the grand ol' Master of Suspense for his mainstream fans, and at the same time gives an appeal to those who might consider themselves too high-minded to be considered part of the 'mainstream'. Meaning if you're in a coffee shop and on one end there's a group of teenagers and on the other end a couple of middle-aged psycho-therapists with numerous degrees, they could both be talking with similar depth &/or enthusiasm over the Birds. It's a work where the story gets set up very well: Tippi Hedren as the daughter of a high-ranking official (maybe a few brain cells and style-wise above Paris Hilton) in San Francisco who wants to get to know better a man, Mitch, who's from an island off the coast. She follows him down to the island only to be confronted by Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy) as well as his sister. It's a little uncomfortable a situation in the sort of mother-son dynamic she rattles...but that's not all her presence seems to be incurring.What unravels from there is sheer Hitchcock exploitation film-making- exploiting the audience's wildest fears- always with the most assured and inventiveness that one would expect. Several shots stick in one's memory, perhaps the greatest being the from-the-sky view of the fire that breaks out in the city, and then the seagulls that come into the foreground (point of view is put into question here, and it's a shot that works on both levels as mentioned before). As for the average horror fan, The Birds may work even more effectively than Psycho, despite its age shown in the bird attack scenes- which are nevertheless extraordinary in the usage of composite shots- because after the initial shock of the middle chunk of the film Hitchcock gets into something of a near zombie movie in the last third of the picture. Mitch barricades his mother, sister and Melanie in the house, only to have the rancor-loaded birds crashing head on to get at the house. Getting at what, who's to say? There's explanations that can be given, to be sure, but it may not even be necessary, it just is (one gets this amusingly from Hitchcock via the scene in the restaurant/bar with the town locals giving their drunken/angered/well-informed viewpoints).When it comes down to it, The Birds is not entirely as emotionally disturbing or complex as Vertigo, and one might be reluctant to say that it is art because of its appeal on a commercial level. But art it is, conjured out of a premise that seems ridiculous yet made all the more prescient and startling through Hitchcock's ever-careful style, and specifically the lack of a traditional Herrmann musical score (albeit with his contribution as a sound-designer with the birds notwithstanding). By the last scene, one sees how what might have been a cheesy, trashy work by a lesser filmmaker out for cheap scares, becomes something of a bizarre, discomforting statement on nature versus human beings, or at least what can be capable of those we all take for granted. It's also a hell of a lot of fun for the whole family, more or less; watch for the school-yard singing as the birds swarm around the playground, later parodied wonderfully in High Anxiety.",10,2,5,5 April 2007
Sully," everything's good about it except for its reason for being (as a movie)
","So here's the deal: in the English classes I teach, I like to bring up the Rhetorical Triangle, which was originally by Aristotle or one of those Greek fellas, and what this consists of are three things in any decent piece, fiction or otherwise that is meant to convince us of its worth (obviously): Logos, Pathos and Ethos. Logos is the use of logic, facts, or truth; Pathos is the appeal to a reader or just an audience's emotions; Ethos is the speaker or writer's character, credibility, and authority.I thought of this when I was walking out at the end of Sully, the new film by the 86 years old(ass) block of American grit known as Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as the pilots who landed the plane without any loss of life in the Hudson river in January 2009. Surely the film has the logos and ethos down - it doesn't fudge any facts (far as I or most can tell), and it's made by a filmmaker who has gone around the block already when it comes to depicting figures who may be called heroes but they simply (in that Howard Hawks tradition) see themselves as professionals (think of the soldiers from Flags of Our Fathers or American Sniper, the former made for dull viewing, the latter more engaging but troubling at times). But the pathos? I'm not so sure.Sully was a man who was and remains beyond reproach: he *did* do his job and did it well, and despite the doubt that may be planted to the flight committee/board who are investigating the landing in the river (basically the closest this movie has to antagonists), where's the conflict? There may be some interior struggle I may have missed, but in such a short run time I'm not so sure Eastwood and the screenwriters leave much room for any troubling character signs or things that can put this story in flux (especially as it's one that is relatively recent and more in the public eye than Chris Kyle even was by comparison). This isn't to say that from that ethos/logos perspective the filmmakers and cast don't do their job - this may be one of Eastwood's better directed films in a while, and Hanks and Eckhart (mostly Hanks as it's his guy at the top of the bill) so as good as they can in portraying these men.But, and it's not too small a but, what else is there to this story? If one thinks back to two of the intense films that involve plane crashes from the past ten years, United 93 and Flight, they each had a) something that was intensely significant that made it a story worth telling and utilized pathos to the Nth degree, or b) gave us a character (Denzel in Flight) who was troubled and flawed and made it a little more difficult to see the story as black and white. Sully doesn't dance too far into the gray areas, and it's not really because Eastwood or his filmmaking team avoided them. They're just not there to begin with: a plane had a major problem, the pilots were both professional *and* human in their duties (the one interesting factor to me is that), and then there was an investigation. Oh, and Sully's wife or girlfriend (Laura Linney) had trouble selling their other property or something. Shrug.In other words, aside from the centerpiece of the film, where we see the crash happen from the perspectives of the pilots, the passengers (including three who were separated due to arriving at the last moment to the gate), the attendants, the airline traffic controllers, the coast guard, and which is an incredible piece of filmmaking and performance unto itself, there is not too much 'there' there emotionally speaking. That may be part of the point, that this was a case that showed the best in people and the fact that no one died was something of a miraculous event. Is that enough to make it worth rushing out immediately to plunk down the how many dollars it costs to see it in a theater? I'm not totally convinced.",6,2,5,13 September 2016
Princess Mononoke," mind-shattering anime; my favorite of Miyazaki's films
","Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.",10,9,16,11 June 2006

Beetlejuice," AND IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER, EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT! (that's not just a quote)
","This is one of Tim Burton's best films. His sophomore effort shows the story of a married couple (the Maitlands played with good degree by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die accidentally off a bridge and wind up the target for a upper-class family (including a young yet well played Winona Ryder) and a weird yet scary ghost (with the most) named Beetleguise (or Beetlejuice in a scene of laughs) played to immense complexity by Michael Keaton. Sure this plot may sound a little anti-climactic being mainly gags and not really a focused story, but so what? In a film where you see sandworms from saturn, shrimps that attach after calypso and a nut who has seen the exorcist 167 time (insert quote here), why bother with a plot. Great fun every time I watch. Reccomendable to anyone.",10,89,113,27 September 2000
Valkyrie," solid storytelling, almost like a heist movie, minus emotional attachment
","Bryan Singer's latest film, Valkyrie, is a step-up from what was a long 'slog' of a movie-going experience like Superman Returns. His direction here is more in line with the X-Men franchise, oddly enough for a movie about Nazi's scheming to kill Hitler. He has what amounts to a well-oiled machine via Christopher MacQuarrie's script, and his cast assembled is a gallery of who's who in British film (yes, British people playing Nazis, without German accents, as well as Tom Cruise with his Tom Cruise accent). If only one felt a stronger bond with some of these characters like Cruise and Bill Nighy and Kenneth Branaugh play, there might really be something special about what amounts to a great idea carried out to the extent of great failure.If you haven't seen Tom Cruise's character, Col. Stauffenberg, explain it in one sentence in countless commercials and trailers, here's what the plot amounts to: a small group of completely fed-up Nazis plot to kill Hitler and implement operation Valkyrie which, in effect, will put the 'right' Nazis back in power and end the war by negotiating an end to battle with the allies. This is the premise, and it is executed in a not so strange way much like the plot of a heist movie. We see the masterminds (Branaugh, Stamp, etc), bring in Stauffenberg to use his expertize and hatred of what's become with Germany as a means to pull off their plot. They also bring in some other possible 'friendlies' to their cause who will have various odd-job type tasks (i.e. Eddie Izzard's officer will make sure the phone lines are down from Hitler's operation station after the bomb goes off), and everything has to be planned and operated to the last T.But, of course, as in a heist movie, we know that things wont turn out very well, or as well as anyone might like. Matter of fact, considering that instead of robbing a bank or jewels that it's taking out Hitler and his regime and implementing emergency procedures throughout Europe, it is what we expect it to be: a glorious try at something unattainable. What does make the movie fascinating is the execution of suspense as in any good conspiracy thriller (watching the tension during the first war-room meeting Hitler has with his men and as Stauffenberg awaits confirmation to set off the bomb is intense), and the striking quality of the performances. The actors all do good work- even Cruise who has the double burden of acting with one eye (or a crazy lazy/fake eye) most of the time- this in spite of or despite the fact that they're not given much in way of motivation aside from the obvious. I liked seeing the character of Stauffenberg go through the motions of executing the complex plot, but there's not much there for me to care about the human being.This may not be the case for some, and if so all the better. This really is, to Singer's credit, one of those real WW2 movies with strong men played by terrific actors that... is not really great. In the right frame of mind it could, however, hit just the right spot. Valkyrie is slick, efficient storytelling.",7,16,26,25 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," 'I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!'
","There's been maybe too much hype about this movie, though at the same time it did affect me in the way it was intended for die-hard fans (e.g. all the time this past week I kept thinking 'ah, Simpsons movie' as I re-watched episodes from past seasons on DVD), and the anticipation almost became boring after so long a wait. The question then comes, was it worth it? For all of the ultra (and mostly kidding) hype and ultra promotion and the almost decades-long wait for some people? Absolutely. It delivers, at the least, a good time for those who may even just watch the show casually, and have even scoffed it off after years of shows that have spurned off from it like Family Guy. It's a reboot, if one can imagine, for those that think the show has gone too slack for the audience. But since it's an institution at this point, one of the longest running shows in the history of TV, what would one expect? It also has what the fans want, even if it's in the smallest things like seeing Homer acting like the classic idiot that he is (and with a pig no less, going from Spider-Pig to Harry Plopper. in a single bound) or Bart acting like a proto Dennis the Menace skating through town without his clothes on (d'oh, spoiler). But it's also- as more than a few fans and observers have said- like one long episode of the series...which can be said about most animated TV-show-to-movie transitions (with the exception of South Park). Its plot is not too untypical for a Simpsons episode: Homer does something dumb, the town is in jeopardy, and only he and the rest of the family (more or less) can come to the rescue. It is a fairly simply plot, but then again, why carp? If the writers tried to shoot for the moon with something too ambitious- or, actually, more-so than I actually expected- they could've fallen flat on their faces. It's this level of quasi-simplicity that allows them to go for jokes that might not get on regular TV (this includes, to be sure, jabs at the 'crawl' at the bottom of a TV screen, and the old 'to be continued' gag).But this being said, as an extended episode, it's one of the best episodes ever made! Praise enough? What does a great episode have anyway? What about a great movie? There's a sincere attempt to just go for broke in terms of tackling all kinds of comedy: subtle and biting satire on current events (environmental mishaps, governmental s***-headedness and evil-doing, Tom Hanks), 'scatalogical' humor, chiefly in the MacGuffin that triggers the rest of the plot (that's a good pig); total zaniness (want to see Homer split into a dozen pieces as he has to come to an epiphany while stretched to Dali degrees?); and subtle-to-obvious jabs at religion, family, alcoholism, Green Day, and of course the Hollywood summer blockbuster itself. Where else will one see a bomb-detonator robot shooting itself in the head over the pressure? The gags come at ten-to-twenty second clips much of the time, and it even has (gasp) some of the heartfelt moments from early on in the series, surrounded by jokes that still can hit best with a packed audience. It is, simply put, a true crowd-pleaser, one of the best in recent memory, and definitely aside from Grindhouse THE movie so far this year I will want to watch again and again. Woo-hoo!",10,5,14,27 July 2007
Alien: Covenant," a vicious, sometimes over the top, exciting and suspenseful and violent horror movie
","There's a moment where the robot Walter, played by Michael Fassbender, meets the other robot, David (also, surprise, Michael Fassbender, fresh off of a hair-cut to make himself look not so Iggy Pop like), who has been on this planet for ten years, interact with one another. David has one of those flute-recorder things, and shows Walter how to use it. Walter is able to use it with a moment of practice, and David points out to his robot-other-same man that he can't *create* any music naturally. David can, though he's not as advanced as Walter is after some years of modifications (David was the first synthetic life form, as one could see in the 2012 precursor to this, Prometheus), and it's a wonderful little scene. It may actually be the best sort of sci-fi philosophical scene that either of these films tried to do as far as addressing in a subtle but direct enough way how the deeper ideas Scott and his writers are trafficking in. If only those ideas worked stronger and weren't so BLATANTLY stated as happens in the 2nd half of this movie.But what am I starting this off with - Alien: Covenant, the sixth proper Alien movie (don't count the Predator ones for now), is Scott taking another stab at this franchise after getting both praise and (probably more-so I think) criticism for trying something different with Prometheus. It didn't work, though not all his fault (but then again we usually blame the director if he can't reign in the unwiedly/stupid elements of the script, and Prometheus is a stupid man's idea of a 'smart' science fiction film, albeit beautifully shot). So here I think Scott's thought is, 'alright, if you want blood... you got it, f*** it, I give up.' In the process he actually creates his most suspenseful film (not counting, say, The Martian, which is a different sort of suspense I mean) as far as action goes since American Gangster or even Black Hawk Down; his cinema here and set pieces are visceral and exciting and terrifying.He and his writers may have a climax too many, though, with the exception of a denouement 'twist' that should be obvious but isn't and that makes it all the more frustrating for me once it's revealed (it involves Fassbender, that's all I'll say, or one of them), those climaxes are fun as hell and shot with style and... yes, some schlock, but a healthy dose. When Katherine Waterson is flying nearly off of the ship hanging on for dear life on what is practically a thread as she is trying to shoot away a rascally Xenomorph off of the escape pod that Danny McBride is flying... I mean, does it totally make sense? No, but it's gripping in a way I didn't expect. And I think there's some smarter things going on in the script or, to put it another way, not as many noticeably dumb things to comment upon or take one out of the film.Are there some plot holes? Sure; one involves the basic idea of the planet that Billy Crudup decides to go to - not so much the 'hey, let's go, there's a better chance of life that isn't years away', which is the original plan, but because, well, why didn't this pop up before when the team was doing the vetting for the other planet in the first place? Did it not show up on the map? I also take issue with something that happens with Damian Bechir's character and an attack that occurs to him - it should go one way or the other involving an alien presence on him, and either way has a logic issue, though one more than the other - and a particularly WTF obvious slasher movie moment involving a couple taking a shower (you know it from the trailer) that took me out of the movie. It made me laugh, and I don't think that was Scott's intention, but it seemed as if whether he recognized it or not he was fully going for the slasher movie tropes... which he already is here anyway, but in that scene, my God.But the performances are all uniformly good for what's asked, and Waterson, Fassbender and McBride are all putting in above-average or fully excellent work here (Fassbender, whatever loaded lines about Oxymandias he has to say, makes it so convincing I almost want to give the problems I have in the second half a pass), and it helps that Waterson gets to make her character like but not like a 'Ripley' protagonist; we know she's the tough woman, but she also gets to be vulnerable and upset and so on (James Franco has an odd cameo as... well, I'll leave that for you to discover), and it's always great to see her putting so much into this character. And Scott is still there making things look wonderful with his DP Dariusz Wolski. Alien: Covenant is a step in the right direction from Prometheus as far as not having so many glaringly dumb or inane or questionable moments in the story or logic of events, even if it has its own set of issues (not to mention, I should say, a flashback to what happened to a city of engineers that, for me, should've been cut out as to leave more mystery - wouldn't it let the audience have a little fun/do the work halfway of wondering what happened to those charred bodies without having to see it?)",7,5,15,20 May 2017
All the President's Men," a tight ball of a mystery movie, gets better with more viewings
","The first time I saw All the President's Men I wasn't very impressed or, actually, that involved. But it was also also at a time when I wasn't paying much attention to what was on the screen (school-time, middle of the day, that sort of thing). After seeing it a couple more times, and from reading more and more about the Watergate/Nixon involvement and impeachment, the film has a lot more importance for me, and it does work very well as mystery-movie entertainment. You have the investigators (here also journalists) Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, working for the Washington Post, on their own digging into the break-in at the Watergate Hotel in 1972. But without much results over time they almost lose their case and story. Enter in 'Deep Throat', a special secretive informer for them, and some extra paranoia, and the case goes up a notch.This is quite a film to see in the 21st century to see how, like with today's Good Night and Good Luck, how determined, concrete investigative journalism stirred up the system and the content being relevant to the time it was created. At the time it was released, however, I wonder if the connection was even stronger to the very recent events of a scandal being uncovered leading to the impeachment of Nixon. But aside from the content, there's also how the film is put together, and its really, like GN&GL, good movie-making for a mature, thinking audience. Robert Redford is in one of his best turns (even if one could say he's just being himself, which he often is anyway in films) as Woodward, with his scenes with Deep Throat in the parking garage exquisitely intense. Dustin Hoffman is equally good as Bernstein, the sort of other head of what the editor-in-chief (played very well by Jason Robards) called 'Woodstein'. The dialog in the script is dead-on, and the storytelling just piles on and piles on what works. If it doesn't grab attention right away it's not a crutch, but an incentive to stay along with the story and see it till it's end.",10,8,13,29 March 2006
The Soloist," an inspirational story that doesn't inspire, for all that it tries and might aspire to be
","I went into the Soloist not won over by the trailer. Indeed I thought it looked like something that we see in Hollywood from time to time, which is a hyped-up story of an underdog with not all his screws tied up being inspirational to those who are down on their luck. It looked like, frankly, pablum. But I also thought that an actor such as Robert Downey Jr being in the film might mean some promise, something stimulating about the project that would attract someone like him, one of the best American actors working today. Turns out, this is not the case. What attracted Downey Jr I can't say; was it the material, the true life story of Steve Lopez's chronicling of Nathanial Ayers Jr, or was it Joe Wright, the director of Atonement at the helm? All of these questions can be asked, but what we're left with is the film itself, and left to judge it on what is here. What the Soloist is is an overwrought, crammed-up and morally questionable presentation of a story that, frankly, doesn't give much uplift when the lights come up. The story of Ayers, a schizophrenic who happens to be a virtuoso musician living on the streets of LA and connecting somehow with a sympathetic columnist, is one where there really isn't hope, despite what the trailers and ads might say. In fact, I believe, a moral of the story would be: 'yeah, try as you might to be a 'friend', whatever that means in this context, but these 'people' on the streets, whatever they're qualities and talents that are apparent, should be left alone and without much medication to get them in a better frame of mind if at all possible.' At the end we're given a tacked-on catharsis statement from Lopez on how Ayers affected him, but it's not very inspirational. It's just sad, and not in that fulfilling kind of way.The makers of the Soloist probably thought they were making a grand statement on the power of friendship and connecting with the mentally ill. But there are so many other films that one could spend there time with, given all of the promising ingredients here. If you want to see a movie about a relatively normal guy and a mentally warped guy watch Rainman; if you want to watch good Downey Jr movies watch his output last year; for Foxx, 2004's output (especially Collateral); for classical music put to dizzying visual heights, Fantasia (which, I should add, Wright desperately tries to emulate in the scene where Lopez and Ayers see the recital and all of those colors flash through his mind ending with the pretentious line: 'Beethoven is in the room').On top of Wright crowding in FAR too much into making it a feat of the visual, even when it's not needed to express something about the story or the characters or mood (and an inconsistent one at that as it moves jarringly between flights of fancy like the shot careening across the sky with birds flying around to, yes, a documentary interlude on the homeless), Foxx goes way too over-the-top in his performance. There is nigh a shred of subtlety, and even if this is the point which it well may be I was never really convinced or drawn in to this real person, Nathanial Ayers, who apparently still is on the streets of LA mumbling and playing wonderful music. Downey Jr still does what he can with his character, and actually does pull us in with his conflict of his profession and his feelings for this man he looks after. But one actor can't really save what is ultimately a heavy-handed story of inspiration that lacks inspiration or triumph-of-the-human-spirit element to make it worthwhile. It's simply another Hollywood vehicle for hope that tries too hard and not hard enough. Wright may be a talent to watch, and Atonement showed those sparks, but it's not here.",4,6,13,3 May 2009
Dodgeball," Funniest Sports Comedy since BASEketball (and, luckily, in that comedic tradition)
","One of the things that debut filmmaker Rawson Marshall Thurber gets right at the start of Dodgeball, and runs with for the whole length of the film, is that if you're making a film out of this story (that includes the a-typical story and characters, in a comedy genre or otherwise) there's got to be a laugh a minute, literally.  And, amazingly, Thurbert pulls it off, along with a great ensemble cast headed by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn.  Because there is also a constant urge to make fun of anything, that nothing is out of bounds, disbelief is completely suspended, and Thurber reaches (credible) ZAZ comedy territory.Main baseline: Stiller and Vaughn trade places from March's Starsky and Hutch, as Stiller plays the tyrannical, egocentric head of Globo-Gym, which has been the monopolizer of physical fitness in the town.  Vaughn runs Average Joe's, a gym where the only people who work out are the ones who work there.  When Stiller bids to take over Vaughn's place, they fight back with a Dodgeball tournament with a prize enough to save Average Joe's. 
The story's just an excuse, anyway, as was the story for BASEketball or Airplane.  It's an excuse, so to speak, to let Stiller run wild with the persona he creates for White Goodman.  It's an original performance, even if one wonders if he played a character with these kind of qualities before on his show.  And Vaughn, as well as the assortment of supporting actors (Christine Taylor, Alan Tudyk, Stephen Root, Justin Long, Joel Moore, and especially Rip Torn), contribute a lot to the success of the laughs. They're relying on certain cliches, but they're the kind of cliches you can't take a bit seriously.  There are also a good deal of (surprise) cameos by the likes of William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong that sneak up and bring some of the funniest parts of the film. It's a good time, unless this just isn't your kind of movie.  Between A- and B+",7,0,1,20 June 2004
Rock Star," Some things to look for, Wahlberg isn't one of them
","Mark Wahlberg, the star of Rock Star, seems not totally right for this movie.  Not just because of the Marky Mark past image, but also because he seems uncomfortable sometimes in the movie.  Sure he might have a god singing voice as a hairband lead singer, but that might not totally compensate in my book.  It would've helped a little if it looked like he was having a little more, well, fun.  Both Wahlberg and the film have something in common- they take themselves too seriously.Still, the film has it's moments.  They're are a good number of in-jokes and puns at the rock industry (It's no Spinal Tap though), some alright rock music, and a good feel for the period.  But, the film becomes muddles after what we know the plot is is established.  Formula, toppled with formula, with only a tad of compensation.  By the way, though the film might sound original with it's plot, it's actually based (in part of course) on the events that transpired with Judas Priest when they kicked Rob Halford out of the band (you might even spot a gay reference here or there).

The Martian," a thoughtful, exciting, crowd-pleasing movie about problem-solving
","It's great to see characters think and actively searching for a solution to a problem. That was one of the driving forces of Apollo 13 (remember, 'fit that, with that, using nothing but that'), and other films dealing with survival often have that as a crux of the narrative. But The Martian isn't something where the filmmakers are trying to do a lot with a little dialog, like All is Lost or Cast Away. There are stretches without talking, but not as many as you'd expect; as the audience we're filled in often about what processes are going on and how things keep evolving (or, sometimes, breaking down miserably) in the search for how to keep astronaut/Botanist Mark Watley a) alive and b) bring him back home. It is a splendid piece of big, mainstream entertainment because it really digs in in ways that invite the audience in, while constantly keeping things entertaining and amusing.The Martian is about a man left behind by his crew (not their fault, they genuinely thought he was a goner), and how he has to find ways to stay alive, to give himself food and, most importantly, send word to NASA that he's alive and well and can they maybe send some supplies and oh does the crew know yet? It's got a lot of science to it - as Damon says in the trailer that most have seen, 'I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this' - but, more often than not, it's accessible and easy enough to understand. That is, of course, if you're not too scared by science fiction (or, as the filmmaker and actors have talked about in press interviews, science 'fact', as everything, save for us presently going to the moon with men/women on a ship, is plausible). It's a movie about how to keep humanity in all its dimensions going through the perils of space. And, as we see, space is nothing if not indifferent; it acts, particularly on Mars, as a place where nothing really grows, storms can knock the hell out of things if items or persons aren't fastened tight, and if anything comes loose, watch out for the air and pressure to possibly kill you. On the level of threats, director Ridley Scott and especially screenwriter Drew Goddard (taking, from what I've been told, faithfully from Andy Weir's best-seller), it's high and pretty constant, and there is always that sense even when things are going well that they can break down at any time. While I never thought watching it 'Oh, maybe he won't get back or might die', as the conclusion seems clear since we are meant to like this guy and want to see him live/return, the threats and obstacles are presented expertly, with a lot of excellent pacing giving us breathing room.The 'breathing room' part is what I mean by this being a crowd- pleasing, entertaining flick. Goddard, previously of Cabin in the Woods, is adept at giving actors funny things to say, and The Martian is just good but basic sci-fi without the wit. Some of it may seem obvious - Watley is saddled with one of the other astronauts' musical selection (disco, which he grows to kind of like in a begrudging sort of way) - but a lot of it is due to personality, from him as well as those at mission control (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, a very funny Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara are part of what is actually a giant supporting cast). These are serious scientists and people trying to do their jobs in (mostly) responsible ways, but how they talk is closer to how one might see people talk in, say, the real world; this isn't the tone-deaf wit of Prometheus, and it's funnier than what Gravity previously tried to do. I was surprised how much I was laughing during The Martian.But it's deep down a drama, and led by Matt Damon in a performance that makes this director-writer-actor triangle complete for the audience. He has to hold down major chunks of the film, albeit there is a lot with NASA and the other ship with Chastain and so on, and without making this man believable in his serious scientific intellect, his ways of making things light (or cursing, which is interesting that they get away with a PG-13 here by the way through bleeps), and real pathos, the movie won't work, or nearly as well. He delivers up to what the script asks, and it, plus Scott's visual scope and control of the pacing, make this an exceptional Hollywood movie. We get to see how process works in a crisis, and that's always character-building and interesting (when written well) in a movie; that it's at this level of A-list makes The Martian a special film, and one of Scott's best.",10,22,54,5 October 2015
Evil Dead II," more entertaining than the first; a great party flick
","Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, distinguishes itself from the original in that this time the hero Ash (the unmistakable, often hysterically funny hero of the Evil Dead trilogy, Bruce Campbell) isn't the last one on the line in the kind of unique, nearly art-film (not to scare off people, I mean more like WAY low-budget) horror-filled treatise on the teenagers-down-to-one. This time, Ash is like the hero of a Saturday afternoon matinÃ©e special or updated drive-in flick that's been allowed by the censors to show whatever's inside the creator(s). Sam Raimi, the mad genius behind this trilogy and films like A Simple Plan, The Gift, and the recent Spiderman 1 & 2, doesn't keep his material high and dry for too long. In fact, not much is too low-brow in the horror book. He pulls almost every trick out of this book, so the speak, to get the audience into a shocked, but (with the proper sense of humor) amused mood at the lengths the 'curse' will take Ash and the other visitors. And from a film-making standpoint (this is aside from the fact that the story's a clever send-off of tongue-in-cheek, ultra-violent Italian horror films), it's all bravura thanks to the great make-up and special effects. Two of the fx crew, Greg Nicotero and Robert Kurtzman, made this as their official, outstanding proving grounds before heading off to start KNB effects, which has worked on array of action and horror films. And always there's a cruel, if totally and timely un-realistic turn waiting for Ash and the others, as Raimi and co-writer Spiegel maintain the zombies and such. The highlights include the little hand that could (provided by Nicotero), a 'mother' laid to rest in a fruit cellar, and a flock of trees awaiting in the forest outside the cabin (which, for me, was more frightening and disturbing when done in the first film).Aside from the onslaught of ridiculousness, and rebellion against being embraced by any mainstream audience, it's something of an acquired taste. Though it's gained a hefty cult following, and rightfully so, you show this to any random audience of today and the effect may be the same as when it first came out - some will love it, and some may almost puke or walk out. But it's the kind of film, like the first as well as the wonderful Army of Darkness, that displays Raimi's inspired talents with a lens, and it grows on you. Not to mention, it makes a fine old party movie with friends; it's the work of a real comedic talent, not just of a sensational stylist.",10,3,7,2 July 2004
Law Abiding Citizen," what starts as an intriguing *serious* injustice-revenge story turns stupid... and still serious
","F. Gary Gray needs to find his groove again. The director who debuted with Friday went ahead and became a director of dramatic films, like The Negotiator and A Man Apart, films that have their moments if they are, obsessively-repeated TV airings notwithstanding, forgettable. But with a film like Law Abiding Citizen, he should have taken a better look at Kurt Wimmer's script and seen what he had to work with. It's really two movies, sort of shoe-horned in to one another. The first one, at least in the first half hour, would appear to be an injustice-revenge flick where a guy watches in horror as two thugs break into his house and rape/kill his wife and child. But at the trial one of the thugs rats on the other, one of the thugs gets death row and the other pretty much walks. Then, years later, when the one thug is about to be killed by the lethal injection, he strikes his first blow of revenge... and then another... and then...Then it becomes the second movie, which is basically a comic-book flick (think the Joker in the Dark Knight) set in a realistic urban-crime center. The problem mostly is in this second half, and in how the actors are made to play it. Gray doesn't know really how to make this into something as silly as it really is - how Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton is the biggest criminal mastermind in the history of, well, this year's masterminds - so he plays it completely straight. As actors, good ones, like Jamie Foxx and Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill go through the motions of the script, it becomes oddly, not as interesting as its premise would make us believe.Part of this, I wager, is on Butler's end. Some may disagree, but his performance did nothing for me. The character requires someone with a lot more dramatic hump and subtlety, maybe even ambiguity, and Butler, after the opening set-up scenes, goes into a Hannibal Lecter imitation that is just unconvincing (some have suggested it's because he has to put on an American accent, but is that the reason for sure or is it just the material?) And, again, the script and direction clash with a heavy-handed, jarring mix. Some scenes are seriously compelling. Others just had me laughing at how Shelton was able to basically blow up ANYTHING within a hundred mile radius, including cell phones.Gray could have worked this into something much more entertaining if it left its BS moral complexity at the door. It can't be both styles - dark/deep and crazy - and it should have been either/or; it had the potential to be something that goes for broke, but the absurdity that mounts isn't the right kind with the tone of the film, not to mention the predictability that comes out of the script as it is (for example, any time a character says they wonder if they really did make the right call with the Shelton-family killer, the next scene, dead). It's a split in the film that is never reconciled, and while I could always see a better movie being made out of some scenes, it didn't come together on the whole.",5,3,5,26 April 2010
High Fidelity," A nice narrative comedy
","High Fidelity is brought to screen by John Cusack (not only as star, but also as co-producer and writer) with some good taste.  He talks to the screen through most of the film about love's labors lost.  He goes through some bad relationships, then we see the romance kick in with his current date (Iben Hjejle).  Not all of this is funny though.  The humor comes with Cusack's employee's at his record store (Jack Black and Todd Louiso) which were pretty good at what they shouldn't do (not acting wise).  Black was my favorite character (besides Tim Robbins and his guru type of man) because he reminded me of a Jeff Anderson from Clerks.  Not the most terrific script, but some good acting and interesting scenes pull through.  A-",9,3,6,14 April 2000
Up in the Air," about an 'issue', but also about the characters and a bittersweet lot in life
","Jason Reitman is a filmmaker that cares about the issues of the day, or of some day or other. But I don't think he consciously goes out of his way to make a 'statement' about lobbyists and tobacco with Thank You For Smoking or about teen pregnancy with Juno. Such as the case with Up in the Air, I think he was attracted first, from the book his film is based on, by the characters and the story of this particular guy with a very uncomfortable, morally repugnant but somehow available job of being sent across the country to fire people, personally, and send them on their merry way. Yet right now, even more than teen pregnancy or the demons of lobbyists, unemployment is hitting many people, everywhere. In Detroit, a city that's featured in one particularly disturbing scene in this film, the unemployment level is somewhere between 30 and 40% depending on the time of day.So it's bound to strike a chord with people, not least of which because of Reitman's usage of real people who have been fired featured in the film, spouting off to Clooney's Ryan Bingham, angry or teary or berserk or, in one most troubling case, perfectly calm. And yet what makes Reitman a strong storyteller is not that he cares first about hitting the hammer on the audience with the message (he's not, say, Paul Haggis with his dramatization), but that he wants to tell this story of a guy who we might not even know actually exists, until that moment he steps into a room and fires someone. Or, perhaps, one sees in a hotel reception room giving a presentation about 'How to Backpack Your Life.' It features a sharp screenplay that's wise about the nature of human connectivity, the lack of it in this character, and his realization of what's missing in his efficient but cold life.What's also clever in the story is how Ryan Bingham, played by an as-always cool and witty and very slightly vulnerable George Clooney, is also not entirely safe with his own job. His work of going out on the road, which he does more than 3/4 of the year, is threatened by young upstart Natalie's 'fresh' idea of putting a computer-cam link up so people can be fired right over their monitors. She goes out on the road with Ryan, however, and sees how it's really done, the actual humanity that goes in the process of telling someone they've been let go (not to mention the equally unsettling task of handing a booklet over on starting over). It's through this road trip that we see Natalie's own weaknesses revealed, but more-so she brings out some of the ambivalence of Ryan, too. Mostly as Ryan has a fling with a professional woman also on the road (Vera Farmiga), and what really unfolds from a seemingly safe, long-distance romance.Oh, there are one or two little scenes that do get in the way of it being truly phenomenal (there's one scene in particular, as Ryan and Natalie, charming and shrewd played by Anna Kendrick), argue on a pier, where she lays out everything wrong in Ryan's life, and it's too-spelled-out for the audience when we know what's wrong or conflicted already). But these shouldn't get in the way of what is another success for Reitman as a filmmaker. He navigates this tale of this man who is so comfortable with the ritual of travel, of hitting that impressive and pathetic plateau of ten million frequent flier miles, that he can't see any change ahead, either in that or in how he views his life with his family or his potential love interest. I won't reveal what happens between Ryan and Alex, but it's easy to say that it's not an easy turn out to the story. Just when you think Reitman's starting to get a little too comfortable with his characters and pleasant situations (i.e. wedding scenes), he pulls the rug out, and it makes sense completely.Up in the Air is funny, but completely disarming in equal beats (sometimes equal scenes) by it's tragedy. It's bound for Oscar contention and it deserves it, for its intelligence and observation and performances, all top notch. It's of and for our times without forcing it.",9,4,11,25 December 2009
From Here to Eternity," them reenlistment blues
","This is ostensibly a film about life before war breaks out - the climax (not a spoiler I don't think) is the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 - but it's also about how much it sucks to be a man. And a woman. Actually it is not something that is too appealing it would seem to be a part of an army base during peacetime from the looks of this. The women in this world are in miserable marriages or at miserable jobs, and the guys are stuck in the same super-masculine patterns: do some boxing, trust me, Pruitt, it'll be good for you (nevermind that he blinded a guy by accident in a fight years before), and make sure to have plenty of booze when it's the nighttime.Even the setting is deceptive: the beautiful beaches and sweet presence of Hawaii (those shirts!) are masking how if a person cant take being around other a-holes it doesn't change anything. Through this it makes for a compelling batch of stories; you have Lancaster as a sergeant who falls for the Captains wife (Deborah Kerr in a performance that is so intense at times it nears going into being too much, but she always keeps a scene and her delivery of these lines in check) and the conflict in whether to go for it in the 'after all this' thing; Pruitt (Clift), who this feels like the movie is more about than its top billed star, is filled with guilt and angst and should also be too much to take, but also finds those lines of keeping it compelling and interesting, full of pain and fury and all that, but also not going too far.The only one who may be having 'fun' up to a point is Sinatras Maggio, who becomes the brunt of racist remarks (damn you Ernest Borgnine, who's great in his few scenes by the way and cuts a mean impression), and is the first to drown himself in booze when it becomes clear life is being much too oppressive. Though one knows how this story is leading up to its eventual conclusion, it feels more like a post war story (and it is by way of it being filmed in 53) while coming before. A guy like Maggio would've faced likely the same sort of bullies and pricks in post war life as pre, but in this world he has no escape from what this BS tough guy male world has to do to people. Or does it have to? Yeah, it does.There are points where it likely has dated, where the hopes and aspirations for the women especially (or some of them men too) are different than it would be today or even like 20 years after the pre Pearl Harbor days. What were the options then, one has to ask, and it leads to having to take things on the context when it was made. What makes it work today from being dated is the power of the performances and that the writing is smart enough to recognize everyone as flawed to varying degrees, and that Zinneman keeps a strong hold on the dramatic tone scene to scene. If there's anything flawed its minor, like leaving the Lancaster-Kerr relationship to the wayside for a good part of the run-time until returning to that in the third act.So if you only expect like the romance of that iconic bit on the beach you may be in for not so much disappointment but a heavier and more empathetic tale of soldiers and women and the problems in trying to be true to feelings when its not possible. Sure its a melodrama, but so what? If its done this well its worth embracing to this day, and Sinatra, Clift and Jean Arthur are worth noting for their terrific acting.",9,6,7,4 February 2017
Atonement," half the time great drama of a crisis in ego, and the other half...
","Atonement is being acclaimed now as one of the best films of the year, a surefire contender for the best picture prize at the Oscars (at least, apparently, as a 'proper' film as opposed to the crime classic No Country for Old Men). It's not hard to understand it, for a good lot of the running time; Joe Wright, the director, has taken what is an apparently beautiful book (unread by me) and transformed it into the stuff of true existential crises. It's about a young girl, Briony, who witnesses what she thought she saw as a crime. This might seem unclear at first, but it isn't, it's a clear move on the part of immediate revenge for a tryst she witnessed between her sister and a worker (Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy). He's sent to prison, then to war, where unforeseen circumstances may change everyone's lives.Doesn't sound like a bad premise, with a good dosage of romance in the mix. And for the first half hour, forty minutes it IS great film-making of a tense nature, focusing on the young girl who just wants to be the center of attention with her first play and is cut-off by family and other matters that flock away. All of this is filmed by Wright, and acted by the case, quite absorbingly, and by the end you really care what will happen to poor Robbie... But then the story takes a turn that only slightly recovers in the last ten or so minutes. Suddenly the point of view changes- which, I suppose, is also true to the book, albeit from what I've heard lopping off some bits and pieces that would have made it a longer but richer film- to Robbie fighting in the war, though not exactly 'fighting'. He walks around a lot, comes across a beach-front of soldiers (in a startling 5 minute long take no less, indulgent but effective), and yet this coupled later with the emergence of the Briony as a nurse doesn't really click for me.Yes, it should be compelling cinema to see Robbie suffering along with all the other British in the midst of the early, rough days of WW2, but what Wright shows us isn't much more compelling (or, for that matter, as well done) as any given number of war pictures of the period done in the present; even a harsh hospital scene with wounded only works so much until it's overkill. When the point of view changes it suffers, and when it finally returns to Brialy it takes some time to get adjusted back in it all (not helped by a nearly too restrained performance by Romola Garai, particularly in dramatic scenes where, whether or not they actually happened, should be believable). I may be in the minority here from the masses who are praising Atonement to the sky, but only when Vanessa Redgrave appears does the film finally offer a satisfying catharsis.It's a sad thing too, because when Atonement is at its best it's what many dramas, particularly those of this kind of period setting, seem to lack in dealing the old love-and-war story. This time real danger, caused by complete human error in youth and judgment, is in the mix, and it provides a level of interest in what will happen to the characters. That Knightly and McAvoy work so well speaks to the director's gifts. I just wished that Wright either made the film longer to make it even more of an epic feat, or knew how to deal with the change in perspective of narrative for a FILM, as opposed to in a novel.",7,10,19,24 December 2007
V for Vendetta," the first excellent film I've seen in 2006
","I admit, I'll have to see V for Vendetta again to fully grasp some things about it- chiefly things in the story and dialog (that and I had a rather faulty screening of the film at the theater). But to say that I haven't been this excited about a film brought by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the Matrix creators, since their 1999 ground-breaker, is saying a lot. Some may not like the film, or may not 'get' it, as it does go for a lot of dialog and character development over useless explosions and violence (of course there's some in the film, but no in over-abundance). But it is, like the first Matrix, quite challenging in the futuristic story kind of way, taking more from Orwell this time at a look of totalitarian society and the humanism that lies beneath terror and fear through dominance. That it is also a well made and well acted film is much to its credit.And while the film is credited as its director to James McTiegue, who was AD on the Matrix trilogy, one can see the Wachowski's (possibly akin to the V character) pulling the strings throughout in their script and co-producer credits. They take from a graphic novel and churn out something rather epic, and complex. V (Hugo Weaving, in maybe his greatest performance without a 'real' face) has set the date November the 5th as a kind of judgment day, as one year from that date he will return to change the course of history. But in this year's time Evie (Natalie Portman) gets in the cross-hairs, and becomes involved in his vengeance against the government that did this 'monstrosity' to him. Through this there is an investigation by an officer (Stephen Rea), some good deal of back-story through flashbacks involving a tragic character who's life is scribed on a roll of toilet paper, and the whole story of how this totalitarian society in England came to be.It's through this story, of which even I can't say that much more, that the Wachowski's deliver some action, however more food for thought than some might come in thinking it will be. For those expecting the non-stop action that went with the first Matrix you might be disappointed. But if you come in with an open mind, like with the Matrix sequels, it won't spell what came for many as disappointment. The talk in those films, which became muddled through the action at times, isn't so here. And through the cast of actors, who are all very, very good (particularly Portman, Weaving, Rea, and of course John Hurt as the high chancellor), there are some individual scenes that are just great, and entertaining, and involving dramatically in ways the filmmakers didn't quite get on their previous efforts. One favorite for me was the fake TV show with the two John Hurt characters in a comedy kind of scene. And the whole sequence with Evie in the 'prison' is surprisingly moving. If I could make criticism of the film upon a first viewing, yes, it is sometimes a bit 'talky', and the direction is not as astonishing as with the ones squarely helmed by the brothers.But for any of the small flaws seen on a first viewing, I can say that they weren't enough to deter me from recommending it, enough even to say that it SHOULD be seen twice, even if there isn't much confusion on what the story or characters are. One thing's for sure, you're likely to see very few other science fiction dramas this original this year, if at all, and least of which challenge the viewer's expectations and intelligence like this does. And great song over the end credits, by the way.",10,8,16,17 March 2006
The Island," at best it's sort of watchable as a preposterous sci-fi movie, at worst, well, Michael Bay IS the director...
","The Island is at least a partial remake of any given number of science fiction movies (among those referenced have been Logan's Run, Clonus, THX, and even the Truman Show), and it owes something to the preposterous science fiction movies of the 1950s where characters are one-dimensional, the storyline is fairly easily readable if you're into the genre, and it's got a lot of turn-off-your-mind action. So being in the 21st century and in a HUGE production mounted by Armageddon/Pearl Harbor gunner Michael Bay, what the Island is and what its content holds and how its done is not lost on me. In fact, it's not even really a 'bad' movie, though at one point about 90 minutes in I had to say to myself 'this is one stupid movie'. Because The Island tries for the thought provoking measures of say THX 1138 and The Truman Show, by taking the clone side of the picture in the stem-cell debate (is it ethical to create life to save others only to destroy the 'spare parts') in the future. But even in the first half and a bit in the second half of the movie, as it tires to dig into the subject matter and be smarter than just a humongous summer action movie that can possibly leave you a few IQ points lower, there's an empty quality to it too. What can be said except it's Michael Bay doing what he does.So, it's really just a big B-movie that's masqueraded with 100 million+, two really good-looking stars (McGregor and Johannsen), and even a couple of excellent actors either underused (Buscemi, in maybe five minutes of the movie) or one-sided to the point of inertia (Sean Bean as the 'God' of the Echoes and Jordans and so on). McGregor's character starts off having weird dreams, investigates around the area, and finds out his fellow 'people' are just shells used for spare parts. He gets Johannsen out with him into the real world, chased my a mercenary (Djimon Hounsu, not given much else to do but look stoic and give out orders in yelling form). It leads to, naturally a scene between TWO McGregors on camera, and the kind of scene where the two of them, at gunpoint, have to tell the hunters 'I'M LINCOLN!' 'NO, I'M LINCOLN!' Which is around where I said the 'stupid' line.At the end of the Island, I knew it was the kind of movie, as well, that I could recommend to some and not to others. If you're looking for something to which Michael Bay has a kind of near auteur-like knack of doing- big chases, explosions, car crashes, large, sweeping camera shots across terrains, and editing fast enough and photography quick and shiny enough to leave your eyes dizzy, this is just the ticket. That it has inklings of satire about the current state of science, albeit rather simplistic and not as probing like with THX or Truman Show, might strike the fans fancy. But if you're more of a serious science fiction movie fan, not really up for Bay's brand of cinematic whiplash action f***-off movie-making, it might be a slightly arduous experience. From one who's seen Bay movies that are decent (The Rock) and wretched (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor), it's possibly somewhere in the middle. Sometimes pretentious, sometimes fun, a kind of polished, glistening throwback to other movies and books. Overall, it's hit and miss.",5,3,5,26 August 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," a rollicking good time
","The Coen Brothers (them being Joel and Ethan) have a pretty good film here; recommendable to say the least. If it's not one of their very best it might be because it goes for so much within the framework of the Odyssey that it threatens to run off the tracks. But there's a great deal of originality here too, from the KKK musical number to the tommy-gunned cows to the horny-toad mystery following the 'sirens', to a great final hoe-down involving men with fake beards. It's crazy, and it works most of the time. It's an odyssey inspired by Homer, though it isn't exactly 'based' on it; from what I described up above it's really a jumping off point, as if the brothers took what they remembered from the story after reading it in school, and then put on their own ideas for the characters based on who could best play them. The film takes place in 1930's Mississippi where 3 convicts (Tim Blake Nelson, John Tuturro and in a Clark Gable-like face, George Clooney) escape to go look for a hidden treasure, but, like in the original Homer odyssey, there are their sidetracks (sirens) and villains (John Goodman does a good job as this villain). About the 4th best Coen brothers movie you can find, with some enjoyable comedy and some ironic moments. Definitely fun and with some memorable tunes. A-",10,0,3,31 December 2000
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," one of the most shamelessly funny movies of the year
","Like with Will Ferrell's last film as co-writer/star, Talladega Nights is genuinely smart in being completely irreverent and stupid. Sometimes I couldn't believe some of the malarkey I was getting my kicks from in watching this film, and I didn't have the same expectations I had for Anchorman (a different cast, more varied). But it turns out to be probably on par with that film in just delivering a brilliant mix of physical comedy, bits of slapstick, bits of social commentary (well, maybe lots actually), and even nuance too. The genius of Will Ferrell as race-car driver Ricky Bobby, as well as his co-stars John C. Reilly (as best friend Cal) and especially Sacha Baron Cohen as gay French driver Jean Girard, is that they're all fearless at being shameless. Some scenes could be pulled off by other comics or actors, but they just wouldn't be the same with the timing and (likely) improvisation. Something about it all just clicks with the material, and so much goes by that you might want to see it again just to get all of the parts that might've flown by.The basic premise involves Ricky Bobby (yes, two first names as his full name with a Wonder Bread hat most of the time) as a dimwitted by earnest champion Nascar type driver who gets his game toppled by Gerard (Cohen, his funniest and spot-on role since the Da Ali G show), and after a crippling accident that left him in his underwear screaming and running around on the field. He gets his game back, however, through his even more of a redneck-type father (Gary Cole, his most ingenious playing since Office Space) through certain endeavors. This is all just a cover though for all of the juicy, unexpected comic bits, which can range from delivering big, show-stopping laughs (my favorites were the knives in the leg and Cohen and Andy Richter's odd gay marriage pairing) to little ones that you might be laughing at even as no one else in the theater does. It's also not a boring take on just race car driving either, which might've limited the material.In the end, Talladega Nights gets its best material at lampooning the 'white-trash' types who participate in &/or love race car driving, and some of the most obvious jabs of any comedy since...well, Anchorman. It's not to say that Ferrell isn't an acquired taste- you'll either find his verbal and physical antics funny or you won't, to which this film might be a mixed bag. But everything from the product placements to the French to most Sports movies and lots of quotable lines in-between makes this the kind of comedy you might be laughing about with your friends once leaving the theater. One things for sure, I've never had a laugh so loud at an joke involving El Diablo (which is a 'fighting chicken' according to Cal) before this.",8,1,5,6 August 2006
The Godfather," an obvious word: masterpiece
","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his 'business' over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.",10,17,37,19 February 2000
