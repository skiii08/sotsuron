The Blair Witch Project," A realistic look at terror
","After a half-decade of ironic slasher films, it is a chill wake up call to be reminded what terror really looks like.This film really isn't that 'scary.' (really.) But what is fantastic about it is the realistic sheen it gives the growing panic and terror of three would-be documentary film makers.What creeps us out? It really isn't the thought of a madman killer, or a swift, fatal disease--it is the unknown, the odd. And this film is full of the unsettling...the inexplicable. And that is why this film succeeds. Not by making us shriek in terror, but by giving us a gnawing feeling of unease and doubt.One last note: If you are prone to motion sickness, wait for the video. I had a splitting headache after I left the theatre from the swinging p.o.v. of the film's finale.",7,1,2,17 July 1999
