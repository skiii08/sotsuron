The Blair Witch Project," A Perfectly Plausible Urban Legend
","Upon release in 1999, 'The Blair Witch Project' was immediately declared a horror classic. The film was a huge sleeper hit and remains one of the highest grossing independent films to this day. Much of the film's box office success can be contributed to its brilliant marketing campaign. Through a then innovative website (which, charmingly, remains up and mostly unchanged to this day), the studio convinced countless people that the film was genuine. That the footage of three college students entering the woods, attempting to make a documentary about a local legend, and mysteriously disappearing, was the real deal. I wasn't fooled at the time, recognizing it as the clever marketing ploy it was, but many of my middle school classmates were. After the hype wore off, a backlash quickly kicked in, many derisively describing 'The Blair Witch Project' as 'eighty minutes of jerks wandering around the woods.' Nearly fifteen years later, after hundreds of found footage films have followed in its wake, how does the film hold up? That the film managed to fool so many is a testament to the believable mythology it builds up over its brief run time. The legend of the Blair Witch is surprisingly detailed. The metafictional device is furthered by setting the story in a real town, Burkittsville, Maryland. Though completely invented, the Blair Witch seems like a perfectly plausible urban legend. Numerous missing children over the years are connected to the story. In the forties, a serial killer blamed his murders on the witch. The three filmmakers visit a local nut, Mary Brown, who claims to have encountered the witch. In the early scenes, local people from the town are interviewed, each giving their own opinion and stories on the legend. We are shown Coffin Rock and its gory story is related to us. In practice, the Blair Witch isn't any different then the Bell Witch, Mothman, the Bunnyman or any other real life urban legends.The success of 'The Blair Witch Project' is built mostly on the unsettling atmosphere it generates. The film begins with white-on-black title card, letting us know that the three kids don't make it out of the woods. This information lends many of the early scenes a quiet unease. Even when Heather, Josh, and Mike are goofing off, we know dark times lay ahead for them. The movie takes the woods setting a long way. Though frequently parodied in the years since, the scenes of the three kids running blind through the dark woods, listening for strange noises, still have the power to chill. These scenes are low-tech, relying on nothing but the real fears of the viewers and the actor's terrified performances.What engineered horror elements 'The Blair Witch Project' does have are equally subtle. Throughout the film, the campers make strange discoveries. First, they find strange piles of rocks outside their tents. Infamously, they come upon bizarre stick figures hanging in the trees. One of the highlights of the movie is, after Josh's disappearance, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks filled with bloody bits of flesh. Donahue's panicked performance really sells that moment.The common complaint of 'jerks lost in the woods' certainly does hold some water. Long scenes in the middle section are composed of the characters wandering around, yelling at each other. While it certainly adds to the film's tone of desperation and a few moments, such as a revelation concerning some downed logs, prove effective. However, this part of the movie goes on for far too long. As short as it is, 'The Blair Witch Project' is truthfully a little long and probably would have been best served as an hour long short.The ending makes up for a lot though. The survivors stumble into a strange house in the middle of the forest. The ending is notorious and well known. It's also incredibly stark. The viewer is left with no answers, the mystery maintained. First time viewers might not even catch why Josh is facing the wall in the basement, a reference to the earlier legend. The effect is intensely creepy, the found footage illusion maintained until the end credits roll.'Blair Witch' was a true pop culture phenomenon and that's honestly sort of surprising. I'd never expect a film as low-key or divisive to resonate with so many people. Maybe the internet campaign really caught everyone's attention, even those who knew the movie was fiction. The movie spawned a television special, several books, comics, collectible figures, a much-contested sequel, even a series of computer games. Yet its biggest influence was on the horror genre. It took about another decade for found footage to really catch on, hundreds of copy cats following in the wake of the wildly successful 'Paranormal Activity' series. Every notable title in the sub-genre to come, from 'Cloverfield' to the 'Marble Hornets' web series, owes something to 'The Blair Witch Project.'",7,2,3,27 March 2014
Final Destination 2," Sick Kills and Gruesome Humor
","I never would have thought that 'Final Destination' would have become one of the most enduring millennial horror franchises. The original wasn't a bad movie. It was a fairly clever update of the slasher formula which owed more then a little to 'The Omen.' (Both series dispatch their victims through convoluted Rube Goldberg-style accidental death traps.) However, it was horribly earnest and, beyond the wacky death scenes, it had little else to offer. I think the only reason the 'Final Destination' series has had the longevity it has is because, unlike the 'Saws' and 'Paranormal Activities,' the series hasn't burnt itself out with yearly installment. The movies are elaborate enough to force a few years between each installment. The reason I say this is because none of the movies are all that good. Except for this one. (And part five but I'm not talking about that one right now.) And it's good the same way a 'Friday the 13th' sequel is good. From a writing perspective, these movies are Dumb. The entire premise is kind of dumb. Lots of people survive near death experiences every year and most of them aren't brutally killed afterwards in ridiculous, contrived manners. There's a reason that, despite five films being made, none of these movies have ever attempt to build up any kind of mythology, aside from throwing out more ways to escape 'Death's design' that most certainly do not work. It's never been said but can certainly be assumed that the psychic visions that open each film are provided by Death. So why does Death give people these vision just with the intention of then brutally murdering them afterwards? Why does Death brutally murder people anyway? It's Death! He can off you in any way! Why make such a show of it? The only real thing we can gleam from all of this is that the Grim Reaper has an utterly brutal sense of irony and is also a passive aggressive jerk hole. Tony Todd's character shows up every couple of movies to sinisterly hiss some bit of vague misinformation, as if he really knows what's going on.So the story is utter nonsense. Like a 'Friday the 13th' film, each entry in the series has the same blueprint. Character has vision of horrific accident that gorily kills loads of people, some how manages to avoid said accident, himself and his friend proceed to suffer horrible accidental deaths Or deaths that seem accidental anyway. Part two is no different. The characters aren't great. They roughly break down into stereotypes: Final girl, an initially skeptical love interest, stoner guy, snarky chick, Mom, Son, Angry Black Man. Some of the characters get a smidge of personality. Angry Black Man panics nicely. My favorite moment is when Stoner Guy knows he's the next in line to die. He tells Final Girl to, after he dies, go into his apartment and remove all his drugs and porn, anything that will 'break his mom's heart.' It is a surprisingly touching moment in a movie that otherwise dispenses with any character moments. None of the actors are bad, with one exception: Ali Larter, the returning survivor from the first movie. Holy spit, how did this lady become a star? She's wooden, wears one slightly constipated expression throughout, and can never make a single line sound convincing. The 'Resident Evil' movies clearly deserve her.None of that matters anyway because the entire movie is built around the death scenes. And, holy cow, they are incredible. The opening freeway pile-up is hugely intense. The motorcyclist sliding across the glass is uncomfortably realistic to anyone who has survived a bike crash. The entire sequence will make you nervous every time you pass a truck hauling logs. It's a heck of way to open the movie. The kitchen sequence is the first sign of the movie's darkly humorous wit. It's an over-the-top, extended game of misdirection that has an amazingly nasty, unpleasant payoff. Characters explode into ludicrous giblets with little provocation. A battering log smears a man to splattering meat and blood. In the best kill in the movie, a teenage kid is squashed by a falling plate of glass, dissipating into an explosion of blood and gore. Person one second, puddle the next. Even for a seasoned gore fan like myself, it's almost too much. The dark humor shows up again when the Jaws of Life have the opposite effect. My second favorite kills involves a flying barb-wire fence dissecting a guy into four parts. The stunted look on the guy's face is almost hilarious, even if the globs of intestine are nasty. The movie never quite tops those moments even if the hospital set last act rolls along at a decent pace. The gore comedy mentality continues into the final scene.And that's why 'Final Destination 2' is awesome. The death scenes are some of the wettest ever put to film and any mean spirit intentions are grinned away by the movie's dark wit. That's one of the reasons why three and four disappointed me so much. They returned to the dead serious tone of the first entry. Only five featured the same sick kills and gruesome humor. Hopefully the inevitable part six will continue that tradition.",7,2,2,7 November 2013
The Exorcist," Has Good Truly Triumphed Over Evil?
","When 'The Exorcist' was released, it was a phenomenon. It did what all great movies do: Spurn discussion. Some Christian condemn it, others supported it for making the devil real to a new generation. Even the critics were divided, some considering the film vulgar trash driven by shock value. Forty years later, 'The Exorcist's' status as one of the greatest horror films ever made, if not the greatest, is well established. Few challenge this opinion. It's hard for me to declare any film the greatest anything but 'The Exorcist' is clearly an incredible film.The story behind 'The Exorcist' is well known. William Peter Blattey, a screenwriter best known for comedy, was inspired by the supposedly true story of a young boy possessed in 1950s Baltimore. Using this as a basis, he wrote the novel 'The Exorcist,' which became a great success. Hollywood came calling not long afterwards, as you'd expect. Blatty adapted his own book. Accordingly, 'The Exorcist' is an extremely close adaptation, following the book on a nearly scene-by-scene basis.William Friedkin, who just won an Academy Award for 'The French Connection,' did not approach 'The Exorcist' as a typical horror film. Friedkin shoots the movie with a docu-drama intensity. Though the film is famous for its chilling use of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells,' there's very little music in the movie. As we watch the McNeil household go about their days, and Karras' isolated existence, this creates an acute sense of reality. One the film slowly subverts. A sense of chilly unease is created in a simple scene of Chris walking down the street or Karras serving communion. This is best illustrated during Karras' nightmare, which is not outwardly disturbing but still unnerves the viewer. Or the long sequences of Regan in the hospital, focusing on her discomfort during the procedures. No matter how normal things appear at first, its apparent things are going to go very, very wrong.The creeping feeling of discomfort and established realism leaves the audience for the film's stabbing sequences of shocking behavior. The moments are well known now, widely parodied and referenced. Regan bloodily masturbates with a crucifix, pushes her mother's face into her bloody crotch, screams profanity, spews a torrent of green vomit, and cranks her head around in a circle. Even lesser moments like Regan speaking with the murdered director's voice are well known. Yet Friedkin's rooted-in-reality approach makes these moments creditable. Chris being attacked by her own daughter is shot in an intimate style, placing the audience in the character's shoes. What makes these moments horrifying is not that they're happening. Far more explicit scenes existed before and after. What makes them effective is that they are happening to this girl, in this house, in this way.The film builds towards the final act, when the titular exorcism takes place. Father Merrin's arrival brings a graveness to the already intense situation. The camera remains focused on the priests as they do their work. The girl blares profanity, moans blasphemy, and floats above the bed. The room shakes, the actors' breaths visible before them. These are special effects but the movie's total commitment to verisimilitude makes them seem plausible. The last third of the movie is still shockingly directed and completely effective. Every time it gives me chills.It's notable that 'The Exorcist's' conclusion still triggers debate. Father Merrin dies, succumbing to his poor health. Karras convinces the demon to leave the girl's body and enters his. With his last ounce of free will, he flings himself from the window, dying. Has good truly triumphed over evil? Has Karras' crisis of faith been resolved in his act of self-sacrifice? If demons exist, God must exist, right? 'The Exorcist' doesn't provide easy answers. What catharsis the ending creates is undermined by the scars still visible on Regan's face, the lines of aging on Chris'. These events will haunt them forever. Moreover, the eerie opening has Merrin, in Iraq, starring strangely at a Sumerian statue. The demon recognizes him upon his entry to the house. This is but one battle in a long, on-going war between demonic forces and those of human faith. Is it a battle we can ever truly win? Whether 'The Exorcist' is faith-affirming or existentially unnerving is a matter of personal interpretation.Finally, 'The Exorcist' is bolstered by a fantastic cast. Ellen Burstyn at first appears likable. As the events go on, her thread-bare emotions are bravely acted out, showing no sign for movie star vanity. Jason Miller's Karras is darker, more uncertain and troubled then the character in the book. He does a great deal of acting with his face. Max von Sydow's booming voice makes Merrin a figure of immediate respect. Despite only being 44 at the time, he appears much older and carries a lifetime of knowledge and regrets on his shoulders. How much credit Linda Blair can take for her performance is still debated. Blair is great as the cherub-faced Regan, a happy, mischievous child dealing with her parents' divorce. Once possessed, the voice of Mercedes McCambridge and Dick Smith's legendary make-up takes over, creating a disturbing, incomparable portrayal of demonic arrogance and vicious sacrilege. The only performance I'm not too keen on is Lee J. Cobb as Lt. Kinderman, a subplot that didn't entirely work in the book and seems even more extraneous on-screen.The best horror films are not the ones that simply set out to scare an audience. 'The Exorcist' does that. Boy, does it ever. But it also discomforts us, presents us with difficult questions and themes about complex, real life issues. About faith, guilt, the existence of evil and the question of good. The film is a triumph of direction, sound design, and tone but also of writing and creation. To say 'The Exorcist' is the greatest horror film ever made is too presumptuous. It is, however, clearly one of the greats, in this genre and any genre.",9,2,3,22 March 2015
Resident Evil," A mess.
","Every thing Anderson did right with video games movies on 'Mortal Kombat' he seems to have forgotten by the time he got to this project. I'm not even a fan of the 'Resident Evil' games and I can tell that this film changes much of the source material. I mean, was the whole computer going nuts and underground laboratory aspects necessary at all? It complicates the plot when it didn't need to be complicated. The characters are stupid, that's for sure, often doing things wrong just because it adds to the 'drama.' Milla Jovovich is sort of attractive, I suppose, but not much of an actress and certainly not strong enough to hold down a project as weak as this. The fact that she was engaged to the director at the time makes her casting even more bogus. The special effects are pretty good with some interesting looking monsters. However, it isn't much of a zombie movie as they don't really appear in it at all and most of the gore is pretty soft. 'Resident Evil' is just plain dumb. Just to think that this could have been directed by George A. Romero Grade: D",3,0,2,15 February 2007
Alien vs. Predator," I refuse to refer to this movie as 'AVP.'
","Being a longtime fan of both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchise, I'd long been awaiting this project ever since it was first hinted at in 'Predator 2.' But why did they have to give Paul W. S. Anderson the reins to it? A long series of comic books and computer games got the formula right so easily. It's simple. Aliens take over colonized planet. Soldiers are sent in to deal with them and inadvertently run into a clan of Predators, who are there hunting the aliens. Leave it to someone like Anderson to screw up a perfectly good concept. First off, he sets the story on Earth. Then he sets it in the present. The alien's designs are the stupid dinosaur look from 'Alien Resurrection' which makes no sense and the predators look ridiculous in their pumped-up armor. The movie is also rated PG-13. I mean, you combine two R-rated franchises and get a PG-13 film? What the heck? There isn't a single chest bursting scene in the whole film. Setting the movie in an ancient underground pyramid/maze in the middle of the Artic obviously happened more because Anderson seems to dig that sort of thing then because it made any sort of sense. But if the movie had some awesome creature carnage I could have forgiven all that. The first battle between an alien and a predator is pretty cool and easily the best moment in the film. But Anderson did one thing that completely prevented me from getting any joy from the film. He messed with the mythology. You NEVER mess with the mythology. Apparently the aliens were breed by the predators for hunting reasons. Why? That doesn't make any sense in the context of the series! That's like going back and saying Batman's parents are still alive or something! All the mystery is gone! This movie could have been a fan boy's wet dream ala 'Freddy vs. Jason' but by giving the project to an ignorant self-indulgent twit, it does nothing but raise the ire of geeks everywhere. Shame on you, 20th Century Fox, for letting it happen. Shame on you. Grade: D-",3,0,1,15 February 2007
Halloween," You Should Fear the Reaper
","As originally envisioned by Moustpha Akkad, 'Halloween' wasn't much more then an exploitation film. Even the original title, 'The Babysitter Murders,' sounds like the kind of undistinguished schlock that would have played on 42nd Street for weeks and then be forgotten. Enter John Carpenter. His stylish direction, directly influenced by Hitchcock, Argento, and Hawks elevated 'Halloween.' It really is as good as everyone says it is.Carpenter uses the tracking shot emphatically throughout 'Halloween.' It's a rare shot that isn't moving. The constant movement accomplishes several things. It establishes a sense of speed through the first half of the film, as the characters go through their everyday lives, living from one moment to the next. We are placed within someone else's world. The movement also implies a third party, a voyeuristic eye. Of course, there is a voyeur and it's not just Michael Myers. The audience themselves are spying on the cast. During the best of these early scenes, the viewer truly feels like we're snooping on the daily routine of ordinary small-town folks. Lastly, the camera constantly roaming makes the motionless moments more noticeable. The camera stands still to make a statement, a bold exclamation point on the preceding. Little Michael having his clown mask torn off. The Shape raising up from the floor behind Laurie. The final montage, noting the places where violence has taken place. 'Halloween' is visually engineered to make an impact.I'm going to talk about the early half of the film a lot, mostly because it's frequently overlooked. You could call those day lit scenes a couple of things. 'Boring,' to modern, ADD-afflicted youth. Yeah, it's kind of those things. However, these scenes establish our setting, Haddonfield, the typical Midwestern small town. They establish the autumn setting, leaves fluttering in front of the camera. They show the characters in their normal lives, contrasting with the horror the night brings.What exactly is Michael Myers? He's not human. Watching the film this time, the word that kept coming to mind was 'wraith.' For those unaware, a wraith is a Scottish ghost that is exceptionally angry and takes it out on anyone that comes its way. Michael Myers is an entity, an embodiment of some inhuman force. This is why he comes into existence, fully formed. This is why Dr. Loomis insist the character is unknowable. His motivates are obscure and inscrutable. Actually observe Myers' behavior. He shifts through the darkness undetected. His mask appears in frame before quickly vanishing again. Over Laurie's shadows, in the doorway, he slowly fades out of the black of the night, a ghost phasing into perception. While the girls smoke pot in Annie's car, Myers drives behind them. And what's playing on the radio? '(Don't Fear) The Reaper.' But you should fear the Reaper. Because you can't stop him. Michael Myers is a malevolent manifestation of death itself, inexplicable and indestructible. The indestructibility is about the only thing the subsequent sequels and remakes got right Carpenter and Debra Hill were working in archetypes. Laurie is the virginal, shy every-girl, a babysitter and obedient little daughter, who hasn't moved past schoolgirl crushes towards actual relationships. Is PJ Soles' Lynda the more interesting, likable character? Maybe. That might have to do with the boundless enthusiasm Soles brings to the part, an innate likability that should have made her a major star. It's not as if there's much to Lynda, a cheerleader stereotypically interested in fashion, school dances, beer, and her boyfriend. But what about Annie, by-far the least defined of the girly trio? She is hopelessly devoted to a boy who doesn't seem that invested, abandons the child she was supposed to protect, spills butter on her clothes, and gets stuck in a window. 'Halloween' mostly avoids the broad clichés of later slasher films but Annie totally deserved to die. What a stupid girl.Anyway, why Laurie? Why does she survive the Shape's inescapable power? Carpenter likes to say it's because she paid attention to her surroundings. Maybe. But then why does her off-screen teacher bring up destiny and fate? Laurie is forced on the path of survival, her encounter with pure evil destined to make her a fuller human being, to bring forth her indomitable will to survive. There's no way JC could have predicted the influence his little movie would have. Yet, of course Laurie is the original final girl. Her elevation to iconic status is buried in the bone marrow of the film. Even if she does need Dr. Loomis, who spends most of the movie just kind of hanging around, to save her.The film is painted with shadows, crisscrossing faces and bodies. The blue tone not only suggests night and darkness but also a morbid, deathly pallor. No wonder Myers reigns supreme. He has recolored the entire night to suit him. Argento's influence on Carpenter is most obvious here, as John uses color to create a tone and atmosphere. The last act is a fun house thrill ride, designed to continuously ramp up the tension. Laurie falling down the stairs, running across the streets, knocking on a locked door, trapped in a closet, it's all escalation of the previous set piece. Bold-faced audience manipulation that works every time. Despite the famous theme music, most of 'Halloween's' score is pulsating synth or pounding piano keys. Myers' leitmotif, a quivering, rising note, implies his presence even when he's barely glimpsed. The score is another tool in Carpenter's box to raise tension and get the audience's blood pressure up.Am I reading too much into it? Or is 'Halloween' deep? The film is a classic for a reason, a retelling of an urban legend that transcends those roots. The retelling becomes the new standard for the myth, the old routines reinvented continuously throughout the years. Wow, 'Halloween,' good movie after all.",9,5,7,5 November 2013
Carrie," Her Fragile World Shatters Apart
","The influence of 'Carrie' can't be understated. Stephen King went from a minor bestseller to an international success. Brian DePalma, known before for absurdist satires, was changed into the predominant thriller filmmaker of his age. It launched the careers of Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, William Katt, John Travoltra and, most importantly, Sissy Spacek. The movie's critical praise was acknowledged with two Academy Award nominations, unheard for a horror film. Finally, the film introduced the final jump scare into the horror movie cliché library, something every major shock film of the next two decades would rip off.'Carrie' is, ultimately, a simple story. Meek, poor and telekinetically gifted Carrie White suffers abuse at school from classmates and at home from her religious fanatic mother. Sue Snell, Tommy Ross, and Miss Collins attempt to help poor Carrie, to save her. Vindictive Chris Hargensen and her doofus boyfriend plan petty revenge against the girl for mostly imagined wrongs. The plot is engineered to build towards the climatic prom sequence, each storyline coming together. The whole story takes place over no more then a few days. The structure is precise, elegant, and functional.The story is also a coming of age story. The film begins and ends with blood in bath water, representing different losses of innocence. The emergence of Carrie's powers is tied directly with her first menstrual cycle. Her character arc is ultimately framed as a struggle against her mother's authority. Her psychic abilities give her the strength to fight back, to strike out on her own. Dowdy and plain at first, Carrie goes through a 'Beautiful All Along' transformation, charming Tommy at prom, suggesting that, had this not been a Stephen King story, she could have gotten away from her mother, had a normal life. King's original book was a epistolary novel, showing the events from the outside looking in. The film refocuses on Carrie, showing her world, her side of the story.For a fact, whenever the movie shifts away from Carrie, it suffers. De Palm's past as a cult filmmaker occasionally pokes through. A long sequence of the girls in gym is odd, with upbeat music and comical angles, adding little to the story. How about the scene of Tommy and friends trying on tuxes, which features bizarre fast motion? Carrie's Mother isn't the most complex character. She's little more then a raving, religious lunatic. Only near the end, when explaining Carrie's conception, does the character seem to be more. Piper Laurie plays the part as operatic theater, driving her intensity to absurdist heights, most evident during her orgasmic death scene, writhing in religious agony. Chris is similarly cartoonish, a sadistic, evil queen bee. It's no fault of Nancy Allen, who plays the part to its fullest, simply an example of thin writing. William Katt, several years away from his light comedy hero roles, is nearly flat as Tommy. Katt tries, occasionally showing some depth under those golden locks, but frequently comes off as a brainless jock.Spacek owns the film and, when the focus is on her, 'Carrie' shines. Her big blue eyes and freckled face conveys such a strong vulnerability, a deep sadness. You feel for the character, want to protect her. As the prom night goes on, as you see her smile and come into her own, a deep melancholy comes over the film that almost brings me to tears every time. Because you know her happiness is going to be short-lived. Despite occasional misinterpretations, 'Carrie' isn't a revenge story. Carrie's psychic wrath at the prom isn't righteous nor is the audience meant to enjoy it. Instead, it's high tragedy. You're watching her fragile world shatter apart and the terrible fall-out from it. 'Carrie' is ultimately an incredibly sad film. You forget that between showings, only remembering De Palm's stylistic flourishes or the intense effect scenes.De Palma's highly stylish direction occasionally verges on melodramatic. The multiple quick-cut close-ups on Carrie's glaring face or Margret chopping a carrot drawls too much attention. The infamous De Palma split-screen nicely shows Carrie's powers but are an exercise in style, not story. The dinner scene between Carrie and her mother, though beautifully shot in deep shadows, puts too fine a point on it when lightening strikes after Margret's dialogue. Ultimately, De Palma's direction works for the film. His repeated use of double focus, different items in the foreground and the background, provide depth to the frame, supporting the themes. The turn-table shot of Carrie and Tommy at the prom probably goes on too long but beautifully illustrates both her heavenly feeling while subtly suggesting that things are about to go out of control. No sequence is better constructed then the lead-up to the prom massacre. Another one of De Palma's trademarks, a long, single shot, revolving around the room, setting each puzzle piece in place brilliantly.Pino Donaggio's score is also hugely important to the film's success. The score is beautiful, dreamy and romantic when it needs to be. Carrie and her mother each have a leitmotif, a mournful oboe for Carrie and pounding, psychotic piano for Mom. During the prom, Donaggio's score fluctuates from silent to foreboding, slowly building tension. While the actual massacre is happening, the score is almost non-existent, treating the violence starkly, honestly. Unlike De Palma's direction, the score is always honest, building and supporting the story's emotions Except for the shrieking, Hermann-esque 'Psycho' strings that play whenever Carrie employs her powers. This was no doubt De Palma's idea, the Hitchcock humper.Though infamous, I almost feel like that final jump scare is unnecessary. It's an exploitation movie move in a film that is anything but. However, that final image, of Sue's mother cradling her on the bed, the room womb-like, a warm parental relationship, the kind Carrie never had, recalls the story's whole point. 'Carrie' is a devastatingly sad, powerful horror picture, showing that the genre can explore and plunge emotions far deeper then fear or revulsion",9,2,3,5 November 2013
