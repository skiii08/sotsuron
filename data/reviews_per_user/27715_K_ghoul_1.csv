Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning garbage.
","This movie was simple, and boring. It didn't engage me at any point. It's full copy and paste character, and amateur storytelling, Denis villanueve should be ashamed of himself for taking this huge crap, and releasing it on the big screens. This is more a 'her' sequel than it is a blade runner 2. The hologram gf was completely insignificant to the story overall, and was only there to be annoying and cringy. If i wanted to look at cool backdrops of sci fi-ish settings i'd use google images. I didn't pay for the imax ticket to look at google images. i wanted a mind blowing experience, and what i got instead was a massive slap to the face.",4,3,5,7 June 2018
