The Blair Witch Project," A Cult Hit
",The Blair Witch Project is the latest cult film that claims to be the found footage of three missing filmmakers. Heather is making a documentary about the Blair Witch working with her is Josh and Mike. One the first day they go around interviewing people in the town. The next day it was off to the woods to shoot the documentary. The characters work well with each other at first. As time goes by the characters begin to argue when strange things are sighted like the piles of rocks. On the way back they don't seem to know quite where their heading. At night they are hearing weird sounds some of which sound like feet. This happens every night and each day the characters begin to breakdown. The scary thing about the movie is the fact at night we hear sounds but see nothing. The movie successfully keeps your heart pounding especially during the moments where the characters are panicking. The feel of the movie is real very real and that's what's also scary about it. The camera technology is cheap and that gives the film it's real life look. A great movie with a frightening ending. I give this movie 5/5. A very scary movie that is definitely worth checking out. Don't Go Into The Woods.,10,1,2,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow
","When I see this movie again I will make a better and longer review for it. I went to the premiere showing of this movie. The movie was great wild ride. The Special Effects were better then anything before. The Computer Generated characters actually looked convincing unlike the earlier attempts. The ships were computer generated just like in Babylon 5 but done well enough that it looks like the technology used before. (Models) With the computer technology of today George Lucas can imaginative and breath taking worlds, some thing he could not do as well in the original trilogy. The story follows two Jedi warriors and their discovery of Anakin Skywalker. In addition to getting Queen Amidala to a planet that is one large city. So she can talk to the Senate about the Trade Federation's invasion of her world. I don't want to tell too much because I have a habit of saying too much. I didn't find Jar Jar Binks to be as annoying as everyone else claims because I actually found his jokes and mishaps to be funny. Darth Maul didn't have the commanding presence of Darth Vader but he sure did look demoniac and cool. They should have given him more screen time. The movie is entertaining, imaginative, fun and worth the full price. The Original Trilogy is still the best, this movie doesn't quite manage to bet Episode 4-6, they did have better and more exciting plots, despite the fact the special effects in Episode 1 are far better.",10,0,0,27 May 1999
Casablanca," 2. Casablanca (1942)
","It is considered the second greatest American movie of all time and I can see why. Casablanca is a well-directed and acted adaptation of a play. Rick is a saloon owner in the city of Casablanca in Morocco, which was under the control of the French until the Nazi's came. A women who he fell in love with comes to Casablanca and enters his bar which has him feeling upset. She had ditched him in France and he end up traveling with Sam the Piano Player. The movie portrays the Nazi's and the people who work for them in an interesting way. Ilsa Lund Laszlo claims she loves Rick but she is devoted to the cause of her Husband Victor. The movie sort of becomes a story of star-crossed lovers. The movie is both stylish and brilliant. This is a classic that well be with us forever. I give this move 5/5. Rated PG.TagLineThey had a date with fate in Casablanca!",10,1,1,23 November 1998
Citizen Kane," 1. Citizen Kane (1941)
","PRINCIPAL CASTOrson Welles Joseph CottenDIRECTOR Orson WellesPRODUCER Orson WellesSCREENWRITERS Herman J. Mankiewicz, Orson WellesReviewI can see why this movie was claimed the greatest movie of all time, it's because it truly is in many ways. Charles Kane has died and his last words were Rose Bud.

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I dream come true
","The ultimate in offensive comedy has hit the big screen with an excellent movie. Eric, Kyle, Stan and Kenny on the big screen it's a dream come true. The kid's favorite TV show Terrance and Philip has been made into a rated movie. The kids watch the movie, which features constant swearing. The kids can't stop swearing after this upsets Kyle's mother. Terrance and Philip are arrested and war is declared on Canada. Being Canadian a found the movie's attitude toward us quite funny. 'Mothers Against Canada' The song Blame Canada is definitively of the funniest songs in the movie. The whole movie parody's Disney animated musicals the beginning of South Park is take on the beginning of Beauty and the Beast. The song Satan sings is a direct parody of the song 'Up There' from The Little Mermaid. The movie laughs in the face of MPAA going beyond what they would deem acceptable. The death of Kenny in this movie of one of the funniest I have seen so far. 10/10 a brilliant comedy.",10,0,0,18 September 1999
The Mummy," Fun action adventure movie.
","Get ready for a wild ride when Rick O'Connell and his companions Evelyn and Jonathan awake a 3000-year-old mummy. Hamunaptra the city of the dead where the Egyptians go to be mummified or resurrect the dead. The mummy is an exciting, entertaining and fun action adventure movie. The plot is sort of like Indiana Jones type thing because it has Americans and British searching for treasure. The mummy effects and look are quite convincing, unlike the original this remake has a lot of scary looking mummies. The movie has a fun and involving story with a compelling narration beginning.",9,0,0,29 September 1999
American Psycho," Canada got the original uncut version
","Patrick Bateman is the Vice President of a company that does accounts or something like that. Patrick Bateman's long time girlfriend Evelyn Williams wants to get married though Patrick isn't interested in getting married. Patrick has strong desires to murder women and store their body parts in his apartment and the apartment of Paul a guy he murdered. Patrick isn't interested in anything but working out, properly cleaning himself and acting out his sick desires. The film plays out as a satire of the 1980's it shows the emptiness of the decade through the viewpoint of Patrick Bateman. The film has a number of funny times as well as scary and intense times. The director Mary Harron balances the satire elements and the horror elements in a entertaining way. The gory violence mostly occurs off screen though it does still have some good gory moments. The version I got to see was the original uncut version which has a three way sex scene. In Canada you get the uncut version which has that scene; the American version does not have that scene it has been cut out. I have not read the original novel by Bret Easton Ellis though I defiantly would like to read it.",9,0,0,17 April 2000
Dark City," DARK CITY (1998)
","An alien species called the strangers come to earth to study us. They are placed in a city where they conduct experiments on them. They have special powers which one man named John Murdoch has. The plot is strong and powerful, which is helped by good special effects. I give this movie 41/2 out of 5. Rated PA",Null,0,1,24 June 1999
Gone with the Wind," 4. Gone With The Wind (1939)
","Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are back in the best version of Gone With The Wind ever. They have remastered the picture quality and the sound quality. This romance story takes place during the Civil War, which is portrayed, in quite a realistic manner and quite brilliantly in style. The relationship between Scarlett and Rhett is well thought out and diffidently a lot of fun to watch because Rhett is such a stylish man. If you haven't seen the film may I suggest you watch the collector's edition, they really did a good of fixing it up. This movie most rightly takes it's place as the fourth greatest movie of all time according to me and the AFI. Gone With The Wind is a classic that will be with us forever. I give this movie 5/5.

And in Maltin's view, 'it looks better than it has in years.'

Schindler's List," extraordinary motion picture
","I thought I would watch the movie again before I reviewed it, which is easy since I have it on tape. I have seen this movie a number of times and it still impresses me. Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's most extraordinary movie. It's the true story of Oskar Schindler a business man who saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. It won 7 Academy Awards inaddition to a number of other awards including the Director's Guild. The Cinematography for this movie was brilliantly done, it was truly haunting. This film had some of the best performances I have seen. Ralph Fiennes did an excellent acting job when took on the character Amon Goeth. Amon a man who likes his Jewish maid a little too much, he seems to be quite disturbed and also is quite brutal. Liam Neeson acting so also excellent he really played the role. Oskar Schindler is a member of the Nazi party who is a womanizer and a war profiteer. He character changes very much because he knows what the Germans are trying to due the Jews. The scene where the Germans remove the Jews from the Ghetto is disturbing and well directed. The unearthing of the bodies scene is haunting and disturbing. The ending of this movie brings a tear to my eye everytime. An extraordinary film with a compelling story and stunning score. 10/10 for this masterpiece. Number 9 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies.",10,9,13,3 September 1999
Dumb and Dumber," Harry and Lloyd go on a trip.
",Harry and Lloyd go on a trip across America to return a briefcase to Mary. A couple of the jokes are corny but the rest of them are funny. The cop joke is the best next to Lloyd's dream. I have seen this movie six times and the jokes are still funny. Jim Carry and Jeff Daniels are great as two annoying losers. The soundtrack for this movie is great; it has the hit 'The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead' by Crash Test Dummies. For Harry and Lloyd everyday is a no-brainer.,8,0,0,29 August 1999
A Clockwork Orange," A dark, ironic tale of an ultraviolent future.
","This movie is a must see there is nothing in Hollywood like A Clockwork Orange. This is my favorite movie by the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. This film is a brilliant commentary on youth crime and government attempts to stop it. Alex is a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. Him and his Droogies go around creating a real horror show. Alex arrested for murder and his Droogies abandoned him. There is a scene where Alex's is reading the Bible and picturing himself doing all bad things that people did in the Bible stories. This would mean the character of Alex is very drawn to violence he enjoys committing it. Would it possibly for someone to become cured so that individual would not commit another act of violence ever again? The rest of the movie will show you if it is possibly. Malcolm McDowell performance as the infamous young troublemaker is fantastic and brilliant. The remix's of Beethoven's ninth symphony are great and work well with the action on the screen. The slang and dialogue is excellent I would compare it to Shakespeare. A powerful and compelling story that is entertaining no matter how many times you see it. 10/10 A dark, ironic tale of an ultraviolent future.",10,0,0,1 October 1999
Total Recall," great sci-fic action/adventure movie
","Is this reality? Or is this only a dream the ultimate questions in the science fiction action/adventure film Total Recall. That's the fun part of the movie is figuring out if Douglas Quaid is dreaming or not, the events that happen are real I say but other people might disagree. Directed by the always entertaining except in the case of Showgirls filmmaker Paul Verhoeven who has a unique style. Hopefully Paul Verhoeven will come out with another film after the somewhat of a failure at the box office Starship Troopers. Douglas Quaid life is turn upside down after going to the Recall center, his wife and friends keep trying to kill him and he learns he might be someone else. Quaid goes to Mars where he meets up with Melina and the underground rebelling movement. Quaid discovers about his new purpose and about his old purpose created by his other self. The film is a great example how well science fiction and action can mix together to make an excellent movie. The story is intriguing, well scripted and has enough Arnold action style to entertain anybody who likes action stories. If you like this movie check out Robocop and Starship Troopers. Lessons Learned: Colonizing Mars can result in mutants. Mars has a prostitution problem. The concept of a woman having three breasts is not much of a turn on. Even in the future there's Pepsi. Good guys own stripper clubs.",9,0,1,5 February 2000
Titanic," Titanic is one of the year's best films.
","TITANIC Titanic is one of the year's best films. The story is based on actual events of the tragic Titanic voyage. Since everyone knows what happens to the Titanic, James Cameron adds a interesting twist to the story. A ship in the present sends a probe into the Titanic to locate a diamond but instead finds a picture of a naked lady. The lady who is in the drawing calls the man who found the picture. She tells her story about her time spent on the Titanic.There is a lot interesting scenes in the movie in addition to being powerful and dramatic. It is a very long movie but the time passes so well that you don't even notice that much. The shots of the Titanic in some scenes were quite good. This movie is definitely a must see especially on the big screen. Rated PA",10,1,1,7 November 1998
Psycho," Psycho is a good thriller
","Said to be Alfred Hitchcock's most terrifying film and it sure is with its compelling story and stunning score. Marion has stolen a large amount of cash and is driving to meet her boyfriend Sam. She stops at a place called Bates Motel, which is run by Norman Bates and his apparent overprotective mother. 'She just goes a little mad sometimes' according to Norman Bates in his conversion with Marion. This leads to the famous shower scene and the compelling events that follow when Marion's sister is trying to find out what had happened to her. The ending of this movie is shocking and surprising. This movie was number 18 on the AFI hundred greatest movies. This Alfred best movie even according to the public I would say so myself. I can watch this movie over and over again; I would still not be bored with it. 5/5 for this frightening classic. Followed by 3 sequels and a remake.",10,5,9,20 August 1999
Army of Darkness," fun fantasy adventure film
","Ok so its no Citizen Kane but still think that this deserved more praise then it got. The critics dislike this because it was different from the previous films, which is true. I have yet to The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn maybe when I do see these films my view of this film will change. Ash is transported to 1300 AD when he goes through a wormhole like thing. To get back to his time Ash must get the book of the dead and say three magic words. Ash forgets the last word but takes the book as the result he awakens the army of darkness also known as the deadites. Ash decides the people to fight the deadites because they refused to send him home. The film makes great use of fantasy and humor; the film is more comedy then horror unlike the first two films. If you are looking for a horror film this isn't for you but if you want a funny fantasy adventure film this is for you. Short run time, plenty of action and laughs makes this film quite watchable even if you don't like it. An exciting, entertaining and fun fantasy adventure comedy; though some of the special effects are campy the comedy makes up for that. Lessons Learned: People from the 14th century are considered to be primates. People that work in the hardware section at S-Mark know how to make artificial limbs. Everybody has a chemistry textbook in the trunk of their car. New pickup Line: 'Give me some sugar baby'",10,2,3,4 January 2000
Scream 2," SCREAM 2 (1997)
",Someone has taken their love of squeals one step too far in this new Scream which is almost as good as the original. The new movie has lots of laughs and screams in it. It also has a good tie to the first movie. The outcome of the movie is quite surprising. Rated PA,Null,0,0,24 June 1999
The Green Mile," longer then it needed to be
",The only complaint against this film is its length; the film runs too slow and thins in parts. It's going real good then suddenly drops off for a while then starts running real well again. I could tell that other people agreed with me because people were checking there watches and other people were asking each other how long is this film. This affected the film power to gets supernatural message across to a bored audience. The film has good moments of humor surrounding the popular mouse Mr. Jingles. The performances are great and the characters are interesting. Though seeing Dale gruesomely get electrocuted was probably something people could have done without during the Christmas season. If you like supernatural stories this is for you and if you liked The Shawshank Redemption you might like this movie.,9,0,0,11 December 1999
Platoon," A powerful and moving war drama.
",This movie is director Oliver Stone best movie; it's a war movie classic. Platoon gives us a real grim look at the horrors of the Vietnam War. War always brings out the worst in people; tensions begin to amount among the platoon because of the two conflicting sergeants. The American soldier's actions become quite wrong when dealing with Vietnam civilians. A sometimes shocking but always vivid and compelling war drama. . Chris Taylor is a rich teen who volunteered for the war effort. The movie is narrated along by Chris Taylor played by Charlie Sheen who gives the best performance of his career. Watch for the head-smashing scene. 10/10 A powerful and moving war drama.,10,0,0,2 October 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," The best thriller of the 90's.
","This movie is probably my favorite thriller of all time. The silence of the lambs is the only horror / thriller to win an Academy award for best picture. It also won for best director, best actor for both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Buffalo Bill is murdering and skinny women across the country. Clarice Starling a student is sent to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector in hope that they will be able to create a profile for Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector is called Hannibal the cannibal you can pretty much guess what he did. Dr. Lector keeps giving Starling clues in an exchange for answering his questions about her childhood. Anthony Hopkins performance stuns me every time it's simply brilliant. Scott Glen performance as the psychopath who wants to be a transvestite was bravo as well. Jodie Foster received an Academy award for her excellent performance as well. The scene when Jack is watching Clarice as she goes through the house is chilling. The story is strong and compelling with a stunning score. The movie is shocking, frightening and even disturbing with its subject matter. 10/10 The best thriller of the 90's.",10,1,1,10 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Another great horror movie
","Cole Sear is a young boy who can see dead people sound scary believe me it is. The Sixth Sense is an effective horror movie with a good story to back it up. Cole is reluctant to tell anyone about his dark secret. Malcolm Crowe is a child psychologist who wants to help to Cole, as the story continues the relationship between them grows stronger. Bruce Willis is great as a child psychologist. Haley Joel Osment does an excellent acting job he made the character of Cole quite convincing. Like the Blair Witch Project this movie doesn't use tons of gore scenes instead it takes time to develop a strong story. The story is basically about getting over our fears and letting go of the past. The ending of this movie had a great unexpected twist. This movie has great imagery and an excellent spooky score. 10/10 Another great horror movie. 'I see dead people' Cole Sear",10,0,0,12 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Red Line (1998)
","An all star cast and good performances just could not save the plot of The Thin Red Line. The plot for this film is really boring infact its so boring that it made Beloved look like Jackie Chan flick. The plot is so slow and the war scenes are not that exciting. Saving Private Ryan is great movie but this one is awful. I just could not like this movie even when I try to. I could not believe this film was nominated for best picture, the film critics said it was good but not that good. The Judges nominated this film for over the Truman Show. The Truman is one of best films if not the best movie that came out in 1998. The soldiers sit around think a lot and we can hear their thoughts of course. This becomes more and more annoying as the film goes on. It was too long for such a weak war story. See Saving Private Ryan but avoid The Thin Red Line if you can. It's just not that great at all. Worst war movie I have seen.",Null,1,3,8 August 1999
Princess Mononoke," a masterpiece
","Is Princess Mononoke for children in North America? The answer can be yes or no it depends on your viewpoint. A lot of this film will go over well with children and the intense violence well scare them out of their seats. The girls in Iron town were rescued from the brothels and they do mention that in the film but they don't say what they did other then men bother them. The film runtime is 135 minutes; children are use to films that run for only 80-90 minutes, as the result children will have trouble following the film. Adult anime fans will love this movie unless they just watch anime for animated nudity. When Ashitaka defeats a boar that had turned into a demon he is left with a mark on his arm that will spread across his body and kill him. Ashitaka leaves his village to find the Sprit of the forest in the forest from which no man has returned. Ashitaka makes to it a town called Iron Town where they make Iron. The town is run by Lady Eboshi who wants to tame the forest to gain profit; she is destroying the forest. Lady Eboshi has very good aspects to her she did rescue women from the brothels and gave Lepers a chance to work. A relationship develops between Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolf gods and Ashitaka when Ashitaka rescues Mononoke from Iron Town. The story is struggle between good and evil but simplistic one like in the case of Disney films. Japanese films have more freedom when it comes to creating their stories since they don't have to worry about over sensitive editors. Hayao Miyazaki gives us a story about how humans, animals and nature gods constantly fight over share of emerging order. The ending isn't better then life happy like in Disney its just practical and realistic. This movie is very well directed, the story is enchanting and involving, it grabs the audience attention and never lets it go. The animation is sharp and visually stunning, a true landmark in animation and fantasy adventure, a flawless masterpiece. 10/10 A definite contender for Best Foreign Picture at the Academy Awards.",10,0,1,4 January 2000
Jurassic Park," Great Fun
","Like every other little boy I was too fascinated by Dinosaurs. Truly amazing beautiful animals that went extinct 65 million years ago. There is so much to learn about Dinosaurs, scientists only know part of the greater story. I once wanted to be a paleontologist when I grew up but then I said I wanted to be a number of things. Wouldn't it be nice to see live Dinosaurs so we could touch them and study them? Would it be possible to control the animals that have been just brought back to life? The movie suggests no way especially if we are going to be ignorant. Malcolm said that life would find a way so breeding them all to be female may not work. The explanation the film gives us for how we could clone dinosaurs is quite logical, scientists said that it could done. (In the future of course) With the use of CGI legendary director Steven Spielberg brought us completely convincing looking dinosaurs. The movie has a terrific story its exciting, entertaining, compelling and a lot of fun. Critics complained that the acting was bad, I thought acting was just fine. The logic behind how the parks electrical system would work is shaky and some of it doesn't make sense. Jurassic Park instantly became an international box office hit. 1993 was a good year for Steven Spielberg he made piles of money from this movie and he won 7 Academy awards for his other movie Schindler's List. 10/10 Great fun for all ages. Followed by The Lost World Jurassic Park.",10,3,6,8 October 1999
The Wizard of Oz," The Wizard Of Oz (1939)
","Dorothy and the gang are back in the best edition of the Wizard of Oz yet. Dorothy gets transported to the magical Land of Oz when she gets knocked unconscious during a twister. The sound and picture quality has been fixed up for this Special Edition version. Dorothy needs to get home, the Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Man wants a heart and the Lion wants courage. This is a classic is both magical and enduring. I think it most rightly takes it's place as the Sixth greatest film of all time according to me and the AFI. If you have not seen this movie on the big screen I suggest that you go see it. This is a classic that will be with us forever. I give this movie 5/5. Rated G.",Null,0,1,24 June 1999
Evil Dead II," good horror-comedy
",Though Army of Darkness (Evil Dead 3) was an action-comedy the first two films are horror-comedy. Ash and his girlfriend Linda stay the night at a cabin that belongs to an archeologist who was studying the book of the dead. The evil that was awoken by the book kills Linda and several humorous attempts to take out Ash. Ash troubles increase when a group of people comes to the cabin one of which is the daughter of the archeologist. The film makes good use of creepy and funny elements to tell its story. The setting of the story is set up well and the film gets right down to business instead of dragging along. Funny of use the blood splashing all over the place especially the face. Lessons Learned: Dead people look like walking rubber from a distance. Trees can leave their places so they can attack cabins. Trees have faces well sort of.,9,1,1,15 January 2000
