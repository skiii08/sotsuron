The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Teen soap fan-fic masquerading as deep futurist commentary
","I was intrigued by the first film. Sure I eventually discovered that the teen romance took center stage despite building this up as some dystopian future epic (or a fantasy world, I couldn't figure out which). The politics/social commentary were a bit simplistic but perhaps they were saving the real meat for part 2. It still whetted your appetite for learning more about this world.Catching Fire started out decently enough with some passable allusion to the lifestyle of celebrity/political couples and introduced an interesting concept of discontentment within the seemingly loyalist Capitol City elite. However this is where the series started to irritate me with its endlessly generic love triangle, elementary school level black & white politics/social commentary, and downright absurd leaps in suspension of belief.This latest entry only furthers that downfall into inane tripe. In addition to following we already had to stomach -Sat.Morning cartoon evil empire vs plucky youngster and the most powerful force of all: Hope! If 'hope' is so dangerous, why have the games at all? Why not just make them entirely broken slaves? -Twilight style soap opera level romance where the female lead spends most of the movie trying to figure out her one true love. More than trying to survive or topple Dr Doom's regime it seems.-Villainy for the sake of villainy. Why kill off thousands of your slave labor when human beings are supposedly in very short supply. Also, why obliterate your expensive infrastructure when your have lethal poison gas at your disposal? -Technological leaps of faith: We have mind-blowingly stunning futuristic technology (much devoted solely to gladiatorial combat) and can genetically modify bees with hallucinogenic drugs, but can't genetically modify more food for the masses? Those slave work horses are less likely to rebel if you give them a fresh supply of oats.-Breaking suspension of disbelief. In addition to the questionable tech, we get weird stuff like skin ravaging gas (entirely cured by water) and being blown yards away by electricity while not so much as leaving a visible scar. That and the nagging question: If Katniss is such a threat, why does Snow not just up and kill her? You have no problem killing scores simply for making a hand gesture.Mockingjay adds the following -It's the third movie and we just now discover another entire rebel army and military HQ has been conveniently waiting behind the scenes this whole time. Apparently for 75 years! -Am I suppose to believe no one in that entire rebel army was capable of sowing the seeds of rebellion or inspiring the slaves to rebel. For an entire 75 years?? -Seriously, why were these guys never mentioned in prior films? -If they've been underground that long, how can they be expected to cope with the sun on the surface? -If the Capitol had the power the brainwash people with drugs, why not brainwash Katniss into a timebomb to discredit her instead of pitting her into another contest? -Yes the Capitol is evil and does evil things. Surprisingly, this is news to people 75 years into its history. And apparently suppose to be surprising to the audience who sat through the past two movies -Snow saw Katniss and the rebels walking among the ruins, yet chooses to bomb the hospital instead of bombing the rebels? Why not both? -I just witnessed a single arrow fired from a bow taking down a futuristic bomber aircraft in a massive explosion. Why did they rebels bother firing hundreds of rounds from an anti-aircraft rifle when a single arrow fired from a bow was more effective? -How many times did Katniss break down over a setback and shout NO!, NO!, NOOO!!! in an agonized expression. How long before she's aware of the dystopian primal world she was born into.-Peeta appears on TV repeatedly in worse and worse condition over the film. It's suppose to be chilling to notice how ragged he looks in each successive appearance, but the movie doesn't think we have eyes and requires Katniss to spell out every detail that appears on screen before even the audience gets a good look: 'My god, he looks awful!' 'What have they been doing to him!' 'Look at him, how terrible!' repeatedly almost 20 times. Similar things happen throughout the movie.-They have the ability to hack into the entire capital without consequence....why was this never attempted in earlier films? And why did they need Katniss in particular if they could pre-fab their own propaganda? -For someone who is suppose to be a standard-bearer for the free world, Katniss doesn't spend much of the movie thinking about it. Most is spent on worrying about Peeta, that is between the time where she isn't actively pursuing Gale. Subtle commentary perhaps, but I doubt it.The movie has a few good ideas, namely that the rebels may not be as noble as they appear and questioning the downright terrorist acts the rebels resort to to win. The first 5 minutes give a false sense of a dystopian visual feast before descending quickly into banality. Also, you can't go wrong with a boyfriend timebomb. It's interesting and cheesy enough to at least grab your attention.I honestly wouldn't be so hard on this if it wasn't trying so earnestly to be taken as a serious look at a dystopian future and a serious romance-drama despite being, at its core, teenage fluff.I really should just consider the whole series a lost cause. I seriously doubt it will get much better. But there's one more left. I think I'll manage that just to witness the resulting 'thud' the this series (or, if a miracle occurs, be pleasantly surprised).",4,6,8,14 March 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Tolkien's Modest Tale Gets Mired In Shallow Action Setpieces and Mediocre Fanfiction
","I have immensely enjoyed the LOTR trilogy and even found the first Hobbit movie to be a competent adaptation of the Tolkien novel. Yet DOS is easily Peter Jackson's weakest, most desperate entry: completely smothering, diluting, and contradicting the source material. Worse, it even fails as its own adaptive entry in Peter Jackson's Hobbit tale with paper thin characterizations, bloated and empty action sequences, and a series of plot holes added not only to the Tolkien lore, but also in the plot line concocted by Peter Jackson's team.MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT: To keep this a proper length, I'll just say that the first 30 minutes is a mix of abridged Tolkien and weak filler.The first most glaring plot shift in this alternate Jackson plot line involves Legalos and Tamriel as a betrothed couple, characters who were never in the book, and a preposterous love triangle involving Kili the dwarf. This really insults the intelligence of anyone vaguely familiar with the Tolkien-verse and is just stupidly contrived even when divorced from Tolkien lore. The romance is so undercooked and contrived between Tamriel and Kili that it is extremely difficult to take seriously. A wood elf, of a race/species that had been mortal enemies of dwarfs for centuries, suddenly starts a serious love affair with a dwarf after some clich√©d banter and forced sob story. All the while willing to break up with Legalos.At any rate, everything Tolkien wrote in the Hobbit to expand upon and add charm and suspense to everything up to the Wood Elf fortress narrative was completely pared down to the bone. If not for the love story involving Kili, Bilbo would have rescued them all within 10 minutes of capture--a complete mockery of the Tolkien narrative.Of course it's clear to see why that part needed to be rushed through: to get to the wall to wall river action! Not only does this whole scene look patently phoney, it may well be one of the most mindless sequences yet created in Jackson's Middle Earth. The heroes become nigh immortal, characters become weightless and defy physics for no other reason than to kill as many orcs as possible as flashy as possible, and the elves apparently have limitless arrow ammunition and can subdue orcs by sheer brute strength. The elves in particular are essentially gods that can only be touched through painfully awkward plot contrivance. Even the most near-impossible stunt in the LOTR trilogy doesn't approach this level of fan-wankery.However, late in the film, we get more idiotic and pointless action sequences in Laketown. Apparently, orcs manage to infiltrate to town and for some reason the dwarfs and elves are the only residents willing to fight back despite heavily armed guards roaming the streets previously. 'Cuz we don't want anyone else hogging the glory of the elves beating down orc fodder like something out of an Asian martial arts film. To further insult the viewer's intelligence, not a single person is known to have been killed in the assault. Why are orcs considered a threat again? By far the stupidest scene is the depiction of Legalos chasing the orc leader across a bridge to the mainland. That's right, a bridge to the mainland--a conceit that makes the entire infiltration of the city, the entire premise of the island's isolation a complete and utter farce. Why there's not so much as a drawbridge is mind-bogglingly lazy.Firstly, Bilbo never again wears the ring even though it's the only sane thing to do under the circumstances. Supposedly, Bilbo is being corrupted by the ring which is complete bullocks considering Hobbits are suppose to be immune to its effects for long periods of time. In the Jackson-verse narrative, Bilbo seemingly only got the ring days ago. Bilbo is completely unaffected by it during his adventure in the Tolkien novel with much more time passing with the ring in JRR's narrative. Also, Smaug can supposedly sense the ring on him while he's invisible, but he never does again even while Bilbo is stupidly running around visible. The contradiction especially apparent while Bilbo spends a lengthy amount of time to grab the Arkenstone but somehow it never dawns on him to do it while invisible.Once the dwarfs enter the Erebor (Smaug's lair) is when the movie goes completely off the rails into sheer camp. They bait the dragon and go through a 20+ minutes chase sequence with Smaug being constantly outmaneuvered and outsmarted by these dwarfs despite living in Erebor for almost 100 years. What was once a dangerous and crafty creature turns into one of the Keystone Kops, unable to torch even one dwarf despite all the foreshadowing of Smaug being aware of the scent of dwarfs. Yet, when they walk right over or under him, he's completely oblivious. At one point, Thorin stands on Smaug's snout, yet instead of slurping him up with his tongue or roasting him with a brief blast of flame from his nostrils, Thorin is given ample time to escape and still impossibly dodge a pillar of flame without so much as a sunburn.Through all this, Bilbo's role is sidelined for Thorin's Batman-esque heroics. Smaug doesn't even seem like he's really tricked by Bilbo's 'barrel-rider' boast 20 minutes earlier--why he even mentions it after being harassed for so long by the dwarfs is anyone's guess. Even when Smaug starts for Laketown on his own (finally!), the most mind-numbing scene occurs where Smaug is lured and then engulfed by a giant dwarven statue melting on top of him like molasses, completely engulfed, then shaking it all off like a wet dog. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. How Bilbo himself managed to keep himself from being liquified by the splashing molten gold dripping off of Smaug is irrelevant at this point. It's a real capstone of 'what were they thinking?' that pervades this film.",4,0,0,28 December 2013
Frozen," A pleasant diversion, but no classic and leadened by weak musical numbers.
","This was a pretty decent animated film, though nothing really exceptional.There are some good points on a conceptual level, such as the focus on multiple female heroines and to Scandinavian setting. The best aspect is that this looks astounding, with very appealing character designs and settings. The comic relief is also a mildly strong point.But this is really a quite average film. The skeleton and glitz is there, but there's not much depth and nuance (by Disney standards) that really make this film stand out among the Disney or Pixar classics. The story progression is also very patchwork where conflict is presented and resolved with a blink of an eye and ponderous diversions eat up screen time before hastily resuming the plot. When a movie like 'The Emperor's New Groove' outdoes a film like this in all of these aspects, you know something's wrong. Even the better character development, such as Esla and Anna's relationship, doesn't seem as strong as it should.Some of these issues could be blamed on the musical aspect, a genre Disney had cornered for decades in the animation medium, taking up the script. But this film has got to have some of the weakest musical numbers in Disney's film canon. They're so generic that they could easily have been salvaged from Disney's direct-to-video 'cheapquels'. Lyrics are bland and repetitive, simply doling out exposition without being remotely memorable. At best, they are mildly diverting though still seem like lesser numbers lifted from a Disney Channel music video. It's sad when the 'Olaf in Summer' number is the best of the bunch (sure it was completely pointless, but it was at least kinda entertaining).There's also this odd sense that this movie had serious 'in-development' issues similar to movies like Bolt, Tangled, and Brave. While Tangle came out much better for it (and personally a better film), this one came out not so well where it seems like there wasn't much of a solid direction. While the bare bones plot survived along with a handful of well-realized character moments, Disney ended up holding this together by padding and bridging sequences with superfluous musical numbers (troll song anyone?) and plenty of fluffy comic relief moments while other seemingly important characters like Wesalton are wasted supplying little more than comic relief and expositing antagonistic dialogue here and there.I know that this was intended as a kid's/tween's movie. The themes aren't too complex beyond the importance of family, trust, and the power of love. I have no issue with that. But this one seems like it's made almost exclusively for youngsters and a product of complacency and low expectations rather than be something that older audience members can equally appreciate like the best of Disney, Pixar or even Dreamworks.",5,30,59,2 March 2014
