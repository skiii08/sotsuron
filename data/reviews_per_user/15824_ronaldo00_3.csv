The Devil's Advocate," Oh my, Big Al Rules.. Again
","What a movie, what a ride. Beautifully performed that's what made this movie something to remember and fell glad to recommend seeing.He ain't supposed to be the big attraction, but he can't help it, it just explodes out of him. Salute to you Al Pacino, although it's never surprising that we see a magical performance coming from a master like you, but you totally blew me off. I can barely swear that no other actor could possibly deliver what big Al managed to, not even half as good he performed not now, not before and its sure ain't happen in the future. Al Pacino really amazed me this time. He simply stole the show.Reeves, with a good performance added something a long with Charlize Theron.It's full of amusement and it's definitely a must see especially for those who thinks Al's best performance was in Scent of a woman - I WAS one of you - .",9,1,1,9 February 2007
American Beauty," American beauty
","American beauty has so many things you can think over, when I first saw the advertisement for it I thought , of course it's one of those movies romantic drama with no drama in it, but once i sat and watched the movie i suddenly realized that the credit and the awards that it got was not for nothing. Lester character tells us how much a person can change in his life maybe it was some how delinquent but great Kevin spacey really earned his Oscar as will as SAM Mendez. American beauty is not about sex and it's not about lester committing adultery with Angela ,It's much more than that it's about changing our vision and our look to life in general and as lester said 'I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life'.American beauty is the best piece of work I've ever seen and for those who didn't watch the movie I'm telling you are missing a lot and for the who didn't like It sorry It's not that you didn't like It, you didn't understand it once you watch what's beyond you will love this movie.",10,1,2,14 July 2005
Mystic River," One of the best ever
","What's the use of going on and on saying, I recommend this picture highly or even assuring you that you will love it, will I can't. Because may be It's not the type of a movie that you would watch, but even If you don't like it you wont be able to Dennie It's greatness whether through the great direction by Eastwood or by the powerful performances especially those of Tim Robbins ans Sean Penn.As a man who tends to show himself more macho, I admit that I almost cried or may be be I dropped a tear or two and believe that is really something when it comes to me.Until this Day No movie moved me and touched me deeply as much as mystic river.It's a movie that teaches a lot, and it can reach to you in many ways, the kind of movie that i wish to see more of.
