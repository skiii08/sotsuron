Requiem for a Dream," One of the most compelling and hard to watch movies.
","I watched this movie alone and felt somewhat emotionally shattered afterward. However, it is one of the most compelling and brutal movies. It follows the lives of four drug addicted people. Sara, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian, and Harry's best friend Tyrone. Each character tries to fulfill his idea of a recipe to attain happiness. I watched helplessly on the sideline as they all spiraled into a deeper pit then I even imagined. It is so well done that I felt sick to my stomach at the end because I felt so entangled in the characters lives. The movies was quite graphic. It's very hard to put into words. Just see it if you can handle it.",9,1,1,20 November 2006
My Neighbor Totoro," Positively adorable!
","This movie was probably the cutest movie I've seen in my entire life. It made me smile from beginning to end. It starts with a father and his two little girls moving to a new house. The girls encounter friendly spirits that live near their new house in the forest. Totoro is one of the spirits, a big lovable creature, who is always there to help the little girls. Plus the friendly neighbors add happiness to the movie. There was not a single part that seemed unnecessary or too over the top. It left the viewer feeling happy and content when it ended. It's good for every age and I would highly recommend seeing it. Miyazaki wins the cuteness award for this movie.",9,1,2,23 November 2006
