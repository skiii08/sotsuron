United 93," See this movie!
","I was skeptical about a movie done on the tragedies of September 11th, but after hearing family members of the victims approval I decided to go. Go now if you can as some of the proceeds for opening weekend will be donated to the memorial fund. This movie brings back all of the emotions that we all felt on that fateful day, it's gripping and heartfelt. I think it was done as accurately and truthfully as could possibly be done based on the facts that are known about this tragedy, I don't think it could have been done any better. It's so hard to put this movie into words, but I'm so glad that I did go see it. If you still think about 9-11, if these people are still in your thoughts and prayers, go see this movie.",10,1,4,29 April 2006
