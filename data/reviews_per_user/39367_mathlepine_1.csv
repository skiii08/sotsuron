Catch Me If You Can," Interesting, entertaining... but a little bit too long.
","Leonardo is excellent as Frank Jr and so are Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. The plot is great for a true story in the sense that you don't always know what is going to happen next, there are some surprises. It was one of the first time that a beautiful lady played by a famous actress wasn't in the action of the movie. In fact, there is none. Yes, there are many ladies, but they have little screen time and they aren't famous. So, it was a fresh aspect here for a Leonardo movie that I liked. The plot is entertaining because you're asking yourself when he'll get caught. (if you know that he gets caught) The way he fools everyone is also very funny to watch. The dates were a little bit confusing but it wasn't very important. Sometimes, some scenes are boring and you want to get to the action. At the end, you hope that it end because it's a long movie, but it's worth it.
It is not the best movie that I've seen. Live some people pointed out, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, it wasn't dramatic enough to be a drama. It was something unusual that could have been god, but I think that Spielberg didn't spend too much time on this movie. So it gives us a good movie... close to even be very good...    8/10",8,1,2,14 January 2003
