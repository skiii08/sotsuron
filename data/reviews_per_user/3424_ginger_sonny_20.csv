The Devil's Advocate," Tongue In Cheek
","Rosemary's Baby joins The Firm in this fun thriller starring Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino In director Taylor Hackford's Devil's Advocate, a pre-Matrix Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a young, ambitious Florida attorney lured to a multinational law firm in New York by the deliciously evil magnate played by a charismatically diabolical John Milton (Pacino). There Lomax becomes corrupted by vanity, ambition and greed - while his loyal wife, Mary Ann (Theron), trying to get him to see the error of his ways, is sacrificed on the altar of greed. Pacino gleefully invests Milton with a gimlet-eyed evil, as, after all, he's not just an unscrupulous boss - he's the Devil himself. Yup, Pacino joins other such luminaries as De Niro (in Angel Heart), Nicholson (in The Witches Of Eastwick), Gabriel Byrne (in End Of Days) and even Sam Neill (in Omen III: The Final Conflict) in incarnating the Antichrist in the name of entertainment. This is tongue-in-cheek, fun thriller and a variation on a classic theme - would you sell your soul to gain the whole world?",Null,0,1,27 August 2004
The Big Lebowski," more Coen genius
","Jeff Bridges is the exquisitely stoned Dude. John Goodman is Walter the crazed Nam veteran. The Coen brothers direct. A fantastic combination
Fargo was always going to be a hard act to follow, but the Coen Brothers succeeded with this off-the-wall bowling comedy turned kidnap thriller.Bridges is 'The Dude' Lebowski, an aging slacker and ten-pin fanatic who just wants to go bowling (cue the movie's hilarious parrot-cry) but becomes unwittingly caught up in a complex abduction plot purely because he shares his surname with a mobster. With some frighteningly weird stuff, ranging from lavish dream sequences to Moore naked on a trapeze, this is bizarre but brilliant Coen territory. There is terrific support from Goodman as Bridges' best bowling buddy, a sporadically violent Jewish convert who manages to get him into even deeper trouble with almost no effort whatsoever, Buscemi cast brilliantly against type as their silent friend Donny, and Turturro, whose lycra-suited bowling champ Jesus Quintana positively heists the few scenes in which he appears.",Null,0,1,31 August 2004
Rocky V," Wooden
","Rocky V Wisely choosing to retire Rocky from the main action in the ring, Stallone instead puts his mind to training newcomer Morrison to step into his shoes. However, big business risks getting in the way. Potentially much more interesting is the sub-plot of Rocky trying to patch things up with his son (played by Stallone's real offspring), but this is handled with much less finesse than characterized the original Rocky. Odd that Stallone, who can be a great actor (as his performance in Copland illustrated), gives such wooden performances in the films that should be closest to his heart.

The English Patient," beautiful, but read the book too
","Beautifully shot adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's classic novel. Showered with Oscars and plaudits on its release Oscars for Best Picture, director Minghella and actress Binoche were among the many laurels showered on this adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's 1992 book. Romance blossoms between star-crossed lovers Count Laszlo de Almásy (Fiennes) and Katherine Clifton (Scott Thomas) in desert outposts during World War II, the couple's affair related in flashback by amnesiac, charred and dying Almásy to sympathetic nurse Hana (Binoche). Although its setting (and aloof leading man) has drawn comparisons with epics such as Lawrence Of Arabia, the ebb and flow of memory and attention to interior landscape - both signatures of Minghella's work - transcend the forbidding landscape to create inner vistas arresting as desert blooms.",Null,0,2,31 August 2004
Fargo," Smart,stylish,frozen film noir from the Coen Brothers
","Just when the ultra-ironic, ultra-violent thriller seemed to have been done to death by Tarantino and his acolytes, along came the Coen brothers to breathe fresh life into the genre. David Mamet-favourite Macy is wonderfully weak and wicked as Jerry Lundegaard the Swedish-American car-salesman whose attempts to mastermind the perfect crime - the kidnapping of his wife - go horribly, violently and hilariously wrong. For a start he has hired two trigger-happy crooks, the verbose Carl (Buscemi) and the taciturn Gaear (Stormare) to carry out the kidnapping. Pretty soon people are starting to get shot and this attracts the attention of the smart, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand, who deservedly won an Academy Award for her tough, funny, touching performance). With its central plot strand of the well-planned crime spiralling wildly out of control, the film investigates similar territory to the Coen brothers' brilliant debut Blood Simple, but Fargo is a more assured work, lighter and more layered. The cast, boasting at least three scene-stealing performances (Macy, McDormand and Buscemi), are on top form. The film manages the neat trick of trumping Tarantino by not merely being filled with laughs and slickly handled, literally visceral action sequences, but also presenting rounded, recognizably human characters.",Null,0,0,31 August 2004
Léon: The Professional," Besson's best work

Hit-man Leon (Reno) lives by a strict code of ethics on a diet of milk and sit-ups with only a pot plant for company. When bent copper Oldman murders a neighboring family, Leon reluctantly harbors the only surviving witness, pre-teen Mathilda (Portman). She pushes Leon to teach her the assassin's trade, and her desire for revenge eventually leads them into the film's ferocious climax.Oldman appears once again to swerve alarmingly towards ham, but Reno's performance of hangdog loyalty lends his character pleasing sympathy while Besson's heavily stylised direction builds tension around sexy violence.",10,0,1,3 August 2004

","Tim Burton's skewed suburban fairytale starring Johnny Depp as the unfinished experiment who has shears instead of hands. Visually, stylistically and emotionally stunning.After finding his fantastical feet in Batman and Beetlejuice, Burton gave free reign to his imagination in this strangely cold curio.The small-minded community of a pastel-hued suburb is rocked when an Avon lady (Wiest) fosters Edward Scissorhands (Depp), the unfinished experiment of local Frankenstein, Vincent Price. A pallid, wild-haired innocent with a heart of gold and fingers of steel, Scissorhands becomes the neighborhood's personal freak show. He fascinates with his dexterous ability (as hairdresser, ice-sculptor etc.) and arouses strange desires in female loins. But he is never accepted into their pringle swathed hearts. Only Kim Boggs (Ryder), a companion in square-peg-round-hole ostracism, sees the beauty behind the boy's ghostly exterior and they begin a fairytale romance.Verdict: With its comic-book design, 50s chic and peerless, Gothic invention, the film is a visual treat, while Depp's blinking bewilderment made his character one of the icons of the 90s.",9,1,2,3 August 2004
Gandhi," epic yet flawed
","Epic but somewhat vague biopic of Indian spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi from Richard Attenborough. Ben Kingsley gives a career best performance in the central role For years this biopic of the great Indian statesman was director Attenborough's pet project and when he finally got the chance to make the film he pulled out all the stops in terms of cast and crew.
It's certainly visually stunning - the teeming beauty of India coming alive thanks to the cinematography of Williams and Taylor. Yet there's a feeling perhaps that Attenborough should have taken a few steps back from the material before commencing filming - as far too much is glossed over or left unexplained by the screenplay. It's safe to say that if you knew nothing about Gandhi before going in to the movie, you wouldn't know a whole lot more coming out. The decision to cast British actor Kingsley as the lead role was a controversial one. Admittedly, he is absolutely superb, his performance more than making up for the movie's other deficiencies.",Null,2,5,31 August 2004
Resident Evil," Glossy entertainment
","Glossy horror based on the best-selling video games. A group of commandos have to infiltrate an underground base - unfortunately it's defended by a ruthless artificial intelligence and is full of hungry zombiesFive years after it was first mooted, the movie adaptation of Capcom's bestselling video game arrives, helmed by Paul Anderson, the Briton responsible for hit video game movie Mortal Kombat and costly flop Soldier.Thankfully, Anderson and the producers were fans of the game (and its sequels), and were adamant that that its distinctive, chilling tone be transferred to film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers also managed to incorporate some rubbish of their own. Where the game was scary because of the player's depth of involvement, the film fails to fully engage due to poor characterisation and a pretty lame story. Eschewing literally using the plot of the first 'Resident Evil' game, the film maintains the basic premise of an isolated mansion and a feisty heroine (Andseron calls the film 'the explanatory prequel'). Alice (Jovovich) awakes in the shower with amnesia. While wandering around in the empty mansion she's joined by 'cop' Matt (Mabius) before the sudden SAS-style arrival of a group of commandos, lead by One (Salmon), then later by Rain (Rodriguez) when he gets splatted. In some leaden exposition, One walks and talks Alice - and us - through the set-up. The mansion is a cover for a secret lab - the Hive - belonging to the ubiquitous Umbrella Corporation. A virus has been released in the Hive, killing all the staff. The lab has been sealed by the Red Queen, a 'state of the art artificial intelligence' (who sounds like a schoolgirl reading out an essay in class). The commandos must enter the lab - taking Alice, Matt and a further amnesiac, Spence (Purefroy), with them - and retrieve the fruits of the research. These fruits turn out to be highly dubious bio-weapons, in the form of not just the zombie-creating 'T-virus', but also in the form of further monstrosities (such as 'the Licker').Resident Evil just about works. The characterisation and scripting seem sadly cursory, and devices such as giving characters amnesia are tired, but the overall dynamic is effective. The few stabs at story depth are cackhanded - Umbrella is made the quintessence of pervasive, all-powerful corporations; Matt has an earnest little speech about its evils ('Companies like Umbrella think they're above the law, but they're not.'). However, there's some good horror here - zombies are always fun, but Anderson puts some effort into making them a worrying presence rather than simply a justification for gore. The look of the film relates nicely to the games too. While it's frequently glossy, it also gets moodier in places, hinting at the grim, lonely atmospherics of the games. The film's biggest coup comes at the end. It's giving nothing away to say the heroine makes it, but her fate superbly sets the story up for a sequel. George A Romero fans should also look out for a explicit nod to Day Of The Dead in the closing seconds. Verdict As a piece of quality cinema, Resident Evil just doesn't qualify. But as a slickly-produced piece of trash - and, more importantly, as an adaptation of a video game - it holds its own.",Null,0,0,18 October 2004
Zulu," pure British vintage cinema
","Vintage tale of the attack by 4,000 Zulus on a small British outpost in 1870s Natal. Stars Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins and Michael Caine
'Zulus, sir. Thousands of them...' Well, 4,000 to be precise, and all of them heading towards a character-actor-packed stockade at Rourke's Drift, with their spear-points glinting in the sun. Anxiously awaiting them is small regiment of Wales' finest (less than 150 in fact), keeping the British imperial end up in south African back-country, in 1879.
Endfield's lavish paean to British pluck has become as much a part of the bank holiday as wet weather and vomiting up your Easter egg, so it's hard not to feel well-disposed towards it, despite its struggles with the clichÃ©s of heroism and flatulent length. Director Cy Enfield (The Sound Of Fury, Mysterious Island) was among the fimmakers blacklisted by the HUAC in the 50s. He emigrated to Britain, where he made Zulu, his biggest hit. As for the actors, Baker (who also produced and personally put funding into the film) is the dignified officer, Caine (in his first starring role) his sour lieutenant, Booth the weak link in the chain of command who ultimately proves his mettle.

Lawrence of Arabia," multi Oscar winning epic
","Superlative multi-Oscar winning biography of T E Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole), the Oxford-educated lieutenant, who united Arab tribes against the Ottoman Turks in WW1 The idea of Lawrence (O'Toole) as a wilfully self-destructive character is established in the credit sequence which presents his death in a motor-bike crash as something close to suicide. We flash back to Lawrence as a young, energetic, slightly mad man stuck in a job as a military cartographer, desperate to put his knowledge of and passion for all things Arabian to practical use. Then in a breathtaking cut we move from a lit match to the sun burning over the film's real star, the Arabian desert. Lean and cinematographer Young clearly fell for the desert as much as Lawrence himself, and they ensure that the audience shares their love.
The film strips down the story to its basics, following the struggle of the unhinged anti-hero to help establish a united Arab nation. O'Toole is wonderfully intense in the lead, but his characterization of a man of unfathomable motivations gets lost in the grandeur of his surroundings - the vast, exquisitely composed desertscapes and breathtaking battle scenes. Sharif is served better by a more conventional role and, emerging like a shimmering mirage on the horizon and slowly approaching the camera, is given one of cinema's great first appearances.",Null,1,3,31 August 2004
Schindler's List," deserved oscars
","Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes star in Spielberg's award-winning Holocaust drama Author Thomas Keneally won a Booker Prize for 'Schindler's Ark', but it took Spielberg to tell the story of shady Nazi industrialist Schindler who saved hundreds of Jews from the death camps to a worldwide audience.
It was very much a personal project for Spielberg. After the success of Jurassic Park he was able to make any film he wanted, and has said that he didn't expect many people would want to see a Jewish story. However, in Neeson's flawed hero Oskar Schindler, Kingsley's quietly desperate Jewish administrator Itzhak Stern and Fiennes's bloatedly evil concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, Spielberg had a dramatic engine that pulls an audience along through the heartbreaking story of the enslavement and massacre of Poland's Jews. It won buckets of Oscars, but its best tribute is the shocked, tearful silence of audiences everywhere. An outstanding, harrowing piece of cinema.
Verdict A heart-rending and redemptive Holocaust story, this Oscar-grabbing epic added to Spielberg's directorial credibility, showing he could handle controversial, sophisticated stories with real sensitivity.",Null,9,13,31 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Uma Thurman will....Kill Bill
","Uma Thurman is the avenging angel in this long-awaited fourth film from Quentin Tarantino. Intense gory martial arts action Crime boss O'Ren-Ishii (Liu) paces the gallery of the House Of Blue Leaves, watching her subordinates take on The Bride (Thurman), a samurai-sword wielding blonde dressed in a natty, blood-stained yellow tracksuit. As The Bride disembowels and decapitates a dozen yakuza flunkies, pausing only to rip out the eye of one assailant to uncork another plume of blood, one wonders: what does all this mean for feminism? The first volume of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill sees women stalk one another as remorselessly as Sergio Leone's nameless gunfighters. Men hardly get a look in. The face of the titular Bill is concealed from us throughout. In place of machismo, we have a ferocious femininity - the snarl of a mother protecting her child. A different strain of aggression drives this action movie, maternal yet predatory. Tarantino riffs on this with his opening fight where the Bride and Vernita Green (Fox) break off from their knife duel when Green's daughter returns from school. The Bride is after vengeance. After taking a beating at the hands of her former colleagues from the The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, the final bullet to her head is delivered by Bill, who also happens to be father of the unborn child. Waking from a four-year long coma, the Bride clutches at her empty womb and unleashes a feral howl. It is a searing moment from Thurman, who showed up to work on the film only two months after giving birth. What does this mean for feminism? Hard to say, except perhaps that hell hath no fury like a heavily pregnant woman gunned down on her wedding day. A self-conscious interweaving of numerous exploitation genres - in this volume, the influence of Japanese samurai movies and the ultra violence of Takeshi Miike (Ichi The Killer) are particularly strong - unfortunately one also thinks of McG's Charlie's Angels films. Superficially, at least. What with all these kick-ass chicks and Lucy Liu strutting her stuff. In fact, Kill Bill is the anti-Charlie's Angels. It is a deliberate riposte to the cartoon kung fu, lukewarm Matrix leftovers, and shoddy CGI - what Tarantino dismisses as all that 'computer game bullshit' - that Hollywood has been dallying with while the director was away. Where McG's franchise speeds you through its incompetence, Tarantino dawdles to shade in more characterisation, to fill in back story, to embellish every inch of the plot before marking it with a signature flourish. The director of the 90s is back and he might as well have signed the right hand corner of every frame.Unfortunately, he is so brimming with ideas and ambition that his film had to cut in two to meet the needs of distributors. Miramax took this course of action rather than edit their one-time wunderkind. An unsympathetic studio might have trimmed the extended anime sequence about O'Ren-Ishii's troubled childhood, for example, although this is an intense treat depicting events almost too agonizing and heartbreaking to witness in live action.Kill Bill arrives at a moment in mainstream movies - between the second and third Matrix films, before the final part of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, ahead of another bloated Harry Potter installment - where Hollywood is willing to test the bladder strength and patience of its audience like never before. Whether it is the fashion for director's cuts or DVD deleted scenes, it is a contemporary truism that art is best served if the excised portions are restored. With this spirit in mind, the dividing of Tarantino's epic into two volumes may be seen as a victory for integrity. However, cynics may suggest that numerous installments mean punters shelling out more times for the same film, both in the cinemas and again for the various extended DVD editions. Whichever way you want to slice it, this is only half a film. Though it contains many pleasures - and it's great to see such an influential director returning with such a stylistically exuberant work - it is missing the classic satisfying element of any story: an ending. Verdict A blood-stained love letter to exploitation movies that seems to be missing a few pages.",Null,45,93,13 September 2004
A Clockwork Orange," genius
","Famous for the controversy surrounding copycat violence and Kubrick's decision to withdraw it in 1973, A Clockwork Orange can now be judged for what it is: an intelligent, visually stunning, disturbing and yet queasily entertaining adaptation of what was already a great work of literatureAdapted from Anthony Burgess's slim best-selling novel written in the invented street slang Nadsat, A Clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex (McDowell) and his thug friends, addicted to mindless acts of violence, killing tramps and raping women. Equally violent is the state's aversion therapy Alex is forced to endure to cure him of his addiction.Director Kubrick's decision to withdraw the film could be seen, cynically, as the ultimate marketing tool (after all, what film has been so notorious for so long?) but, more realistically, as a significant gesture in the annals of cinema history. The debate about whether he was the victim or instigator of the worst kind of knee jerk censorship, or even merely an artist exercising his right to choose who sees his work will run and run - not least because of Kubrick's stony silence on the issue. The balletic violence is choreographed with an unsettling slickness, coming as a sharp jab to the kidneys. It is difficult to watch and impossible to tear your eyes from. And the film has far more to offer than violent sensationalism.Set in a future Britain, decrepit and reactionary, it cuts close to the bone when it comes to Englishness. Alex is the aesthetic hooligan, a sci-fi Mod, a Regency dandy who stalks the Thamesmead housing estate before going home to the grotesque working class kitsch of his parents. Also the script's use of Burgess's Nadsat is dazzling - and funny: 'Well, well, well! Well if it isn't fat stinking billy goat Billy Boy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if ya have any yarble, ya eunuch jelly thou!'The film is stacked with superb performances from younger, hairier versions of talents that went on to become stalwarts of the British acting aristocracy. There's a sideburned Steven Berkoff, as a deranged and screaming police officer, a baby-faced Warren Clark, chilling yet cherubic as the sadistic Dim, and of course the unforgettable tour de force from Malcolm McDowell as Beethoven's most horrorshow admirer, Alex. Directed with assurance and filled with the cynicism, paranoia, visual flair (and lurid titillation) that characterized so much of his work, this is vintage Kubrick and classic cinema.",Null,0,1,31 August 2004

Jaws," scary stuff
","It left a generation of schoolkids afraid to go into a swimming pool, let alone back into the water. Wunderkind Spielberg's story is all the scarier for hardly ever showing the Great White that is most of the characters' nemesis Spielberg was still in his twenties when he signed up to direct the shark movie that would transform his career - and Hollywood itself. The production was notoriously chaotic yet, with the help of a major marketing campaign, Jaws became the biggest box office success ever, until the release of Star Wars the next year. The cast is top-notch. Scheider is police chief Brody, a hydrophobe taking up his new posting on Amity Island off America's East Coast. His buddies in battling the killer fish are rich-kid ichthyologist Hooper (Dreyfuss) and maverick fisherman Quint (Shaw). The film has political undertones - it is marked by a post-Watergate distrust of authority - but also owes a debt in its theme of self and mutual reliance to those twin classic 50s westerns of contrasting political colours: High Noon and Rio Bravo.
John William's great and justly revered score is instantly evocative of the film and its power to terrify, and there are several stand-out shock moments and wonderfully sustained suspense scenes. But the film's real master stroke - keeping the monster unseen for as long as possible - was, ironically, forced on the production by the refusal of the various mechanical sharks to function on demand.",Null,11,22,31 August 2004
Casino," suberbly crafted
","Superbly crafted often sickeningly violent mafia must-see. Directed by Scorsese, starring De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone in a stand out performance The true story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro), a shrewd, Mafia-connected casino operator, whose assured, mannered existence is undone by his devotion to his flighty wife, Ginger and his boyhood friend Nicky (Pesci), a wild card who fancies his chances on Ace's patch. De Niro and Pesci narrate the extended opening, detailing the mechanics of skimming money from the casino to pass onto the bosses back home. This sequence ends with the glorious introduction of Sharon Stone's showgirl hustler Ginger, all fur, jewels and blonde ambition, who casts gambling chips into the air. On a security monitor, De Niro watches her exuberant transgression, and falls in love. So begins his downfall, and the end of Mob rule in Vegas. Where Goodfellas explored the allure of being a Brooklyn wise guy, with a hair-trigger comic sensibility, Casino emphasises the remorseless fear and grind of a mobster's life, all its attraction purged in two horrifically violent set-pieces. One, a torture scene with a vice, has been rightly condemned as gratuitous - but it is the closing beating that truly disturbs, two men brutally disfigured by repeated whacks with metallic bats that, as they are tipped into the grave, their featureless faces frozen in a contorted howl, it's almost as if a new species has emerged from the violence, only to be suddenly, cruelly, aborted. There is no romanticism in this view of the mafia. Scorsese making a gangster film with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro raised no eyebrows, and led some critics to accuse him of hitting a rut. All the same, with its ferocity and maturity, particularly in the responsibilities weighing upon the wise guys, Casino can be seen a closing chapter in the evolution of a gangster community, from its street heyday in Mean Streets to its adjustment to the new drug trade in Goodfellas to its final giving way to the power of the corporations in the Eighties.

Goodfellas," contender for best gangster movie ever
","*WARNING* REVIEW CONTAINS ONE CASE OF BAD LANGUAGE *WARNING*'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster,' says Henry Hill, who opens his true story of 30 years in the mob in Scorsese's epic There has never been an adequate explanation as to why this superb gangster epic didn't win 1990's Best Picture Academy Award.

The tale of 30 years of life in the Mob, as seen through the eyes of real-life gangster Henry Hill (Liotta), was based on Nicolas Pileggi's gripping book (which he and Martin Scorsese adapted for the screen) and directed with skill by Scorsese. There are so many things about this movie that are great - the casting of De Niro as Hill's mentor and Pesci (who won an Oscar) as the psychotic Tommy, that infamous tracking shot as Henry and his date (Bracco) walk into the Copacabana restaurant, the soundtrack featuring everything from Tony Bennett to The Who - it's no real surprise that the movie regularly appears on critics' Top Ten lists.

Shark Tale," Appealing, funny, but ultimately unrewarding
","DreamWorks rolls out big-hitting voice overs - Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Renée Zellweger and more - for this CGI underwater romp about what happens when a shy shark crosses paths with an ambitious fishSince Disney and DreamWorks raised the bar by putting CGI and knowing humour into their films in the 1990s (with hits such as Toy Story and Antz), animated movies have changed. Romance and songs are still important, but positive responses from grown-ups are also elicited. References are slotted into scripts that only adults will understand, nods given to other movies and celebrity voice overs heartily encouraged. These are the things that will get adults trooping into the multiplex - naturally, with their children in tow. DreamWorks' Shark Tale works this style very well. Considered by some the company's comeback to Disney's Finding Nemo, its cast list is much more top-drawer, with each character's features matching the actor giving them their voice. De Niro's shark has a mole and a drooping mouth, Zellweger's angel fish the same quirky smile, Scorsese's puffa fish the director's wild eyebrows. And then come the references to other movies. The Great Whites are an underwater Mafia family, puffing on cigars and hosting elaborate funerals like The Godfather's Corleones (scripting in Joe Pesci's 'Am I a clown to you?' speech from GoodFellas beefs up these credentials). The ocean is a capitalist haven - apart from one public spirited poster for Tuna History Month - full of chain stores like Gup and billboards for Coral-Cola. One shark sings the Jaws theme tune to make himself scarier - while another camply comes out of the closet as a vegetarian. However funny these references are, Shark Tale prides style over substance. Its plot suffers as a result, swooping clumsily between its two major characters, Lenny (Black) and Oscar (Smith). Lenny is an effeminate shark whose father Don Lino (De Niro) wants to toughen him up (unlike the similarly single father in Finding Nemo, who is fiercely protective of his charge). Lino wants Lenny and his brother Frankie (Imperioli, from 'The Sopranos') to take over the family business; Oscar (Smith) is a fish who works in a whale wash and wants to be 'at the top of the reef where the somebody's live'. Their paths cross when Frankie is training Lenny in the dark arts of machismo. Frankie tragically dies, and Oscar, from then on, is mistakenly thought to be a shark slayer. Leaving his best friend Angie (Zellweger) down at the ocean floor, still desperately in love with him, Oscar joins forces with Lenny and the corrupt Sykes (Scorsese) to nurture his fame. A money-digging lion fish Lola (Jolie) latches onto him, a Jessica Rabbit with fins. Despite the fame and the accolades, of course, things soon fall apart for our shark slaying friend, and our hero learns the error of his ways.The morals here are basic enough - don't cheat your way to the top; don't go looking elsewhere for what you can find at home; be proud of who you are. Nevertheless, this morality is only engaging when applied to Lenny, a truly adorable character - voiced well by Black - who carries the film. Smith's Oscar, on the other hand, is intensely annoying, and you cringe at his energetic outbursts. He's especially embarrassing when bantering with the West Indian jellyfish, whose heads are turned into tams. Characters' attitudes also change completely as the film comes to a close; De Niro becomes sympathetic and Smith becomes lovelorn. The storyline is secondary to the bells and the whistles, which is Shark Tale's ultimate flaw.Verdict The special effects may be appealing, and the script often funny, but this tale is clumsy and clunky, and ultimately unsatisfying.",Null,1,2,18 October 2004
Jurassic Park," entertaining
","Steven Spielberg blazes the trail of investing movies with legions of CGI beasties in this breakthrough special effects movie. Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern visit the island theme-park of Richard Attenborough, who has been breeding dinosaurs The astounding commercial success of Spielberg's theme-park movie proved once again the power of marketing and awesome special effects to overcome a thin story line and feeble characterisation. Another surprising aspect of the response was that the film seemed not to depend on a decent-sized cinema screen but proved effective when reduced to little brother telly. A definite tribute to the director's manipulative skill in dotting the overlong proceedings with enough shocks, scary moments and sentimentality to take up the slack. Amid the special effects showcasing and chases, Jurassic Park exhibits the perennial concerns of Michael Crichton - who wrote the source novel. Said concern is man abusing scientific knowledge and playing God. The culprit here is Attenborough's John Hammond, an entrepreneur who has used dinosaur DNA taken from blood-sucking mosquitoes that have been preserved in amber to re-create the prehistoric dinosaurs, with the intention of opening the ultimate theme-park cum nature reserve. To prove that all is well with his proposed park, Hammond is forced to call in three 'experts': paleontologist Dr Alan Grant (Neill), his girlfriend paleo-botanist Dr Ellie Sattler (Dern), and chaos theoretician Dr Ian Malcolm (Goldblum). Oh, and sadly some kids are along for the ride too - they are the target audience after all, both for Hammond and for Spielberg. After the initial splendour of viewing a brontosaurus chomping on a tree-top and the thrill of cuddling a sickly tricerotops, things inevitably go sour and the predators make their presence felt. T-Rex reestablishes his reign, this time as king of movie monsters (a kind of bipedal Jaws), while the smaller velociraptors prove their viciousness by hunting and chowing down on various cast members. Much of the film consists of being chased by dinosaurs and trying to survive. It's a simple formula, but crudely effective.
Attenborough is preposterously bad as Hammond, with an accent as wobbly as his scientific and moral judgement; the performance is only redeemed by his twinkly eyes. The rest of the cast are adequate, but hobbled by under-developed characters. Possibly the rather characterless leads work to the movie's advantage, since no one going to see a dazzling special effects movie needs distracting by a tame scientist's view of very untamed monsters. Not surprisingly, the sound and the computer-generated visuals received Oscars.",Null,2,4,31 August 2004
