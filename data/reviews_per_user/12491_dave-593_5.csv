Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THE PHANTOM MOVIE
","Forty minutes into 'Stars Wars: Episode 1--The Phantom Menace' one character, eyeing the impending storm announces: 'it's very bad.'  True to form the storm along with the rest of the movie appears to live up to this apt description as well.  Bland, derivative, and sophomoric 'The Phantom Menace' is strictly a by-the-numbers movie conceived by focus groups and corporate executives--a deadly combination that probably robbed the film of its life force and a singular, coherent vision.  Trying to be all things to all people the latest installment of the 'Star Wars' saga is indeed a bloodless creation totally devoid of heart and soul.  The Force must have taken a wrong turn, landed in Toysarus and applied for permanent residency.  Someone should remind  Mr. Lucas that a movie and a movie-tie-in are not the same thing at all.  It is therefore unsurprising that 'The Phantom Menace' is long on special effects and short on wit and imagination.  It is so attuned to the millennium angst that it seems to be manufactured more by computers than man.  It is as if the entire human population has been effectively shut out of the filmmaking process.  Computers 1.  Man 0.  Phantom menace rules.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," SHAKESPEARE COMES OF AGE
","'Shakespeare in Love' is ostensibly made for the MTV generation.  Plodding and cloying, this shaggy dog comedy panders to the quasi middlebrow audience: it goes out of its way to reward those who are able to identify anything that resembles an Elizabethan in-joke.  Call it a self-esteem booster or plain I- know-something-you-don't-because-I-took-English-Lit-101. Whatever the case, the film readily sacrifices wit for farce, and assumes an ill-fitting disposition that calls for tentative and clumsy attempts at bowdlerizing Shakespeare for the common age.  It is little wonder that Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare like an irascible buffoon--a device that will firmly keep him in the Hall of Fame alongside Porky and the entire cast of Animal House.",Null,0,1,1 October 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Seeing is Believing
","Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' will certainly disappoint anyone who tries to measure up to the hype surrounding the film's sexuality and its real life married stars.  The film is not especially erotic for good reasons: Kubrick was perhaps battling his own private obsessions and prefers to explore the emotional bonds that unite couples and the deception they sometimes go at great length to mask their own insecurities, fears and shortcomings.Nicole Kidman's nakedly, ferocious performance is aptly counterbalanced by Tom Cruise's tormented and doubtful everyman wrestling with his seven year itch.  Her monologue recounting a near love affair is arguably the film's highpoint.  Still the  paying public will expect more shedding of clothes from these headliners than they have been led to believe--courtesy of the press no less.  While Kubrick's masterful handling of nudity is nowhere as shocking as Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts' (remember Julianne Moore?), it is nonetheless effective in evoking the decaying and sick environment populated by his characters (especially the use of yellows and burnished tones).  For the film to really work it is best to accept some of its contrivances such as the use of coincidences to advance the plot or cliches involving prostitutes with hearts of gold and eschew naturalism and logic for something surreal and nightmarish.'Eyes Wide Shut' unfortunately is Kafka played straight without the sensual or perverse sensibilities of Bunuel to help propel this somewhat dated and overworked genre into another level.  Whatever its faults 'Eyes Wide Shut' will perhaps be remembered best as one of Kubrick's most humane and moral work--minus the plethora of icy cold characters of years' past.",Null,0,0,31 August 1999

Jackie Brown," Santa's Got a Brand New Bag and it's Empty
","In the fall of 1994 'Pulp Fiction' became an overnight sensation. Critics all over hailed it as an American masterpiece--an instant classic that generated so much excitement that it immediately spawned a generation of Tarantinos and Tarantinites in its wake.  In order to understand this phenomenon we need to turn our attention to the current state of the American cinema and compared it with the last three decades.  In the seventies the American cinema enjoyed what is arguably its golden years when it produced such masterpieces as 'McCabe & Mrs Miller', 'The Godfather', 'Badlands', 'Chinatown', 'The Godfather II', 'The Conversation', 'Taxi Driver', 'Nashville', and 'Manhattan'.  In the eighties the number of masterpieces dwindled to just three films.  Apart from 'Raging Bull' the best films were also the most underrated: 'Cutter's Way' and 'Dangerous Liaisons'.  In the nineties the American cinema declined so precipitously that the closest thing to a masterpiece, if any, was arguably Robert Altman's 'The Player'. So when 'Pulp Fiction' opened it was not difficult to see why the public readily embraced it as a masterpiece. It was as if the American pride was at stake and that Tarantino was perhaps the man who could restore the  public's faith in the cinema again.  Does Tarantino really deserved this kind of attention?  Maybe.  But is he a major talent?  I think not.  Tarantino's talent is somewhat suspect when one considers just how much of his own 'Reservoir Dogs' resembles Ringo Lam's 'City on Fire'.  Was this homage or just plain theft?  In 'Pulp Fiction' the main characters end up pointing their pistols at each other in close proximity. This classic gun-toting mexican standoff was of course gleefully appropriated from John Woo--another favorite of the director's.In 'Jackie Brown' Tarantino, this time, turns his attention on Pam Grier and the black exploitation cinema of the seventies.  But the end result of what he hopes is hip and soulful feels more like a white man's attempt to ape the moves and rhythms of someone black. Soul train on film it is not.  'Jackie Brown' is rhythmless, sluggish, and shapeless.  It is evident that he needs a more disciplined editor to trim the excess fat.It is not that Tarantino is without talent.  He certainly has a good ear for street gutter and writes dialogue that is appropriately foul, abrasive, and wickedly funny.  But Tarantino's fondness for the lowlives, the B movies that he grew up on, is pure pulp not art no matter how good his craft is. His ludicrous screenplay for 'From Dusk to Dawn' clearly suggests that what he truly loves is trash--which is enough to make one wonder if there is more to 'Pulp Fiction' than all the clever chatter about redemption and the like. To put it another way, Tarantino is less than the artist he purports to be: he is a shrewd trickster, a consummate showman who is only too eager to dazzle us with his bag of tricks.  Consider the scene in which the bag of money is switched in 'Jackie Brown'.  Tarantino offers us three different viewpoints of this sequence but adds nothing significant to what we already know.  It is an editing 'trick' he had learned so well in 'Pulp Fiction'. But when the smoke clears it is unlikely that anyone will be gullible enough to believe that the LAPD would not arrive early to prepare their sting operation.  It is the audience who will be left holding the bag.  There is no doubt that when  a man of Tarantino's talent decides to aim this low you can bet that he will surely hit his mark.",Null,0,0,20 October 1999
