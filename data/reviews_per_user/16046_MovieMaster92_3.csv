The Longest Yard," Worst Remake Ever
","If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time with it. It was absolutely nothing like the original movie. Sure, there were some comedic sections in it, but because of the lack of dramatic elements, the death of Chris Rock's character was unbearable and came out of nowhere. Not to mention Courtney Cox's character was an absolute bitch, and the part with the transvestite cheerleaders was flat-out wrong. If any remake was about the worst thing to hit theaters, it was this one, not to mention I was not impressed with Sandler at all.In short, don't see this movie. If you have, and you loved it, go rent the original, and you'll see what I'm talking about.",1,2,5,25 June 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A Well-Rounded Performance by Everyone
","When I first heard of 'Little Miss Sunshine', I thought it was an interesting idea for a movie. Its concept was new, fresh, and had never been done before. But it wasn't the endearing story that I was really impressed with. What I was really impressed by was the performance by each of the talented actors.'Little Miss Sunshine' carries a cast of pretty colorful characters, including Alan Arkin as a sex-obsessed heroin addict for a grandfather, and Steve Carell as a a homosexual man, who, after losing the man he loves, as well as his title as #1 scholar in America, attempts suicide. The cast also includes Paul Dano as a disturbed teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal to be an Air Force pilot, Greg Kinnear as a motivational speaker for his '9 Steps to Becoming a Winner', Toni Collette as a mom who tries to be optimistic even when she knows things are falling apart, and, of course, we can't forget about Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, an excited 7 year-old who is determined to win the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA. These were very different roles for all of the actors, and showed their incredible range of talent. This especially goes for Steve Carell, who spends most of his time being the boss of 'The Office', where it doesn't require a whole lot of acting. Abigail Breslin definitely applies here, too. She's definitely not that little girl from 'Raising Helen' anymore, and her Academy Award nomination was well deserved.'Little Miss Sunshine' won the 2007 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and Alan Arkin received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It has received 28 more wins and 34 more nominations for various awards. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a treat and I would recommend it for anyone over the age of 13.",8,1,3,10 March 2007
