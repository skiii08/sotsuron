Your Name.," full of grace
","This is a very delicate, gracefull way of movie making. it is full of nuances, human feelings, recognition of loss, recovery of interaction etc.i dont think it can be remade. i dont think the director of spider man can understand it and live in a world of heart of glass. all he could remake would be colossal, rude, krass mcdonals hamburger.i am really said to learn copyright owners sold its rights to the US.",9,13,14,12 January 2020
Marriage Story," Scarlett Johanson was a mistake
","I liked the movie. I had seen the squid and the whale when it first came out and i think that Noah Baumbach revisits paralell stories.However, I give it a 6 stars because watching Scarlett Johansson was a torture. She does not fit into the movie. She is not acting naturally - she never does. But one can tolerate her when she is the bimbo in a Hollywood action movie. Yet, in the occasions when we expect real acting, she is like this 'vulgar, rude, grotesque' giant in the film, that disturbs you all the time somehow. She does not flow with the scenario, she cant develop a character, she cant show emotions.. She is always in the 'look at me i am acting, i am doing you a favor, because i allow you to watch me, i am so great' mood.I wish Greta Gerwig was in the movie. She is a delight to watch.Better casting next time Noah.",6,1,5,16 December 2019
