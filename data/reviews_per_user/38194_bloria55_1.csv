Mission: Impossible III," Not in the M:I spirit
","I want to start off by saying M:i-III is a good movie. It has all the fundamental elements of an action movie (hateable villain, worldly threat, natural hero). Also, the casting was well-picked, and none of the acting took away from the film. With that said, the main problem I have with this sequel is that it is not in the Mission Impossible spirit. Its focus is entirely on Ethan Hunt's relationship with his girlfriend, and not on the mission as in the past movies in the series. Also, the plot lacks involvement in Davian's actual plans for the 'Rabbit's Foot'. Ethan Hunt's character is retired, which accounts for his obvious lack of skill he had in the first 2 M:Is, but it does get tiresome after a while. Ethan Hunt was once always in control of his surroundings, and is not in control in any situation in this movie. My main point is illustrated by saying that when the end credits come up on the screen and the classic M:I theme starts to play, it just does not seem to fit. This movie is successful on its own, despite the bland cinematography by the relatively new director, but I do not think it belongs as a sequel to Mission:Impossible or M:i-2. I do recommend seeing M:i-III, but do not expect a continuation of the past 2 themes.",7,0,2,5 May 2006
