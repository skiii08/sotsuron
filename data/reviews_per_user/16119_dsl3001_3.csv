Antz," great dreamworks film though not quite up to SHREK or SHREK 2
",This is a great dreamworks movie though I didn't like it as much as the SHREK films. IF you want to know why it is because it didn't have as much of a good story. After all the SHREK films were great wonderful story's and so was this one its just that it wasn't as delightful as SHREK 1 and SHREK 2. MY favorite character in this movie was probably Z. After all he is very funny and he talks a lot he really can't get his mouth shut a lot of times. Here is a list of all the dreamworks movies I liked more than this: CHICKEN RUN I already said I liked both SHREK films more I like Wallace and Gromit more and finally I liked OVER THE HEDGE more. Here is the movies I liked as much: THE PRINCE OF Egypt THE ROAD TO EL DARODO Joseph KING OF DREAMS MADAGASCAR. And here are the movies I liked less: SPIRIT STALLION OF THE CIMMARON SINBAD THE CAT IN THE HAT SHARK TALE and Flushed Away. You should watch ANTZ sometime you will definitely like it. Though I assure you that you will like SHREK more.,8,0,1,9 February 2007
Cars," another great Pixar
",When I first saw this movie I didn't know if I would like it or not. It's just that it didn't get really good reviews but I disagreed this is another great movie from pixar. It's about a HOTSHOT rookie race car who first just cares about winning and getting awards. But he accidentally takes a wrong and goes down route 66 then he accidentally drives into the long lost town of Radiator Springs. Then he learns that there's more to life than winning and awards. That is pretty much the main plot of it. We will be seeing RATATOILLE soon and if there was another pixar after that I would think they would need to make more sequels of other Pixars besides Toy Story. Like I said it's another great movie from Pixar if you get a chance to watch it don't miss it.,9,0,0,3 June 2007
Jaws," Spielberg's best film
",JAWS is the most excellent Spielberg film. It is in fact Spielberg's best film. for six reasons it is. I'll tell what they are. 1. It's more exciting than all of them. 2.It's more advanced than any of them. 3.better characters in it. 4.better storyline 5.It captures more peoples imaginations 6.It has a better and more exciting storyline than his other films. Those are the six reasons why I think this is Spielberg's best film. when I was younger My parents thought RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was the best. well they are so totally wrong! Besides they should like this movie and LAST CRUISADE more. But any way that does not mean that I hate his other films. I mean I like CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND THE INDIANA JONES movies and the JURASSIC PARK films but they don't seem to be more good this really is Spielberg's best film.,10,1,4,21 March 2007
