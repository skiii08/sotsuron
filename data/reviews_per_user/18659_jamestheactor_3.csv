Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A departure from the previous films, but still an adventurous, yet emotional adventure.
","It's a departure from the previous adventures. I had a feeling that Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly) would not be returning after the events of the third film, but it wouldn't be the same without Johnny Depp! The scene in the courtroom with Jack impersonating the judge is very amusing and I was surprised to see that Barbossa is now a Privateer. The following chase through London after is entertaining, but I would've preferred it if Jack and Mr. Gibbs had escaped. In that disguise, Angelica looked just like Jack! The way Jack confronts her never fails in its humour and the search for the Fountain Of Youth gets started really well. The ritual of the Fountain was not what I thought it would be: I originally thought that whoever drinks from the Fountain would gain eternal youth, but in actual fact two people drink from two chalices with one containing the tear of a mermaid. The drinker of the other chalices dies and 'donates' their remaining years to the other drinker.The effects are impressive and it got rather tense aboard Blackbeard's ship. During the mutiny scene, I agreed with Philip as he made his stand. Sam Claflin plays him convincingly and strongly. I'm also a Christian, though I've never thought anything linked to missionary. Blackbeard certainly had an evil presence. Ian McShane plays him well and his scenes with Jack are tense, but not without humour. The mermaid attack at Whitecap Bay is also tense, but Jack brings humour to the scene again when he falls off the tower. I was concerned for the mermaid Syrena from the moment I saw the front cover of the film. Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey plays her wonderfully and on the DVD front cover, she is holding onto Philip as if to say, 'Keep me safe.' I was pleased that Philip protected her as Blackbeard's crew journeyed to the Fountain. During that time, Syrena saw that Philip was not like Blackbeard's crew. Jack's meeting with Barbossa on Ponce de León's ship is also fun to watch - they try to keep the balanced ship stable as they discover that the Spanish have taken the chalices. Jack stealing the chalices is also a great scene and Barbossa's story of losing the Black Pearl is interesting as I was wondering what had happened to it.I felt so sorry for Syrena when she was tied up and Philip apparently killed in front of her when Blackbeard saw that they had feelings for each other. It was like a knife through my heart. I thought Philip had been killed, but I was VERY relieved when it turns out that Philip is alive. His attempt to rescue Syrena is so moving, but I was annoyed when the Blackbeard's crew suddenly appeared, tied Syrena up again and forced Philip to go with them. The remainder the journey to the Fountain is inspiring, as are the effects, but I couldn't stop thinking about poor Syrena. The Fountain of Youth is certainly a sight that's not easily forgotten, and the confrontation between Barbossa and Blackbeard is entertaining. I was surprised when the Spanish arrived to destroy the Fountain and the climatic battle is fun to watch. I was relieved when Philip saved Syrena. I would've done the same but I was still unsure about how she felt about Philip. Blackbeard gets what's coming to him. I should've known Jack would switch the chalices so that Anjelica would end up drinking from the chalice containing Syrena's tear! I've always found it tense when someone loving someone, but not knowing the outcome. Philip is injured during the battle, after freeing Syrena, he applies water to himself and Syrena appears before him in the water. It's a very sweet moment. Philip asks for her forgiveness, but I think Syrena had already forgiven him. She forgave him a long time ago. You can tell by the way she looks at Philip. She loves him and wants to give him the power to breathe underwater. Now THAT is a gift! Serena kisses Philip and takes him underwater. Philip and Serena together at last.It seems that Blackbeard's evil has rubbed off on Anjelica as she states her hatred of Jack as he maroons her on island with a pistol containing one shot. However, that shot is quickly used as an attempt to kill Jack, which fails. I had a feeling Barbossa was going to return to piracy as he claimed Queen Anne's Revenge but the scene is still entertaining. Jack's meeting with Mr. Gibbs on a beach and his charm on explaining how he prefers to not know what moment will be his last never fails. I hope the Black Pearl gets restored to its original size.",8,0,1,27 April 2016
Avatar," One of my MOST AMAZING, INCREDIBLE and POWERFUL adventures!
","I've seen some of James Cameron's movies. Titanic is powerful, AND SO IS AVATAR! I can't really call it a film. It's beyond that - IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ADVENTURE! I was more than interested when I saw the trailer, and after reading the plot outline on IMDb, I HAD to see it! At first, I was interested with the opening sequence and the mining operation on Pandora in the year 2154. The Na'vi had my eyes fixed on them throughout the entire adventure! I want to join them and I offer my love to them! In fact, blue is my favourite colour! Everyone involved with making this masterpiece did exceptionally brilliantly! I walked out of the cinema filled with excitement! When Jake explains how, when you're dreaming, sooner or later you have to wake up, I was thinking the same. I agree with this, but not if the dream isn't a dream, but reality. If I had to choose between following orders and protecting the Na'vi, I would choose to protect the Na'vi. I shared Jake's experience of not wanting to go back to Earth after seeing how amazing Pandora was, hearing words like, 'You have a strong heart,' and 'One life ends, another begins,' becoming one of the people – and falling in love. I have a strong and loving heart, and I learn things quickly. Love is a powerful sweetener to an incredible adventure.I enjoyed the scenes where Neytiri shows Jake how to fly the Ikran. I would say, 'Yah!' with excitement before taking flight. My FAVOURITE scene is when Jake is initiated into the Omaticaya, and he and Neytiri choose each other. I LOVE the dialogue in that scene, and the romance is amazing! I would choose Peyral because she is a good hunter. (Who am I to choose someone who has already chosen?) I'm a good dancer and would use my moves and skills whilst learning to become one of the people. I also enjoyed the battle scenes, and I could feel the emotional outcome when Hometree was destroyed, (I was saddened by that) but to be honest, there were times during the adventure when I thought it would end, but I'm glad it didn't. (I know that James Cameron has confirmed the possibility of two sequels.) I LOVE the scenes where Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other clans to repel the humans. The final battle is very entertaining and the effects are incredible! I enjoyed every moment of it and felt as if I was in it and fighting alongside the Na'vi. I also felt a wave of relief and some pleasure when Neytiri killed Quaritch and saved Jake. I feel this way when good triumphs over evil. I remembered Titanic and was hoping that Jake would survive - and I was SO pleased when Neytiri saved him. That's another scene I TOTALLY LOVE - with the attack repelled, Neytiri and Jake reaffirm their love as she sees Jake in his human body for the first time. It's so beautiful! Love's complicated!As I watched the remaining corporate personnel being expelled from Pandora, while, Jake, Norm and other scientists were allowed to remain, it reminded me of a play I performed in in 2006. I'm VERY happy at the end when the clan performs the ritual that permanently transfers Jake from his human body into his Na'vi avatar. At some points in the adventure, I was actually hoping that would happen. I'm VERY pleased that it did! The ending's not bad at all, but I reckon that after Jake was transferred into his Na'vi avatar, Jake stood up, Neytiri smiled at him and they kissed. The people would then cheer!The experience is incredible and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for any sense of adventure! The words, 'I see you' are powerful and effective and if I were transferred into a Na'vi avatar. (I would LOVE to actually!) those would be the first words I would say. The song 'I See You' is also powerful and very effective. Thinking about it now, if I were with Jake at the end of the film, as a Na'vi avatar, I would say some of the many words the song involves. Speaking of the music, I noticed at times during the adventure, I heard two of the notes from Titanic's theme.I find that parts of a POWERFUL adventure stay with you after it's over, but this adventure is eternal! After the experiences I went through a few years ago, I'm NEVER going back to how I used to be. Love is my FAVOURITE emotion and it's EVEN STRONGER now that I've seen Avatar. Whenever I saw any stills or clips of Avatar, they struck my heart like love lightning - love SO strong! I have a strong heart and I believe that the power of love, more than just an emotion, but a strong feeling and/or affection, also plays a vital role in facing danger, having no fear, protecting others and standing together as one! Don't feel lost in love. Have the bravery the stand up and let it flow like a river of honey! Become one with the power of love! If your dreams become reality, and you are on Pandora, walking or flying with the Na'vi, you may see me there.Love, James.",9,11,17,22 January 2010
Up," To the skies in a house with thousands of balloons!
","I like an adventurous adventure. I've heard everyone needs someone to look up to - and Carl Fredricksen idolising famous explorer Charles F. Muntz certainly demonstrates this, as does Muntz vowing not to return until he captures an exotic bird at Paradise Falls. Carl befriending a girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan is interesting to watch and I like two would-be explorers sharing their desire of a great adventure together.I was moved by Carl and Ellie's emotional experiences during their years together. They realised their dream of visiting Paradise Falls, but I wasn't expecting Ellie to fall ill and die. Some may think that because elderly people are elderly, they're adventures are over. But that's never a guaranteed fact: I'd seen the posters for Up before I saw the film and when I first saw the thousands of helium balloons lifting Carl's house up to the skies, I was truly amazed. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final merit badge, becomes an accidental stowaway as he frantically pleads to be let in but is denied by Carl at first, which I found hilarious!The house flying through a thunderstorm is tense to watch, but the flying house survives and lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and walking it across the mesa is a good idea. I love the tall, colourful flightless bird known as the mythical 'Snipe', whom Russell names 'Kevin'. The Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak is also great. The pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, are fun to watch. I was taken by surprised that Alpha had a funny voice, which turned out to be broken wire in Alpha's collar. I wasn't expecting Muntz to become the film's villain in his search for a giant bird. I was concerned for 'Kevin' and Carl's house, when Muntz forced Karl to choose between saving it or Kevin. I was relieved Carl saved his house and that he and Russell reached the falls, but I felt for Russell and I was also concerned for Kevin. Carl looking through Ellie's childhood scrapbook is another fantastic moment - looking back at memories can be very powerful and have positive reminders of happy times.When one adventure ends, another adventure begins. Russell going to rescue Kevin lifted my spirits - as did Carl lightening his house to take to the skies once again. The final showdown on Muntz airship is tense, but fun to watch. I was relieved once more when Carl freed Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddling Alpha with his cone of shame and becoming the dogs' new leader made me laugh and proud. Muntz falls to his death and Carl's house descends out of sight through the clouds. Carl could not have said it better, 'It's just a house.'After reuniting Kevin with her chicks, Carl and Russell fly back to the city. Carl presenting Russell with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met is a proud moment. I was very pleased that Carl's house landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie. Towards the end of 2009, I had a feeling that a powerful experience was approaching. And Up certainly played a flying part leading Up to that powerful experience!",9,0,0,17 October 2017
