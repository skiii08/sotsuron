Frost_Nixon," Absolutely Brilliant
","As a teenager in Australia when Nixon resigned, I didn't really understand the impact of his actions at the time. It's only later that I've come to believe in his betrayal not just of American politics but of all democracies that have the same fundamental beliefs.So I went to see this film with some anticipation and was not disappointed. If Ron Howard was not considered a great director before, then surely he must be after this. The greatest problem with filming stage plays is overcoming the sense of 'staticness'. But Howard's superb use of different camera techniques which allow both a sense of movement but do not distract from the stunning acting performances.Whilst Frank Langella is quite rightly getting a lot of attention for his remarkable performance (he manages to humanise Nixon, a feat I would have thought impossible), do not dismiss Michael Sheen's mesmerising effort as David Frost. Both men inhabit their characters, not just play them.The support cast is excellent; Kevin Bacon reminds me of Eastwood at times and they are the best roles Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell have had in a while.A masterpiece.",10,6,10,28 December 2008
Iron Man 2," Too Smug For Its Own Good
","So Iron Man 1 was fun, mainly seeing a serious actor like Downey Jr having a go at comic book action. He was surrounded with quality support and provided a nice, out-of-his-comfort zone performance that made the film a little more than the average comic book effort.Downey Jr is back in this and again supported by a good cast. But this time he's too comfortable in the role and there's no real sense of involvement for the audience. Reminded me a little of the later Roger Moore Bond films.The support cast is fine, but like Downey Jr all pretty much one-note. Rourke has little to do and Rockwell is wasted. The women are a bit better, with Paltrow having a bit more to do and Johansson having fun.I'm sure this will be a success and sure that it will probably generate a third movie; I just hope that the next one is a little more interesting.",6,1,3,13 May 2010
Quantum of Solace," Not Bad, Just Not Bond
","I've been a Bond fan for a long time. I don't mind the occasional 're-interpretations' of Bond and enjoyed Casino Royale (although it did need the 'Bond, James Bond' quote and music at the end to keep me happy).The problem with Quantum of Solace is not that its a bad film. Its actually a quite good thriller, although I could do without Marc Foster's blurring camera-work during the action scenes, that moves along quickly and which looks like an expensive, slick Hollywood movie is expected to.No, my problem with Quantum of Solace is that its like those movie adaptations of popular novels. You know the ones - where the director/writer/producer decide to 'interpret' the novel and so what you end up with is a familiar title, character names and not much else that got you into the cinema in the first place.So, like a lot of people, I'm asking where are the elements that make this a Bond film? Why have the producers almost completely removed the traditional Bond music? Why does the 'gunbarrel' opening now take place right at the end? Why is there virtually no humour? (I don't need Roger Moore, but an occasional one-liner wouldn't hurt). Why is there no Q? (I don't need an invisible car, but one gadget would be nice) Of even more concern is an excessive ugliness of tone in the film. Its only brief, but there is a closeup of a gunshot wound, that seems completely gratuitous, as does the photo of a mutilated head. Likewise the attempted rape scene at the end is not what I expect in Bond.Daniel Craig is a fine Bond and if the writers can have him looking a little less like the victim of a car crash for most of the movie and give him a clever quip now and then, I think he will rank with Brosnan and Connery.Like the dedicated fan I am, I'll go along to the next Bond in a couple of years - but Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, it better be Bond I'm going to see and not some well made clone.",7,2,2,28 November 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Why Isn't This Your Favourite Film?
","There are many things in life that baffle me; the world's ongoing fascination with Paris Hilton, the fact that Will Ferrell is a movie star, the inclusion of synchronised swimming as an Olympic event.And why '2001' is not the favourite movie of everyone who has seen it.Maybe its because it wears the SF label, but there's not a bug-eyed monster or a ray-gun or a noisy space dogfight in sight. Instead, there is mystery and murder, elegance and the everyday.Maybe its because you have to decide what its about. Kubrick doesn't tell you. (Clarke tells you more if you read the book and Hyams tells you a bit in the sequel.) Is it about Nietzsche's idea that man is the missing link between ape and superman/starchild? Is it about God/god being simply a more evolved species than our own? Is it about natural intelligence versus artificial intelligence? (Both the monolith and HAL have power over humans). Is it about natural emotion versus artificial emotion? (Hal has never been evil to me; he is more like one of those super-intelligent kids who go to university at age 12 and can't cope emotionally with their environment. HAL, to my mind a victim of a form of emotional abuse (after all he is a child of only 9), doesn't know how to lie, but does possess a strong survival instinct.) Maybe its because the dialog is all but meaningless. Hardly anything of significance is spoken. It could almost be done as a silent film, but that would rob us of one of the most emotional scenes in cinema history - HAL begging for his rational life. You do have to listen to this film - but its the music that tells us the story; its the silence that tells us the story; its Dave's breathing that tells us the story.Maybe its because you saw it on TV. This is not a TV movie; its not even a home theatre movie. This is a cinema movie. See it on the big screen. Anything less and its power and beauty diminishes dramatically. Feel it first and then think about it. And let its wonder consume you.'2001'. The. Best. Ever.",10,2,7,28 August 2008
