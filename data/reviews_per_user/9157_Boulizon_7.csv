Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A little deception
",When some friends and I first saw Kill Bill volume 1 i was thrilled and overjoyed knowing that the movie was so goooooooddd! Very violent but except the fact that there was blood a lot and it was much less realistic than others movies directed by Q.T the movie was one of my best. Still i went to the theater to watch the second volume and... a big heavy deception. I though i was in a nightmare. Dialogs were strongly constructed by Michael Madsen when Budd declares 'That woman deserves her revenge and... we deserve to die' Many scenes were funny and remarkable but the death of Bill was disappointing and so was the happy ending.,10,2,4,6 September 2004
Training Day," Training Day, great movie,
",Training day was a great movie. It was strong and persuasive. Most of the dialogs had an impact and clearly this movie was built and directed in the flammes of the L.A street gangs. Denzel Washington was at the TOP of his apogee and his role was worth. This kind of movie is the American good movies which aren't too Hollywoodian for the public the camera filmed different angles taken for suspense and intrigue. Though the last scene with the Russian Mafia was a death shooting scene with interesting angles and sound effects. The way the dialogs were filmed had enormous caracteristics of 'well done'. The Movie is highly recommended and suggested to an audience wanting realistic visions on drugs and corruption.,9,0,11,5 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great movie one of the best trilogy ending...
","I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.",10,1,3,7 September 2006
Saw," Saw- the next generation of suspense movie
","SAW... The next generation of suspense, the movie directed by James Wan was successful in the high way of suspense. No need to wonder about WHo the psychotic murderer will kill but now on we watch how the VICTIMS kill each others. The Murderer is a kind of John Doe saw in Seventh and you can be certain that his theory about life and death was taking the audience into a deep reflexion. The angles filmed give the screen suspense so high. It isn't blood and gore and language that freak someone but in which circumstances the chain of events happen and how it's ending. That film is strong and gigantic example of how Freaking movies should be. The Epilogue of the film takes the public to some unpredictable and unseen ending. The music scored a powerful freaking audio in which the suspense is taken. Always the suspense as along as it is correctly taken. In the end when we heard about the recording tape from the Jigsaw killer we can easily freak a little and feel that the 'punishment' of been ungrateful to life is just starting back.We never know about the two main protagonists if they will die or not but we can surely presume that the Jigsaw killer had predicted their deaths.",9,0,1,14 March 2005
Reservoir Dogs," The First masterpiece movie of Q and 'the Best'
","Reservoir Dogs was the best movie I have ever seen. Renegade director Quentin Tarantino has done a masterpiece with this movie. Such films are remarkable just by style: In that film everybody dies.The second aspect of the movie was the background racism against Black which is the personality of many inglorious American republicans bastards.This film was the hitting movie of the Sundance film festival. Even with the language and the multiples gun shot sequences it doesn't change anything about the fact that the 'K-Billy Super Songs' are the best music adaptation and the Intrigue is perfect.The best scenes of the movie are : The Restaurant tipping part, the tortured cop who got his ear cut-off and then the fire revelation and of course the end with the SHOWDOWN AMONG PROS.",10,0,2,24 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," At long last : Episode III is good.
","Finally! Since some years the Star Wars films weren't too great(compare to the oringal trilogy). Nevertheless, everyone were expecting the Clone Wars talked in episode 4. This volume takes audiences into a dark universe where tyranny begins to exterminate courage, love, valor and...light. Strong points:1- General Grievous2- the deaths of the Jedi 3- the great deathway of Mace Windu which is fantastic.4- every lightsaber's combats.5- When Anakin/Darth Vader returns to the Temple.fixing: There should be more scenes with Grievous and we should of seen him killing Jedi knights like in Clone Wars.Weak points:The battle of Kasshyk should of been longer.A missing small appearance of a young Han Solo.A missing Imperial march near the end.However, the movie was excellent. Having some good guys dying was finally seen to the screen. Fortunately, we may consider that this formidable picture gives a redemption for I & II. Now having enough lightsaber battles, deaths, dark side visions, good dialogues make it possible to watch and love. Performances were quiete acceptable. In that movie the king was Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancelor Palaptine/Darth Sidous. The ways he convinced Skywalker to join his side was simply too exhausted giving anger to his character to eradicate the Jedi Order. Even if he's a bad guy Darth Sidious is not hated because his cause was well explained and the Empire forged.Whatever it is you may not have a lot of surprises when watching it because you surely have seen the original trilogy but the way it was directed and especially the scenario worth everything. Revenge of the Sith is not better than Episode five the Empire Strikes back but is not far behind it.",10,2,4,30 August 2005
Sin City," Sin City: A bloody movie but...Very good.
","It was a considerable film. Though the black and white colors were the highest big point from it. Sometimes we see colors but the colors we do see appear to be the red on the women lips and some others but not much.The Narration of Sin City seemed to be a Pulp Fiction but much more violent and based on a Comic Book. Somehow, we have alternate stories from John Hartigan a noble cop, Marv(protagonist)the guy who wants to avenge Goldie, we also have Dwight, it's a three different stories which are clear and soft. The Quentin Tarantino scenes were the best. Though there is a 1$ dollard scene with the razor in the bathroom, the beginning with Hartigan driving his car and going after the son of the senator and then been shot by his partner(Michael Madsen from Reservoir Dogs). The movie was interesting but intensely violent. At least, the comic book 'style' is very formidable and contains a super top great film.",7,0,3,5 April 2005
