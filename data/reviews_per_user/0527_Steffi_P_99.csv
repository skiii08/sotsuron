Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 'Beyond your years'
","The exploitation movie – that branch of cheap and violent movies that includes Spaghetti Westerns, Kung Fu, zombie horrors and many other subgenres – has rarely run to epics. These were bottom-line products, made at low cost for (supposedly) unsophisticated audiences, and usually clocked in around the 80 minutes mark. Grand, overarching themes were rarely explored, and the main goal for the filmmakers was generally a high body count and maybe a bit of sex. With Kill Bill however Quentin Tarantino creates a grand, sweeping homage, the exploitation movie to end all exploitation movies, a two-part meditation on the very nature of revenge and killing.As with its predecessor, Volume 2 is a patchwork of references to Tarantino's favourite pictures. This time round he is, if anything, even more flagrant in his referentialism. The flashback at the start of the picture features some rhythmic cross-cutting between close-ups like one of Sergio Leone's early features (notable exceptions as exploitation epics). Then there's a Kung Fu segment which mimics not only the clichés of Hong Kong cinema but also the style of humour and overused zoom lens. Is it theft? Not really. It's channelling the influences in the way one might reshape Romeo and Juliet or La Dame aux Camelias into some other work.Tarantino doesn't just borrow the motifs and camera-work of his cinematic forebears, he also encourages the eerie, taciturn acting that characterised Leone's pictures. Uma Thurman's range broadens even more here. It's amazing the way she is able to portray Kiddo as a tough fighter while still retaining her sensitivity. David Carradine is at his best here in the title role, a model of seductive evil, credible as both the killer and the kind lover and father.And really these two dual-natured performances characterise something that is fundamental to Kill Bill. It's a movie about killing, and one that does not shy away from the sensationalist violence of the exploitation flick, but it is also a movie with a lot of heart and humanity. With volume 2 it becomes clear why volume 1 began with the business over Vernita Green's daughter. It becomes clear why Bill cancelled the hospital hit on Beatrix at the last minute. This is a movie about love as much as hate. Kill Bill is an emotionally mature and intelligent work, while still having that delightful playfulness and comic book mythology. A sincere and worthy tribute to a tawdry yet beloved part of cinematic history.",10,2,4,7 May 2012
Vertigo," 'That is a matter between him and his own conscience'
","Perhaps the most significant thing about this masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock is that it is the film which broke Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.Hitchcock's films are not known for their visual style. There was always the occasional attention grabbing close-up or freakish angle, but by and large he made his impact through pacing, plotting and expressionist arrangement. Vertigo is the exception  it really is a feast for the eyes. Most important are the colours, a fact which Hitchcock establishes right from the start with the kaleidoscopic opening credit sequence. He shows full mastery of Technicolor, comparable to the films of Michael Powell. Each location has its own colour scheme  neutral light browns for Midge's flat, traffic-light red for Ernie's restaurant, glowing green for the hotel where Judy stays. The green motif  here symbolising rebirth  crops up again and again in relation to Madeleine and Judy. Even the water she attempts to drown herself in has a greenish sheen to it.One thing that characterises Hitchcock's films is that, no matter how complicated the plot is, it is conveyed in a way that the film can be understood in a single viewing. You're never left wondering who some minor character was supposed to be or confused about some character's motivation. Vertigo is no exception, although it is one of the most complex and twisting plots of any Hitchcock picture. He dispenses with his trademark suspense (with the exception of the red-herring opening scene, Scotty is never actually placed in any danger) and plunges into the depths of his psychological streak. It is perhaps also Hitch's only genuine film noir, although it is rarely referenced as such (probably because noirs are typically in black and white). It does however have all the typical noir elements  a femme fatale who leads the hero astray, a kind but plain woman who loves him and, in between the two, an upstanding, well-meaning lead man whose life unravels because of his own faults.Vertigo is also as abstract as Hitchcock's early Fritz Lang-inspired efforts, but here done infused with the more confident later Hitchcock style. There are colour filters, dream-like cinematography (particularly good in the sequoia forest sequence), the famous zooming-in, dollying-out technique and an animated dream sequence. The dazzling imagery could be seen as prefiguring the influence of psychedelia a decade later, although really it is perhaps only the logical extension of the German Expressionist style. It's only really an updated version of the superimposing of images and casting of shadows in films by Fritz Lang and FW Murnau. For this reason Hitchcock could be called one of the truest heirs of the German Expressionist movement, and not just for the psychological angle.It's an amazing accomplishment of both lead actors that they are both essentially playing two different characters each. James Stewart starts off in his comfortable, familiar friendly type that he is used to playing, but by the end of the picture he has transformed into an cruel, obsessive monster. Kim Novak also plays two very different roles as the prim, icy Madeleine and the worldly and down-to-earth Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes gives a great supporting role as Midge.Another thing worth a mention is Bernard Hermann's score. I'm not a big fan of Hermann, but I'd say this is his best score for Hitchcock. He matches the action perfectly. There are several long sections without dialogue, and here the music plays a similar role to a silent film score. In fact the timing of every element in the film is spot on  one example being a wave crashing on the shore in the background when Scotty and Madeleine first kiss.The first time I saw Vertigo I was hooked, right from the opening moments to the final shot. While its power to hold me has diminished somewhat over repeated viewings (a weakness of all Hitchcock films, the flipside to their being instantly enjoyable) it still looks amazing and it can still send shivers down my spine. It's an incredible achievement.",10,7,10,23 November 2006
The Sound of Music," 'My heart will be blessed'
","The 1960s were a time of transition in cinema, when independent producers began to take control from the old studio moguls, neo-realist influences crept into Hollywood, foreign language films became trendy, and for the first time pictures were being made in black-and-white for artistic reasons rather budgetary constraints. And yet the most popular picture of the entire decade was a bright, joyous and epic musical, a product of old-fashioned studio professionalism, crafted for pure entertainment. And there is no shame in this fact, because The Sound of Music is a truly wonderful classic of the screen.Let's start at the beginning (a very good place to start) with the musical from which the movie was adapted. This was certainly the best of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein scores, the culmination of all their works prior to this. It demonstrates, in many instances, what was really exceptional about Richard Rodgers's tunes. His melodies have a subtle beauty which comes at you in ways you wouldn't anticipate. There are those sour blue notes in the title song, the haunting chord progression of 'Edelweiss' through major and minor or, in 'My Favourite Things', the shift from a minor key verse to a major key chorus while barely seeming to change melody at all. Filled with Oscar Hammerstein's deceptively simple yet rhythmically sensitive lyrics, this is music as gorgeous as the hills and mountains that provide the motion picture with its backdrop.The director is the highly versatile and under-appreciated Robert Wise. Wise began his career as a sound editor and he really understood the musical genre. He doesn't give The Sound of Music that very precise, choreographed look of say, a Vincente Minnelli musical or his own earlier picture West Side Story. Instead he has the performers doing very simple 'dances' of realistic movement, for example Julie Andrews speeding up her walk as the song gathers pace for 'I Have Confidence'. He also gently and unobtrusively makes the image match the scope and style of the music, a great example of this being in the opening number. For the slow, broad opening of the song, we have Andrews against the backdrop of the mountains. Then for the busier but quieter section he has her walking among trees, skipping between their trunks like the notes of the song, before having her running out onto the hillside as the music swells up again.Star Julie Andrews, like Irene Dunne and Judy Garland before her, was one of those rare talents who could both sing and act. Of course her role here as an actress is mainly one of childlike earnestness, but the thing is she pulls it off with complete sincerity, never becoming too grating or too pathetic. And of course she is able to carry her acting performance through into the musical numbers, putting her character into every note and dance step. Male lead Christopher Plummer was reportedly not comfortable in his role, but he does an adequate job all the same. Apparently Richard Burton was also considered for the role, and he undoubtedly would have given an excellent performance, but he might have been a little too good, making the captain perhaps a bit too stern and menacing in those early scenes, so I'm glad the role went to the softer and more fatherly Plummer.One criticism that is often raised about The Sound of Music is that its story is rather weak and short on substance. It is true that it lacks the compelling drama of say, My Fair Lady, that it never really builds up any true sense of danger over the Nazi anschluss, and that perhaps it is at times a little overwhelmingly cheerful. And yet the fact is that the weight of this picture is not in its story, but in its music. This is something that is significant about Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals. Think about those lyrics. Most of these songs don't say anything very specific about the story or characters; most of them just play around with a little idea like saying 'goodbye' or going through the notes in a scale. With the exception of 'How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?' these are songs about feelings, not expositions. The songs do not exist to tie the story together, the story exists to present the songs. And these musical moments are powerful enough to send shivers down spines and send hearts soaring.",9,5,14,3 January 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'Passing through history'
","Copying isn't always a bad thing. Copying is what 80s cinema did in a big way – from remakes and spoofs to homage and reference, cinema thrived on recycling the past. Raiders of the Lost Ark borrows the adventuresome plots and exciting action of 1930s serials, classic swashbucklers and the James Bond franchise, while hinting at influences as disparate as Lawrence of Arabia and the Cecil B. DeMille religious extravaganzas. And like all of the great blockbusters of this era, its success comes not only from its derivative nature or its non-stop action, but from the fact that it is simply brilliantly conceived.Raiders of the Lost Ark also works by being somewhat tongue-in-cheek, pre-empting any sneers at the genre's clichés by spoofing them itself. The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan features such self-satirizing lines as 'You can't do this to me, I'm an American!' But this isn't quite like the brilliantly daft 1980 Flash Gordon, for which your sense of irony must be switched to max. Kasdan's script is fully-functioning and wholly professional. Every moment and every line counts. Exposition scenes often dovetail into action ones, so we never have a chance to get bored. The scene where the army intelligence people come to ask Indy about Ravenwood and the staff of Ra serves two purposes. Firstly, it gives the audience the necessary background for the quest ahead without being too presentational. Secondly, the officials' lack of knowledge and sympathy endears us further to Indy, and lets us know that we won't be calling in the cops or the army for this one.Director Steven Spielberg has elaborated on Kasdan's work by fashioning action scenes that are both fun and inventive. Spielberg injects sequences with so many neat little ideas to continually amuse us and stop this from being a no-brainer. Take for example the local man falling onto the front of the truck during the road scene. Spielberg makes the moment both funny and exhilarating by showing us for a split-second the man's surprised face in the windshield. By-and-large the director keeps a rather detached eye, his camera often peeping through a bit of scenery or overlooking the action with a god-shot. It is this approach that gives so much of the picture its distinct, memorable look. Intense moments like Sallah's realisation that the dates are poisoned are composed of a series of attention-grabbing shots with no camera movement, creating a series of iconic images like the frames of a comic book. And this is really what Spielberg is at this stage of his career; a comic book director. But he happens to be a very good one.What really makes Raiders of the Lost Ark such a treasure is its fabulous characters and the way they are presented. The hero Indiana Jones is introduced as an enigma, a mysterious figure in hat. The opening shots reveal him to be a leader at the head of a band, an expert in the field and eventually, a handy man with a whip – and only then do we see his face. Karen Allen's Marion is easily the best of the Indiana Jones heroines, tough and resourceful in her own right, able to be his partner in adventure. And Paul Freeman's Belloq is the ultimate Indiana Jones villain. Smart and sophisticated, his enmity fuelled by rivalry rather than a simple conflict of interests, he's probably the most believable foe Indy has ever come up against. At the other end of the scale there's the sinister thug Toht, played with relish by English TV actor Ronald Lacey. Lacey makes his entrance as the campy and comical Gestapo stereotype, but when he coldly whispers 'Let me show you what I am used to' his tone is utterly menacing and the character becomes genuinely scary. There are so many more perfectly written and played supporting roles – John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Brody – and it's not clear whether the actors were cast to suit the characters or whether the characters were developed around the actors. Most likely a mix of both.Raiders of the Lost Arc is really what all these early blockbusters were – a distillation of all the techniques for making high-quality entertainment. Yes, its ideas are cobbled together from the last five decades of action cinema, not to mention adventure literature and comic books, but it gets away with it. It gets away with it not just because of its knowing and light-hearted take approach, but because of how its makers have learned from the past, completely refining every aspect of the genre to make a modern classic.",9,0,0,22 February 2011
Spartacus," 'An animal can fight, but to sing beautiful things'
","Spartacus is unique among Kubrick films in that he was never meant to direct it, and he had little influence over it once it reached post-production, something which did not suit Kubrick or his style. As such it's a slightly botched, uneven work.Very little of Kubrick's style  which was actually still developing at the time  remains intact. It does often look like a typical studio job with the director being just a cog in the crew. You can still see Kubrick's sense of contrasting high and low with location. Just as he showed complete changes of tone between the trenches and palatial officer's quarters in Paths of Glory (1957), he here compares the ornate, spacious Roman palaces with the dingy, underground gladiator's cells. In fact, the films best moments come in the first hour set at the gladiatorial school.Taking the few known facts about the real historical figures concerned, Dalton Trumbo has woven a good story, particularly with the complex rivalries and loyalties between the Romans. The dialogue however is pretty poor. Kubrick dismissed the script as being too full of stupid morality, and he was right. There are lots of impassioned speeches about dying free, much of which borders on cliché. While it's a welcome change from the piety of the religious epics of the 1950s, this deal with making such a big thing of the hero being perfectly noble and principled can be almost as bad.In spite of the stellar acting line-up, there are only really three acting performances I really like  the trio of English Romans. Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton are both ideally suited to their roles as Crassus and Gracchus respectively. However best of all is my all time favourite actor  Peter Ustinov who, as usual steals the show as the gladiatorial school owner Batiatus. Apparently Ustinov wrote most of his own dialogue, which explains why he gets all the best lines. Or perhaps it's just his deadpan delivery which gives lines like 'Most exciting. I tingle,' such brilliance.The musical score is instantly forgettable. In fact I even forget who composed it. Kubrick does make good use of it though, editing to the beat in two key scenes  when Spartacus and Draba are waiting to fight each other, and in the build up to the final battle  building up tension well.There are quite a few moments of sloppiness in Spartacus. There are plot holes big enough to drive a convenient character arc through. There is a hideous backdrop which makes what was supposed to be quite a warm, poignant scene look silly. I'll also point out rather smugly that, if you watch closely in the scene of the gladiators rebelling at the school, Spartacus actually defeats no less than four fully armed Roman guards using nothing more than a wicker basket. Mind you, it's cinema. You can overlook these things, sit back and enjoy.So, it's no small wonder that after Spartacus Kubrick moved to the UK and ensured he had complete control of all his pictures from thereon. You would never guess that it was the product of one of cinema's most stylised and meticulous directors. When there are moments of brilliance they are rarely a result of directorial style. It's not a bad film  it has just enough good elements to hold it all together. But on the flipside it has far too many bad elements to make it a classic.",8,2,5,6 November 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'I'll be right here'
","One of the big secrets to the blockbuster format of the late 70s and early 80s was that while the movies were primarily aimed at an adult audience, for the most part they were also fine to take your kids along to. It was only a small twist then for that most savvy of blockbuster pioneers Steven Spielberg to create a picture that was made for kids but could also appeal to the grown-ups in the audience. But most of all, like the director's earlier hits, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial works because it is just so well thought out and perfectly pulled off.The opening moments of E.T. are a masterful piece of filmmaking. Spielberg shows us what the aliens are doing without revealing quite what they look like. We see a few silhouettes through the trees, a couple close-ups of hands and feet, even some point-of-view shots, but no clear views. This builds up a feeling of wonder and anticipation. We only get to see exactly what E.T. is like when Elliot encounters him face-to-face, which helps us identify with Elliot's discovery of his new friend. Bizarrely, in the CGI-ed up 2002 re-release Spielberg violates his own earlier genius by including a very clear shot in the opening scene of E.T. running into a clearing as his spaceship departs. This, to my mind, is far worse than the oft-maligned change of cops' guns into walkie-talkies, because it would destroy that sense of curiosity for a first time viewer. Spielberg claimed the re-release is how he would have done it first time round had he had the technology, but I reckon he's mistaken. It seems in his drive to make the creature more realistic he forgot the careful touches that made the picture so vital in the first place.Thankfully, even in the overdone re-release there is enough of the director's original inventiveness shining through. A move like cutting down the line on the ringing telephone seems a bit excessive, until you later see an identical bit of cutting on E.T.'s makeshift equivalent, encouraging us to draw a parallel between the two machines. Spielberg keeps the focus on the younger characters by having some of the less important adult figures (such as the teacher or some of the government scientists) appear only vaguely – hands, backs, but never faces. In contrast, the focus is constantly on the facial expressions of the three children and E.T. A really important moment is the reaction shot of E.T. as he watches Elliot and Michael making threats over Gertie's favourite toy. At that point, the little alien stops being an odd creature and becomes a feeling, empathising character.And then there is so much else to this picture that make it so wonderful. There is its touching story, one of the most heart-warming aspects of which is the way E.T.'s presence brings the family together. There is John Williams' powerful and evocative score that seems so utterly in tune with every image. And the performances of the three young actors, natural and deeply poignant, and even out-acting their on screen mother Dee Wallace. A moment like the release of the frogs and the recreation of a scene from The Quiet Man, inter-cut with the original may be incredibly surreal for a kids picture, but it is a gorgeous tribute to all that is romantic in cinema. The ironic thing is that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is such an intelligent and beautiful production, it moves me more as an adult that it did as a child.",10,0,1,28 February 2011
Casablanca," 'Who's got trouble? We got trouble.'
","For the Allies, 1943 was perhaps the grimmest and most desperate year of the war, as the conflict threatened to grind on into stalemate. Back on the home front, movie production was responding appropriately, cutting back on the flag-waving calls-to-arms, and making pictures that were more about hope, endurance, and getting on with life during a state of war. This is where Casablanca fits in.Everybody knows about Casablanca – even people who think they don't will probably be tacitly aware of its many quotable lines. Why has the picture become such a cultural monument? The reasons are many, but that quotable script is as good a place to start as any. Casablanca is based on a (then un-produced) play by Murray Bennet and Joan Alison, which provided the outline. However it was given its Hollywood makeover by celebrated screen writing twins Julius and Philip Epstein, whose best picture up to this point had probably been The Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney; a witty, rather sentimental and very musical period piece. The Epsteins have brought many similar touches to this picture, especially their approach to music and comedy. Many of the key moments have a musical underpinning; not just the recurring love theme 'As Time Goes By', but the playing of the Marseilles to drown out the Nazis, or the 'Knock on Wood' number which is played in the first scene at Rick's, and very much establishes the atmosphere of the joint. The Epstein brand of humour doesn't rely on a handful of ridiculous and exaggerated characters, as was the usual at this time. Instead, the jokes all arise from normal things that we might laugh at in real life, such as the market trader reducing the price when he realises Ingrid Bergman is 'a special friend of Rick's'. This sort of thing is crucial for Casablanca, because it allows a little touch of humour without robbing the story of its dignity or credibility.Then there is the director Michael Curtiz, a man who has not been deified by the magic wand of the auteur theory, and yet one whom any serious film scholar is forced to pay attention to simply because of the number of important pictures he helmed. Despite this being his best-known picture, he is himself better known for the series of swashbucklers he made with Errol Flynn in the mid-to-late 1930s. It is true that Curtiz's style tended to be very technical, and certainly his most noticeable work has been in the action genre, so as such his having directed Casablanca is seen as being coincidental to its success. Still, his shrewd mechanical mind has added a thing or two to this picture. Take that opening shot of the city, panning down from the mosque tower into the busy street. It's a complex, cluttered shot, but it really gives us a feel for the location and that tense atmosphere, with great touches like those two extras bickering in the foreground. A lot of Curtiz pictures begin with a shot like this – crowd scenes that look completely random and extremely realistic, and yet are full of meaning and rich in detail. Curtiz was also not quite the mean-minded movie-making machine that he is sometimes painted as. He did have a feel for romance and sentiment if it was a picture that relied upon it. Casablanca features quite a few uncomplicated close-ups of characters in emotional intensity, just about the only uncluttered shots you get in a Curtiz movie, and they are incredibly moving.But of course, what would these close-ups be if they weren't of great actors? Casablanca has a flawless cast, but also a very bold one at the time. Humphrey Bogart was only just starting to play leading roles, and even then he was generally an anti-hero. However, Casablanca solidified his screen-persona, a tough individualist on the outside, but a good man at heart, albeit one loathe to reveal it. By showing that there was a human side to his charismatic demeanour, he gave his best performance to that point. Bergman too was just on the cusp of stardom, but she pulls off a role of frailty and tearfulness without getting hysterical, as many a lesser actress would have done. And then there is Claude Rains, one of the few long-established players in the picture. Rains is playing his usual type – perhaps his archetypal role – and it is actually one not unlike Bogart's, with the crucial difference being that Rains revels in his amorality. And yet Rains's art is that he makes this character, who is utterly despicable on paper, likable on screen.On that note, it's tempting to view Bogart and Rains as the two leads – not Bogart and Bergman. It is Bogart and Rains whose story arcs deal with the main theme of Casablanca – whether to strive for individual gain or to fight for the good of the people. And this is after all a movie about people, and hope in the unity of people. There is this feeling of people brought together by their desperate situation, which permeates Rick's and the picture in general, and it's something writers, director and cast have all contributed to. It makes us feel that the struggles of every minor player – Peter Lorre's nervous underground agent, Joy Page's young wife desperate to escape the city, S.Z. Sakall's jovial headwaiter, the sadly-unsung Dooley Wilson – are as important and immediate as those of the lead players. It is perhaps more than anything else this rich humanity that made the picture connect with wartime audiences, and has made it a work of power and resonance ever since.",10,4,5,27 October 2010
Lifeboat," 'That isn't funny, it's logical'
","During the years of World War Two, Hollywood production followed the necessities of morale and propaganda, but tended towards movies that were minimalist and stripped down. Due to the conflict available resources were even lower than the cash-strapped days of the depression, and crews were smaller as many studio employees joined the armed forces. As far as the quality of the pictures produced is concerned, it wasn't always a bad thing. With fewer elements, filmmakers were encouraged towards inventiveness, as well as a more personal focus.In the case of Lifeboat, it lead to the first in a series of pictures directed by Alfred Hitchcock made entirely in one confined set. Four years later he would make one called Rope, which gave the illusion of being shot in one continuous take. As such there was a constant feel of the artificiality of the process as the director's self-imposed limitations forced him to change angle and focus by moving the camera around. Lifeboat is different, not because Hitch didn't have the level of technical expertise yet, but because it has a far more timely and important story, and he could not afford to turn it into some self-indulgent technical exercise.What we actually have is Hitch at his most thoughtful and least extravagant. Rather than drawing our attention to the smallness of the space, he makes the drama revolve entirely around the characters. His shot compositions are mostly designed to show only the actors, not the boat. This isn't just done with close-ups, but many cleverly arranged group shots. In acknowledgement of just how much the human brain can take in at once, he might have one character talking, while several others stand around them, not as bits of scenery but as part of the narrative. A good example is Walter Slezak, whom Hitch will place in some innocuous part of the shot, only to have the actor turn his head at some key moment while someone else is speaking, making us suddenly remember him and wonder if perhaps he is listening. While Hitch generally let actors get on with their own job, I am sure such precisely timed and presented bits of business were at his behest.This is not to say the actors in Lifeboat are mere puppets for the director. Slezak is in fact a brilliant performer, intelligently displaying an air of innocence, with now and then a touch of something deeper. His manner is genuinely ambiguous, which makes it believable for the other characters to be divided in their opinion of him. Tallulah Bankhead seems more or less to be playing herself, or at least the delightfully vibrant persona that she crafted for herself. On dry land she could easily come across as a bit of a fraud, but here in the Lifeboat she personifies the spirit of defiance in the face of it all. From the rest of the cast come solid turns which are distinctive and lively, but never quite going so far as stereotype or overstatement.The end result is not the most conventional piece of wartime propaganda ever. But while not exactly rousing, it is certainly entertaining. And this is what is best about Hitchcock – when he wasn't busy being a technical show-off, he always kept his mind on thrilling and enthralling the audience. A director who plays TO an audience, pandering to a specific set of sensibilities, will make films that will only ever appeal to the tastes of one era. Hitch on the other hand plays WITH the audience, and this has made his pictures stand the test of time.",8,7,7,8 November 2010
Chinatown," 'Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown'
","Only fifteen or so years after the classic film noir cycle had run its course, and not really that long since film theorists began to universally recognise it as a genre, the film noir was back as a subject for stylish nostalgic homage. But Chinatown is no lazy bundle of clichés  it draws together everything that was great about film noir, and was put in the hands of one of the most talented directors and some of the greatest actors of the day.Story-wise this is very much the archetypal film noir, reminiscent of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, Vertigo, Touch of Evil and many others, and with a plot equally as complex and skilfully woven as those classics. You have the political corruption, the cynical private eye hero and the femme fatale, not to mention the atmosphere of absolute despair, regret and the terrifying power of evil people. But Chinatown has much more than that  it was made in an era when cinema was shorn of many of its conventions and the burdens of censorship and is therefore more daring and more grown up. The characters are at once stylised references to film noir figures and at the same fully rounded and believable individuals. The dialogue is both memorable and realistic. Robert Towne's screenplay also had some invaluable modifications from director Roman Polanski, most notably a change to the ending, although I won't spoil that here.Two things really stand out about Polanski's direction of Chinatown. First is his use of colour. The bulk of the film is composed in drab browns and greys, which evoke the era, as well as the theme of drought. Polanski had a great talent for being incredibly restrained when it came to colour, and really it's not so much about putting the right colours in, it's about keeping the wrong colours  the bold ones  out. He doesn't let so much as a brightly coloured button sneak into the shot, the exception to this being when he wants to draw attention to something or create a shift in mood. For example the blaring neon lights of the final sequence are a counterpoint to the rest of the film, and really help to ratchet up the power of the finale.The second thing that stands out is Polanski's use of space. Just like Alfred Hitchcock could create suspense out of nothing, Polanski creates a sense of confinement out of nothing. A lot of Chinatown takes place outdoors and in wide open spaces, but by this point Polanski's skill and confidence was such that he didn't need cramped apartments or castles to create claustrophobic spaces. Here he creates the same feeling with shots through car windscreens, Venetian blinds or even just a few carefully chosen items in the foreground. Chinatown is bizarrely shot in scope ratio, but whereas normally the ratio is used to open out the shot widthways, in Polanski's hands it is almost as if it is compressing the image height-wise.Also crucial to the mix is the spot-on casting. These were great roles for Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. This is perhaps Nicholson's career best  a deep, restrained performance in contrast to his comfort zone of playing energetic lunatics. The real masterstroke though was casting John Huston as Noah Cross. Obviously he was a major figure in classic film noir, but he also really gets his teeth into this role. It's also a nice touch to have someone who can make Jack Nicholson look small.Chinatown comes from the beginning of the age in which cinema became more and more retrospective and nostalgic, but nostalgia rarely comes better than this. A lot of people, myself included, didn't like Chinatown upon first seeing it, but it tends to grow on people. It's a very impressive picture.",9,2,6,27 October 2007
To Be or Not to Be," 'In the hands of a ham'
","It has long been controversial to make a comedy out of war and tragedy, but often it is among the best ways of dealing with a difficult subject. Being able to satirize evil and imagine humour even in the most desperate of plights is a big part of coming to terms with these things. And when done in the right way, it can make some of the most compelling works that cinema has to offer. With To Be or Not to Be, director Ernst Lubitsch, who had spent most of his career making sophisticated and often innuendo-laden comedies with absolutely no political content, surprised everyone by tackling the most urgent of topical issues head-on, yet still maintaining the frivolous comedy style that was his forte.Co-written with Melchior Lengyel (who had provided Lubitsch with his earlier hit Ninotchka) To Be or Not to Be features a brilliant premise – that of actors turning their skills to do underground work. As such it takes a light-hearted yet affectionate view of stage acting (which is where Lubitsch started out). This was a rather timely subject in Hollywood at the time. In the early days of sound, a lot of theatre actors had been called in to do the talkie business, but now the trend was shifting towards subtler, more naturalistic performances, as especially encouraged by directors like William Wyler and George Stevens. And there's nothing wrong with that approach – Wyler and Stevens were making some excellent pictures – but as a result the good old ham actor was becoming a somewhat marginalised figure. To Be or Not to Be makes the theatrical scenery-chewers into the heroes. The debate between the different styles is itself the subject of many of the gags, for example Lionel Atwill continually having to be reminded not to overact. The young Polish airman who woos Lombard is named Stanislaw, perhaps after Stanislavski, the nemesis of ham actors.The casting of To Be or Not to Be is like a celebration of the little hams. You won't find theatrical legends like Charles Laughton or John Barrymore here, but supporting players like Atwill, Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan are exactly the sort of people who were now a dying breed in the Hollywood movie. Here they can be seen at their unashamed best. The two leads on the other hand are not hams at all, but they were among the best comedy actors of the era. Jack Benny was ironically a master at underplaying scenes, often at his funniest when doing very little, such as drawing out the pause before beginning Hamlet's soliloquy. Carole Lombard was a consummate comedienne, often adopting a tone of complete sincerity that made little throwaway lines (like her enraptured 'It certainly does (interest me)' when Robert Stack is talking about his bomber) sound comically ridiculous. But she could turn that sincerity to dramatic purpose as well, for example her very genuine look of trepidation when she is questioned trying to leave the hotel.And finally let us talk of Lubitsch himself. There isn't much to say about Lubitsch's direction here that I haven't said in one of my many other reviews of his pictures. One thing that is specifically worth mentioning now though is the attention Lubitsch gives to minor performers. Another feature of the more modern directors is that they gave very little screen time to bit players. The aforementioned Wyler would often get supporting players to do their scenes with their backs to the camera so as not to draw attention from the leads. Again this is not intended as a criticism – it is right for Wyler's dramas. But Lubitsch was one director who always found a little bit of camera time for even the most inconsequential of actors. There are obvious examples in To Be or Not to Be with the many members of the acting troupe, but notice how in the scene with the Polish aviators in Britain, he treats several of them to close-ups. These aren't 'face-in-the-crowd' close-ups that you might see in a montage. Instead it's as if each of these men has become a lead character for a few seconds, even though they will soon disappear from the story. But Lubitsch did not do this indiscriminately. In the scene where Lombard passes on the photograph at the bookstore, there are two Nazis in the background. We don't catch a glimpse of their faces, we just have to know that they exist. It seems that when Lubitsch lingers on a character's face he does so out of affection. And that is really the attitude that permeates To Be or Not to Be – contempt for the villains, affection for the heroes, even through all the wit and satire. It is this ideal that really makes that fusing of the tragic and the comic work.",10,10,20,6 August 2011
Citizen Kane," 'It isn't enough to tell us what a man did, you've got to tell us who he was'
","Citizen Kane  one of the most acclaimed features of motion picture industry. Today, it's perhaps the most beloved film of those within the industry itself, topping the Sight and Sound directors' and critics' poll as well as AFI's 100 years, 100 movies list. But as with many a great and pioneering feature film it is also surrounded by a great deal of myth and misconception.For me, the biggest misattribution regarding Citizen Kane is that it was highly innovative  a revolution in film history. It isn't  it's really more of a return to form. Many of the things that make Citizen Kane stand out actually hark back to the silent era. Perhaps this is not surprising given Orson Welles' unique position  a talented young man who had already proved himself in several other fields, hastily teaching himself the basics of film-making and then putting together a very individual yet finely crafted picture. Given all this, it makes sense that Welles is in many ways like those early pioneers of film who were creating cinematic styles for the first time without previous generation of filmmakers to be influenced by.Take first of all Welles' independence. Welles is now looked back on as the ultimate director's director, bucking the studio system and controlling every aspect of production. This however was a freedom enjoyed by many silent directors, before the studios had consolidated their power, and the film-making process was a lot quicker and simpler. However, Welles' evasion of studio influence was significant, coming as it did at a time when the studio system was at the height of its dominance.Now let's look at Welles' style as a director. The first thing that hits you when you start watching Kane is the rhythm  first how we home smoothly and eerily in upon the Kane mansion, how the images dovetail into one other, and then the startling change of pace with the 'News On The March' segment. Ironically, even though it's a good mock-up of a straightforward newsreel, this is actually one of the most tightly constructed and cinematic sequences in the entire film. It's not just a rhythmic editing pattern, but each shot 'agrees' with the one before and after it, the pace and style of the movement in each shot gives a consistent flow to the whole thing. This sense of rhythm harks back to earliest days of film  Melies is probably the first to use it, and Griffith and Eisenstein developed it, but an overt sense of rhythm declined with the coming of sound, with a few notable exceptions such as Busby Berkely musicals and Disney cartoons. What is really great in Kane is how the pace of the picture is carried through into Orson Welles' acting  you can see he is totally sensitive to the rhythm of his own work with every move he makes.In a similar vein, Citizen Kane also represents a return of expressionism in film, that is the externalisation of ideas and feelings through technique and symbolism. Not that expressionism ever totally died out, but Kane is constantly and overtly expressionistic, almost as much as the silent films of Murnau and Hitchcock, with moody lighting in sombre scenes, high and low angles, massive distances between characters to demonstrate emotional detachment, the pelting rain when we first encounter the middle-aged Susan Alexander and so forth. Of course this is another reason why Kane is a director's favourite  touches like this are the chances for directors to express themselves and create something more than simply shooting a script. All this is sometimes a little overdone in Kane  often the hallmark of a young director  and the continual dollying in and out on headlines and ridiculously low angles can get a bit tiresome. Welles was to direct with more subtlety in his later features.One area in which Citizen Kane does seem to be genuinely revolutionary, and perhaps the area in which it had the most influence, is in its creation of the modern biopic. Granted, it's perhaps not a true biopic because Kane is a fictional character (albeit one based on real figures), but the structure of revealing his story  beginning with the public image of the person at the end of their life, then telling their true story, warts and all, as a flashback, humanising them in the process  was the basis for Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi and virtually every other biopic of the last forty years. It's often stated that Welles was ahead of his time, and it was a long time before Citizen Kane's influence could be felt. One director/writer team however, were more on the ball  Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) bears many similarities to Kane, taking a distant, un-heroic figure and turning him into a real and sympathetic person.Citizen Kane is still in itself a unique and captivating picture, very clearly the product of someone who was never classically trained  as it were  in film-making but who had a natural feel for it all the same. It's not a perfect film, as some have claimed, but it's a satisfying, well crafted (not to forget brilliantly acted) piece of cinema, well deserving of praise and attention.",9,1,2,1 January 2008
The Birth of a Nation," 'The dark side of wrong'
","In writing these comments, I don't normally look into the political or ethical issues of the films in question, but in the case of Birth of a Nation I feel I must, due to its significance in cinema history and its appalling and conspicuous racism. While most buffs who view the picture today will be able to ignore that racism, the fact of it still causes a number of problems. As it was DW Griffith's most famous and successful picture, it has been taken as representative of his whole career and personality. Consequently, some of today's writers have attempted to downplay Griffith's contributions to cinematic form (see for example John Steinle's woefully uninformed essay at sensesofcinema.com). Others have stated that Birth is overrated compared to Griffith's less objectionable pictures, or even that the less racist first half is also technically superior to the second.None of these attempts to reassess the quality of Birth or Griffith's work as a whole is particularly convincing, and they are little more than a ridiculous assumption that a director's views are synonymous with their talent (a misunderstanding for which the auteur theory is at least partly to blame). Anyone who has seen more than a handful of Griffith's pictures will know that he made pictures putting forward many different and conflicting views – see for example the Biograph shorts The Red Man's View, His Trust and The Rose of Kentucky – but the fact that he made Birth of a Nation proves he was certainly a naïve and unconscious racist, although not a hateful one. Still, this doesn't detract from his being a master craftsman of the cinema, and to deny Griffith's influence would be to misrepresent cinematic history.So with that said, let's have a look at the picture itself. Birth of a Nation's greatest asset is perhaps its portrayal of family life and romantic love. Griffith's tableaux are a beautiful blend of naturalism and the style of renaissance painting. He paints a nostalgic picture of the Old South, linking its romantic imagery with the emotional heart of the story – for example Henry Walthall having his first glimpse of Lillian Gish's portrait while standing in a field of cotton. By contrast many of the action sequences are actually rather dull. The main battle scene in the first half is a bit of a mess, with too many indistinct god-shots of people running round, a bit of flag-waving and some puffs of smoke. The one exception is the final ride-to-the-rescue, which is, unfortunately, perhaps the best Griffith ever constructed. I say 'unfortunately', because it's also completely abhorrent, racially. While I can appreciate it objectively, I can't enjoy it.It's often overlooked that, aside from his technical innovations, Griffith's pictures were also at the forefront of revolutionising screen acting. They took us from the grimacing and pantomime of the mid-1900s to the subtle yet expressive performances which we see here. In Birth of a Nation, it's particularly nice to see Lillian Gish at her peak, before she descended into a style which consisted of nothing but childish gestures and over-the-top hysterics. Another standout is Raoul Walsh as John Wilkes Booth, who brings a powerful presence to his small yet pivotal role. On the downside, perennial villains George Siegmann and Walter Long are simply hammy stereotypes, indicative of the crudeness of many reconstruction scenes. Griffith defenders who claim the first part is better than the second are at least right in terms of the quality of acting and level of realism! As a cinematic achievement, Birth of a Nation is surpassed by Intolerance and many of Griffith's short pictures. It is still however an example of his sensitivity to cinematic form and a culmination of his pioneering work of the previous six years. Today, discussion of it seems to be either at an infantile level (see the message boards below ;) ) or simply non-existent. Griffith's pictures are not only integral to the development of cinematic language, they are also beautifully made works of entertainment, and acknowledging this does not make someone a racist by association. Let's not throw Griffith's baby out with its bigoted bathwater.",8,1,4,5 September 2009
12 Monkeys," 'Certain unnamed realities'
","The future dystopia has been a staple of sci-fi movies for around forty years now, and for even longer in sci-fi novels. However there are only so many ways you can show the world going to buggery before it gets a bit samey. Twelve Monkeys however is a future dystopia movie that mostly sidesteps looking at said dystopia, and instead twists through time to reveal where things went wrong in the first place.Although sometimes thought of as a non-linear movie, Twelve Monkeys in fact follows the personal timeline of its hero as he zips back and forth, and in broad outline is not actually amazingly complex. However, the David and Janet Peoples screenplay does not make any clear opening statements – apart from a couple of lines on a title card which are put in dubious context. We then plunge straight into the flowing narrative and have to glean what the movie's about in bits and pieces along the way. While this demands close attention from the viewer, it works very well to embroil us in the world of a confused outsider.This confusion and oddity is deepened in the approach of director Terry Gilliam, who uses rather overt stylisation to make the world of Twelve Monkeys as distorted and alien as possible. His near-constant Dutch angles and claustrophobic camera positions (racked up or toned down depending on protagonist Cole's mental state) could easily become tiresome, but the focus on macabre set design, unusual faces and familiar objects made to look outlandish allows us to get swept up in the wonkiness of the whole creation. At times, watching it feels a bit like being unpleasantly drunk. But don't let this fool you into thinking there isn't precision to all this. Knowing that the story often relies upon the audience recalling some tiny detail, Gilliam uses a number of cunning tricks to fix something in our memories, for example Madeleine Stowe's distorted voice on the words 'Merry Christmas' or the fact that Dr Peters has those distinctive ginger locks.As Gilliam garnered his reputation as a belligerent maverick, he also began to work with more and more prestigious Hollywood stars. Twelve Monkeys sees Bruce Willis in a role that is arguably to his type, with a fair bit of macho action, but with a presentation that is very much counter to his usual confident demeanour. He's actually very effective in this lonely, vulnerable guise, seeming mysterious yet sympathetic. The most memorable turn is that of an exuberant Brad Pitt. Pitt's madman act is derived mostly from the hammy madman acts of Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper, and it's really just as overdone, although there is some amazingly complicated business he's doing with his fingers that is at the very least distinctive. Gilliam seems to have achieved the impossible and make Pitt look, not unattractive as such, but disappointingly plain. Madeleine Stowe gives a strong and steady performance, a credible turn in what is really the only straight dramatic role. Her best highlight – and the most poignant moment in the whole picture – is that ghost of a smile in her final scene.While Twelve Monkeys in many areas falls some way short of perfection, it works better than many movies with stronger components, simply because good or bad everything is of a piece. Pitt's overacting, Gilliam's extrovert camera, the improbable converging of events in the storyline, these all fit in with the strange and giddy rhythm of the movie and its grim yet oddly sentimental mood. It is far from the typical sci-fi fare that gets the geeks salivating, but it is an absorbing thriller and one that, even through its unreality, carries a striking humanity.",9,2,3,29 January 2012
12 Angry Men," 'Gambling on probabilities'
","The 50s are known as the age of the big picture – the epics and the uber-budget monstrosities. But it was also the era when the Indy film came of age, and every now and then a mini-budget wonder peeped through between the tall trees of the major studios. And 12 Angry Men is quite literally a small picture, taking place almost exclusively on the one set. It's unusual that a production that is so minimalist in terms of locations is derived not from the stage (as was, say, Rope) but from an earlier television edition – testament to the growing influence of TV at that time.This is the cinematic debut of director Sidney Lumet, who has something of a flair for these claustrophobic little dramas (he also did the job on Murder on the Orient Express and Dog Day Afternoon). Already you can see him thinking about how to turn the one space into several different kinds of space. We begin rather objectively, with the camera holding back unmoving in a far corner as the jurors potter about. We then gradually close in, the shots becoming more personal. Crucially, the camera now often follows actors around as they move (especially the restless Ed Begley) to get that more aggravated feel to the shots. Finally towards the end the camera starts to pull back again, revealing the group dynamic as they spiral into heated argument. Lumet shows his inexperience (some shots don't match up very well, and the close-ups are too close) but essentially his ideas are geared in the right direction.Such a tight little drama calls for some first class acting. Henry Fonda gives a subtle, considered performance, showing with his face and general demeanour that he is really not thinking just about how to persuade the other jurors, but about the implications of the trial, and the life that is at stake. Fonda clearly understands that Juror #8 is not simply a man doing the job he has been called up for, but one who has found himself under the burden of an almighty responsibility. Lee J. Cobb gives a performance of great power, and one that is needed since it is really his character that ends up holding the emotional weight of the picture. Honourable mentions also go to George Voskovec and Martin Balsam for giving the most realistic and human portrayals of the other jurors.12 Angry Men is a hugely affecting and effective piece of work, not to mention a really neatly structured one. But is it perhaps sometimes a little too neat? It ought to be entirely believable, entirely smooth and unforced in feel, and yet too much of the dialogue seems so calculated. The writer's thought processes are too much on display. I'm talking, for example, about the way Juror #3 keeps saying something so perfectly hypocritical at exactly the ideal moment. And while it's true that each character must clearly represent a different attitude or segment of society, some of them are embarrassingly stereotyped, and the twee acting styles of Joe Sweeney and John 'Winnie-the-Pooh' Fiedler don't help. None of these things is a big enough flaw to bring 12 Angry Men tumbling to the ground – don't get me wrong, this is still a mighty picture – but they do serve as a warning that the little pictures are just a susceptible to corn and gimmicks as the big ones.",9,0,0,26 May 2010
The English Patient," 'You loved him'
","Once every five or ten years there is produced an epic, historical romantic tragedy, a movie of incredible beauty and emotional magnitude that tends to make a sweep at the Oscars, usually deserved. The late 80s and early 90s had been suspiciously devoid of any such movie. And then, all of sudden, a bunch of them came along at once. The English Patient sees such a grand romance with the elusive themes and complex structuring more often encountered in the art house.It is not, however, dull or pretentious, possessing a directness and humanity that makes us feel somehow involved. Director Anthony Minghella does not attempt to dazzle us with any form of technical wizardry. His style is simple, thoughtful, with few camera movements. At certain times he places us right within the action, such as at the beginning of the first flashback, where the camera occupies the space of an imaginary extra person as the team discuss their expedition (this is a trick classic master Frank Capra also used, by the way). At other times, particularly in the 1945 scenes at the monastery, his camera looks down upon things, but the sense at these times is not one of cold detachment, but one of giving the characters some space and freedom at moments of high emotion, as when they bring the bedridden Count out in the rain.The English Patient has practically an ensemble cast, with players of many different temperaments contributing something, and no-one quite seeming to be in a lead role. Although she won her awards as a supporting actress, Juliette Binoche provides perhaps the strongest presence throughout the movie. Her character is bereaved several times, and it's admirable how she manages to make the emotion seem genuine even in repetition. Together with Naveen Andrews and Kevin Whately she forms a warm, likable trio that viewers are instantly able to connect with. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, the lovers of the primary story, are a sharp contrast. While both are physically very beautiful, there is a stiffness and formality about them both which, despite some wonderful efforts (Fiennes's drunk act is priceless), they never quite break out of enough to make their passion seem truly alive.But perhaps this is part of the point. The English Patient is after all a picture of shifting tones. The scenes of 1945 depict a time for healing, mourning and rebuilding, and as such the only times where real human feeling is allowed to flow. Perhaps it is right that the dead romance of the past should be portrayed with a loftiness as of some ancient legend. Thinking in these terms, it becomes possible to see the movie for its all-round care in construction – the deeply-composed shots within the monastery that look like Vermeer paintings; the Walter Murch editing that seems cut together for harmonies of sound as much as image – a design in which even the style of acting performances is keyed into the dual storytelling. This is a picture in which the artiness and metaphor of highbrow filmmaking meet the grandeur and sentiment of the mainstream, to overwhelming effect.",9,0,1,12 February 2012
Batman Returns," 'An embarrassing lack of juice'
","There is a tendency for directors with a unique look began to dominate cinema more than ever in the 90s. Directors like Tim Burton have a kind of mainstream popularity and creative control only really enjoyed by Cecil B. DeMille and Alfred Hitchcock in the classic era. This meant that, after a certain point, whatever project Tim Burton took on, it looked like a Tim Burton movie. When he filmed Batman in 1989, it was very much a Batman flick, but when he returned for the sequel, armed with the commercial bankability and industry respect that the first picture had earned him, was far more able to twist the production to his own vision.Burton was never outstanding at basic film-craft (otherwise he could be making dramas), but his substantial genius lies in his visual arts. Somewhat atypically for a director, he would have his production design team base everything on his own sketches. His instantly recognisable forms – a mix of Gothic nightmare and twee Americana – dominate Batman Returns. It's almost so much here that the sheer weirdness of it all overshadows the comic-book antics. There's also a lot of 'clever business' too such as the point-of-view shot of the young Penguin looking out through the bars of his crib being mirrored by a point-of-view shot of his older self looking through the sewer grate. It is very Burton-esque to show things from the perspective of the villainous freak – and certainly very unusual for the mainstream.As can be expected, the cast members are a suitably over-the-top bunch. Danny de Vito hams it up gloriously with humour and just a little pathos. Michelle Pfeiffer milks those terribly corny lines for all they are worth. Add Christopher Walken into the mix and it seems the writers were spread-betting when it came to throwing in traditional Batman villains. As a result poor old Michael Keaton in the title role is a bit lost, which is a pity because he was excellent in the 1989 predecessor. The most honourable mention goes to Michael Gough, reprising his role as Albert the butler. You have to admire his dryness when he Pfeiffer recommends he pen a dirty limerick for the occasion, and he informs her one has just sprung to mind.Batman Returns is several notches below the earlier movie. It is simply too much of a collision between Burton's world and Batman's world, but there are a few things to be salvaged from the wreckage. For all its basic incoherence, the picture is filled with a wonderful dark humour and numerous silly ideas. Far from a classic, it is at least a good bit of fun, and of course it looks pretty good too.",6,1,3,13 December 2011
The Great Dictator," 'Can you hear that?'
","Back at the dawn of the talkie era, Charlie Chaplin defended his decision not to start making sound films by saying 'The moment the little tramp talks, he's dead'. He was right of course. His comic persona was the creation of an era in cinema when words and voices were irrelevant. The little tramp's appeal lay entirely in how he did things, not in what he was supposed to be saying. And yet it was inevitable that if Chaplin wanted to continue in the business he would have to cave in eventually. Besides Chaplin's agenda was itself changing, and he had now reached a point in his life where he really wanted to speak to the world.Many of the early scenes in The Great Dictator seem to prove Chaplin's fears about sound film. The slapstick has lost its flow, looking forced and awkward. And it appears Chaplin has no real idea how to write or direct dialogue. Sometimes characters make some banal little comment on the action as if simply to fill up the silence. Even worse things happen when Chaplin attempts verbal humour, resorting to feeble puns like the one about the gas keeping him awake all night (not that puns are necessarily bad, just that Chaplin isn't very good at them). Above all, the visual and verbal business is poorly integrated, with a badly-timed stop-start feel. It makes it particularly jarring after a dialogue scene to see this ageing version of the little tramp doing some of his old moves, such as teetering on one foot as he runs into a squad of stormtroopers. These scenes are unlikely to raise more than a titter, and are a sad testament to the fact that this familiar character was past his prime and out of time.But this is a tale of two Charlies. For the first time in decades Chaplin creates a new character for himself in dictator Adenoid Hynkel. And the great thing about Hynkel is that he sidesteps Chaplin's inability with comedy in words but still makes use of comedy in sound. The dictator's cod-Germanic speech is part silly-voice, part linguistic nonsense and it is very, very funny. It actually adds to the humour that no-one else in the picture speaks it, and that Hynkel mostly lapses into it in moments of anger, as if it was some involuntary anxiety-driven affectation. The other great thing about Hynkel is that he is one of Chaplin's great works of satire. The nonsense language is of course a lampooning of Hitler's forceful speechmaking, but the parody continues through everything Hynkel does. Take for example when he has finished posing with the baby, and rather disgustedly wipes his hand clean. He does it with the same stiff-faced disdain that Hitler always displayed in public, but the character's puffed-up austerity is also being punctured by the fact that he's just got his hand covered in wee wee. The little tramp, a creation of and for the silent era, could not make the transition to sound. But Hynkel is a creation of and for the sound era, and he works fantastically.As the picture unfolds, it begins to gain maturity and clarity, not to mention comic brilliance. Jack Oakie's Napoloni makes a perfect partner for Hynkel, and their antics together are like the Marx Brothers at their most riotous. Napoloni is also a work of satire equal to Hynkel, with Oakie working in many of Mussolini's less dignified mannerisms, such as curling his lip and bulging his eyes like he's trying to squeeze out a fart. While Chaplin's direction is at its most overt and showy, he also cleverly and subtly gears his compositions towards ridicule, making the most of those tall set designs to show off the dictator as some little twerp. And finally, the picture acquires the poignancy that made Chaplin's silent features stand out, this time with an extra bite in the seriousness of its message. It is then that you realise Chaplin knew his little tramp was finished, and yet that he needed him here to deliver his point. By subjecting him to sound, Chaplin sacrifices his alter-ego, making a means to speak his mind to the public who had loved him.",9,5,6,18 October 2010
Ed Wood," 'It's all about razzle-dazzle'
","The mighty epics and incisive dramas of the 1950s should be well-known to anyone with a cursory interest in classic cinema, but now less familiar are the numerous B-movies that formed a teaming if slightly seedy underbelly to Hollywood's grandiosity. The movies may have been cheap and shoddy affairs, but that doesn't mean there weren't behind-the-scenes stories that were just as fascinating as the juiciest tidbits of A-list gossip. Here we see a celebration of one of the B-flick's unsung heroes, the great Edward D. Wood Junior.The project was given, very appropriately, to that champion of B-movie chic Tim Burton. As a film director, Tim Burton is far from the best, but he had a certain kind of genius that could shine through in the right project. For Ed Wood, he seeks very much to immerse us in the eponymous filmmaker's world. When, for example, Dolores notes that her sweaters are always stretched and Eddie turns over with a guilty look, we are suddenly sharing that private space between him and the camera. Many scenes are shot from a low angle, such as when Wood first meets Lugosi, which reduces the image to the actors' heads, the sky and the odd signpost. It creates a very surreal image, with very little to tie it into the real world. Nothing normal is allowed to steal into the frame. Burton also stages a lot of the scenes with a certain sense of occasion, as in Lugosi's final speech or Wood's entrance in women's clothing – these events are given an air of grand theatricality. This is Wood's world – only seeing the glamour.Actors don't often get the chance to ham it up in modern cinema, but even though Ed Wood is about real historical personages, these individuals – Bela Lugosi, Criswell, Bunny Breckinridge and of course Mr Wood himself – were hugely flamboyant figures, and besides, the world in which Ed Wood takes place is somewhat hyper-real. Johnny Depp demonstrates his magnificent ability to walk the line between drama and comedy, giving the title character a boyish charm that makes us forget how atypical he is for a lead. Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi as a ham who hammed even when he wasn't in front of the camera, showing the old horror legend as larger-than-life but also painstakingly human. Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones play similarly oddball characters, and just have fun with the opportunity to chew up the scenery and still remain faithful to the actual people they are portraying.In Ed Wood Burton, along with writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski make Wood's movies look better than they actually were. And Landau makes Lugosi seem like a better actor than he really was (at least, as he was at that forlorn stage in his career). While little that appears here is outright fabrication, the facts have been dressed up, exaggerated, just as Wood might have done himself. And this is all fair enough in the spirit of the thing. After all, Ed Wood doesn't seem to be a document of how things actually were, but of how we should like to remember them.",9,1,1,17 January 2012
A Bridge Too Far," 'Can be helped by a cup of tea'
","As genres go, the war movie went through a fairly slow and awkward evolution. During the 40s and 50s, when all the other genres were busy growing up, all war pictures were produced as propaganda or respectful tribute, simply due to the needs of the era. By the 60s and 70s the genre was making up for lost time with not only anti-war movies but also war comedies and even war musicals. A Bridge Too Far turns away from such frivolity, back to those earlier pictures that recorded events of the past conflict, but this time around it is to tell one of the less successful stories of the Allies in World War Two.Many war stories have been told through the eyes of one or two characters, with shifting historical episodes taking place as a backdrop. Screenwriter William Goldman's takes the reverse approach. His script is first and foremost a description of events, from which various personal stories are thrown up. And charting as it does a full scale military operation, A Bridge Too Far features numerous characters and numerous tiny stories. With such fleeting glimpses it is difficult to make much empathetic connection to the material. And yet the whole thing is structured to provide a blend of the informative, the exciting and the moving. Some characters exist purely for historical detail, others are heroes of a brief action set-piece, while others still are mouthpieces for a bit of commentary.Director Richard Attenborough was proving himself to be a specialist in war and historical pictures, and you can see him here perfecting the broader sweep that would soon win him an Oscar for Gandhi. He shows real economic expression, often putting an individual story in the foreground and a bigger happening in the background. His arrangements are clear and meaningful, which also helps in the fast paced action scenes. We get a real impression of the speed at which combat takes place, with enemies popping up and people being shot with barely enough time for us to process them. The editing of Antony Gibbs is instrumental here, never allowing a shot to carry on for an instant longer than it needs to. Still, Attenborough uses far too many close-ups for the needs of the picture, at times making them standard shots when they ought to be played like trump-cards for key moments. He also wastes time with banal bits of metaphorical business, like the train-set spinning round in circles.As usual with an Attenborough picture we get the full range of Dickie's acting buddies, and this is perhaps his most impressive ensemble yet. Unfortunately what with all the bit playing going on here many of them are simply filling a slot – the cool arrogance of one upper-class general, the gung-ho naiveté another, the nervousness of some junior officer – at least, that goes for the British cast members. The Americans are a more interesting bunch; James Caan and Robert Redford giving believably impassioned but unfortunately brief performances. The standout is Gene Hackman as Polish general Sosabowski, who brilliantly conveys through his suppressed anger at the incompetence of his allies, the fact that, as representative of a conquered nation his perspective on the combat is somewhat more realistic. Ryan O'Neal also stands out but for all the wrong reasons. It suddenly struck me watching his dreadful turn in A Bridge Too Far how much O'Neal resembles George W. Bush – he has the same deadpan delivery and gormless expression.However A Bridge Too Far is too major an epic to allow these minor gripes to spoil it. This is where the picture's bitty structure and legion of characters comes in useful. Don't like this actor? Never mind, he only has two scenes. And in spite of its lack of a overarching personal story to bind the narrative together, A Bridge Too Far does do a very decent job of telling the big historical story. It's almost as effective as a documentary, and is certainly more entertaining. There are many pictures that ought to have been successful, but somehow failed. A Bridge Too Far ought to have been a failure, but is somehow a success.",8,0,1,16 August 2010
The Terminator," 'A serious attitude problem'
","There has long been a tradition in cinema of actors whose good looks or sheer physicality far outstripped their Thespian talents. Of these Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a league of his own. His nickname of Austrian Oak seems to refer not just to his impressive stature but to his woodenness before the camera. And yet he became an icon in the 1980s by managing to get cast in parts which didn't stretch his disappointing range. What do you do with a monotonous voice and a body that looks like it could punch through concrete? You play a robot, that's what.Oh, sorry, not a robot. A *cyborg*Yes, the 1980s run of hi-octane sci-fi actioners was a boon for Schwarzenegger. The idea of some technological terror coming to get us was hardly new. It was the subject of a lot of 50s B-movies, and if you want to go back further you could include Frankenstein as well. The Terminator is essentially an update of these stories for the then-fledgling age of computers and robotics. It's not the best bit of writing ever. There is some woeful dialogue, and enough logical flaws in the plot to drive a juggernaut through, but this doesn't really matter because the screenplay only really exists to give us a thrilling action adventure. And the central premise – futuristic warriors battling it out over the life of a present day woman – provides a strong enough core to build any number of fight and chase scenes around.The Terminator was the second feature of James Cameron, and he shows early on a skillful blending of terror and excitement. The picture moves fast, so he doesn't have much time to establish elements of horror, but he is adept at throwing something into the frame – such as the prominent window behind Linda Hamilton – to introduce a little note of uncertainty and danger. To maintain the pace, Cameron's tack is to keep the images constantly moving, not letting the tempo down even in quiet moments. After Arnie utters the immortal 'I'll be back' line, we cut between near identical close-ups of the desk sergeant's paperwork – an utterly pointless bit of editing narrative-wise but it brilliantly ratchets up the tension before it all kicks off. Cameron also loves to make the audience feel involved, frequently placing us within the action. The first shot in the modern day has the camera underneath the jaws of a monstrous-looking digger. Often characters are seen advancing towards the retreating camera. It's worth remembering that Cameron was of the first generation of filmmakers to be influenced by video games. Not that earlier directors hadn't used these techniques, but I think that idea of feeling like a participant in the action really helped shape his approach.The movie looks neat too despite what was a relatively low budget for the era and genre. They have really gone to town on all the tropes of the 80s action movie – dry ice, blue lightning and alleyways full of billowing newspapers and homeless people. In a way, that contrast between piercing white light and smoky shadow was the 80s equivalent of chiaroscuro lighting. Very often of course it is hiding the clunkiness of the special effects, which are strictly old-school. Personally I love the movie's pre-CGI charm. This really was a golden age for animatronics, even as they were becoming obsolete.So, where does Mr Schwarzenegger fit into all this? With The Terminator we have a movie where fast-paced action runs roughshod over logic, and it doesn't call for amazing dramatic performances. Look at the other players – Linda Hamilton is passable but not amazing, and Michael Biehn is dreadful to the point of irritating. Outside of this movie, both Hamilton and Biehn were better actors than Schwarzenegger, but here it is Arnie who is the most compelling and watchable, simply because playing a hard, mechanical killing machine is the one thing he could do really well. Just for once, he gets to be convincing, chilling, the captivating heart of the movie. Good for him.",9,2,3,8 November 2011
Sleepy Hollow," 'We need to use our brains'
","Throughout the course of the 1990s Tim Burton established himself as a cinematic brand. The audience expects certain things from a Burton movie – hallowe'en-horror stories, meek and sensitive heroes, dark and twisted imagery, and of course Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow contains all theses things, and was one of his most prestigious productions to date. As such, its box office success was a foregone conclusion. It's real value as a movie however is by no means guaranteed.Burton's pictures have sometimes been described as fairy tales for adults. This is all very well in itself, but does Sleepy Hollow really need to talk down to its audience so? The frequent gore and sex suggests it's not aimed at kids, but it's given the simplistic overlay of a children's film, only without the charm. One of the weakest aspects is the series of flashbacks to Ichabod's childhood, which are simultaneously boringly clichéd and too wildly hysterical to be taken seriously (not to mention the slightly disturbing fact that Lisa Marie's cleavage is continually hovering over the young Ichabod's head). With inventions like this Burton and his writers are presumably paying homage to the B-horrors of the 1960s, but really they just seem like a trashy and charmless copy of something that was endearing despite its trashiness. The dialogue meanwhile ranges from trite and insipid to frankly ignorant (1800 was not a new millennium!) Of course in movies like this atmosphere is often more important than plotting, but in Sleepy Hollow the atmosphere is laid on so thickly – and with so little imagination – that it becomes virtually meaningless. For the opening shots of a letter being sealed, the imagery could hardly be more obvious if Burton himself had popped up on screen and said 'Red wax looks a bit like blood, doesn't it, eh?' The special effects are too cartoonish to be properly horrific, but not enough to be comical. When we see the horseman's flesh re-growing, he dips off the screen, presumably so the shot can be changed to allow for some stupid waggly tongue special effect – as if that makes any sense whatsoever.Burton was such a reputable figure by this point that he always secured big names for his casts, and if nothing else Sleepy Hollow contains some really wonderful players. Michael Gambon brings some gravity to his role, and I'm always glad to see Miranda Richardson, even if it's only that she still shows occasional flashes of 'Queenie' from Blackadder II. But it's also a shame that so many of these excellent players don't get to show their full potential, mostly through the weakness of the screenplay or a simple lack of screen time. It seems a particular waste to have Christopher Walken in a part where he doesn't get to speak, or even really change his facial expression. But just as the supporting players are disappointingly underused, the leads are disappointing full stop. Johnny Depp was clearly trying to go for something a bit different with his fussy, slightly effeminate Ichabod Crane, but he makes for a rather dull and uninspiring hero. Meanwhile Christina Ricci's acting is only marginally better than that of the dead tree.I can't deny that Sleepy Hollow at least looks good. The beautifully stylised cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki sometimes evokes the graininess of early cinema, at other times fills the frame with shadows while still keeping everything in clear definition. But nice as it looks, this is nothing more than high-class gloss for this dry twig of a movie. Sleepy Hollow features everything one would expect from a Burton picture, and all the lavishness that goes with a director of such renown, and yet it contains very little else of substance.",3,0,1,4 March 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Just like the old days'
","When the old Hollywood production code was abandoned in 1967 it wasn't just sex, violence and profanity that started appearing on cinema screens. For the first time since the early 1930s you could get away with making criminals the good guys. One of the nicest products of this new era of liberty was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western very much of its time in style and values, and yet one so warmly human and respectful to genre convention you feel it was aching to be made all along.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is first of all a superbly written screenplay. What is striking is how witty it is from start to finish, enough to arguably classify it as a comedy Western. But this is far from being a Blazing Saddles-style spoof. The humour is very natural, and largely serves to make the characters instantly likable. A great example is the early scene in which Butch is challenged by Logan, and Butch uses his intelligence and his sense of humour to overcome his opponent, whereby from then on we admire and route for the guy. Another great aspect of the picture is how the two main characters are opposites who complement each other. The easygoing amiable Butch and the prickly, cynical Sundance are like a gentler version of the brains and brawn dynamic of many criminal duos both real and fictional.It may seem obvious now, but it was only after a lengthy selection process that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as the eponymous heroes. But just like the written characters, this pair have a great rapport and complementary styles. Newman has such presence and charisma that, even though his character actually makes a lot of bad judgements throughout the picture, he still has the air of man people will look up to and follow. Redford handles the difficult balance of bringing out Sundance's curmudgeonly manner but giving us the impression that it's all a front and he is a nice guy deep down. Above all they both make their performances look effortless, so that although these are obviously heavily idealised portrayals of the real historical figures, we believe in them as genuine people.This was the picture in which ace director George Roy Hill really hit his stride. He often uses camera set-ups that may seem against cinematic convention but help to focus us purely on what is important. Take the sepia-toned sequence after the opening credits. We start with a very odd shot of Paul Newman walking through a town which, rather than show him in a more normal wide-shot showing off the whole street, frames him in mid-close-up. We then get a lengthy shot of Redford framed similarly whilst the gambler he is talking to has his back to us. What these shots do is draw us in completely on these two characters for their introduction scene, without distracting us with the faces of anyone who is inconsequential to the story. However, after these opening few shots we move to the wider group shots and landscapes that let us know we are in familiar Western territory. There are some other neat touches from Hill in the chase scenes that form the climax of the first half of the picture. He keeps the pursuing lawmen in long-shot, never allowing us to get a proper glimpse of them, which makes them a depersonalised presence, and puts us constantly in the place of heroes. Also rather than cutting back and forth as many chase sequences do, he has several set-ups in which both hunter and hunted are together in the same shot (very difficult to organise over such great distances), which gives a very realistic sense of the pursuit.The icing on the cake is surely the music. Not just the Burt Bacharach tunes, at turns achingly sad or wonderfully jaunty, but the way they are used. The central montage of sepia photos has a beautiful sense of nostalgia to it, and the fact that these 'good times' are presented in a way that is somewhat distant and abstract gives them a tone of poignancy when compared to the bad times that are to come in Bolivia. These good old days are dead and gone, the montage seems to say. Of course Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head is a tad anachronistic but it suits the tone of the bike ride sequence perfectly. Touches like this, the occasional nods to the nouvelle vague and the modern-sounding score, along with the carefree ethos, make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid very much a movie of its time. And yet, it does not have the pretentiousness or downright weirdness of so many late-60s cinema, and with its good-natured charm it is in fact one of the most accessible and enduring pieces of its era.",10,1,2,13 January 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is a war room!'
","It's often said of Kubrick that he never repeated himself, as far as genres go at least. Of course, that's not strictly true if you count Dr Strangelove as one of three anti-war films. But it was his only true comedy, and even though it was originally conceived as a straight drama about the perils of the nuclear age it is only through the comical method of storytelling that it has real weight.It was with this film that Kubrick really consolidated his style. It was here that he more or less abandoned regular camera movement, and began using his trademark zooms and long takes within one frame. It's as if he finds one perfect shot then sticks to it. If the camera moves at all it's generally a straight side-to-side track, from one carefully constructed shot to another. This use of camera became the template for all his subsequent films, although it appears to have happened more or less overnight. It's strange also to think that while only nine years into a forty-five year career as a director, in terms of numbers of pictures made this is in fact in the middle (he made six full-length features before it, and was to another make six afterwards).There are of course many other Kubrick touches present here which had been in development since day one. There is his contrast of place, particularly through light and dark. There is a slightly crazed intensity to everything. And of course there is the usual supporting cast of deranged eccentrics  although the difference here is that the oddball characters are running the show.One thing that really makes this film work is the way in which the comedy is gradually turned up and up, like a dimmer switch. There is barely a joke in the first twenty minutes, and the whole thing opens like some dry political drama. The real breakdown point is that freakish low angle shot of Sterling Hayden, at the moment where he first brings up his psychotic theory concerning bodily fluids. By the time the eponymous Doctor is introduced, the thing is well and truly off the rails and more or less anything goes  and all the while keeping to the dark storyline that the comedy was spawned from.Probably the greatest strength of Dr Strangelove though is its cast. Sellers gives us three carefully constructed and totally individual characters (although I don't think he's quite as funny here as he is in Lolita). George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also both brilliant in rare comedy roles.But after all this praise  I don't know. To me Dr Strangelove still falls a few inches short of being a classic. If you stripped away all the layers of comedy it would probably be mind-numbingly boring. Kubrick has tried to inject a note of suspense, but no matter how you shoot and edit it you can't wring much excitement out of world map boards and cockpit controls. This picture is great when considered as a kind of comic anti-war set piece, but it is too lacking in soul to be anything more. Then again that's not a bad thing in itself, as I can't think of a better way to make such a film.",8,1,4,11 December 2006
Alien," 'I admire its purity'
","The sci-fi movie, by the late 1970s was a very clean, bright-looking genre. In the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek space travel was all about gleaming corridors and friendly swishing doors. Aliens were generally friendly, as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or if they weren't at least they were only trying to shoot you with a ray-gun, not bite your face off in some dank corridor. With Alien, the sci-fi genre reacquired that sense of horror and paranoia which it had had in its 1950s heyday.The look of the thing is all-important here. The design team have created an environment that looks suitably space age-y but also very gritty and industrial, with an emphasis on tight enclosure. The room of the 'mother' computer is easily the brightest, yet its low, curved ceiling makes it incredibly claustrophobic. Director Ridley Scott often keeps his camera amid the clutter. In the opening scene before the crew awaken, he sets up the feeling of eeriness with various indistinct movements in the depths of the set. Throughout the movie Scott integrates simple elements of light and sound – squeals, clanks, flashes – and his sense of timing really makes this a triumph of horror. One of the great things about the production design and the way Scott shoots it is that the creature often blends into the paraphernalia, creating several surprise moments where we realise it was in plain view all along.Another brilliant thing about Alien is that the crew of the Nostromo don't look like a set heroic, uniformed space pioneers. They look – and act – like ordinary people doing their job. Although there isn't much room for dramatics here, there are many fine performances from the cast. Ian Holm does well, all things considered, throwing a believable inhuman streak into the mix. Veronica Cartwright is ostensibly the token screaming female, but she plays it with surprising realism and dignity. But best of all is Sigourney Weaver. The part was originally written for a man, and while heroic women in action movies are quite de rigueur now, compare Ripley to any other female character from a mainstream 70s movie, and you see the context Weaver was working in. And yet her performance is strong and confident enough that she seems completely natural in the tough, assertive role.Stunning and innovative as it is, Alien remains something of a one-off. Although many 80s sci-fi movies adopted that dark, dingy look, they were typically more action-orientated affairs, most notably the sequel itself, Aliens. Such an even balancing of contemporary horror and sci-fi was not really attempted again. Alien remains a brilliantly constructed work in a field of its own.",9,0,1,21 October 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," 'Wait and see'
","In the period immediately after the close of the Second World War, motion pictures that dealt directly with combat situations did not tend to do very well, especially with the veterans themselves. The subject matter was still too painful to face up to, not to mention the fact that any inaccuracies or falseness in tone would be grossly disrespectful. Even when dealing with post-war issues there was still a lot that could be got wrong in terms of credibility, respectfulness and relevance. With the Best Years of Our Lives they just went and got everything right.So how do you do go about casting three homecoming war vets at a time when virtually all your audience either was a recently returned vet or was related to one? Do you bring in dedicated professionals who pour everything into a role to totally become their characters? Or do you get familiar character players whom audiences will know and trust, and perhaps see a bit of themselves in? What we actually have is Fredric March, a well-meaning ham who hit his peak in the early years of the talkies, Dana Andrews, a leading man from a handful of genre-movies, but not what you'd call an impressive dramatic actor, and Harold Russell, a genuine disabled veteran with no previous acting experience. But all three turn in perfect performances, from Russell's wordless agonising and pent-up frustration to March's believable and endearing drunk act, and too many other highlights to mention.Why do these three very different performers all work equally well in this picture? Well, firstly they are all intelligent men, able to draw upon their experiences as well as to realise the seriousness of the subject matter. Secondly, these guys have been filmed in such as way as to show off their performances to the best and to make them fit into the story. This is the sort of thing director William Wyler was very good at, and I'm going to ramble on about it at length because it is fascinating but goes unnoticed by most viewers.Now, film convention says that if two characters are talking to one another, you either have the camera to one side, showing them both in profile, or you cut back and forth between them in opposing camera angles. In the opening scene there are a couple of shots where one of the protagonists is talking to someone behind a desk, but Wyler doesn't use either of the angles just mentioned. He just keeps the camera behind the desk, so regardless of which is talking we only see the face of the main character. This way we get to witness both the speech and the reaction of the protagonist, and we aren't distracted by having the face of someone who is little more than an extra brought to our attention. A more elaborate version of this comes when we briefly meet the character Woody Merrill (Victor Cutler), Theresa Wright's replacement date when she is trying to get Dana Andrews out of her head. While it would be difficult and look a bit odd to only show us the back of his head, Wyler is careful to make sure he is never too close to the camera, and that we always see him in profile, never square on. This stops us paying too much attention to him or seeing his emotions. It gives us no chance to sympathise or identify with him, and allows us to believe in the romance between Andrews and Wright.So this is how Wyler stops us getting distracted by the less important players – but how does he focus us on the more important ones? Again by breaking with cinematic convention. For example, moments such as kisses and embraces are 'supposed' to be shown in extreme close-up, but Wyler often shows these in long shot. This is because he knows sometimes it is more powerful to show peoples' body language than their facial expressions. Of course, Wyler does use close-ups, as well cutting between opposing angles when two characters are talking, but he uses these sparingly and only when absolutely needed. Whenever he is not using one of these techniques, he generally keeps the camera in one position without cuts, allowing the action to play out naturally. Thus when he does move in to one of these more dramatic angles, it has greater impact, and you really take notice and feel that something is going on.And that is more or less all there is to it. For a picture that is nigh on three hours long, there aren't very many characters and the action only really takes place over a few weeks. And yet it is never boring. In a way it's a bit like another wonderful feature from the same year, It's a Wonderful Life, in that it paints a picture of a world that is so believable and recognizable, and yet seems strangely idyllic, and more like we wish our world could be. I for one wish my world included a bar where I could chat about my problems to Hoagy Carmichael while he played piano. You see, it's a picture that spoke directly to audiences of its time, and can still speak directly to audiences of today.",10,4,4,5 November 2009
Closer," 'The pictures make the world seem beautiful'
","It's nice to see that, over three decades since the likes of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Sleuth, stageplays with minimal casts can still be made into workable movies. Closer, adapted by Patrick Marber from his own play, looks at the love lives of four professionals in early contemporary London. Set in amongst the bustle of the metropolis, yet brutal in its intense focus on the individuals involved.The director Mike Nichols made his debut with the aforementioned Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and as then he shows a rich lexicon of techniques to bring out the right aspect at the right moment. Every scene seems played for different effect. The photography scene in which Julia Roberts first appears is all about faces – well-lit, unobtrusive backgrounds and close-ups big enough to make us notice eye colour and twitching mouths. The sex chat scene shows Jude Law at first simply sat at his computer, then a little later we see wider shot with clothes strewn around a poky flat, giving us a clue as to his current living arrangements, before finally moving into mean close-ups, mostly played for comical effect. Not only does each scene have the necessary impact and perspective, each one is distinctly memorable in style and setting.When such a small cast carries the burden of the whole movie upon them, you need a very capable set of performers. Jude Law at first seems a little disappointing in his woodenness, although arguably it's right for his rather weak-willed and stilted character. Julia Roberts is muted but entirely convincing. Natalie Portman is overwhelmingly emotive, silently bearing her character's pains but also believably forceful towards the end. The best performance is perhaps that of Clive Owen. Not a particularly pleasant character that he plays, but Owen somehow manages to make him likable, and almost vulnerable in his slavery to his own libido.Being adapted from a minimalist stageplay, Closer makes an unconventional movie, but not a bad one. The long, dialogue-based scenes of the theatre remain intact, but the strength and individuality with which they are acted and directed prevents things from ever seeming boring or wordy. Closer is unusual for any narrative in that it rather confusingly leaps forward between scenes, sometimes across several years, without explicit notice. Once you've got the pattern however it becomes very easy to follow. The fact that it tends to tell the story through the eyes of the most despicable characters at their lowest moments forces viewers to consider their own actions rather than take the place of the victims. For all that it is about deception, it is painful in its emotional truth, which makes it fulfilling. It is dark but with a dark wit, which makes it bearable.",9,0,1,16 May 2012
Battleship Potemkin," Of Men and Maggots...
","Battleship Potemkin is by general consensus Eisenstein's masterpiece. Coming between the over-the-top action melodrama of Strike and the formalist documentary style of October, it's the most 'normal' looking of his silent films. Rather than being overly stylised it best demonstrates how the montage technique can be used in regular cinematic storytelling.Eisenstein here takes the editing techniques he perfected in his first film Strike, and uses them to greater effect in telling the story, creating tension and staging action. Whereas the action in Strike was almost relentless, Potemkin contains moments of stillness and calmness which act as a counterpoint to the more exciting situations, making them tenser and more effective. He stretches out time to an incredible extent, sometimes even splitting sentences over two title cards. He also slows things down to give certain scenes greater consideration. The section in which Vakulinchuk's body is brought to the pier and visited by Odessa citizens has a slow tranquillity to it, which gives it an air of sadness.When Battleship Potemkin does burst into moments of action, the direction is tighter than ever. Looking at the most famous sequence  The Odessa Steps massacre  the scenes of mass panic begin before we are actually shown what is causing them. If you watch closely, you can see how well directed the crowd scenes are. It's not just a hundred or so people dashing madly down the steps, there are also for example some people confusedly trying to cut across the crowd, implying Eisenstein directed the group at the level of individuals, and took real care composing each shot.On that note, although Eisenstein's silent cinema is characterless and based around the actions of masses of people rather, he still has respect for the individual, and often uses the action or experience of one person to hammer home a message. For example, the opening sequences with the sailors becoming tense and angry all builds up to that one man smashing a plate. Later in the Odessa harbour, shots of the crowd are intercut with close-ups of fists clenching. And of course although the Odessa Steps sequence involves hundreds of people, it's the individuals that we remember most  the mother and child, the woman with the pram, the man with no legs and so on. Eisenstein also makes the impact of the set pieces all the greater by introducing us to these 'characters' just prior to the massacre.Eisenstein's symbolism, which was rather heavy handed in Strike, is here much subtler and cleverer. It is also much more skilfully woven into the narrative. For example, when Vakulinchuk makes his first big speech, he is both literally and metaphorically waking up the other sailors. Later, the boiling soup is used as a metaphor for the sailors seething with rage. Even the title of the first part  the Men and the Maggots can be taken as a reference to the difference between the sailors ('real' men) and the despicable officers who command them.Eisenstein is also now a little more reserved in his use of artificial cinematic techniques, such as superimpositions and lens masking. These techniques were all over the place in Strike, but here they just crop up once or twice, giving them greater impact when they do appear. It also shows more confidence in his own direction  he doesn't have to rely on cinematic trickery to hold the audience's attention anymore.Eisenstein's silent pictures are arguably the most totally cinematic of their era. By taking the possibilities of the editing process to their extremes, he follows on from D.W. Griffith to further cut cinema free from its ties to theatre and literature, helping establish it as a unique storytelling form. As a result Eisenstein's other silent pictures sometimes suffer from too much style over substance. However, in Battleship Potemkin, he not only perfects the use of montage, but does so without compromising as much on the drama and storytelling, and that is why it's his best film.",10,1,1,6 March 2007
Taxi Driver," 'Morbid self-attention'
","This picture has been recognised as Scorcese's first masterpiece. It's not his first really great film  that would be Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (which I actually prefer to Taxi Driver)  but it's his first work as a really mature director. He'd shown talent before this, but there's just so much detail and control on display here.Taxi driver is a film about two worlds as seen by Travis  the low-down, dirty underworld and the clean, respectable, 'normal' world. Travis desperately wants to be part of the normal world but isn't equipped to break out of the low world. Scorcese's camera roves around in prowling point-of-view shots, to show us Travis' wandering mind. He makes great use of colour to create the two different worlds  grimy greys and greens for the low world, clean whites and reds for the high world. There are plenty of little details that add extra layers  for example the two guys arguing in the background during the opening scene.Scorcese is often thought of as a modern director, part of a new wave. But actually Scorcese and this new wave were extremely retrospective. In Taxi Driver you can see shades of Hitchcock in the way he puts the audience inside the character's state of mind. He is like Kurosawa in the way he tailors his shooting style for different moods  particularly that director's High and Low. The character of Travis and the seedy world he inhabits also occasionally reminds me of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom as well. In terms of style Taxi Driver could have been made by any of these, by this time, elderly directors. It's only really the frankness of the sex and violence that mark it as the work of a young director.Travis is the first of Scorcese's loser heroes. Like Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy, he does the 'wrong' thing to achieve his aims, but ends up succeeding anyway. This is the most modern thing about Taxi Driver  it's the very opposite of Hollywood's old code of 'no crime without punishment'.Like a lot of American cinema of this era, the Vietnam war casts its shadow over Taxi Driver. It's subtle  Travis is an ex-marine, and it's fairly clear his wartime experiences have contributed to his current state of mind. During the war there were plenty of heavy-handed allegorical films, and later there would be lots of heavy-handed films dealing with the war itself, but coming in between this is perhaps the harshest depiction of the Vietnam generation.So yes, Taxi Driver is expertly constructed in terms of its direction. It's also brilliantly acted and scored (perhaps Bernard Hermann's best score). It's extremely bleak and difficult to watch though. While it's possible to sympathise with and understand Travis the picture lacks the humanity of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Raging Bull or King of Comedy, and it's never really spoken to me as deeply as any of those films.",8,3,5,8 June 2007
Barry Lyndon," 'I'll duel him, if I have to follow him into the church'
","Barry Lyndon, if not one of Kubrick's most underrated pictures, is certainly his most unjustly overlooked by many of his fans. At first glance a period drama culled from a work of 19th century literature may seem completely at odds with the innovative and in-your-face look of Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange, but it is perhaps the most carefully considered work by a director at the top of his game.Apparently the source novel is one of its authors less well known works, but its structure and themes were perfectly suited to Kubrick. Kubrick's films can usually be seen as being made up of contrasting segments, and Barry Lyndon is in fact formally separated into Parts One and Two. Part one is the rise of Barry, Part two is his downfall. The two parts can be seen as mirror images of each other, and there is a sense of history repeating itself, particularly with the two main pistol duels. Barry's story begins with his duel with Captain Quinn. It ends with his duel with Lord Bullingdon. Both duels are between a young man and an old man. Both duels are (essentially) over a woman, and in both cases the younger man is a relative of that woman who has a somewhat inappropriate love for her, whereas the older man is or will be her legitimate husband.Kubrick further contrasts the two halves of the story. Part one is largely set outdoors, and all the most important scenes take place in the open air, signifying Barry is at first an outsider. This is in contrast to the luxurious interiors of Part two. The music changes throughout the picture from delicate folk airs, to pompous military marches to stately classical pieces. Kubrick goes to some pretty excessive lengths to add little subtle touches that signify the changes in Barry's position. For example, if you watch carefully in the first half, you'll notice that every time there is a candle-lit scene, the number of candles on the table increases by one each time.Of course, all these symbolic touches don't really add much to the story. What is the real key to Barry Lyndon's brilliance (and also the reason it isn't more popular) is its pacing. It is incredibly, indescribably slow. There is no abbreviation. Every little event, every encounter is played out at in full as it might really have happened. Establishing shots are held for so long that they almost become miniature scenes in themselves, and act to set up chapters in the story rather than the next scene. This is not simply a life story stripped down to the exciting bits, it really feels like a life story. Two things prevent the film from becoming mind-numbingly boring. Firstly, every shot is beautifully composed and lit, so if nothing else the film is nice to look at. Secondly is the way Kubrick handles the emotions.Emotion is nearly always understated in Kubrick's films. His characters tend to hide their emotions, and Kubrick rarely uses any cheap devices to make things too obvious. The emotions in Barry Lyndon are at their most understated. All the dialogue and conduct is highly formal and ritualised, in keeping with the period setting. But paradoxically the emotions are also constantly on display. Throughout these unbelievably long drawn out set pieces the characters are constantly betraying their innermost thoughts and feelings through subtle gestures, body language, tones of voice and facial expressions. Kubrick actually makes more use of close-ups than in any of his previous pictures, far subtler than what is generally called a reaction shot, but the characters are constantly reacting all the same. The world of Barry Lyndon is one in which the characters say one thing, yet think and feel another. When eventually we do get to see a very openly emotional scene – little Brian between his mother and father – the effect is incredibly powerful, like the floodgates have finally been opened.With all this considered the actors all do an amazing job, and the casting is perfect. Marisa Berenson is particularly good, keeping her face blank and expressionless, but showing very strong emotion just beneath the surface. There is a great supporting cast too, for example Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, who helps keep that slightly bizarre and silly feel that is in all Kubrick's pictures. This is not to mention Michael Horden's narration, which gives a spot-on tone of friendliness with a touch of sadness.Barry Lyndon is really a refreshing take on the period drama. All too often period films and historical epics simply duplicate the stuffy, formal manner of their source material. Barry Lyndon on the other hand transcends its literary roots and, while sticking to the language and story of the novel, shows a very genuine humanity in the characters. It never forgets that, no matter how much they are constrained by the conventions of the time and place, people still experience the same emotions. It's not the most entertaining of all Kubrick's films, but it is an amazing achievement nevertheless.",10,2,4,29 January 2007
Full Metal Jacket," 'We've got to try and keep our heads until this peace craze blows over'
","The major Vietnam anti-war films all took different approaches to the subject. Apocalypse Now cranked the war experience up into a surrealist nightmare. The Deer Hunter avoided dwelling on the conflict itself and instead focused on the psychological aftermath. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, made at a later time when the Vietnam was coming to be regarded as the previous generation's war, focuses on the transformation of men into soldiers.Like most of Kubrick's films, Full Metal Jacket is divided starkly into informal parts 1 and 2. Opening with shots of the recruits having their head shaved (their individuality literally being stripped away), part 1 looks at the training process. Kubrick emphasises the gruelling nature of this process with drab, Spartan sets, straight, symmetrical shot composition and scenes which are relentless and repetitive. It's the stronger half of the film  part 2 just isn't as tight, and despite it's being more varied some segments are just boring.Compared to other Vietnam pictures, Full Metal Jacket has a rather small-scale, cheap look to it. This was the price Kubrick paid for his artistic independence. Having said that, it's impressive that the whole thing was shot in England (aided by one use of footage) and it demonstrates how much an imaginative director and design department can do with limited means. Take, for example, an abandoned industrial estate (of which England has had plenty of since the 1980s), remove anything that gives the location away, graft in a few palm trees, slap on some genuine signs and murals  and you have an authentic looking Vietnam battleground.Full Metal Jacket isn't bad, but there are lots of things I don't like about it. Most of them are down to the screenplay. The dialogue isn't as smart as it thinks it is, full of philosophical pretensions and trite moralism. Kubrick makes some poor decisions as a director too. The over-the-top stylisation of Pyle's mental breakdown  brilliantly staged as it is  doesn't sit well with the realist, occasionally documentary approach used in the majority of the film. Later, in the combat scenes, he uses some really clichéd slow motion shots when people get shot. Peckinpah popularised that, and he's also one of the few directors who could get away with it. Here it just looks amateurish.This is yet another Kubrick film which all too often gets overrated because it is startling and different. It has its strengths (there is some great use of music, although even that is disappointing compared to Kubrick's sublime rhythmic direction on Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon) but overall it's one of my least favourite of his.",6,2,5,23 June 2007
The Grapes of Wrath," 'That's what makes it ours  living on it and dying on it'
","For the adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, the obvious choice for director was probably not John Ford, who was at that time best known for historical dramas. However, if the setting was not typical John Ford then its themes of family relationships, community spirit and social outcasts persevering in the face of all adversity certainly were. It was also a task which members of Ford's stock company of actors  Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and John Qualen  were more than suited to.Considering it is a contemporary drama shot in black-and-white, the images in Grapes of Wrath are startling, from the opening shot of a distant Henry Fonda approaching a crossroads to Jane Darwell's close-up monologue with which the films closes. The director of photography was Greg Toland, one of the best in the business at the time. Combined with Ford's effortless talent for shot composition the results are among the finest images in black-and-white cinema.Ford knows exactly when to edit and when to move the camera, usually for maximum emotional impact. In a scene where Ma Joad is burning some personal possessions in preparation to leave the farm, he cuts to a dirty mirror reflection of her. It's hard to explain how but it works perfectly. He also makes far more use of close-ups than is his norm, building up a greater level of intimacy and bringing the emotions to the fore. This occasionally makes the lengthy patches of dialogue seem a little corny, but this is often a problem with motion pictures adapted from novels which few directors have managed to get round successfully.John Carradine performs in what was probably the best role of his life as the preacher Casey. He's cast completely against type (he usually played sinister villains), but he makes the role his own, creating a character who appears simple on the surface, but is full of down-to-earth wisdom and humanity underneath. There's also a small yet memorable appearance from another Ford regular, John Qualen, who gives a spirited performance as the farmer Muley. In what are some of the best scenes in the film he vents his anger and frustration at being turfed off his land, eventually breaking down until he's nothing but a ghost of his former self.Despite Ford winning Best Director at the Academy Awards for Grapes of Wrath (one of only two Oscars it received), it's probably more a classic borne out of group effort than the vision of one man. For a start, the plot is sourced from a great novel, itself brilliantly adapted by Nunally Johnson. That is combined with a great cast of actors and of course Greg Toland's cinematography. Ford definitely felt more at home when making a western. Having said that, he was never someone to do a sloppy job, and I'm by no means suggesting his Oscar wasn't deserved, but that's not what makes this a memorable picture.",9,1,2,15 October 2006
The Godfather: Part II," 'It had nothing to do with business'
","In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.Being a drama, The Godfather Part II's biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brando's middle-aged Don in The Godfather. It's still only a small demonstration of De Niro's talents however.Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roth's wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as she's not a character we need to remember, he doesn't allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. It's intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying 'They're carving up Cuba – geddit?' But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And what's more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather – the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end – all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel.",7,15,27,31 July 2010
Fargo," 'Funny-lookin''
","In the 1990s the younger generation of independent filmmakers gained their prestige with some odd movies, movies that were both grim and noir-ish but with an almost nonchalant twist of comedy running through all the nastiness. This was the kind of picture in which the Brothers Coen specialised. Fargo is among their purest expressions of that type, a grisly thriller set in a snowbound Minnesota that, despite its inherent darkness, comes across as humane and affectionate.While the New Wave-influenced directors showed off an abundance of technique, the Coens and their generation have tended more towards minimalism. There's an elegant simplicity to their approach, with few camera moves or obvious artifice. That's not to say the Coens were directing on autopilot. The camera may not move but there's a lot of thought gone into those static shots. We see a beleaguered William H. Macy at his desk while cars rushing by on the freeway behind him seem to mirror his nervous jitters. In the opposing shot of the indignant couple, the array of statuettes makes it look as if the whole room's ganging up on him. It's a kind of meaningful shot composition that is actually rather witty. This triumph of the image over technicality allows the Coens to really bring out some detail. Many filmmakers may attach a camera to the front of a car for a bit of high-speed action, but in Fargo we have such a shot pointing down at the road surface in the headlights, picking out every little crack and grain. The Coens have really painted a world with palpable texture.But just as character seems to live in the very landscape of Fargo, it also lives in the actual characters, brought to vividness by a cast that's at just the right level of quirky. What's neat about Frances McDormand is that she is comical without actually doing a comedy performance. Other than a slightly strained accent, its all done in very genuine timings and expressions, which stops it slipping into farce and weaves it well with the movie's more unpleasant moments. William H. Macy is full of twitches and mannerisms, but he just manages to pull it inside the realms of believability. And Steve Buscemi too is straddling that delicate line on the edge of reality. In short, the people that inhabit the world of Fargo give us this impression of normality stretched to its limits, but normality all the same.Unlike your average thriller, Fargo is not exactly a tightly-constructed ride of suspense and excitement, but this doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and engrossing. Rather than seeming to have some grand theme or focused structure, it's as if the screenplay just grew organically out of a number of elements. Like many works by the Brothers Coen, Fargo is rich with the weirdness of America, with ominous statues of local heroes and checkout girls grinning vacantly like a taxi driver from Total Recall. Brilliantly offset by a doom-laden and very Nordic score from Carter Burwell as well as a sprinkling of familiar American hits, it scampers smoothly from one mood to the next. This isn't a big movie by any stretch, but it in its constant, delightful diversity, it seems to be part of some large and tangible world.",8,1,1,9 February 2012
The Aviator," 'A bad experience with a dog'
","The biographical movie is these days more able than ever to be frank about all kinds of madness and sordidness. In fact it's more than that. It's practically a prerequisite of the modern biopic that you present your subject as some kind of flawed genius. The trouble is, no matter how interesting the individual, an interesting movie is not a guarantee.The Aviator is directed by Martin Scorsese, whose love of antique cinema surely gave him some special interest in the project. However, I don't see what the idea was of making the early scenes mimic Howard Hughes's two-strip colour process. It doesn't have the authenticity to hark back to the real thing, no other lost classic techniques are resurrected to keep it company, and frankly it looks ugly. As usual Scorsese's showy, jumpy manner of filmmaking is a bit hit-and-miss. He's still great at capturing states of mind, albeit a bit heavy-handedly, but he is seriously short on 'wow' moments these days.The protagonist is portrayed by Scorcese's new favourite Leonardo DiCaprio. He's perfect as the young Hughes because he'll probably go on looking eighteen until he's fifty. Trouble is he still looks (and sounds) eighteen when he's playing the middle-aged Hughes. The acting however is first class, subtle yet forceful. The same unfortunately cannot be said of Cate Blanchett's terrible impersonation of Katherine Hepburn, which copies a few of Hepburn's speech patterns in a grotesque caricature. And she gets the accent wrong. No-one else really stands out as good or bad.In spite of the general mediocrity of the production, Hughes's life as presented here does offer up some great moments. A nice little montage of clips from Hell's Angels which makes it look even better than it probably is in reality. The occasional humour in an incredibly rich man who thinks he can get anything to happen by simply buying the experts. Our ability to actually route for Hughes when he comes back blazing and cleans up at the hearing after everyone had written him off as a nutter. The eventual poignancy as his condition resurfaces. However it's The Aviator's failure to weave this into some kind of grand narrative that makes it seem so plain overall.",6,1,2,6 June 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'It comes in pints'
","When it was released a decade ago, The Fellowship of the Ring was a massive hit with the both critics and the general movie-going public, two groups who generally ask for nothing more than a good yarn well told. However the reviews and box office figures did not quite reflect one crucial demographic – the geeks. There were a lot of people, die-hard fans of the Tolkien books, who went to see the movie purely to see how faithful it was to the book. And then they spent a lot of time complaining about how much it wasn't. This review is dedicated to those discerning folk.It's true, there are a lot of changes from the novel, but most of these stem from the fact that movies are not books, and they do things differently. One of the most notable (and most frequently complained about) omissions was the story of Tom Bombadil. But while Tom's tale was nice it's a diversion unrelated to the overall plot that a movie, designed to be enjoyed in one sitting, cannot really afford to make. All in all this is a cunning adaptation, brief compared to the book but faithful to its tone. Pippin and Merry's first appearance, setting off fireworks in a tent, is an invention for the screen, but it is a quick visual way of introducing them. The first encounter with the black riders is turned into a chase, just enough of an action peak that the movie needs at that point. Another clever idea is to make a kind of unofficial character out one of the orcs, which gives the showdown at the end of this movie a bit more a dramatic thrust.Stylistically this is very much a movie of its time. To see a 21st century action movie, you'd think a camera now only holds three feet of film. An edit comes every couple of seconds whether the scene demands it or not. Add to that some dizzying camera moves, and this is really not a good movie to watch if you have a headache or a hangover. This isn't to say director Peter Jackson doesn't have a good sense of timing with his technique. His greatest strength seems to be in creating creepy tension, notable examples being the black rider's horse sidling into view as the hobbits cower by the roadside, and the approach of the orcs in Moria. He pulls a neat trick in the final battle scene, at the key moment switching from the rapid action of the fight to still shots of Sean Bean with the melee raging around him. It gives a much more emotional impact to the turn of events than Tolkien's lofty account.A large part of the appeal of The Fellowship of the Ring and its sequels is the creation of a world for them to take place in. It was right of Jackson to actually take the production to the vast New Zealish wildernesses rather than just make do with a strip of backlot, frequently hitting us with the grand sense of uninhabited openness that is rarely seen outside of Westerns. The CGI (something I'm not normally of a fan of) comes into its own with the creation of caverns and castles packed with texture and detail that, like the landscapes, captures the imagination with their sheer scale. It's not all good though. Places like The Shire and Rivendell are beautiful to the point oftwee – sometimes even verging on Thomas Kincade levels of kitsch. Jackson and his design team were certainly far better at portraying evil.The problems facing the cast of this picture are similar to those of a historical epic. There is too much nobility and stolid dialogue to really bring much passion to the roles, and some of the players are more wooden than Treebeard (Orlando Bloom is the worst offender here). Best of the bunch is Ian McKellen, who really brings out the warmth in Gandalf, helping to make him the only human-seeming character in the whole piece. I also like the performances of Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan who bring some jocular naturalism to the parts of Pippin and Merry.If anything, the biggest problems with The Fellowship of the Ring are problems it has in common with the novel. Tolkien's work, well written though it is, does lack a certain humanity and emotional complexity - the constipated formality of the elves; the orcs, one-dimensional baddies (portrayed here of course with cockney accents); the rather tiresome presentation of the ring as some forbidden treat, the lack of developed female characters. I'm well aware that these are the very things that many people love about Lord of the Rings, but to me and many others it gives the work a rather distant and soulless feel. These flaws are largely carried over to the movie versions. However, the fact that Peter Jackson's adaptation has done some work to chip away at the stiffness of the novels, adding a hint of playfulness with some new dialogue, cutting out a lot of the stuffy proclamations, throwing in the occasional character reaction, is very much to the movie's credit. Yes, this version deviates from the books, but where it does so it improves.",7,0,0,26 March 2012
Cold Mountain," 'Having a thing, and the loss of it'
","American cinema was once very much enamoured of the Civil War. The silent era produced the world's first blockbuster with Birth of a Nation. Then the classic era gave us its crowning achievement in Gone with the Wind. But since then Civil War pictures have been few and far between. That period has to some extent fallen out of favour as a cultural touchstone, and there has of course been widespread condemnation of the overt racism of the former movie and the general of-its-timeness of the latter. Now, with a more realistic approach towards the horrors of conflict and oddly enough a British rather than American production, we finally have another great Civil War epic for our times in Cold Mountain.Adapted from the popular novel by Charles Frazier, Cold Mountain is an epic that is made vast through its succinct storytelling. The background to the romance between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman is communicated to us with pure images and mere fragments of dialogue. The characters and where they came from is rarely stated overtly, and it seems more natural that way, as if we're watching life pass by before us. In keeping with this director Anthony Minghella (who also adapted the screenplay) often keeps his camera high and distant, although he's not afraid to put us right within the action at times, allowing the liveliness of a character's performance to push the camera away or their calmness to draw it in. His wide-open shots show off the landscape at its finest (Romania often standing in for North Carolina, but this doesn't matter; it looks wonderful), showing off the changeless beauty which surrounds the misery and bloodshed.The cast of Cold Mountain gives us some fine examples of non-American actors playing Americans, not that you would know for how well Nicole Kidman and Jude Law master the dialect. That lilting Southern States accent rarely sounds very serious to an outsider, but Jude Law manages to bring a strong dignity to the part of Inman. Irishman Brendan Gleeson is excellent as always, and his authentic fiddle-playing is a bonus. Best of the bona fide Americans is Renee Zellwegger. She's massively theatrical, but she gives us just the sort of larger-than-life supporting character the movie needs. She plays the role with life and likability, and she is deep and genuine when it's needed too.Cold Mountain is, above all things, a powerful romance. There's a sweeping, Odyssey feel to Inman's journey, and a burning idealism to the love story that some might regard as old-fashioned despite the movie's modern take upon warfare. And funnily enough those earlier movies – Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind – weren't overly romantic tales. Cold Mountain is, in a way, more achingly human; a beautiful picture, full of the balance between great evil and great kindness. It's a worthy and far less flawed successor to those Civil War epics of past generations, and it's a real shame it never got quite the reception it deserved.",10,6,9,18 April 2012
North by Northwest," 'Tease a man to death'
","North by Northwest, among the best-known of all Hitchcock pictures, was in fact begun with the specific intention of creating (in the words of its writer Ernest Lehman) 'the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures'. And to this end it does seem to tour faithfully round all the familiar stops on the Hitchcockian trail – the falsely accused man, the espionage backdrop the exact details of which are not elucidated, the showdown on a famous monument, the dry wit and the sharp innuendo. This may make it the most archetypal, but does it make it the best? One thing that really stands out about North by Northwest is that it is one of Hich's more comedy-laced scripts. Or more accurately, the comedy is more tightly interwoven, rather than being kept as a standalone feature for certain scenes or characters. And while there are some good laughs here, such as Cary Grant's nonchalant wisecracking when he is first kidnapped (which really makes us warm to the character), it seems to be at the expense of the action. You see, although there are certainly a lot of speedy chases, narrow escapes and cunning getaways, not a single one of them is up to Hitch's best standard. The drunk-driving chase for example is more awkward than nailbiting. There is simply no material for Hitchcock to do some grand orchestration of suspense, like say the concert hall scene from The Man Who Knew Too Much or the finales of Rear Window and Psycho. All in all this wrong-manhunt seems more like a case of annoyance rather than something to inspire the old 'it-could-happen-to-you' fear factor.That is not to say there are not good things about North by Northwest. In fact there are plenty. Hitch's direction is on-the-ball as ever, with lots of set-ups where the characters are walking (or running) towards the camera, coupled with moving point-of-view shots, which places us somewhat forcibly within the action. This, coupled with a tight editing scheme, at least makes this 130-minute picture move at a considerable pace. Grant is perfectly suited to the resourceful but unassuming hero, and his laidback approach to comedy makes the most of the witty screenplay. It provides a great role for James Mason too, the suaveness and good looks that made him a desirable lead man in his youth now make him the perfect devilish villain in his middle age. Then there is the hard-hitting main theme by composer Bernard Hermann, the sparseness of which prefigures his stabbing strings for Psycho.However the fact remains that, while this may be very much the tailor-made Hitchcock classic, the finished product is more of a Hitchcock mediocrity. It lacks the sense of showmanship, the shock value and the spiralling tension that really made his finest pictures stand out.",6,3,9,23 December 2010
Doctor Zhivago," 'Brotherhood and fiddlesticks'
","When a creative team has a run of hits it is sensible for them to stick to a winning formula. Savvy as ever director David Lean and writer Robert Bolt, fresh from their success with Lawrence of Arabia, selected another story of individual experience against the backdrop of major world events. Or, if you prefer, major world events seen through the eyes of individuals. But with Doctor Zhivago they also committed one of the greatest sins of the successful – an over-confidence in their own abilities.Boris Pasternak's story is certainly one with an impressive scope, and a refreshingly intelligent take on the Russian revolution. Rather than coming down firmly on one side or the other, it makes quite clear that while life under the Bolsheviks was no picnic, the Tsarist regime that came before it was little better and needed doing away with. It seems likely that this mitigated, thought-provoking world-view was part of the attraction for those responsible for this adaptation. But Doctor Zhivago is drastically different to Lawrence of Arabia in that it is primarily a romance. Lean of course had done romance before, but Bolt hadn't, and this is where the success story begins to unravel. Bolt fails to create any chemistry between Lara and the title character – their affair simply happens, as if we were reading an entry in a history book. In particular the human story suffers because Lara is a passive, almost mute character. This may be partly the fault of Pasternak, but I am laying the blame with Bolt due to his record, which shows him to be unwilling – perhaps unable – to create strong female characters. In any case, the problem remains regardless of who is responsible.Fortunately the cast is a decent one who ought to be able to breathe flesh onto even the boniest of characters. Omar Sharif is good in the title role, bringing out the right note of humane sympathy, and certainly doing a creditable job of Zhivago's physical suffering in the latter half of the picture. Julie Christie is not bad but she is wrong for the part. She was – indeed is – a fine actress, but she was so resolutely a post-war middle-class English lass that if you took her away from that setting she looked out of place, and also why she is so naturally perfect in Darling, made the same year. Geraldine Chaplin, Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness all give solid and commendable performances, but by no means outstanding ones. Tom Courtney is a little stereotyped, but beneath the mask of austerity he does allow a few of Pasha's true emotions to stir beneath the surface. Rod Steiger gives one of his most natural performances, and yet is simultaneously at his most unnerving and unpredictable. Finally an honourable mention goes to an effortlessly volatile and engrossing turn from Klaus Kinski.So, a somewhat mixed bag so far, but at least the regular David Lean technical crew are still on board from the last picture. The Freddie Young cinematography gives us some glorious landscapes, and the gorgeous Maurice Jarre score is as ever in tune with Lean's imagery, shifting and flowing with each visual nuance. Yes, this is an abundantly professional production. It seems however the decisive blow to Doctor Zhivago's overall effectiveness is dealt by Lean himself. Perhaps it was notions of artistry going to his head, and perhaps he had been too long away from the intimate drama, but he seems to be caught up in image and symbolism. The strict colour scheme of black, white and red, with yellow representing Lara, is so meticulous and invariable it looks forced. Then there are little touches like the sparking of the tram cable during Sharif and Christie's first meeting, ironic in itself since there is no 'spark' between them on screen. Few will notice these touches to be either impressed or distracted by them, but they do show how Lean's focus has shifted from the genuine to the metaphorical. He really seems to believe that a few pretty pictures of flowers can take the place of an actual demonstration of feelings between characters.Of course, Doctor Zhivago is not a total disaster – the box office figures alone confirm that, and there is much here to enthral and entertain. But it does have some major flaws, and these are the flaws of the main creative minds behind the picture – David Lean and Robert Bolt. The same problems would recur, only far more drastically, in the critical and commercial mess that is Ryan's Daughter, and Doctor Zhivago represents for them the beginning of the end.",6,0,2,30 June 2010
The Shining," 'A tremendous sense of Isolation'
","After his greatest achievement in the sumptuous period drama Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick moved on to make his statement on the horror genre. A massive shift in focus, but perhaps not such a surprise since there were elements of horror in 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.Kubrick's greatest strength is probably in that he always followed his own muse, regardless of what was going on in cinema at any one time. Of course, he was sometimes influenced by his contemporaries, but he never followed a trend. The Shining is at once bold and innovative, yet also nostalgic and old-fashioned. In a way this mimics the story's theme of history repeating itself and the overlapping of past and present events Â– a typically Kubrick-esquire mixing of style and content.The atmosphere of The Shining is created through use of space and place. Kubrick shows us two kinds of space at the Overlook Hotel. There are vast, empty spaces such as the grand hall and the gold room, generally revealed to us in slow zooms. Jack is more often shown in these rooms, and they represent his growing isolation from his family and his detachment from reality. Then there are the winding passages like the corridors and the maze, which Kubrick's camera explores with steady tracking shots. More often than not it is Wendy and Tommy whom the camera follows through these passages, and this gives us the sense of confinement and helplessness of their situation.In terms of place, The Shining is in a way a Heart-of-Darkness style journey into hostile territory. The opening credit sequence tells us this right at the start, as we see Jack's car travelling higher and higher into the mountains, a tiny dot from the helicopter shot. The Overlook Hotel resembles its mountainous surroundings, both in shape and colour. Kubrick's construction of space and place combine to create the nightmare situation Â– a place which is in itself massive and spacious, but which is also a prison, cut off from the outside world.Kubrick is perhaps best known for bucking trends, and rejecting by-the-book approaches, and The Shining does go against the horror grain in several respects. Perhaps most notable is the light. Whereas virtually every horror film prior to this had exploited the darkness, The Shining (as its title suggests) is filled with light and brightness. It's also something of a return to the early days of horror, largely favouring creepy atmospherics over slasher shocks. In fact, there is a very direct and obvious reference to DW Griffith's Broken Blossoms (not actually a horror, but it's still got the axe moment) and even Shelley Duvall's performance towards the end slips into wonderful Lillian Gish-style melodramatics.The Shining is tightly constructed, and it certainly stands out from its contemporaries in the genre, but like many of Kubrick's films it is seriously overrated. For all its supposed sophistication some of the horror moments are terribly camp and corny Â– for example the old woman in the bathtub does the most ridiculous zombie lurch I've seen outside of B-horror. Those quick zooms and that snare thing on the soundtrack that accompany every shock moment are massively overused and soon become tedious. For my money the supernatural horror elements do not really work Â– he just doesn't get the creepiness right. It's only the real-life, psycho-killer aspects that have any impact here, and this is mainly down to the intensity of the acting performances. I'm risking flak by saying this, but maybe the film would have been better if Kubrick left out all the ghosts and just told a story about a man's journey into murderous insanity.",8,5,8,25 March 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'Come with me if you want to live'
","James Cameron wrote and directed some of the best action movies of the 80s, and in 1991 it seems he tried to fashion the ultimate action movie for the new decade. Terminator 2 draws together all the traditions of its predecessors for calculated effect.Like the original 1984 movie, Terminator 2 has a plot that is holier than the pope's colander, with numerous contradictions and logical fallacies. Fans of the series have long argued over the plot holes and even theorised back-stories to explain them away. They are missing the point. Terminator 2's prime directive is to thrill and entertain, and the plot is a servant to this purpose. Does it, for example, seem remotely likely that John and Arnie and the T1000 would converge on the mental hospital not only at the same time as each other, but also at the exact point that Sarah Connor made her escape after years of incarceration? Of course it doesn't – but it makes for an exciting sequence in the movie. That's not to say the plot is dispensable. Even if it doesn't make technical sense, the motivations and development of characters must follow some kind of pattern. We need to accept Arnie as sympathetic, not scary as he was in the first movie. The fact that the first thing he does when he arrives in the present is beat up a load of cocky bikers endears us to him immediately.James Cameron's direction is geared towards a continuous movement and activity. When we first see Linda Hamilton, he has the camera swoop in on the mental hospital, then cuts straight into a moving shot panning from the window over to her. It's more dynamic than a simple establishing shot followed by a cut to an interior, and it helps keep up that tense rhythm and show off her character as someone to be reckoned with. Often cars and other vehicles will drive straight into shot, sliding across the foreground to fill the frame, really making the audience feel involved in – or rather, jolted by – the action. There's some CGI of course, something I don't normally approve of, but the CGI here is neat because it stays within its own limitations. The main subject of computer animation is those liquid metal goo, and smooth blobs were about the only thing CGI could do convincingly back then. Having said that, the technical flawlessness of Terminator 2 is still not a patch on the rickety low-budget charm of the 1984 picture.Speaking of things staying within their limitations, Terminator 2 sees the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing the only role he could ever do convincingly – a robotic killing machine. As usual the awkward woodenness comes completely naturally. I wonder if he ever realised the irony of this? Robert Patrick makes a great contrast to the muscular Arnie; a lean, wiry frame like a metal spring, and a believable portrayal of a mechanical mind. Linda Hamilton is a little better than she was in the first movie, and certainly convinces as the tough cookie. By and large though the casting here is more about looks and body types than actual talent. This is not a movie that demands such depth.Or is it? There is another strand running through Terminator 2 that was not present in the first picture, and that is its humanist streak. From the very opening moments – scenes of children in a playground – we are shown what is at stake. Something deeper is added to the simple people v. machines set-up by showing the robot being taught about humanity and acquiring emotion. It is ostensibly just the stuff of subplot, and yet by giving us something to believe in, by giving reason and sympathy to the heroes, it makes all the frenetic action worthwhile. It is this angle which really brings the movie to life.",8,0,0,5 December 2011
Duck Soup," 'Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?'
","Talking pictures may have scored a total victory over their silent predecessors, but in the field of comedy the silent style died hard, and slapstick remained a staple of comic cinema well into the 30s. The Marx Brothers in a way rescued the more anarchic form of comedy for the talkies with their wild and nonsensical verbal humour, but they also had enough physicality that they went a great way to preserving slapstick for the sound era. Duck Soup is their most perfect movie, and incidentally also the one which features the most visual humour.The Marx Brothers, even when they were not doing slapstick, had a style that very much harked back to the silent comics. If you look at Chaplin's short pictures, he would normally choose a familiar setting, people it with 'straight' but somewhat preposterous characters, then bring on his little tramp to wreak havoc. And this is pretty much what Groucho and Co. do in their first five features at Paramount. Duck Soup begins with an extremely pompous and formal set-up, into which Groucho and Chico come blabbering their disrespectful turns-of-phrase, and Harpo gleefully wrecks all and sundry, to the complete consternation of the overblown figures around them. Regular co-star Margaret Dumont is perfect for this, because she is not a funny character in her own right, but she is a slightly exaggerated version of a stock dramatic figure, and this is enough for the brothers to bounce their comedy off her. Louis Calhern is just right here too, because he is a straight man, but one with prickable pomposity as opposed to dramatic intensity. I am at present undecided as to the importance of Zeppo Marx as the straight foil, but in any case his role in this his last film appearance is fairly negligible, and the picture doesn't suffer for that fact. Duck Soup is directed by Leo McCarey, himself a veteran of silent comedy and a student of the Hal Roach studios. McCarey was not a writer for Duck Soup, but nonetheless some of the physical comedy routines and the general bent towards slapstick do bear his stamp. An especially good example is the hat-swapping routine with Harpo, Chico and Edgar Kennedy, a very simple piece that becomes increasingly funny simply because it is stretched out a ridiculous tit-for-tat conflict. Remember it was McCarey who first suggested Laurel and Hardy team up as a permanent duo, and for Duck Soup Harpo and Chico form a distinctly Laurel and Hardy-flavoured dynamic, with Harpo as the chirpy fool and Chico his long-suffering (but no less incompetent) superior. Unlike the talkie scenes, for which McCarey emphasises the snappy pace with frequent angle changes, the physical comedy is mostly shot in long, unbroken takes, allowing the routines to build up undisturbed and proving really just how good the brothers were at it.But there is something else which makes Duck Soup very brilliant. In an age where satire was not common currency at the pictures, this is a surprisingly bold indictment of war. The setting is a fictional Ruritanian kingdom (a fact that in itself makes this feel like a take-off on all those urbane European comedies that Ernst Lubitsch was making in the same studio), complete with grand halls, aristocratic titles and lots of silly uniforms, and Rufus T. Firefly's militaristic takeover nods towards the fascist governments that were springing up all over Europe at the time. And yet there are hints too at the follies of American militarism, with various patriotic marches woven into the musical score. Of course, the satire is never exactly biting and it certainly doesn't have that poignant quality that is present in even the wildest of wartime comedies (such as Dr Strangelove or Life is Beautiful), but it works on the level of being a big raspberry to the seriousness with which war takes itself.Duck Soup is the absolute pinnacle of the Marx Brothers canon. Their subsequent pictures at MGM were rather more serious and plot driven affairs, which would basically detract from what the brothers were really all about. But despite their previous successes, Duck Soup was not quite as popular with audiences as had been the likes of Monkey Business and Horse Feathers. It does lack the variety show format of the earlier movies, and much as I love it I do find myself missing Harpo's harping and Chico's piano. The 1930s were the era of the formula franchise movie, and the consternation of waiting for things you've come to expect can make a good picture seem tedious. However, enjoyed purely for what it is, Duck Soup sees those wonderful Marx Brothers at their funniest, tightest and most intelligent, and in retrospect can be seen as cinema's first really effective blending of slapstick with spoken-word humour.",9,0,1,6 June 2011
Apocalypse Now," 'Better than Disneyland'
","There were a lot of movies made about the Vietnam war in the fifteen years or so following its end. They varied considerably in their approach, but one thing they all had in common was an attempt to understand and come to terms with what was surely the most unpopular and widely condemned war of the 20th century. Apocalypse Now tries to explain the war in abstract terms, as part calculated slaughter and part incompetent chaos, part Mad Max and part Lord of the Flies, and presents its story in the form of a surreal, operatic nightmare.Although Apocalypse Now's in-the-field production notoriously became an almighty cinematic endeavour, at its heart is a classy screenplay by John Milius and Francis Ford Coppola that has two totally perfect aspects to it. The first is its perfect pacing, designed for a tense and exciting and carefully controlled build-up to a finale. The first half hour or so deals with a no-holds-barred depiction of the brutal realities of warfare. From here on situations become increasingly bizarre and removed from reality – a descent into a surrealist maelstrom. The little revelations about Colonel Kurtz's past are interspersed throughout the picture, feeding us this fascinating man's story one titbit at a time. The second aspect is its perfect dialogue, most of which was presumably provided by Milius, the acknowledged master of such. Milius has the true touch of the poet, creating dialogue that, with just a few teasing words, conjures up images more vivid than a whole paragraph of description - 'Every minute Charlie squats in the bushes'; 'He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam'; 'I realised, like I was shot with a diamond bullet'. Notice the unusual choice of words that just makes a sentence that little bit more characteristic. For example, instead of 'the walls moved in a little closer', we get 'the walls moved in a little tighter'. Unconventional, a little less logical, but far more evocative.As a director Francis Ford Coppola has the difficult task of giving the movie its strange and stylised tone without making it too obviously 'filmmaker-ish'. There is a clear attempt here to maximise the viewer's sense of immersion by avoiding any reminders of cinematic artifice, right down to dispensing with end credits. However in order to give the picture the rhythmic, dreamlike quality it requires there are occasional odd manoeuvres, such as panning over to the white curtain at the end of the briefing scene, but this sort of thing is never obtrusive because the stylisation of Apocalypse Now is all of a piece. Camera movement is slow, smooth and repetitive, with frequent use of horizontal tracking shots such as the one with which the picture opens. What's more, a lot of the odd look of Apocalypse Now is within the scene, not in what the camera does. The early scenes like the massacre at the village are filled with surreal but plausible images such as the coloured smoke bombs or a cow being airlifted. Towards the end of the movie, characters' movements become eerie and dance-like, the lighting becomes more stark and the sound design more ominous. A lot of the credit also goes to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and editor Walter Murch for completing the finished look.But there is a problem in Apocalypse Now's precision and stylisation. The build-up to the crew's arrival at Kurtz's compound is so effective, so promising, that the actual finale becomes a bit of a letdown. And by this point, the creeping weirdness of the picture is verging on the tedious. And while Marlon Brando's Kurtz is an awesome presence worthy of the character, Dennis Hopper's annoyingly hammy and formulaic madman act is too little too late. The lack of a sympathetic protagonist also makes for somewhat unrewarding viewing. Apocalypse Now is a grandly ambitious movie, a noble envisaging of the Vietnam war as a hallucinatory horror, but in its perfection of style it lacks a little heart and soul.",8,0,1,14 February 2011
Edward Scissorhands," 'Sometimes you can still catch me dancing'
","Stories get reused all the time. Whether consciously or unconsciously, movies will reference or reshape far older narratives. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the best writers do not so much steal ideas as respectfully blend or rework them, often to rekindle the thoughts and emotions of the previous generation around the preoccupations of the present one. As the filmmakers of the modern era became ever more retrospective, such movies became more common.Edward Scissorhands is scripted by Caroline Thompson from ideas by director Tim Burton. As has often been commented, it has a fair amount in common with Frankenstein (more the 1931 James Whale/Boris Karloff picture than Mary Shelley's novel - the narrative influences are strictly movieland). But it takes even more from the lesser-known story Being There, brought to film in 1979 with Peter Sellers, about a man (possibly autistic) who has been brought up in one house, seeing the outside world for the first time and being mistaken for a genius. Thompson and Burton channel these influences but give the whole thing the qualities of a modern day fairy tale – a fable about surviving society as a misunderstood outcast. The titular scissorhands – probably the most unique thing about the story – are the literal extensions of a person who cannot get close to anyone without unwittingly doing harm.Just as the screenplay borrows from here and there, so too does Burton take cues from his cinematic forebears in the look of Edward Scissorhands. There are some clear nods to the weird, Gothic style of German Expressionism, but also contemporaries of his like Roman Polanski, Terry Gilliam and Paul Verhoeven, directors who have specialised in taking the real world (or something like it) and making it look baroque and alien. Burton was always more an artist than a technician. His designs for the picture and the way he frames them with the camera create a small town that is both familiar but eerily strange. There aren't too many connections to reality – no visible place names or brands. The houses, cars and clothing look normal apart from the abundance of tawdry, cartoonish shades. This is not mere stylisation – it is of utmost importance for the whole thing to work. The world Burton presents is just weird enough for us to believe the inhabitants wouldn't bat an eyelid at the huge Gothic mansion looming over of the town or think a man with scissors for hands was anything more than a subject for neighbourhood gossip. The snow-covered 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning of the movie is all part of the plan. We can't be distracted by the gold and fanfare of the usual logo; we must have total immersion.The disparate influences of Edward Scissorhands extend to the performances. Lead man Johnny Depp studied the work of Charlie Chaplin in preparation for the role, something I guessed at even before I read about it. There is something very Chaplinesque in his shuffling walk and the way he innocently investigates his environment – a wordless expression of personality that is very endearing. But the best bits of Depp's performance happen on his face. He runs a gamut of emotions, filtered through this incredibly stilted exterior, from that nervous smile we see when he rides in Diane Wiest's car to the quiet anger he shows towards Anthony Michael Hall. Other than Depp, there's an excellently deadpan turn from Alan Arkin which provides a lot of the humour. The most honourable mention however must go to Vincent Price, whose appearance is brief yet has an added layer of poignancy with knowledge of the elderly actor's long and distinguished career as a patriarch of Hollywood horror.Edward Scissorhands is a movie so contemporary in its style, and yet so dependent on the influence of the past. The whole tapestry is new but every strand with which it has been woven has been seen before. And yet it has all done been done with such precision and above all such appropriateness, that even when its derivations become obvious, they only serve to deepen the power and clarify the meaning of the picture. After all, a good movie is the sum of its parts.",10,1,2,4 December 2011
Cross of Iron," 'Talent, sensitivity and character'
","The 70s were a strange time for the war movie, especially those dealing with World War Two. We were by now a generation past the conflict itself, and really cinema could use this giant wound in twentieth century history to say whatever it wanted. And since the anti-war movie was now en vogue (despite not being timely in any specific sense) a humane story about a platoon of disillusioned Germans amid the chaos of defeat could work as well as any other.Cross of Iron was adapted from a German novel, with a screenplay by Julius Epstein of all people. But why not Epstein? After all Casablanca dealt with the war from a similarly oblique angle. You could even draw a line between Casablanca's Rick and Cross of Iron's Steiner, but let's not get carried away. Cross of Iron is a meditative and touching work, with a beautiful optimist streak amid the deluge of despair. And yet it refuses to get bogged down in philosophy, and does not shy away from a realistic amount of action.The assignment of Peckinpah to the material, while it seems natural in retrospect, was perhaps not the most obvious. Peckinpah was certainly not a great dramatic director. However, his handling of action sequences plays a major role in the impact of this picture. For once, his typically poetic scenes of violence are not exciting – they are too chaotic and disjointed for that – but they are startling nonetheless. Shots are arranged to correlate separate events – David Warner does a nazi salute, a shell explodes outside, a picture of Hitler falls off the wall – evoking the situation in a direct and captivating manner.Of course Peckinpah's rapid editing schemes mean there is little room for development within the frame, but he nevertheless does take care over the focus and meaning in his images. In fact, the precision of the fleeting shot is often more crucial than that of the lengthy one. Thus Peckinpah quickly establishes mood with an insert of James Coburn backed by wafting mists when he first sets eyes on the Russian boy. A pair of beams is crossed above Keppler's head to highlight his stark expression when he is bullied into betraying Triebig. Throughout, the clarity of Peckinpah's images enables him to rush all that information through in a lightning fast series of cuts.And in these brief flashes we get to see some stirring acting performances – acting that is at odds with the cutting, being slow and moody. James Coburn was now becoming the archetypal world-weary, reluctant authority figure, and here his tarnished emotional core is at its most perfectly understated. His greatest moment is that ghost of a smile, rolling across his face like an involuntary twitch, that he gives when the Russian boy gives him the harmonica. The next best performances belong to some of the lesser-known German players. Klaus Löwitsch and Arthur Brauss in particular giving us some very real and likable characters.English-speaking European co-productions like this one tend to be a bit messy, mostly down to the disparate forces working on them (the oddest thing which I haven't yet mentioned is that Cross of Iron's producers were all in the porn industry) as well as the bad mix of low budgets and lofty ideals that tends to be behind these projects. However Cross of Iron is, probably more by accident than design, a very apt and fruitful meeting of creative minds – a lovely, tonal work of beautiful melancholy.",10,3,5,20 August 2010
Aliens," 'Game over man'
","The 80s were really the first era where video games began to influence the look and above all the experience of movies. This trend arguably began with Star Wars in 1977, although barring some flight sequences near the end the possible link is more about the Computer-generated imagery rather than a game-playing experience. But a decade later, just as virtual reality was starting to become a really exciting concept in both science fiction and modern technology, the idea of an action movie being a primarily first person experience was, well not born as such (the idea was hardly new), but certainly enjoyed a surge that made the 80s a golden age for the genre. Aliens features no CGI, just a fabulous mix of prosthetics, miniatures and animatronics, but it captures much of the pace and passion of the video game age.Director James Cameron puts a real emphasis on closeness, putting the camera right within the melee. When the marines tool up and jog off to the shuttle, the camera tracks along with them as it were one amongst them. Later we see a scene of chaos and carnage through video monitors from the soldiers' personal cameras. Throughout the picture there's continual movement, from which Cameron's remarkable ability to make not very much look exciting and suspenseful. It's all about careful control of the pace. After the marines touch down on the moon, there's a period of inexorable slowness during which Cameron is able to stave off the action scenes for a surprisingly long time, knowing the audience will be enjoying the suspense. And when the actions sequences come, they are no disappointment, a breakneck mix fear and exhilaration.James Cameron is a rarity among directors, especially in the field of action blockbusters, in that he writes most of the screenplays for his movies, unaided. As such there's always a very tight co-ordination between how characters come alive both visually and verbally. In the scene where everyone is revived for the mission, Cameron has a short amount of time to introduce a half-dozen or so marines. He gives each one a brief close-up and a line or two of memorable dialogue that nails down their personality, or perhaps some little mannerism like Apone putting a cigar in his mouth before he's even sat up. Any more would break the punchy flow of the movie, any less and it would be a bunch of grunts getting picked off with no connection to us. Despite his brevity, Cameron is very precise in his character introductions. Take for example the scene where we see Newt's family investigating the crash site (only in the special edition, I believe). Cameron employs a careful choice of angles and lighting to make sure that it is Newt's face that stands out more than the others, even though she is a passive character at this point.Cameron's dedication to his characters is matched by fine performances from the cast. Sigourney Weaver really runs the gamut, from her anger towards the company in the early scenes, through her steely determination before the enemy, to her maternal tenderness towards Newt. What is most impressive about her performance is that she is able to convince us throughout all these shifts in tone – her touching motherliness in no way diminishes our belief in her as a formidable heroine. The bunch of actors playing the marines give some distinctive performances. Given that the dialogue Cameron gives them is very sparse, they all have such narrow windows in which to make an impression. I'm especially impressed by Lance Henriksen, who gives a brilliant interpretation of the android character, mostly deadpan but with the occasional flicker of true emotion.And all this is important because Aliens is ultimately a very emotional movie. There are some really beautiful story arcs here – Ripley learning to trust an android, redeeming herself after being castigated by The Company and belittled by the marines, and finally regaining a daughter (this is one of the reasons why the special edition is really essential, because it establishes all these arcs properly). And this is really one way that Aliens is very much not like a typical video game, which is unlikely to include any such humanity and poignancy. Aliens stands as not just the perfect audience-involving action movie, but a powerful example of this pure storytelling medium.",10,1,2,14 November 2011
Gandhi," 'A weakness for these spiritually-inclined men'
","Through Lawrence of Arabia and beyond, there has become an established method for doing an epic screen biography of a major historical figure. Starting with the subject's death, and a nod to their iconic status, these pictures would then bring the audience to the beginning of the story, revealing what shaped the person and who they really were, balancing the historical with the personal. As it happens, the producers of Lawrence of Arabia had at one point intended to do the story of Gandhi, but decided against it because they felt his lifetime was then too recent. It was two decades later before this almost deified man got the humanizing treatment of a modern biopic.By this time, historical authenticity was more highly prized than ever before, and it seems the main goal of casting was getting people who could portray their real-world counterparts faithfully. The then-unknown Ben Kingsley was at least partly chosen because he looks remarkably like the real Gandhi. But much more than that, he is able to convincingly show us the different faces of the Mahatma down the years, from the naïve yet principled lawyer to the aged, mystical folk leader. Kingsley also does the uncanny balancing act of portraying Gandhi as calm and humble, yet with an incredible commanding presence, as best demonstrated in his speech to the pro-independence crowd in the marquee. But the greatest moments in Kingsley's performance are those small and very normal touches that are so revealing of character, tapping his thumbs against the prison bars or turning a slap on his grandniece's head into an affectionate pat.This was a long-cherished project of director Richard Attenborough. Attenborough, never exceptional behind the camera, puts most of his efforts into creating the places in which the story takes place, arranging phenomenal numbers of extras to build a thriving, realistic world. What he then does with is to take the role of a photojournalist, selecting from this world the most apt views, often drawing our attention to some comparatively small element, such as the zoom in on a woman cradling her child during Gandhi's return to India. Other times, just like the Candice Bergen character's asking the soldier to come forward as Gandhi descends the prison steps, he will stage the ideal tableaux to give meaning to the moment. For example, the march scene in South Africa ends with a solitary cavalryman leading his horse away amid a cloud of dust. It's the perfect image to conclude the sequence.The screenplay by John Briley presents all the major events in Gandhi's political life, as well as including enough scenes to build up a more intimate portrait, all with incredible succinctness. The whole thing is constructed with a quick, punchy pace, often jumping into the middle of the next piece action, giving both impact and moving the story forward with minimal fuss or repetition. And yet, one of the problems of this picture is its repetition. The impression we get is that the various episodes of Gandhi's life were all very much alike. And as much as the personal life of the man is revealed, and even with the intense reality of Kingsley's performance, there is something lacking in the fullness of the portrayal of Gandhi here. Perhaps Briley and Attenborough were reluctant to reveal some of the man's more negative attitudes and attributes (and there certainly were a fair few of those). This Gandhi biopic, majestic and finely-crafted as it is, is effectively a hagiography, too afraid of criticism or equivocation. As such, it is ultimately a slightly bland portrait of a fascinating human being.",Null,0,1,2 November 2011
Duck You Sucker," 'My country is me and my family'
","This was a picture Sergio Leone never intended to make  he began as producer, but to cut a long story short got roped into directing it. In spite of this, coupled with the fact that he was getting seriously fed up with the western genre, Duck You Sucker is perhaps Leone's most personal picture. He turned it from being yet another Zapata western (see Quien Sabe?, Il Mercenario and Companeros) into a statement against the genre.The intended message of Duck You Sucker is, in short, an even-handed condemnation of the left and the right, the moral of the story being that it's best not to get involved, and that the home and the family are what matters most. A rather dubious philosophy when taken to such extremes, but a real tonic when you look at how preachy some of those Zapata westerns were. Personally though, I'm more drawn in by the delicate humanism that was maturing with Leone's work. There were occasional emotional moments in his earlier films, but now Leone is really giving them time and complexity. Take for example the scene where Juan and John discuss the realities of the revolution at the camp  you can really believe in these characters.Like his final film, Once Upon a Time in America, this one can be seen as almost being a love story between two men. Not in a literal sense of course  it's not homo-erotic  but in the way it's structured. Juan and John are opposites thrown together by fate, are antagonistic towards each other at first, but somehow a bond develops between them and they become inseparable. There's also the back story with Sean (the other man in the Ireland flashbacks), with whom John obviously had a similar relationship.As far as his technical style goes, this is actually one of Leone's most perfectly constructed films. The editing is all spot on, and incredibly rhythmic. Although it's a lot subtler than in the dollars westerns, watch closely and you'll see he still choreographs the opening credits in time with music. Duck You Sucker is one of the best examples of what Michael Powell calls a 'composed film'  that is, one in which every aspect of the image  movement, editing and even the colours and arrangement of objects and people  responds to the music are the collage of sounds. Powell himself was one of the best directors of composed films, Robert Wise was another, and so was Leone.A brilliant example of this compositional style, and one of my favourite moments in all cinema is when Juan realises John's potential as a dynamiter, and the Mesa Verde bank logo appears above his head, just as Morricone's music references Bach's Toccata. A lot of people really hate that bit. Yes, it's completely over-the-top, almost cartoonish, but this is really Leone saying 'Hey, this is cinema, we don't need rules!' Having said that, there is one sequence along these lines which I dislike, and that is when the bourgeois travellers are demonising the peasants whilst stuffing their faces, and we see all these close-ups of their mouths and hear the same words repeated over and over. It's such an obvious, boring device, and not really very effective.A big weakness with Duck You Sucker is that, being caught between the old and new Leone styles, sometimes it doesn't really know what sort of film it wants to be. Leone's westerns, for better or for worse, stuck to the formula of a hero and a villain pitted against each other from the start, destined to meet in a final showdown. As his films progressed he concentrated more on social drama and character development, and Duck You Sucker certainly continues this trend. However, it is still tied to the old tradition and consequently has a few token villains  but the nazi-like army officer Ruiz and the governor whose face is on all the posters while they are necessary background figures, don't really belong as characters. The drama in Duck You Sucker is fully formed  Leone had fully developed the humanistic element in his films by now  but at the expense of making the action elements feel tacked on. Also despite the picture being in part a statement against political violence, the action scenes are still done in an exciting, heroic fashion.An awkward Leone picture to pigeon hole, but still a very enjoyable one. It's the closest he came to making a 'message' film, even if it is the ultimate political anti-statement. It has its flaws, but it looks great, and has a brilliant pace to it. Both Rod Steiger and James Coburn have been criticised in the lead roles, but I think they're both perfectly cast. Considering the circumstances in which it came about, Duck You Sucker isn't half bad.",9,4,7,16 July 2007
The Dirty Dozen," 'Playing war games'
","The war movie was in constant evolution in the decades following the worldwide conflict which most of them drew on for source material. We went from respectful recreations in the immediate aftermath, to the use of war as a backdrop for fictional stories (e.g. From Here to Eternity, Bridge on the River Kwai), at which point tentative anti-military themes began to creep in. But while previous anti-war pictures may have been tragic, ironic and harrowing, The Dirty Dozen revitalised the subgenre by showing war as bloody, brutal and nihilistic.A few years after this a man called Sam Peckinpah would become a byword for screen violence. Peckinpah, by the sheer poetry of his images, inadvertently glamorised the very carnage he sought to condemn. However Robert Aldrich, who directs The Dirty Dozen, takes a slightly more detached view. Sure, Aldrich knows how to make dynamic and exciting combat scenes, shooting series of increasingly frenzied images for the editor (honourable mention to the very talented Michael Luciano) to patch together. However, he takes care never to let us get swept along with the killing. There are scarcely any point-of-view shots, and indeed many of the camera set-ups throughout the picture are from positions where no character could be – up on high or peeping through bits of foreground clutter. These were always typical of Aldrich, but here his use of distant 'god' shots is more abundant than ever. The sense of aloofness this creates means that, while the action is great to watch, it never quite makes us want to pick up a gun and get stuck in ourselves.That is not to say Aldrich is completely cold and detached. He frequently finds room for intensely personal close-ups, showing the humanity of the men and thus drawing out an important strand in the story. Although he was only a writer on a handful of projects, Aldrich always sought to demonstrate his ruggedly affectionate side through his imagery, in even his most macho and ostensibly emotionless pictures. And when at one point he makes a visual reference to The Last Supper, it's not done directly enough to be some twee bit of ironic symbolism. Instead Aldrich seems to honouring these men with their final shred of dignity.But all these intentions would be lost if it were not for a delightfully talented and appropriate cast. Lee Marvin does his superb world-weary, grudgingly humane hero act, and there are some nice supporting roles by the up-and-coming George Kennedy and former lead man Ralph Meeker. But let's face it – it's the titular twelve whom we really want to watch. With one or two exceptions, these guys were more or less unknowns, and it was only really Donald Sutherland who would ever become an 'A' player. And yet, virtually all do a marvellous job. John Cassavetes is more than just a psychotic grin – everything in his body language radiates his rebelliousness. Telly Savalas gives one of the most credible maniac performances I have ever seen – far better than the hammy Ernest Borgnine in Flight of the Phoenix. At first glance these guys appear to have been picked for their twisted faces or burly physique, but they can really act.The end result is an intelligent and professional work disguised as an action no-brainer. So why were pictures like this – violent yet incisive – being produced around this time? It was of course partly the increasing frankness of the era and the fact that the old production code was now in tatters. But it was also the ongoing conflict in Vietnam, which thanks to television was bringing the horror of war into the living room, and also galvanising a popular anti-war mood. It would still have been commercial suicide for a motion picture to critique the war directly, but a lot of movies from the time lambasted it indirectly with the terrors of a previous conflict. And oddly enough, perhaps through their honest intentions of being entertainment rather than mere soapboxes, pictures like The Dirty Dozen hold up better than many of the genuine anti-Vietnam pictures that were to appear once that war was over.",8,1,3,8 July 2010
Gone with the Wind," 'You're a heartless creature, but that's part of your charm'
","Normally when a classic novel is adapted to the screen, the novel still remains definitive. Austen, Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Wells and Verne will always be what they are regardless of how many films are made of their work. Gone with the Wind is a rare exception – a best-selling and critically acclaimed book upon release, and yet the name and the story now belong firmly to the motion picture tradition.When you look at Gone with the Wind, in particular its heroine Scarlett O'Hara, it's sometimes hard to fathom its appeal. It is essentially the story of bull-headed individualism in the face of social catastrophe. But if there was ever an attempt to make bull-headed individualism look romantic, this was it. Gone with the Wind is not, as so many film noirs of the next decade would be, a misogynist mope about the men ruined by such a self-centred woman, but neither is it a feminist glorification of the strong-willed woman. I think its impact lies in that it is really two stories – the tragic depiction of a vanishing way of life, told through the eyes of someone who cares only for herself. The one offsets the other, and gives the whole some kind of honesty.After that, it all comes down to the gloss and polish of David O. Selznick's production. There's no shame in this, any more than there is in making a painting or piece of music a work of beauty, and besides Gone with the Wind is the kind of lily that can withstand a substantial amount of gilding. Probably the most special thing about the way the picture is done is its cinematography – an absolutely magnificent job by Ernest Haller and Ray Renehan. Painting is an apt metaphor here. The tones and compositions are reminiscent of fine artists such as Auguste Renoir (especially at the Twelve Oaks barbecue), with some nods here and there to Renaissance art as well. There is also some excellent use of silhouettes, creating those now-iconic images at key moments, and demonstrating just how much that errant lock of hair can add to Clark Gable's allure.Which brings us onto the actors Despite the hoo-hah over casting, a lot of the performers were simply ticking boxes – Mr Gable and Hattie McDaniel in particular. But this does not diminish their efforts. McDaniel was always a talented actress, she just needed a role big enough to show it. Yes, she plays a stereotype, but the beauty of the performance is that she brings intelligence, wit and humanity to the surface through the stereotype. As for Ashley, I would prefer to have seen Melyvn Douglas in the role. Leslie Howard is a good actor but his physique is too willowy, and he is far too English. However, no-one could have guessed the British background of Vivien Leigh (except possibly Henry Higgins, but he's fictional). Her 'southern belle' authenticity is quite incredible, given how rare it was back then for players to become so immersed in character, and also given that her normal speaking voice made the queen sound common. I would say though that purely as a performance it is merely good rather than outstanding. It is really just 95% sulks and hissy-fits, but she at least nails all the right emotions and even manages to make us sympathise with Scarlett.Gone with the Wind was famously troubled by directors coming and going – which is always great for confounding the auteur theorists, not that many of them would touch this movie with a 10-foot pole in the first place. The thing is, it really doesn't harm the production. George Cukor and Victor Fleming may have been total opposites in personality (an urbane homosexual and a rugged outdoorsman), but their shooting styles were very similar. Both used a lot of movement, of the camera and within the frame, to give atmosphere and dynamism to the scene, and both gave their actors a lot of coaching. The difference with Fleming is that, despite being the ultimate man's man, probably had enough of the no-nonsense attitude to coax out the shrewishness in Scarlett. He certainly brings Scarlett's personality to the quality of the image, with the quick dolly-in that introduces her character, the general bustle in background and foreground, people walking and talking at the same time – all of which are Fleming trademarks. It's as if Scarlett's flighty, haughty, teenage persona has coloured the whole world around her, and it's a very effective way to open the movie, engaging us immediately.The funny thing is, that despite it being a colossal cultural event in its time, and holding its box-office record for over thirty years, Gone with the Wind has since been surpassed in popularity by its contemporary The Wizard of Oz. And even though it is still a highly regarded classic, it is probably now remembered more than it is enjoyed. The truth is, Gone with the Wind was very much a wonder of its age – a work of unprecedented lavishness and a herald of maturity in the motion picture. Whereas The Wizard of Oz, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka and many other hits of 1939 were simply great pictures of their day which can speak to people of any place or time, Gone with the Wind was a great phenomenon which meant something to a generation, but is now just a pretty-looking melodrama.",8,0,2,24 March 2010
The Princess Bride," 'Poor and perfect'
","The 1980s were the golden age of the fantasy movie – Excalibur (1981), The Dark Crystal (1982), Legend (1985), Willow (1988) and many others, sword-and-sorcery sagas for the blockbuster generation. But what those aforementioned pictures also had in common were high-production values and emphasis on aesthetics and stylisation. In some cases this was to hide the lack of a decent story. The Princess Bride by comparison is a decidedly minimalist affair, devoid of special effects (bar a bit of puppetry and prosthetics), atmospherics and big fight scenes. This is a fantasy movie which must rely on other things for its appeal to the viewer.The Princess Bride, adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, is really quite a light and simple story, more of a fairy tale than a work of what is normally called fantasy. Its world is too cosy and its baddies are not really evil enough to give it a sense of danger. It also contains a fair few plot holes along the way. It is however saved by two cunning devices. First is the framing narrative whereby Peter Falk is reading the story to his cynical grandson. The grandson's attitude pre-empts criticism, allowing the story to acknowledge the weakness of its own opening and challenge the nay-sayers to keep watching. Secondly there is the constantly humorous angle, a wit in the words that is often self-deprecating, and more irreverent than outright hysterical. The humour is all within character, so not enough to classify The Princess Bride as a spoof or even really a full-blown comedy, but it prevents the viewer from laughing at the corniness of the movie, because it gives the impression that all along the movie is chuckling at itself.Conveniently enough, director Rob Reiner had a background in comedy, and part of his skill in this area was selecting good comedy actors. The Princess Bride provides great opportunities because it has a lot of minor characters that aren't necessarily comical on paper but can be made funny in the way an actor plays them. Because these parts could be interpreted in a number of ways Reiner is more or less free as to who he casts in which role, and he actually seems to have stacked them so they get better and better as the movie progresses. First up is Wallace Shawn, great at doing indignant pomposity. Then there's Mel Smith, rarely seen in films but a fine character player from his days in TV sketch shows. Then we come to Billy Crystal, whose act is a masterwork of timing, working brilliantly in tandem with a lively Carol Kane. And finally there is the brief cameo by Peter Cook, a model of decorum and propriety until he opens his mouth. Wonderful stuff.While we have the cream of the crop in the small parts, it seems this production could not afford big stars for the leads, and we get too relative unknowns as the heroic Westley and his eponymous princess. Someone may have had the idea that Cary Elwes would shape up to be a modern-day Errol Flynn. He certainly has the looks and can pull off a swashbuckling swagger, but he just doesn't have the necessary presence or charisma, and it's no wonder he was picked mostly for supporting roles after this. Robin Wright is similarly bland, although to be fair despite being the movie's namesake her character does not really have a lot to do here. Better things can be said of Mandy Patinkin who brings the right blend of cheekiness and earnestness to his part (Inigo was my favourite character when I saw this as a child). An honourable mention must also go to Andre the Giant who is surprisingly good considering he's a wrestler hired for his bulk. He struggles with the language but it's clear he was an intelligent and sensitive man.It is essentially all the little touches that make The Princess Bride what it is – the wit, the quirkiness, the set-pieces. And yet, it being a fantasy picture I do find myself wishing it had a little more of the glamour and spectacle with which its contemporaries were filled. It may win out in the comedy stakes but it lacks the wonder and enchantment of Labyrinth, Legend or The Dark Crystal, and thus it falls short of brilliance. This is a little picture that works well on its own terms, and belongs solidly in the category of good plain fun.",7,2,3,2 April 2011
Saving Private Ryan," 'The goddamn rules just walked off'
","Since the popularising of pacifism in the 1960s, the war movie has largely existed only to convey anti-militarist sentiment. But by 1998 there hadn't been a major decent one of those for years, and it was time for another makeover. Saving Private Ryan harks back to the genre's peak in the late 40s and early 50s, when war movies were exciting pictures about heroism and unquestionable moral reasoning. However, the intervening time in cinematic and social development can't be ignored, and so this time around combat must be realistically hellish, and there has to be some kind of philosophical questioning going on.This is all very well, but Saving Private Ryan is also very much part of the modern era's blockbuster strand, and it seems a conflict between brutal realism and cornball simplicity. In between the battle scenes there is some woefully clichéd dialogue and dramatically flat moments. Characters like Upham are just lazily-written stereotypes, and the point-making about the perils of showing mercy to the Germans is heavy-handed. Then there's the John Williams score, which is just like so many other overblown and slightly smug-sounding John Williams scores. You wouldn't think a musical score could be condescending, but this one is.Director Steven Spielberg won his second Oscar for Saving Private Ryan. As with Schindler's List, the frequency and arbitrariness of the killing soon makes us desensitised to it, and immerses us in a world where randomised death is a constant threat. And Spielberg clearly knows how to balance this. For example, about halfway through the battle we see Hanks and his men gradually making some headway. The troops aren't dropping like flies anymore, but the sheer brutality of the previous ten minutes means we never forget the danger the men are in. But the trouble is Spielberg occasionally resorts to techniques like slow-motion and sound distortion, putting the experience upon us in a way that feels obviously artificial, as oppose to letting the images draw us in. And he makes a basic error, I feel, in showing a few point-of-view shots from the German gun positions. Surely the whole point of this scene (and the movie in general) is keeping us with the US troops and never being objective, and yet Spielberg violates his own premise.And yet this is overall a well-made piece and there remains much to like. Despite the weaknesses in the screenplay's minutiae, its odyssey structure gives it a powerful sweep and makes up for the deficits in characterisation. The picture gains resonance is it goes along, and to my mind the later battle sequence at Ramille with its eerie sound effects and man-versus-tank dynamics, is superior to the opening one. Saving Private Ryan is not without its flaws, but it is enough to reinvigorate a genre that was starting to flag.",7,1,2,27 February 2012
The Pianist," 'That's what we have to believe'
","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being 'about' the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.",9,4,6,5 April 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," 'Another of these desert-loving Englishmen'
","Ever since the heyday of Douglas Fairbanks, cinema has been in love with the iconic image of the rugged, gritted-teeth outdoorsman, through actors like from John Wayne to Clint Eastwood, and directors like Victor Fleming and Raoul Walsh. In the more analytical, less adulatory cinema of the mid-50s onwards, these fearless heroes became the subject of lengthy character studies. These sometimes proved just as popular as their lighter ancestors, so long as they contained the necessary dose of action and adventure to add flesh to the bones.Lawrence of Arabia is, as character studies go, pretty gargantuan, and really quite devastating in its complete unravelling of the nature of heroism. But such ruminations needn't necessarily be revisionist or provocative. The screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson begins by inspiring us with admiration for the man, and leaves us filled with pity for him. It is an incredibly concentrated piece of characterisation, but what is rather neat about it is that it says very little directly about Lawrence, besides vague and sometimes conflicting statements. Demons such as his sadistic and masochistic streaks or his inability to fit into military or indeed Western lifestyle come across through his actions – not through his words, nor the words of those who speak about him. This is not only a very powerful method of storytelling but it is a very realistic way of showing the disparity between the man and the myth. Those demons of course come to dominate the character and the picture.This emphasis on 'show, don't tell' (which is of course the essence of all great storytelling) is given life by the vibrant visual direction of David Lean. In Lawrence of Arabia his images are constantly shifting between the historical reality of the broad canvas to the emotional intensity of an extreme close-up. This is also his way of keeping the story in motion. The cut from the blown-out match to the desert sunrise is of course very well known, but in fact Lean begins and ends almost all his shots in this snappy manner. Even cuts within in scenes tend to give completely new colouring, scope and movement. However the actual shots themselves often consist of gradual shifts in tone, with objects hoving into view or slipping out of sight. It's a fairly literal approach to film grammar (cuts are for changes, shots are for movement) and this makes it extremely effective.In fact the direction of David Lean here looks even better than it really is thanks to how in tune the entire production team was. Editor Anne V. Coates (who is still going today in her mid-80s) took on the mammoth task of aligning all of Lean's jarring cuts, and did a perfect job of it. Maurice Jarre not only created a score which fits the tones of the movie (that main theme, with its hints of Arabic melody, conjures up both the hot splendour of the desert and the cool quench of the oasis), but one which dances expertly to the tune of Lean's images, even working in seamless switches in timbre and melody to coincide with the edits. The sound design too takes the reigns wherever a visual change might be too abrupt – for example the creaking of Feisal's tent after he utters the words 'I fear it'.With such a flawless production job, the actors in Lawrence of Arabia seem simply to slot into place. Peter O'Toole is of course very good – introducing Lawrence as a softly-spoken and unassuming hero, bringing out the calm wisdom which passes for charisma, and finally showing the desperate conflict that was going on inside – but one could not say it is a performance that commands the picture. The character as he is written and presented commands the picture, but O'Toole does not. Omar Sharif's is the best performance we see, filled with a very realistic alertness and sense of indignation. Compared to him, it's a little disappointing to see Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn give somewhat trite interpretations of wise Arab leaders, but at least they are true to the demands of the story and hold up their parts of the movie. Fun fact for you: It wasn't just Caucasians being (mis?)cast as Arabs. I.S. Johar, who plays Gasim, was Indian and a fairly big star in Bollywood.I think what makes Lawrence of Arabia so appealing both then and now is that it shows us the tough, outdoors-loving warrior hero, sweeping us along on his adventures, and yet doing so without lying to us about the strains and disappointments of such a lifestyle. Straightforward realism makes for dull viewing, but no-brainer action can be hollow and unmemorable. Lawrence of Arabia gives us the best of both worlds, with a delicate precision that is beautiful in itself.",9,0,2,12 June 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'The stories that stay with you'
","Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.Jackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.Peter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty 'wow' moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.The breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough – or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.Perhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is.",9,1,2,7 April 2012
Schindler's List," 'Not the work – the presentation'
","One of the benefits of our modern day cinema (and by modern, I mean last forty-odd years) is that movies can be made with complete frankness. The more difficult segments of history can be recreated with some accuracy. Schindler's List deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. Thankfully, they did.Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone – each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see – the one-armed man and the civil engineer – are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them 'Nice things cost money'. Eventually he will be buying human lives.In evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained façade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.Steven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous – his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama – but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.And this – the life – is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. This is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. And if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this.",10,15,23,1 January 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," 'Shouldn't let something like that spoil your fun'
","Film adaptations of true events will inevitably get slammed from some quarters. In the case of Dog Day Afternoon it was attacked by its own lead subject John Wojtowicz (renamed Sonny Wortzik for the screen), who described it as 'only 30% accurate'. His gripes were mainly about portrayals of secondary characters such as his mother and first wife, as well as his belief that the film implies he sold out Sal – which it doesn't. But such is the nature of cinema – reality is a myriad of single events from a myriad of perspectives, without explicit beginnings, endings or crescendos. A movie, on the other hand, must tell a story.And movies have to take a form. Dog Day Afternoon, oddly enough, often takes the form of a comedy. Whether this comes more from Frank Pierson's script or the many improvisations made during rehearsal I don't know, but either way it seems to originate from very absurdity of the situation. Although it's based on true events, it's like a 'what if?' sketch. What if a naïve and essentially nice guy tries to pull off a bank robbery? You get situations like the robber asking the hostages if they need the bathroom. And of course, as any Charlie Chaplin fan knows, a comedy basis makes serious scenes even more poignant.This is why Al Pacino's performance is so vital. Far more animated than he was in the Godfather movies, he displays both a knack for comic timing, deepened by the touching simplicity of his character. John Cazale too is almost childlike, speaking tough but acting timid, and this is by far the best of his half-dozen film roles. Chris Sarandon gives a sublimely naturalistic performance, for what is definitely a difficult part to get right. Penelope Allen is also excellent, full of the gutsy personality that makes her the key to the fraternization between the robbers and the hostages. Above all it's the sheer likability of these players as they present themselves here that enables us to laugh, cry, and be enthralled by their antics.Dog Day Afternoon is at least faithful enough to real events that it mixes the public with the personal. After all, the real Sonny was not just some money-hungry hoodlum, and it was essential to balance the FBI operation and the media circus with the character's background and humanity. Who better to handle this balance than director Sidney Lumet. Lumet was already something of a specialist in movies confined to single locations (12 Angry Men, Murder on the Orient Express), and the way he approached these problems was to create different kinds of space within the limitations of the set. In Dog Day Afternoon we have everything from the grand scale outdoor shots, to simple group mid-shots, to the intimacy of the close-up. But there is far more variation going on here than simply how far the camera is from the action. There are, for example, close-ups which don't feel entirely private, with other characters seen in the background, and those which are totally personal, against plain backgrounds with no movement other than that of the actors being focused on. Even in some of the outdoor shots Lumet sometimes arranges things so that those thronging crowds are cut out of the shot. The greatest moment of genius is perhaps the conversation between Pacino and Sarandon. It begins with Sarandon amid loads of cops, and he is awkward and stilted. However as he eases up and the conversation becomes more personal, so too does the space around Sarandon. Sarandon has not gained privacy, but he has forgotten that he doesn't have it.On a purely cinematic level, Dog Day Afternoon is a masterpiece. And yes, some small details had to be changed to make it that good a piece of storytelling. It is not a documentary. And as such a great work, the film has been loved by millions. We come away from it with the feeling that Sonny and his associates were misfits rather than villains, good in their intentions if misguided in their actions, and that the events of that day were a kind of social tragedy.

Amadeus," 'A perfect harmony'
","Historical dramas have been many things in the history of cinema – tear-jerking melodramas, long-winded epics, painstaking biographies – but they have rarely been such good fun as this largely fictional black comedy set in 18th century Vienna. Sometimes mistakenly referred to as a biography, Amadeus is really a cheeky historical might-have-been, a storyteller's flight of fancy.The greatness of Amadeus lies largely in its source material, a play by the renowned Peter Shaffer, who adapted the screenplay himself. Shaffer's twin Anthony was behind some of the best thrillers of the 1970s, and Peter shares his brother's dark wit, but with a mind more towards the dramatic than the suspenseful. It's true that for Amadeus he has updated a baseless rumour and embroidered the truth extensively, but this tale of childish rivalry between two classical composers is simply irresistible. The exaggeration of the characters of Mozart and Salieri, the former into a giggling schoolboy, the latter a stuffy hypocrite, drives the story forward. Shaffer weaves the myth of their antipathy into a fascinating and humorous study on fame, talent, jealousy and ego. The emphasis on Mozart's operas as turning points in the narrative, as oppose to his many symphonies or chamber music, appropriately demonstrates music as storyteller and backdrop for action.Schaffer's play may be the mighty heart of this picture, but let us not play down the skill with which it has been brought to the screen. The first thing to make an impression is the lavishness of the sets and costumes, conjuring up the excessive glamour of the era, never totally clean, always a little dusty. Director Milos Forman however has such an ability to bring our focus in so totally on the actors that he can make us forget the extravagant backdrops. In example, for the interview scenes with the older Salieri, we move from the authentic clutter and bustle of the lunatic asylum, to suddenly having the background become a black and white blur, with F. Murray Abraham and the clergyman picked out crisply upon it. Still, the director does make clever use of the production design, a chandelier glittering eerily behind Abraham mirroring the fire on which he burns his crucifix. There is much cunning editing, not just of the image but also of the music, snatches of Mozart's compositions, accompanying such visual jolts as the appearance of Leopold, at other times disappearing in the middle of a scene, leaving a feeling of emptiness hanging in the air.The cast is a good one too. F. Murray Abraham gives a masterful turn, at his best in his scenes as the older Salieri, full of wry cynicism and weary regret. Tom Hulce's Mozart is massively theatrical, but it's a hammy performance for a hammy character, and almost as much fun as watching Charles Laughton in full flow. Good as these two are, I would love to have seen the leads from the first Broadway production, Ian McKellan and Tim Curry, reprising their roles for the screen version. The standouts really are in the smaller roles, especially a witty Jeffrey Jones portraying the Emperor Joseph II as if he was some slightly incompetent manager. The almost universal American accents of the cast may seem a little unconventional, but really considering these characters would in reality be speaking German is no more or less accurate than them all sounding English. Besides it seems the smaller parts have been cast for the expressive range of their accents, some sounding bucolic, others pompous, giving us the idea of character as opposed to where they might be from.Amadeus stands out amongst historical dramas for its mix of endearing wit and reflexive look at art and genius which is intelligent but never obscure. We are fortunate that it was produced in an era when production values were high enough to make it look stunning, after the days when censorship might have diminished its sharp edge and before the time when it could have been ruined by CGI cityscapes. This is cinema with every note in place.",9,2,4,7 March 2011
The Man Who Would Be King," 'God's holy trousers'
","The epic is one of several old-time genres to have all but died out in the new wave era of 1970s Hollywood. The Man who would Be King, a pet project of writer-producer-director John Huston, works by virtue of its having had a long gestation period, and its coming to fruition under the savvy guidance of Huston. It is an adventure epic in the style of a bygone era of filmmaking, but it has enough modern overlay to its adaptation to prevent it from appearing an anachronism.One of the big advantages of its being produced in the 70s and not a preceding decade is securing of the right cast. Originally the leads were to have been Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable. Another time Paul Newman and Robert Redford were posited. While all these choices were great actors and would have no doubt been fun to watch, I can't imagine any more suitable duo than Michael Caine and Sean Connery. Caine in particular is adept at making the half-poetic, half-colloquial dialogue of Rudyard Kipling's original story sound, well, just that – poetic and colloquial, and very natural when it could easily have sounded bizarre. Caine also has the earnestness of a good storyteller, so makes an ideal narrator. Connery shows comedic touches totally at odds with his usual screen persona, with some great moments like his put-look expression when Christopher Plummer declines to see him foam at the mouth. But later Connery demonstrates the presence and charisma that made him James Bond. Saeed Jaffrey is perfectly cast as their Ghurka companion, and again he is an actor the like of whom we would not have got in a 1950s production. Jaffrey creates a very likable and mischievous caricature, showing some superb and gleeful comic delivery.Huston himself was a director with a long track record, having made his directorial debut in 1941, and writing screenplays as far back as the early 30s. However he had proved himself endlessly versatile and always able to remain fresh with the times. The Man who would Be King features a few nods to such de rigeur techniques as the zoom and hand-held camera, but these are used sensibly and not with the showy abandon of the many young sprouts that were grabbing cameras and calling themselves directors around this time. And Huston still has all his original expertise intact, unlike some of the older directors around who had begun to lose their touch. One of Huston's best assets was his ability to juggle multiple actors in the frame using depth (a large part of the contrack-signing scene is done in one take), avoiding the need to edit back and forth between characters in the shot, and giving more impact to the more functional or stylised cuts such as the attention-grabbing insert of Kipling's Masonic watch chain or the powerful montage of mountains.Another aspect of The Man who would Be King in relation to its being a 70s production is its reflection of the changing political climate. It was only by this point that having Asian people played by Asian actors became the norm, as oppose to the poorer blackface copies we would have likely got had this been produced in the 50s. Bear in mind too that practically every movie in the 70s had some kind of political agenda, and the left-leaning Huston here draws attention to the anti-colonialist interpretation of the story, for example in the marketplace montage which precedes the opening credits, which relates not at all to the plot, but seems designed to emphasise the power and durability of culture on the subcontinent. These things add to the richness of the picture, without once being overbearing enough to detract from its innocent adventuresome roots.",8,1,3,5 February 2011
Million Dollar Baby," 'Instead of running from the pain'
","While sports movies have never been a major genre, boxing movies have probably accounted for more than half of all sports movies ever made. It must just be something about the idea of boxing basically being an organised punch-up, or maybe the scope for philosophising about the spectacle of violence, that has rendered it the stuff of drama.But conversely to the usual male pride arena of the typical boxing picture, Million Dollar Baby sees Clint Eastwood settling into a father-daughter dynamic as an ageing trainer with his protégé Hilary Swank. Eastwood's acting has improved as he's aged. He's become less active, so his whole persona has receded back into his face. All his past roles are written there in that tortured visage, a former tough guy trapped in this old man's body, facing difficulty and failure for the first time. Swank gives a deceptively quiet performance for someone playing a boxer. What she's doing is matching Eastwood's steely, laconic demeanour, albeit with a good deal of youthful optimism. The rapport between the two of them seems completely natural.All boxing matches look more or less alike, but ways of shooting them have differed from one movie to the next. Martin Scorsese's direction in Raging Bull was the much-lauded camera-in-the-ring approach. Eastwood's camera on the other hand is often prowling around the edge -the manager's position – the ropes half obscuring the screen. Throughout the movie there seems to be an emphasis on low ceilings, dark corners, and long, barren hallways. It's a seedy, gritty world these characters inhabit, a world with few exits.For all its modernity and plot twists Million Dollar Baby fits a well-worn mould. Most of the great boxing movies are about failure of sorts, and perhaps victory of other sorts. And there's no shame in its sticking to the pattern; it's what makes good boxing movies good. Million Dollar Baby is part of a cinematic tradition, and a worthy heir to its predecessors.",9,0,1,4 May 2012
The Nightmare Before Christmas," 'With all our tricks we're making Christmas time'
","Stop-motion animation has been around almost since the beginning of cinema, but this was the first time the form had been used for a full-length motion picture. Just like cell animation sixty years earlier, the claymation we see here had been employed for pre-feature shorts or blended with live-action, but hadn't really been taken seriously as a facet of the cinematic medium. This is one of the good things about having popular mavericks like Tim Burton in Hollywood – they can use their mainstream bankability to push through projects the studios wouldn't normally touch with a bargepole.Burton didn't actually direct Nightmare Before Christmas. He instead produced and came up with the story outline, but this doesn't make much difference as far as the finished production is concerned. This is perhaps the most archetypal Burton story, the ultimate tale of scary looking outsiders trying to fit in with the bright and happy world outside and failing beautifully. There's also that familiar look of both characters and scenery (Burton was always heavily involved with the design of his movies) – spindly figures, wild hair, black and white stripes, curling fronds like gnarled fingers. There's been a depressing trend in recent decades of making horror characters seem comical rather than scary, and The Nightmare Before Christmas, with its mix of the grotesque and the cartoonish, is a (probably unwitting) flagship for this. It's a shame because it's essentially the dumbing-down of kid's stuff. Children's movies were better when they could be properly frightening.Something that really helps The Nightmare Before Christmas work is its being a musical. At first hearing Composer Danny Elfman's skittering melodies don't seem suited to singing, but then you realise just how much story and characterisation is carried in those lyrics. It's all a bit reminiscent of Lerner and Loewe's musicals, in that the songs are very much used to move the story along. And the tunes – while not exactly ones that are easy to sing along to – are rather pretty. They're also highly evocative – 'What's This?' fizzes like a snowstorm, 'Sally's Song' feels tender and sad, 'Jack's Lament' is by turns proud and melancholy. Oogie Boogie's bluesy number injects a little bit of fun to kick off the final act of the movie.And we shouldn't downplay the contribution of actual director Henry Selick. Selick takes this stop motion feature with a cinematic approach, using close-ups, camera moves, tilts and the like, to dramatic. The level of detail to the sets is exceptional, and there is a no-expense-spared look one would not associate with the shorts this medium has typically been used in. Most importantly however is the personality that goes into movement the characters. At ten frames a second, this isn't exactly smooth, but there is a wonderful texture and life in stop-motion that you don't quite get in other forms of animation. This is probably the biggest gift that The Nightmare Before Christmas has given us – the championing and reinvigoration of this seemingly dated art form, ironically in the very decade that CGI became the predominant animation method. It paved the way for many more claymation movies, which is undoubtedly a good thing.And as a final thought, I'll just mention that stop motion is an incredibly easy form of animation to do at home. All you need nowadays is a digital camera and the right software (you can do it with Photoshop), plus of course a bit of patience and imagination. It doesn't have to be clay models – you can animate object you like. Have fun..!",8,2,2,23 December 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'God will be cut'
","Over the last twenty years cinema, and culture in general, has had a thing for retro chic. In particular, we have developed an appreciation for the charm that lies in things that, even in their day, were considered cheap and shabby. Hence Quentin Tarantino can make a living through the renovation and glorification of the exploitation movie. And also hence he can find some pretty amazing things to make out of it. Having been bolstered by the successes of his first few movies, he was now able to indulge himself in this pure homage.Much can be made of the scintillating gore and graceful violence in Kill Bill, but Tarantino's direction is marked by both its simplicity and humanity. Unusually, given its subject matter, the visual style here has a lot less emphasis confrontation between two characters (as was the case in the continuous stand-offs of previous Tarantino movies) and more upon individuals and quiet detail, as when Uma Thurman inspects her hands after awakening from a coma or catches her reflection in a Hattori Hanzo blade. And this is all very much to the purpose of the story. Whereas there are no clear-cut heroes or villains in Pulp Fiction, in Kill Bill Thurman's is a character we are really supposed route for.Strong characters are brought to life by a strong cast. Thurman is able to portray the cool and collected killer, but on top of that she displays both a feminine softness and likable humanity, exemplified in brief moments like that cheeky twitch in her face as she talks about getting the other little piggies wiggling. The best supporting part is that of Sonny Chiba, humorously charming at first, then displaying a calm dignity. Quite impressive for someone who was for the best part of his career a Japanese Steven Seagal. David Carradine, a favourite actor of mine even before cameras had rolled on Kill Bill, is only seen here as a glimpse of gnarled hands, but he packs enough character into those digits to make his presence felt throughout the movie. Mention must be made of the music in this picture. Tarantino has always picked and chosen diverse pre-existing tunes for his soundtracks, but for Kill Bill the magpie is at his most manic and eclectic. Most of the selections don't make much cultural sense (for example 'The Lonely Shepherd', which underscores the sword presentation on Okinawa, was performed by Romanian Gheorghe Zamfir) but each fits the mood of the moment, which is what's important. In terms of timing and choreography, he's moulded the scenes around the music and not the other way round, which is a legitimate way of doing things. He's good at it too, selecting images that complement both rhythm and tone. He should make a musical one day.But above all it is a sense of playfulness that make Kill Bill what it is. All the time Tarantino seems to be giving sly winks to the audience, and such self-reference is made acceptable by the exaggerated comic-book nature of it all. The line 'So you understand how serious I am, I'm going to say this in English' makes no logical sense, but it does mean that Lucy Liu's coolest speech can be delivered without subtitles. Appropriate meanings abound, like the phone ringtone that plays 'Auld Lang Syne' (old acquaintance, indeed!). Tarantino has utmost respect for those old exploitation movies, but he recognises their limitations when it came to logic and credibility, magnified here as he tries to cram in one B-movie trope after another. In light of this, he simply has fun with the format, and allows the audience to have fun with it too.",9,1,4,28 April 2012
Black Hawk Down," 'One hundred caskets to fill'
","After the success of Saving Private Ryan in 1998, the war movie was rebranded from the moral fable of the Vietnam era to something that was essentially an exciting experience for its audience. Black Hawk Down was perhaps the most extreme example of that approach, a pure video-game movie that pares down all the camaraderie and humanising to just a handful of brief exchanges, and puts almost all its attention upon the actual business of killing each other.However Black Hawk Down differs from a lot of modern action pictures in its pacing, as orchestrated by director Ridley Scott. Eschewing the usual frenetic overkill, Scott takes a relatively relaxed approach. In the first Lord of the Rings movie, which was released the same week, the average shot length must be something like two seconds. In Black Hawk Down the average shot length is more like three to four seconds, and it makes all the difference. There is time to savour expressions and notice tiny details, making up for the lack of rounded characterisation earlier in the movie. Scott allows the interplay between the men to come out, not in the script, but in glances, grimaces and carefully-placed props. The earliest scenes are eerily calm, providing a moody build-up for the action that is to come.And it's all done with such grace and smoothness. The timing of shots is rhythmic and the images are beautiful. Scott and his cinematographer Slawomir Idziak create some extremely stylised colour schemes which evoke temperature as much as mood. When we move from Garrison's meeting with Atto (browns and yellows) to the hanger with his troops (blues) you can practically feel a whoomph of cool air hitting you. Add to this mix a musical soundtrack that dances from the power of contemporary and classic rock tracks to the haunting sounds of Denez Pringent and Lisa Gerrard. Black Hawk Down has an aesthetic quality rare in war movies.Although this isn't really a movie about deep performances, it's worth making a few points about casting, which seems to follow types rather than talents. For example, Tom Sizemore was then your go-to man for mean-faced sergeant characters. It seems unusual to cast Scotsmen Ewan MacGregor and Ewen Bremner as US soldiers, especially as MacGregor in particular can't really do the accent. However I think the fact that they are outsiders among the rest of the cast feeds into the impression they give of combat virgins.The trouble with Black Hawk Down is that it actually needs to be as visually sumptuous as it is. There isn't really much to go on here, dramatically; apart from a little chitchat in the first half hour, the whole movie is essentially one very long battle scene. When there are talky scenes, all we get is bland, one-dimensional dialogue – the usual trite 'A man's gotta do' stuff. The only way it actually really conveys anything meaningful is through putting us into that combat zone and giving us a little taste of the terror and the exhilaration. And perhaps, for this, it is a stronger war movie.",7,4,6,28 March 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," 'Take a stress pill and think things over'
","Since its release in 1968, this has been a movie which divides its audience into lovers and haters. Sometimes (often?), those who love it will dismiss those who hate it as simply 'not getting it'. This attitude is not only snobbish, it maybe even misses the point of the picture. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not really a picture that one must 'get'. Its plot is not exactly labyrinthine, and while its meaning is obscure it is deliberately so, as Kubrick himself shied away from being philosophically explicit. In other words, if someone tells you they know what Kubrick was trying to say with the movie, they are wrong.So what exactly is the problem then? Contrary to what some might assume, it is not the slow pace of the picture that I find alienating. Certainly there are dozens of pictures with faster paces and shorter runtimes that I find far more boring because they are unconvincing, too wordy or just generally poorly executed. In fact it is the methodical pacing that gives Space Odyssey many of its best points. Take the early scenes with the apes - not a shot is wasted there. It is in fact an extremely efficient summary of the brutal and dangerous lives of these creatures, all told with an atmospheric quietness, building up to the eeriness of the monolith's appearance and the stylised bone-smashing scene. The following spaceship sequence, 'choreographed' to the Blue Danube waltz is graceful, balletic and quite beautiful to behold. Later, the scenes with HAL and Keir Dullea become a kind of space horror, with the long shots and mechanical noises adding to the creepiness. There's also great tension built up by having the scenes of Dullea trying to get back on board through the airlock played out in painstaking real-time. And it is the achingly slow process of HAL being shut down that helps to make it such an intensely poignant sequence.So 2001: A Space Odyssey is, for the most part, an expertly rhythmic motion picture, and from its rhythm comes its power and its emotion. Where the problem comes, and I think the point where most of the audience is lost, is in the final act. When we are sitting through a ten minutes of lights zooming past, colour-filtered landscapes, and weird avant-jazz noises, the picture has lost its sense of aesthetic beauty, and gone into the realms of artistic pretension. No-one can really enjoy this sequence. Some might claim to 'appreciate' it, and yet it is clearly a tonal piece with little actual meaning, so there is nothing really intellectually pleasing about it either.I have to admit though, a lot of my dislike for this picture is only relative to the adulation lavished upon it by its fans. It irks me that the match-cut with the bone and the spaceship is so widely applauded, when there is an almost identical (and far neater) cut in the Powell and Pressburger picture A Canterbury Tale, and besides there are better (but more subtle) match-cuts in Space Odyssey, such as the one from the monolith against the sky to the shadow on the plain. And I'm a little cynical about the fuss made over the scientific accuracy of the space flight stuff, when the picture is so unscientific about Darwinian evolution. Don't get me wrong; I'm not citing the match-cut or the scientific inconsistencies as problems in themselves, only pointing them out as examples of the sometimes misguided way in which this movie is seen as being exceptional. Perhaps then what 2001: A Space Odyssey suffers from is its own reputation. Considered in itself, the picture has a great deal to love about it and only a little to hate.",7,1,5,12 January 2011
The Graduate," 'Hello, darkness'
","When the Motion Picture Production Code was abolished in 1967 every movie genre was irrevocably changed. Action pictures became bloodier, dramas became swearier, and romances became openly sexual. One of the earliest movies to show this change was The Graduate, a movie that pushed at the boundaries of taste not with smut but simply by showing who might be getting into bed with whom, and why.It's an interesting story we have here. On the one hand it follows a very traditional romantic story arc that can be traced all the way back to Jane Austen. Our hero is at first attracted to one member of the opposite sex, only to find the relationship unfulfilling, and find that the 'right' choice was under his nose all along. The difference of course is that The Graduate is very frank about how bizarrely messy real world relationships can be. There is perhaps a bit of a 1950s-style dig at assertive women (the plot is basically An American in Paris if Nina Foch was Leslie Caron's mother). Ben Braddock makes a distinctly creepy lead man as well, conceivably only a couple of nudges away from Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, to the point where it's unbelievable that Elaine should fall for him. But the whole thing has such a sly, anarchic slant to it that it's enjoyable despite these dubious factors.The director here is a young Mike Nichols. Nichols is really good at playing with the images so that we only focus on the main characters. Often a minor character will appear with their back to the camera, contravening regular film grammar. Even when a character is more prominent, for example Mr Robinson or Carl, they are cleverly shot and lit so that while we remember what they do and say, we don't really get a clear look at them and they don't linger in the mind. Nichols is somewhat heavy-handed at times in trying to absorb us in the mood of a scene (the lengthy moving close-up of Dustin Hoffman at the party is a rather too artificial), but it certainly does the trick, even if it's headache-inducing at times. The precision involved can be exquisite too. The first time we see Anne Bancroft at the party, she might as well be just another extra, but she has a bit of clear space around her, and looks up just as the camera pauses, and thus we notice her, without actually realising yet that she's important.The Graduate also gives us some fine examples of acting. Ms Bancroft is the best, only marginally convincing age-wise, but certainly possessing of all the bitterness and frustration necessary for the role. Dustin Hoffman is deceptively quiet here, never really seeming to show much personality, but when for example he announces his intentions to marry Elaine he has the necessary conviction despite his quietness. Katharine Ross gives a decent turn too, having the most overstated role but keeping it within the bounds of naturalism. No-one else really stands out, but of course that is the whole point of Nichols's directorial scheme.When motion pictures became more explicit about sex, there was inevitably a great hue and cry from many in Hollywood's old guard. A lot of this was simple prudery, but others had more practical objections. Raoul Walsh for example, in his highly entertaining autobiography, says how in the old days all the tension was in when the romantic leads would finally get together, but in the modern era they will probably be shown having sex a third of the way through the movie, and that tension is gone. He has a point, but I think The Graduate puts forward a case for the sexualising of romantic cinema as something which makes the depiction of relationships more interesting, more compelling. It is, if nothing else, more true to life.",8,1,1,2 October 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," 'Believe in yesterday'
","The old genres of classic Hollywood were bundles of convention and cliché, familiar in their tone and romantic in their recreation of an idea. And while Hollywood itself would change massively in the modern era, those movie stylings lingered on in the memories of those who had grown up with them. Hence it was just as likely to be European filmmakers who were documenting America's history on screen, albeit through the haze of genre-tinted spectacles. Once Upon a Time in America is celebrated Italian director Sergio Leone's tribute, not to prohibition-era America, but to the classic gangster genre which once claimed to portray it.Perhaps the most striking thing about Once Upon a Time in America is its wealth of detail and compelling atmosphere. The production design is really impressive, with sets to feast the eyes on and realistically thronging street scenes. Leone and his art director Carlo Simi have struck a balance between throwing in stuff that makes sense in context and stuff that conjures up a certain feeling in the scene. A good example is when Noodles flees the opium den and makes his way to Moe's, and the streets are strewn with streamers for a forlorn, after-party appearance. Many of the 1922 scenes feature billows of smoke rising up from vents, for that dreamy, wistful look. Sound design plays an important part here, the creaking of a lift creating a tense build-up to a shooting in the way that one of Ennio Morricone's dirges might have done in a Leone Western. Morricone's music is still a key presence of course, tying various thoughts together across the decades, for example the eerie honky-tonk Yiddish theme that plays to introduce Moe's place in the opening scenes and again in the first set of 1968 scenes.The principle cast for this one are chosen from the front ranks of contemporary Hollywood talent. Robert De Niro was by this time the archetypal New York mobster, so clearly the obvious choice, even if he has to swap his trademark Italian American accent for a Bronx one. He is however a little more serene and meditative than his usual exuberant gangster acts, and the quiet dignity with which he portrays the older Noodles is especially good. James Woods provides excellent support. I love his spontaneous anger in kicking Tuesday weld out of the office after a few words from De Niro. Character actors Burt Young and Danny Aiello do the job of making a memorable impact during their brief appearances, Aiello in particular giving us some great comic relief. Tuesday weld is very good too. A handful of the other cast members are guilty of a little overacting, but I'm not in a vindictive enough mood to name names.Once Upon a Time in America may be a far cry from the surreal expanses and moustachioed bandidos of Leone's Westerns, but much of the director's visual style has survived intact. He's still just as in love with the gritty close-up as ever, bringing an unusual prominence to the mole on Robert De Niro's right cheek. For some of the actor's roles this would be covered by the make-up department, or at least the director would favour his left profile. Here however not only is De Niro's juvenile counterpart given a conspicuous mole for consistency, Leone even shows De Niro at three-quarter angles against a dark background, highlighting the mole in outline, for example when he looks at the photo of Deborah at Moe's. It's pertinent, adding an obvious flaw to those otherwise handsome features. And then of course there is Leone's painstaking slowness and protracted non-dialogue scenes, which are what make this the 230-minute behemoth that it is, since there's only really enough script here for a two-hour movie. As usual, Leone makes these unspoken moments a dance of tense mannerisms and darting eyes, which (just about) renders them watchable.But perhaps it is Once Upon a Time in America's gargantuan sprawl that is its undoing. There is nothing wrong per se with a 3hr+ movie, nor is there necessarily a problem with slow, methodical pacing. The trouble is that this picture sacrifices narrative clarity for its stylisation. I don't mean the confusing timeline-hopping; that's nothing that a repeat viewing won't sort out. However there is clearly something missing and in spite of their length some segments of the movie seem horribly truncated. There ought to be at least one more 1922 scene that brings out the comradely warmth between the boys, and between Max and Noodles in particular. It's not enough that we see it – we as an audience have to feel it. Instead we seem to be hurrying from one key incident to another with no time for character development. And in 1933 Max and Noodles seem continually at odds – there is not enough evidence that their friendship is still strong despite their disagreements, and this means the final scenes in 1968 do not have weight they ought to. Some parts of the story seem to trail off into nothing, for example the reappearance of Joe Pesci at the end of the hospital sequence. Instead the screenwriters have focused on working little bits of symbolism into the dialogue and imagery (for example, 'the key to your clock' and 'I'll do something with your time'), but have not worked nearly as hard on the emotional continuity. As a result Once Upon a Time in America is an interesting and occasionally entertaining collection of references to gangster movie history, but it is a failure as a work of cinema.",7,2,5,5 March 2011
Chariots of Fire," 'The pursuit of excellence'
","The 1980s were a time now looked back on by many as rather embarrassing and misguided, usually in terms of fashion and music, but no less so in the motion picture industry. This was, after all, that brief era when it was acceptable for a period film to be scored with synths. Enthusiastically modernist as it undoubtedly is, I still love 80s cinema for its naïve charm, and the fact that beneath that cheesy veneer still lurked movies of sincerity and sophistication. Chariots of Fire is exemplary in this case.It would be hard for anyone to guess the movie had the makings of a classic though. Sports movies are generally dull (unless they're about boxing), and a bunch of British runners in the 1920s hardly sounds inspiring. And yet the Colin Welland screenplay is a thing of real intelligence and poignancy. It is not, like many sports pictures, basically a drama with the sport as a backdrop – it really is all about the running. And yet other issues and preoccupations of the characters are shot through it – Liddell's devoutness, Abrahams's struggle against prejudice and his seemingly at-odds love of performing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Lindsay's sacrifice to allow Liddell to run. A few liberties are taken with historical accuracy, but these are only for the sake of fine-tuning the dramatic power, without slipping into complete misrepresentation. What we get is an intimate story of credible figures displaying admirable dedication and camaraderie.The two lead players here – Ben Cross and Ian Charleson – were unknowns at the time and they have remained fairly obscure. And while neither of them is exactly outstanding (the roles don't really call for such a thing) they are fully adequate. Cross is genuinely able to sing and play the piano, but also convinces as an athlete. Charleson comes across as a supremely sedate and thoughtful man, and has a kind of charisma that makes him captivating despite his calmness. The biggest treats however are amongst the supporting players, a bevy of Britain's finest character actors. Ian Holm is especially impressive. Often chomping a cigar, his face half-hidden by a straw hat, the personality of Mussabini all comes through in those little gestures and mad energy. There are also memorable bit parts from a sniffy Richard Griffiths and a humourless John Gielgud.Like his stars, director Hugh Hudson is by no means amazing, but he gets the job done. His slow-moving, constantly-roving camera helps to give the picture a nice flowing pace. His camera placement often seems almost arbitrary, with tops of heads cropped and so forth, but he seems to be giving an 'in-the-thick-of-it' look, without resorting to the clunkiness of hand-held camera. At some of the most emotional moments, such as Holm's personal celebration of his protégé's win, he keeps well back from the action. This gives a kind of respectful distance and allows the power of the moment to come across in body language rather than facial expression.But I feel the picture's greatest strength lies in the way it is all put together. There is this continual, breathtaking interweaving of ideas through music, for example, the singing of a church choir plays over one of Charleson's races, or 'He is an Englishman' playing as Cross trains after his confrontation with the anti-Semitic deans. Slow-motion, usually a rather trite and obvious technique, is used here to such smooth and subtle effect, with some clever mixes of slow image and normal speed sound, or cutting from slo-mo runners to normal speed crowds. It all helps to pull what is essentially a rather disparate plot (Cross and Charleson barely have any scenes together), and bring out the tones and themes in a way that is purely cinematic. This is even where that seemingly inappropriate Vangelis score comes in – it has a kind of transcendent quality that makes its anachronism irrelevant. On the surface, this may look like a lot of 80s 'hi-tec'ness guilding the dramatic lily, but it is all just another form of expression in this beautiful medium.",9,0,0,28 October 2011
A Clockwork Orange," 'Funny how the colours of the real world only seem really real on a screen'
","A Clockwork Orange, like many 'cult' films, is a bit of a problem for film buffs. Whether it's good or bad tends to get lost under its iconic, pseudo-hip status. Fans quote its quirky dialogue, delight in the overt violence and sexuality and marvel over its philosophical message-making, but if that were all there was to it Clockwork Orange would be a pretty poor film.Clockwork Orange is perhaps the most extreme example of the Kubrick technical style  a kind of formal method which instantly distinguishes his films. And bizarrely, it's all based around the game of chess. While he had by now dropped all the actual references to the game which peppered his earliest films, Kubrick had begun directing as if he were playing chess. Look at the camera movements. With a few exceptions, the camera only moves as if it was a chess piece  forwards, backwards, left and right. The actors also move like opposing chess pieces, more often than not directly towards the camera or across the shot.Kubrick was always meticulous and extravagant in conveying an idea and an atmosphere not just through performances but through set and costume design, sound, music and lighting. In the first part of Clockwork Orange (the first half-hour or so, up until Alex is arrested) every aspect of every shot expresses the collision between formal sophistication and crude roughness. So we have violent youngsters wearing bowler hats, the mural with penises grafittied onto it, classical music played on synthesisers and so on. It's a world full of images we recognise, but is at the same time as deliberately outlandish as possible. Compare this to the next section of the film, in the prison, where everything becomes realistic and contemporary, although the atmosphere is equally unnerving.Clockwork Orange also represents the peak of the growing musical dimension of Kubrick's films. It is what the director Michael Powell referred to as a composed film  one where the images play out like a piece of music. As I've hinted at above it's structured in contrasting 'movements' which reference and counterpoint each other, like a classical symphony. However there's also the musical element to individual scenes. The scene, fifteen or so minutes in, in which Alex returns to his bedroom to listen to Beethoven's 9th is one of the best examples in cinema of image and music working together  the quick zoom onto the Beethoven poster as the piece begins, then the prowling downward scan in the following shot, followed by the staccato cuts of details of the dancing Jesuses ornament are simply perfect.A Clockwork Orange, like all of Kubrick's later films, is incredibly elaborate and painstaking in the way it is constructed. It's not quite the classic it's reputed to be, and the statement it makes about free will isn't really all that profound. It is entertaining though, and in spite of what I said in the first paragraph, you can't help but like that memorable, poetic Nadsat dialogue.",8,2,5,9 January 2008
Reservoir Dogs," 'Are you gonna bark all day or are you gonna bite?'
","If you go on a screen writing course or read a filmmakers manual, it's likely that the one of the first things you will be told is to minimize dialogue to the bare essentials; that film is a primarily visual medium; that the images should be allowed to speak without unnecessary talking. And yet that notion is consistently challenged by one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed directors of the last two decades – Quentin Tarantino. In this, his debut, the dialogue is a constant accompaniment. The only time there is more than ten seconds without a spoken word is the credits.The gangster movie has long had a strong relationship with dialogue. That's one of the reasons there were so many of them in the early talkie era. The wisecracks are part of what makes the genre, and Reservoir Dogs contains some choice lines, like 'You shoot me in a dream you'd better wake up and apologise'. Tarantino – quite deliberately I'm sure – builds the story around numerous gangster clichés. Mr White, the hood with too much humanity. Mr Blond, the sociopathic killer. Mr Orange, the 'rat'. The dialogue is often used, not just to throw in some tough guy banter, but to add layers to these gangland relationships. Mr Orange tells the rest of the gang the 'commode story' in order to convince them he's a real criminal. The story itself is about a narrow escape with some drugs under the noses of a bunch of cops. Meanwhile the cops in this fictional episode are talking about 'a civilian who came this close to getting blown away'. The anecdote-within-an-anecdote gives a tense commentary upon Orange's tenuous position.Another advantage of this dialogue-based approach is that there is a lot of information for the actors to play upon and a lot of time to get into their roles. Harvey Keitel is very impressive, personifying the honourable mobster. Lawrence Tierney, who was playing lead men of dubious morality four decades earlier, clearly knows just what his character is about, and portrays the formidable crime boss with laid-back ease. Michael Madsen is simply perfect as the creepy, quiet type (although quiet type in this context only means he pauses for breath between lines), giving off an intense presence while barely making a move. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth both overact a little, although admittedly in Buscemi's case it is to good effect in depicting the weasely character, and even when Roth is waxing lyrical he makes you realise how poetic some of this dialogue is. Maybe it needs a bit of theatricality.Despite of his writing so much wordage for his own movie, Tarantino is still very much a visual director, whose camera seems to be finding angles on the action other than those which focus directly on the actors as they're talking. You have for example the wheeling camera in the opening scene, Tarantino's voice disembodied, a long-shot down the corridor as Keitel and Buscemi discuss their predicament, and the lengthy close-up on Keitel as Buscemi rants offscreen. Actually, these are techniques you see an awful lot in very early sound movies around 1930, when sound itself was seen as more of a gimmick than something fully integrated. It's as if the dialogue has its own entity, gliding over images like that radio show soundtrack.And indeed, a lot of the dialogue is simply there for effect. The essential exposition lines are all there as they should be, but unlike a more typically sparse screenplay, they are buried amongst reams of chitchat that serves only to amuse the audience and add realism and depth to the world in which the story takes place. Tarantino's opening spiel about Madonna's Big Dick is a prime example – completely irrelevant to plot or themes, uttered by a character who does barely anything else of significance in the whole rest of the movie. It seems it is just a funny little observation that Tarantino wanted to say (and, appropriately enough, it is literally him saying it). What we are witnessing with Reservoir Dogs is the beginning of dialogue for dialogue's sake.",7,0,0,14 December 2011
Some Like It Hot," 'Cinderella the Second'
","What is it about the comedies written and directed by Billy Wilder that made them so endlessly watchable? Well, the short answer is of course that they are bloody funny. For a longer answer, read on First off let's look at screenplays. Some Like it Hot was Wilder's first collaboration IAL Diamond, after years without a consistent partner-in-crime. Neither man is entirely responsible for the fresh brilliance of this picture, but it seems in bouncing ideas they were able to feed off each others' abilities. The general style of comedy is very much Wilder's – the mix of plausible situation and outright farce, the elaborate visual gags derived from Ernst Lubitsch – but it seems likely that Diamond brought in a tighter and more disciplined angle, no doubt adding a joke or two of his own along the way. But what's great about this screenplay (and what makes the picture so continually engaging) is the way it progresses through different types of humour.So, we open with a setting that is fairly familiar from classic gangster movies – a speakeasy, a Tommy-gun shootout – but with a sprinkling of jokes of a by-the-way nature. We get things like the organ stop being a secret way of opening the speakeasy door – little irreverent twists on hackneyed clichés – and the reason they work so well is because of how nonchalantly they are presented. It's a great way to set the tone and keep the laughs coming without making things too riotous at this early stage. Then, when the cross-dressing antics begin, Wilder and Diamond are able to milk a good half-hour's worth of gags purely out of the awkwardness and potential pitfalls of their situation. But if the entire rest of the movie were simply a load of jokes about blokes in dresses, it would eventually get repetitive. Therefore, when we arrive in Florida the whole thing spirals into a farcical free-for-all, complete with a couple of resident oddballs who make the two leading 'ladies' seem normal by comparison.Speaking of the leads, it really is impossible to imagine anyone other than Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as Josephine and Daphne. Curtis, that rugged and mean-faced man of action, makes a surprisingly good woman, in both looks and mannerisms. Lemmon is great too but there is more of the outrageous comedy drag look about him. It's a pity Curtis couldn't do the voice and had to be dubbed, otherwise I think he would have been in line for an Oscar nomination too. And this is incidentally the role for which Marilyn Monroe won a Golden Globe. Yes, her reputation now may be as a dumb blonde sex object, but in her day it was acknowledged that she could act. And this is just about her best performance, because it's the one part of hers that makes you forget that reputation, and just see the woman.But it's the supporting players that keep this one chirpy, especially towards the end of the picture where all bets are off and things are allowed to get completely silly. Rubber-faced Joe E. Brown is at the heart of the farce, so perfectly exaggerated in his looks and manner, like a cartoon character made flesh. And when the gangster subplot resurfaces, the authentic but somewhat ordinary George Raft will no longer do as chief baddie – the comedy game has been raised since then. So instead we get Nehemiah Persoff doing a very credible and entertaining Mussolini impersonation. And what about that creepy bellhop? Al Breneman, apparently. Where did they find that kid? He's brilliant! For movie buffs who have become familiar with this and later Billy Wilder comedies, it seems strange to think that before Some Like It Hot he was largely known as a writer and director of grim and cynical dramas. It appeared now though that he had hit upon a formula he felt happy with, and for whatever reason was compelled to put that pessimistic past behind him. His partnership with IAL Diamond was to last for the rest of their respective careers, during which they would make only one non-comedy. However, while they penned a number of a real classics together, they never quite equalled the box of delights that is Some Like It Hot.",9,1,1,30 May 2010
Pulp Fiction," 'Royale with cheese'
","Cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.It has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying 'five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us'. One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.Tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style – he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.The reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.My only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's 'square' is literally drawn on the screen. But by-and-large Pulp Fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there.",8,1,3,20 January 2012
Titanic," 'Life's a gift'
","It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.",10,4,5,16 February 2012
The Godfather: Part III," 'Beyond redemption'
","Any series of movies, no matter how excellent it's beginnings, can easily descend into mediocre sequel hell. This is even the case when many of the original cast and crew members remain the same. The first Godfather movie was an exemplary classic, the second a little weaker but still largely deserving of the honours it received. Their director Francis Ford Coppola became a respected and influential man about Hollywood, although he was never quite able to recapture that success. It was almost inevitable that, after a series of disappointing features in the 1980s, he would begin flogging dead horses' heads again.Al Pacino's 80s career had been somewhat paltry as well. Not that he lost his touch - there just simply hadn't been the right roles available to him. And sadly a return to the character he portrayed in two of his finest performances isn't the much-needed booster one might expect. Aged up somewhat, he piles on the weary, decrepit mannerisms just a little too thickly. It basically looks as if Michael Corleone has got a bit of a bad back, and sounds like he has a cough. Fortunately his younger co-stars are a little more up to the game. Andy Garcia plays a hot-headed mafia scion with a degree of subtlety not normally seen in such parts. Sofia Coppola, the directors daughter, received a lot of bad press for her performance (including a Razzie), but she is really not that bad.And her father is still showing all his usual prowess as a director. Those early scenes after the award ceremony show Coppola's superb handling of mood and rhythm. His camera typically hangs back from the action – a passive observer. There are few movements or close-ups and the editing all soft cuts from one similar shot to another. Even business within the frame is fairly restrained, carefully orchestrated bits of movement, no character too animated. Eventually it becomes apparent that the whole thing is set to the languid pace of the aging Pacino. Compare this to scenes where Andy Garcia is in control, in which the action is far more jumpy, the dialogue snapped out and the players closer to the camera. The rhythmic control is carried through in the neat sequencing of events to the music of Cavalleria Rusticana and the final revenge sequence, which is almost as good as the one in The Godfather, even if it is no longer original.And a lack of originality is really what brings this movie down. Coppola's motivation for re-opening the Godfather series - supposedly he felt Michael Corleone hadn't suffered enough - is itself rather a dubious reason to make a motion picture. The Godfather Part III doesn't really make much sense if you aren't familiar with the previous instalments, and is filled with blunt references to the original that don't really add much except nod to fans of the series. This even carries as far as the shot compositions and staging. For example Pacino's meeting with the corrupt cardinal is an obvious redoing of The Godfather's famous opening. It seems Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo were so intent on working in this sort of business, they forgot to put in the intriguing plot and strong characterisation that made the originals what they are. And by sacrificing his real-life daughter in the role of Mary Corleone it even looks as if Coppola is trying to make some dreary statement about his 'art'. Coppola's formal style may be modest and tasteful, but his symbolic point-making isn't.",5,3,6,3 May 2011
Psycho," 'Our private traps'
","The horror genre has often thrived on tales of the unknown, the inexplicable and the supernatural, and this can be very effective in its own way. However there has long been another tradition of scaring people with more worldly horrors, with the genuinely unnerving touch of wholly possible events, familiar settings and the thought that this could happen to you too. And who else would be behind one of the most seminal and iconic entries in this subgenre but Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock, the director who specialised in bringing real-world terrors home to his audience.Perhaps the main secret to Psycho's success is the unusual structuring of its screenplay. The adaptation by Joseph Stefano contains more or less all the actual events of the original Robert Bloch novel, except that the emphasis has changed. The novel was told largely from Norman Bates's perspective, with Marion Crane turning up on his doorstep a few chapters in. However the adaptation brings us in to the story with Marion, telling the first half of the narrative through her eyes. This not only provides one of the biggest red herrings in the history of the thriller, it is a really effective way of keying us into the story on the level of an ordinary 'everywoman', albeit one who has stolen a large sum of money, but even this the script goes to lengths to rationalise, embroiling us in her growing paranoia.But the screenplay would be worth little if it wasn't for the fact Hitchcock knows exactly how to present this material. He uses a lot of long takes in the scenes with Janet Leigh, using his roving camera to keep us with her, or at least with her thoughts, as for example when the camera pans down to the pile of money on the bed then over to the suitcase. Such manoeuvres can be very gimmicky and intrusive, so a director can only really get away with them if the picture is otherwise utterly compelling, which of course Psycho is. Hitch contrasts the long takes with a choppy editing pattern when Anthony Perkins is around, as suited to the awkward oddity of his presence. One of the director's finest constructions is the scene where Leigh and Perkins talk together in the parlour, surrounded by all those stuffed birds, a rather long scene, heavy on dialogue, and thus one that could easily become boring. However Hitch creates several modulations in tone simply by varying his angle. For example, when Bates is angered by Marion's suggestion that his mother be put someplace, Perkins is shown in profile, with that predatory owl prominent at the top of the screen, while the contrasting shots of Leigh become close-ups, looking vulnerable with her back to the wall.And one of the biggest keys to the realism (and therefore the ability to disturb) of Psycho is the quality of the acting performances. Janet Leigh plays a very credible game of trying to balance outward calmness and inner turmoil, which is really crucial to make the picture work. If the average audience member is to empathise with her character, we have to believe that she is not some hardened criminal, and that she is racked with guilt and fear of getting caught. Martin Balsam is great too as the easygoing private investigator, making his character likable by the naturalism of his performance. Finest of all however is of course Anthony Perkins, the genius of whose performance is the simplicity and fragility with which he plays Norman Bates, and that edge of menace he suddenly brings out of nowhere. His turn here is ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense, as it treads that line of allowing the audience to be taken in by one red herring, but is also believable in retrospect once the truth is finally revealed.I'll finish with a quick word on the musical score for Psycho. While Bernard Hermann's 'stabbing strings' have been cited and praised as much as virtually every other aspect of the picture, I'm also struck by the similarity between the main theme (the sharp, tense piece that plays over the opening credits and several other scenes) and the penultimate movement of the Russian composer Modeste Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. This latter piece refers to a macabre Slavic folk tale about a witch who kidnaps and murders children. Whether or not the link is deliberate, both pieces of music strike the same tone to suit their grisly and terrifying subject matter.",9,1,2,27 December 2010
Rosemary's Baby," 'Awful things happen in every apartment house'
","Rosemary's Baby was originally proposed as a project to Alfred Hitchcock. He turned it down, and instead it fell to the up-and-coming Polish director Roman Polanski. It's hard to imagine what the master of suspense would have made out of this tale of devil worship and Catholic guilt, even though there is some Hitchockian psychology and mystery at work. As it was however, it proved to be right up the young Polanski's street, taking his career to new heights, and spawning a run of occult horrors in the late 60s and early 70s, of which this is still one of the few greats.Polanski had already established himself as a director most comfortable with the confinement of interiors in films like Repulsion (1965). Here he draws us right into the claustrophobic feel of the upstairs apartment, often placing the camera in a room adjacent to the action, with the characters viewed through a doorway. The camera movement is mostly restricted to pans. It rarely tracks or dollys, as if it were trapped in a corner. Even in the exterior scenes the sky is often sandwiched or blotted out altogether between the buildings rising on either side. The actors often appear uncomfortably close to the camera, but not in individual close-up shots. Instead, they come in that close as they move around the set and the camera pans back and forth. Not only does this add to the cramped, awkward atmosphere, but this constantly changing distancing of actors within a single shots makes the audience feel as if they are actually standing there.Rosemary's Baby may come across as very slow to some viewers. 140 minutes certainly is a long time in the horror genre. There do also appear to be a lot of unnecessary details in the dialogue  we get to find out far more about Rosemary's background than is normal for a character in cinema. But for one thing, Polanski was not interested in making a shock-and-gore horror  Rosemary's Baby is all about the eerie atmosphere, the tension and the mystery. He holds our attention by regularly dropping in clues that something sinister is afoot. Furthermore, all the detail and depth has its significance in the finished product  like the references to Rosemary's Catholic upbringing or the background of the Castavets.Polanski has never overused flashy techniques  no fast editing, zooms or unusual angles that make for a very obvious directorial style. But there is always great complexity and meaning in the look of things  the set design, lighting, costume and so on. One of my favourite touches is Mia Farrow's extremely short Vidal Sassoon hairdo that she has done halfway through the film. With her bony features and pale skin she more and more begins to resemble a skeleton, especially under the carefully placed lighting in the scene after the party when she realises the pain has gone. It's simple yet significant ideas like that which make Polanski one of the best directors of his era.There's some great casting in this picture. Careful choice of character actors makes for some quirky supporting roles. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are perfect in the lead roles. The musical score  that haunting opening melody, or the atonal violin squeaks  all add to the atmosphere.Rosemary's Baby is a real landmark in horror. It helped keep the genre alive by pushing the occult - something fairly taboo, and not fully explored in cinema since the days of silents - to the fore. Also the restrained atmospheric horror was doubtless influential, particularly on Kubrick when he came to make The Shining. It inspired a lot, but was rarely bettered.",9,40,48,26 November 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," 'Beautiful to die'
","It seems almost inconceivable today, or indeed any time in the last sixty-odd years, but there was a period between the two world wars when the United States was deeply anti-militarist, both in public opinion and government policy. This was reflected in the movies of the time, a trend which reached its peak with this 1930 adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's novel All Quiet on the Western Front.An early sound movie, All Quiet on the Western Front features technical feats that, according to some, weren't possible in the first talkies, especially extensive camera movement and outdoor shooting. Director Lewis Milestone it seems couldn't do without having his camera on the go, and All Quiet on the Western Front incidentally contains some of the most graceful examples from his entire career. We open with a crane-shot zooming over a parade of troops and in through a classroom window over the heads of students – a neat and engaging introduction to the movie. There was also a great deal of experimentation with new technology around this point, some of it very effective, such as the juxtaposing of the teacher's voice over the montage of student's imaginings of army life. Milestone's big thing for this movie however is placing the viewer inside the combat, with some dynamic trench-bound point-of-view shots. Importantly, Milestone stages these scenes with a cleverly-orchestrated chaos that eventually makes it nearly impossible to tell one side from the other.But All Quiet on the Western Front is not without a few flaws common to the era. In particular the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Lew Ayres is horribly overwrought, and yet he is still the best of the lead actors. Some of the supporting players seem a little more realistic, but only because they don't have to emote. It's when people get angry or upset in this movie that all credibility goes out of the window. And some scenes feel rather awkwardly constructed and overlong even when they are fairly short. One example of this is the bit when Ayres comforts a French soldier he has fatally stabbed in a shell hole, which was presumably a moving moment in the novel, but here seems stilted and corny.Still, the movie's haunting imagery and clear point-making have made it the touchstone anti-war picture down the generations. However, despite its initial critical and commercial success, its popularity would wax and wane along with attitudes to war, and it would be rarely seen in the gung-ho 40s and 50s. The tendency continues to this day. In 1998 All Quiet on the Western Front was #54 on the American Film Institute's '100 Years 100 Movies' list. When the list was revised in 2007, post-9/11 and post-Iraq war, it did not appear at all.",8,1,1,8 January 2012
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'This is not a game of cricket'
","The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean's first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean's easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the 'intimate' epic of the late 50s and early 60s.We are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.The problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman's multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before – 1952's The Sound Barrier for example – and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.Lean's use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean's crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle – a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director's work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.Lean's handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That's a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn't get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor – check him out in De Mille's The Cheat (1915) – and it's great to see him at the top of his game again here.Bombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean's assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since.",9,9,10,10 May 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'You're not a goddamn loony now!'
","The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for 'hidden' meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see – Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife – are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that 'something' is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the 'chronics' in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene – for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent – a fact that should not be overlooked – but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.",5,7,13,6 February 2011
Bram Stoker's Dracula," 'Lives for the master'
","The story of Dracula has become the keystone horror for each generation of movie makers. From the 1922 German expressionist masterpiece Nosferatu, one of the earliest true horrors, to the 1931 Universal Studios effort that made a star of Bela Lugosi, to the lurid series beginning in 1958 that would become the backbone of Hammer studios, the tale has been repeatedly reinvented for the tastes of each era. And so it continues to this 1992 version produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the godfather of American New Wave cinema.The full title of this adaptation is 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', so Coppola obviously felt a need to emphasise the picture's roots in its source novel. It is true that this version takes much from the novel that the earlier ones leave out – the vampire's ability to transform into various animals, spoken extracts from the diary entries that make up the book's text, although this latter only really serves to highlight some of Stoker's occasionally substandard prose. But it also adds a lot of stuff that is not in the novel, at least not explicitly. Stoker made some references to the real historical figure Vlad the Impaler, but this adaptation makes it overt, and even suggests that Mina is the reincarnation of Vlad's wife. This allows for an emotional and romantic angle that is strangely effective. Coppola and his writing team also gives the story a flagrant sexuality. There is nothing wrong with this per se, yet it often seems cheap the way it is presented and inserted into scenes, like the audience-pleasing smut of an exploitation flick.There are some unusual choices among the cast members. It was risky casting Keanu Reeves in a vampire movie, because there must have been a chance someone would try to hammer him through Gary Oldman's heart. There are numerous layers to his badness here – he is wooden when calm, unconvincing when angered, incapable of an English accent, and pulling of laughable facial expressions. His awfulness serves to distract us from the mere mediocrity of other players like Cary Elwes and Sadie Frost. Anthony Hopkins gives us a Van Helsing with dramatic substance, perhaps a bit out of touch with the movie's extrovert tones, but brilliantly deadpan in several moments of comic relief. It is however only Gary Oldman in the title role and a wonderful Tom Waits as Renfield who really seem to get into the proper spirit of things, both of them hamming it up fabulously.And yes, this is very much a picture of style over substance. Indeed that is really its one saviour. It's something Coppola is good at as a director. There's a breathtaking atmosphere that is often closer to fantasy than horror. Coppola deliberately used old-fashioned special effects, some of which directly reference German silent movies (the rising ring of fire can be seen in the 1926 Faust), and it's nice to see these tricks – each completely seamless – used once more before CGI achieved total dominance. There's also a fantastic sense of rhythm, with crafty cross-cutting building the final chase to a crescendo. The stylised look is reminiscent of the Jean Cocteau directed Beauty and the Beast (1946) – constantly flowing cinematography and dreamlike imagery, something which only works in the context of the fantastical, nightmarish subject matter.And yet despite Coppola's noble efforts to recapture some of the spirit of both the original novel and the aesthetics of his cinematic forebears, there is much about his Dracula that is low and weak – the tawdry sex references, the corny dialogue, the seeming inability to allow a creepy sequence to play out without extrovert shocker moments (the scene where Oldman shaves Reeves would be brilliantly suspenseful if it wasn't for its having three or four ridiculous climaxes). And these really are all common problems of the modern horror movie (despite how much everyone claims to love The Shining with its slow tension, its influence has been negligible). Just like the famous Dracula movies that went before, this one is very much representative of the horror movies of its age.",4,3,5,18 December 2011
Jaws," 'Swims up and bites you on the ass'
","Blockbuster is a bit of a dirty word in 'serious' film commentary. It gets associated with base commercialism, the motion picture as mere product, simple fare with no long-term appeal. But such an assessment does a disservice to the savvy filmmakers who make the hits, as well as the movie-going public who make the box office figures. You can fake art house sophistication, but you can't fake popular approval.Jaws was adapted by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb from Benchley's best-selling novel. In many ways it follows the book closely, but there are some key differences. In the novel the mayor was being pressured by the mafia, and bizarrely enough there was a subplot in which Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife. With these aspects gone we have a story stripped of anything that may introduce a different tone - anything that might have been the focus of another story in its own right. The plot and dialogue are succinct and direct, especially in the earlier scenes. This is not a picture that wastes time getting itself going.And a lot of the racy pacing is down to director Steven Spielberg. Like John Ford before him, Spielberg has great economy of expression, often working two ideas into a single shot. In Roy Scheider's first scene, we get Scheider on the phone in the foreground while his wife tends to their son's injured hand in the background. The details of the phone call aren't important, we just need to know that it happened, and thus Spielberg can afford to balance it with something that demonstrates the significance of our hero's family life. The tenderness Scheider feels towards his two boys is the closest this picture comes to having a subplot, and it is something largely brought out by Spielberg. For example, scenes like the one in which the younger son imitates Scheider's every move were improvised at the director's behest.But more than conciseness, Jaws has dynamism and punch. Like another ace director of the previous generation, Victor Fleming, Spielberg encourages performances that really move. Take a scene like Richard Dreyfuss's inspection of the first victim. Rather than a professional study, the scene is staged like a heated argument, the actors waving their arms and snapping out their lines. Almost always there is movement – characters walk as they talk, or stand before a busy crowd. The few moments of stillness – Scheider with his family, the stirring Indianapolis speech – are those of subtle significance, and their calmness helps them stand out.Of course Spielberg didn't operate in a vacuum. The invigorating style of Jaws is aided immensely by the tight editing of Verna Fields. Fields uses techniques of the art film – jump cuts, rapid edits – but with the difference that her use of them is purely functional, never attention-grabbing or stylistic, and as such she disguises her cuts to make them blend in like finest mise-en-scene. Take the beach scene where Scheider scans the seascape, fearful of another shark attack. Most of the cuts take place as an extra walks across the screen, softening them so that we barely realise the angles are changing.And it all works of course. Take this kind of professionalism, and you can make an exciting, box-office busting thriller about a shark, a dinosaur, a killer truck or whatever. This is why, when all those rip-off shark flicks began to appear (and I don't just mean the Jaws sequels – the more recent Shark Attack franchise makes the Jaws offshoots look like masterpieces) they were invariably awful. They took the premise, killer-sharks-versus-humans, thinking that alone could make a hit. These are the true lowest-common-denominator cash-in trash. If a movie gets audiences flocking in to see it in phenomenal numbers, it surely must be a high-quality piece of entertainment.",8,7,12,7 August 2010
Paths of Glory," 'Let the men have a few minutes more'
","Although Kubrick's films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone, one theme that crops up again and again is a strong anti-war sentiment, and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.In contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick's other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.The light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers' headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.The use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.The casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn't a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.Throughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier's bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it's quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions.",9,87,92,15 October 2006
Raging Bull," 'I'm not an animal'
","Raging Bull, perhaps Martin Scorsese's first fully mature film, sees him taking on a similar task to that of Orson Welles when he made Citizen Kane  that is, to take a very public figure and strip away the layers of myth, hype and stereotyping to reveal the human being. In this case, Scorsese set himself the great challenge of creating something poignant and lyrical out of the harsh and violent life of a professional boxer.As with Citizen Kane (and Lawrence of Arabia, and many other great biopics), Scorsese begins his story with the end result  what La Motta eventually became  then resets to the beginning of his career, and eventually coming full circle. It was probably with this picture Scorsese discovered his forte for the biopic or real-life picture. It's not generally acknowledged, but round about half of Scorsese's features after Raging Bull would either be biographies or at least based upon real events and characters. It was this goal of telling an unknown story and revealing the real person that drove these pictures, and it began here with Raging Bull.As I said, the job was particularly difficult here  it's not easy to create a sympathetic portrait of a paranoid, short-tempered, misogynist brute, but Scorsese appears to have managed it, perhaps more through technique than anything else. First of all, this is Scorsese at his most subjective. There are numerous point-of-view shots, but they are not just there to show what a character is looking at. Scorsese uses his own blend of expressionist techniques  slow motion, blocking out parts of the sound track and emphasising others  to show state of mind. A good example is La Motta's predatory ogling of Vicky the first time he lays eyes on her. Many of these techniques he perfected in Taxi Driver, but equally important in his development up to this point is 1977's New York New York, the most overlooked of Scorsese's pictures. In New York New York Scorsese became more adept with the musical elements of his films  you can see that from opening credits, where he slows down De Niro's aggressive posturing to fit the music until it comes to resemble ballet more than boxing. New York New York gave Scorsese more confidence in telling a story that spans several years, and how to make transitions that convey that passage of time.Of course the fight scenes are the heart of Raging Bull, and they are real tour-de-forces of technique. Scorsese's policy of keeping the camera in the ring and thus keeping the audience inside the experience of the fight was probably in part influenced by Hitchcock's silent boxing drama The Ring (1928), but I'm also very much reminded of a very different film, The Red Shoes. The Red Shoes, one of Scorsese's favourite films, features an extended ballet sequence in which the camera is inside the performance on the stage, and it is has that similar effect of putting us in the performers shoes. Having said all that, probably the greatest contributor to the Raging Bull fights was editor Thelma Schoonmaker (who coincidentally later married Red Shoes director Michael Powell), since its that editing  not just of the fighters but split second flashes of spectators, cameras and the bell  that has the most impact here. Schoonmaker rightly won an Oscar for her efforts.As for the actors, well, for my money Robert De Niro is not a great actor, merely a good one. To be honest I think he mostly attracts attention by the lengths he goes to in preparation for a role, learning professional boxing and getting fat on pasta for Raging Bull being perhaps the most extreme example. More interesting here is the discovery of Joe Pesci. He's one of the few really great character actors of modern cinema, and everything a character actor should be. Cathy Moriarty is also very good as Vicky, and it's a mystery to me why she more or less disappeared as a major actor after this.Raging Bull is an impressive film, one of the later landmarks of the biopic genre, as well being the last word on boxing movies (although sadly they went on making Rocky sequels all the same). It also revitalised Scorsese's career and launched those of several previously unknown actors. It's not the most watchable of Scorsese's pictures but is one of his most significant.",9,3,5,19 November 2007
Ben-Hur," 'A strange, stubborn faith'
","In the 1950s, while the up-and-coming independent studios were focusing on gritty small-scale dramas, the majors eked out the last of their glory days with giant-budget spectacles. While at first it was thought the immensity of these pictures was enough, at some point the studios felt the need to adapt and set off in search of the Holy Grail known as the 'intimate epic'.To this end, it made sense for producer Sam Zimbalist to assign this project to director William Wyler, perhaps the finest director of human interaction who ever lived, but also one who was not afraid of big action scenes or outdoor vistas. Here Wyler shows a good handling of the Cinemascope canvas, making compositions with a lot of depth to them, which evens out and gives definition to the extreme width. He doesn't just do this with the massive sets, but also with the arrangements of people. For example when Messala comes to visit the Hur household, we see Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd in the foreground at opposite ends of the screen, and beyond them Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell slightly closer to screen centre. This creates a kind of perspective effect which draws the viewer in and focuses us on the actors.But a production of this size cannot be made on the efforts of its director alone. Wyler is backed up by a distinguished technical crew, and in fact perhaps Wyler's biggest contribution was how closely he seems to have worked with them, in particular cinematographer Robert Surtees. While the photography in Ben-Hur is rarely exquisite, it is extremely well-tailored to the moods and dramatic necessities of the picture. One of Wyler's trademarks was keeping to very selective angles, for example having an actor's back to the camera, or part of their face obscured behind a bit of scenery, so as only to show certain facets of their performance. Here he does not shoot with such stark variations, and mostly keeps the players in side-view mid-shots with long takes. However Surtees does a Wyler-type job with his lighting, for example keeping Haya Harareet's face well lit while her body is in darkness, capturing and emphasising her reactions, which are the best part of her performance, such as her shocked look when she is first kissed by Heston. For Heston himself, Surtees uses heavy contrast lighting, which makes the actor's face appear more expressive (and, I have to say, more handsome) than it actually is. Other than this, Surtees's biggest coup is his extraordinary nighttime photography which makes the nativity scene and the romantic meetings between Heston and Harareet truly outstanding.Other honourable mentions go to film editors Ralph Winters and John Dunning, and composer Miklos Rosza. It is the editing process which really makes the handful of action sequences work, especially that of Jack Hawkins urging the rowers to greater speeds, which is a delightfully intense montage of a kind rarely seen in classic-era Hollywood. Rosza's score is both stupendous and lavish, as his often were, utilizing some rather complex arrangements, with counter-melodies audible beneath the main themes. It's a score that can easily change moods to suit the scene, but also sounds authentic for the times being dealt with.Wyler and Zimbalist were sticklers for authenticity, and one example of this I am quite impressed with is that the nails go through Christ's wrists, not his palms, which is historically accurate. There is one rather glaring error though – the depiction of the lepers. 1959 was a good year for leprosy on screen, from the use of real victims in The Nun's Story to the awesomely nonsensical zombie-lepers in Fritz Lang's Indian diptych. However, according to the MGM makeup department, leprosy looks like a mild case of acne – rather an anticlimax after all the fuss made over it by the characters.The cast of Ben-Hur is frankly a bit of predictable box-ticking. People like Heston, Hawkins and Finlay Currie were an established part of ancient-world epic furniture, and the rest of the cast is filled by the usual assortment of respected theatre actors. Still, why complain when each is doing a good job? Heston is for once not the embarrassing lump of wood he normally was. His vocal delivery still leaves something to be desired but his emoting is spot on. Haya Harareet manages to stand out in what is a rather small role despite its being technically the female lead, and it is her contribution that makes the romantic angle work. I feel the Oscar for best supporting actor should have gone to Stephen Boyd and not Hugh Griffith. Boyd's performance is one of the more theatrical but it is also the most elaborate in that league – look at those tiny significant gestures he makes, such as a little rubbing of his thumb as he grasps Heston's arm in friendship. Admittedly though Griffith's lively appearance is very refreshing after the waves of pomposity, and I am faintly amused by the fact he sounds incredibly Welsh.So, were Zimbalist and Wyler successful in creating an 'intimate epic'? No, not quite. They should have taken a tip from the recently-deceased Cecil B. DeMille. These ancient tales were so far removed from viewers' reality that any attempt at emotional sincerity was bound to fail, and the most entertaining epics are those that simply revel in their breathtaking grandiosity. Still, Ben-Hur contains much to enthral us, and in one respect shows the superiority of the vertically-integrated studio system. Although the system's glory days were over, the studios could still be trusted to bring together a tight and professional creative team who could all work towards the same goal. Perhaps the most poignant thing about Ben-Hur is that it is one of that system's final triumphs.",8,0,2,22 December 2009
Kagemusha," 'The shadow of a man'
","Akira Kurosawa, acclaimed Japanese film writer and director, is probably best known in the west via his influence on many notable new wave era filmmakers. Here two of those Kurosawa acolytes, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, repaid the debt as it were by helping to finance the Japanese veteran's most ambitious and stupendous epic yet. In spite of its grandeur, Kurosawa would later dismiss Kagemusha as a mere 'dress rehearsal' for Ran, his even vaster epic of 1985. But when watching this earlier picture's awesome pageantry and historical re-enactment, one's likely response is 'some rehearsal!' Kagemusha takes Kurosawa back to his biggest hits of the 1950s, being set in war-torn feudal Japan. However the focus is very different, moving away from the peasants, bandits and disgraced warriors as protagonists and small-scale human relations as his themes, now looking at the machinations of the highest echelon of that society, with an often cold and distant eye. Since his 1971 suicide attempt Kurosawa seemed to become more cynical and detached from human affairs, not just as a writer but also in his technical style as a director. Kagemusha contains very few close-ups, with even key dialogue scenes filmed with vast gaps between camera and actors, and objective god-shots for the busier scenes.And yet there are similarities here with Kurosawa's much earlier pictures, especially in the director's aesthetic use of movement and stillness within the frame. Check out the scene in which the soldiers hear an enemy playing a flute from across the lines. The men are completely motionless, and the only movement is a flickering fire in the background and the occasional twitch of a flag in the breeze. It makes for a considerably mystical moment. But this approach has a function beyond the aesthetic. The opening scene, filmed all in one shot, shows Lord Shingen, the impersonator (both played by Tatsuya Nakadai) and Nobukado (Tsotomu Yamazaki) all sat in the throne room. The impersonator does not speak until near the end of the scene, but our eyes are drawn to him because of his movements – the occasional change in posture or flash of the eyes – and the comparative stillness of the other two. This long unbroken take means the room, with its great floral crest, is imposed into our minds, and resonates later on when we see Nakadai in the same room, now instated as the lord.And despite the distances between camera and cast, the colourful costumes against plain backdrops really puts an emphasis on the people in Kagemusha, allowing them to express themselves through body language more than facial expression. Lead man Tatsuya Nakadai is really adept at this, putting so much feeling into a shrug of his shoulders or a turn of his head. When you see, in this picture, the complex vocal arrangements and stylised movements of the Noh troupe, or the drummers who are able to make two strikes a fraction of a beat apart, you see examples of precise co-ordination in many formal rituals of Japanese culture. Nakadai has that same precision and control over his body, and turns them towards both theatrical gesture and realist reaction. And in those one or two cases in which we get to see his face close-up we see his talent there too, an ability to display a real look of emotional injury.So far there is very little I have said about Kagemusha that one could not also say about the later epic Ran, with the exception of Ran being a little an even bigger production and a little more stylised. So perhaps Kurosawa was right to think of the earlier picture as being a lesser forerunner to the later one. And yet, Kagemusha has the edge over Ran in one aspect. Whereas Ran is a totally dismal and inhumane affair, Kagemusha retains the heart and humanism of Kurosawa's older pictures. Composer Shinichiro Ikebe provides a rousing orchestral score, shot through with a touch of melancholy, and this beautifully matches the tone of the whole piece. It may lack the hopeful message of Seven Samurai or Rashomon, but it has the same warm regard for its characters that, even with a more objective eye, Kurosawa allows us to share in.",9,2,2,19 February 2011
Rear Window," 'A cold and lonely, lovely work of art'
","A director's ego can ruin a picture. Young film-makers want to get noticed, and drown their work in showy and obvious technique. This is a problem with Alfred Hitchcock's earliest efforts, where his aims were the same as they ever were; yet his means were contrived and jarringly noticeable – dissolves, whip pans, double-exposures – camera tricks that draw attention to the artificial nature of the business. Luckily, by the 1950s he had learnt that his reputation was far better served by staying within the realms of cinematic convention, and learning to employ it to suit the story's needs.Like Rope, an earlier Hitchcock thriller set entirely in one apartment, Rear Window is a based around a unique and unusual premise. But it is an oddity only in terms of story and setting. As far as the mechanics of cinema go, it is an unpretentious deployment of long-shots, mid-shots and close-ups, basic camera moves and functional shot compositions. It just so happens that Hitchcock is using these methods exceptionally well. And, mundane as they may seem, he is using them to create electrifying suspense.Of course, one of the most important and simple 'rules' of the shooting Rear Window is that, even though the focus is outside, the camera stays within James Stewart's apartment. But it's not enough for Hitch to make us look out of that window, he has to make us want to look. He starts this before the little neighbourhood drama even begins, just making the exterior slightly more pleasing to the eye than the interior. A less intelligent director might do this with vibrant colour schemes or freakish shadows, but Hitch keeps everything naturalistic and unobtrusive – whites and greys for the apartment, warmer browns and oranges for the courtyard. And while there are many (wonderful) subplots within the various homes, Hitch has to gradually draw our attention to that of the Thorwalds. Again, he does the opposite of what a naïve director might do – he makes the Thorwalds' apartment the plainest, with small windows, no creeping plants or drainpipes on the walls outside, sparse décor inside. This means when the camera is pointing at that apartment, we are completely focused on what goes on inside it.There is a delicate balance going on in Rear Window, because while the events going on outside the window must hold our interest, what goes on inside the apartment must put up healthy competition. If we cannot sympathise with Stewart or worry for Grace Kelly, the picture would lose all sense of danger. The love story between these two is given just enough weight in the screenplay for this to work without distracting us from the main business of the story, but Hitchcock helps even more, ensuring that at the start of the scenes between Stewart and Kelly the focus is always inward, making us forget the outside for a second. Then, gradually he brings the window back to our attention with lighting and shot composition, pre-empting Stewart broaching the subject of his suspicions. The upshot of this is that we should now like these characters, but also be as interested in the goings-on outside as they are. Hitch is aware that we will also become caught up in their mounting fear, and start to feel conscious about not being spotted. He begins to add some foreground framing in the exterior shots as if we, via the camera, are hiding.One of the great things about a picture made of fewer elements, is there is less that can go wrong. This is especially true when you only have a handful of cast members. James Stewart did not do his best work with Hitchcock, but he played some of his most, shall we say, appropriate roles for the Master of Suspense. As the innocent yet strong-willed 'everyman', he was not so much required to act as to simply be. His L.B. Jeffries could be the lead in a vacuous comedy, and here he allows just a little pressure to be applied to his regular persona, breaking into a sweat once or twice but never coming near the breaking point he would reach in Vertigo. Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey are also simply there to fit their usual types, and each delivers a steady performance without once stepping outside their comfort zone. But who cares that the actors are not stretched? After all, the real drama is going on outside.",10,1,4,12 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 'Songs for great halls'
","Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time – such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin – are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says 'So passes Denethor' when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before.",9,8,11,26 April 2012
Casino," 'He'll keep coming back until one of you is dead'
","Repetition occurs in cinema at every level. If something is successful, highbrow or lowbrow, there is a good chance that those responsible will simply rerun the formula to get the same result. In 1990 iconic gangster movie and filmmaker's favourite Goodfellas was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by Nicholas Pileggi, and starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In 1995 gangster movie Casino was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by You get the idea.Admittedly Scorsese and Pileggi did work well together, the director illustrating the writer's every word with a well-placed pan or close-up. It's a bit dizzying and the constant musical switching gets a bit tiresome, but you still have to admire the craftsmanship that goes into a picture like this, especially in Scorsese's meticulously planned tracking shots. There's one near the beginning where we follow the skimmer into the casino, and the camera eagerly overtakes him as he heads towards the counting room, really engaging us in what's going on. Or there's the tracking shot at the wedding, where Sharon Stone's flick of her head seems to propel the camera on to the next table. It's a very artificial, obtrusive way of making a movie, but it is nevertheless carefully designed to involve us in the story's world.This was the eighth, and to date, the final time Robert De Niro has starred in a Scorsese movie, and this is predictably familiar ground for him. Sam Rothstein is really just a slightly more relaxed version of the De Niro character in Goodfellas. De Niro can at least do menacing without using his fists, and of note is his articulation of the word 'dead' when he threatens his wife. Joe Pesci's role here is nigh-on identical to the one that earned him an Oscar in Goodfellas. He's good at it though. Look at how he stabs up the man with the pen; he really gives the impression of a little guy who's had to get the kicks in quick to survive. But reliable as these two are there is very much a sense with De Niro and Pesci that they are going through the old familiar motions. The real standout in the movie is Sharon Stone. For this part she has to be angry, tearful and drugged-up, as do a lot of actresses, but to do so for such a large chunk of the movie and remain believable throughout, never slipping into over-the-top hysterics, is admirable.Being a repetition of Goodfellas doesn't necessarily make Casino a weaker movie. It has almost all the same merits and flaws as its predecessor. It is perhaps a little more lacking in true drama and comes closer to a documentary, at times being little more than a list of anecdotes, which makes the nearly three hour runtime a little wearing. One area which, for me, made Casino stand-out was its costume design. Garish as they are, there's a mad kind of co-ordination in Rothstein's suits. There are plenty of other tawdry yet outstanding outfits throughout the movie, such as an Ace of Hearts dress worn by a bit player. Sharon Stone's leather suit in her climactic scenes is memorably striking, and as such helps to highlight the fact that she's been in the same clothes for several days. For me, it's the clothes more than anything else which evoke the misguided glamour of Casino and its denizens. Unfortunately, this isn't what people tend to consider in the gangster movie, so it seems to have gone largely unnoticed",7,1,2,1 February 2012
Ran," 'Barren of loyalty and feeling'
","Akira Kurosawa is renowned both in the west and at home as one of the world's finest filmmakers, in large part thanks to his many historical pictures. Made towards the end of his career, Ran is the last in a long line of Kurosawa features set amid the chaos of Japan's feudal past. But this time around there are none of the downtrodden samurai and gnarly-toothed peasants so familiar from his 1950s classics. Ran is not an intimate human portrait as Rashomon, Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress were. This is a vast epic of battles and warlords, the bloody historical backdrop against which those earlier, small-scale stories would have taken place.Kurosawa himself was now in a very different phase in his career. He keeps the camera back from the action, a cold and objective eye. His however is still very much a cinema based around movement, rhythm and tone. Take the opening shots over which the credits are played, picture-postcard tableaux of horsemen, the occasional turn of a head or flick of a tail the only thing to tell these are not stills. Set to the haunting whistle of a Japanese reed flute, it's a perfectionist evocation of the calm before the storm. Throughout the picture staging, pacing, colour and sound are all precisely tuned to the needs of the scene. Often a shot will be held for longer than strictly necessary purely for the sake of rhythmic balance (Kurosawa did his own editing). But it's not all about aesthetics. Some of the artier looking shots also serve to give the story more depth, such as the attention-grabbing close-up of the helmet when Kaede seduces Jiro, which visually corresponds to Hidetora's grass 'crown' in the following scene, the comparison between the two reminding us how great the shift in power has been.The acting in Ran is as much a matter of stylisation as the direction. Taking inspiration from Noh (a Japanese theatre tradition comparable to opera) lead man Tatsuya Nakadai makes exaggerated gesture of even the most normal action, for example wiping his fingers clean with military snap after signing the document that relinquishes his power. It's not a realistic or emotive way of performing but it fits in with the tone of the whole piece. And as with a stage production, the focus here is much more on figures than faces. Of the other cast members Mieko Harada is particularly good as Lady Kaede. She has a wonderful wavering voice like one of the reed flutes prevalent in the score, and is deeply expressive. It's great fun to see the exuberant stage performer Peter playing the fool, and also Hitoshi Ueki (Lord Fujimaki), a popular comic actor who seems to me like a Japanese Clive Swift.For all its stylistic precision, Ran can make for difficult viewing, not because of its length or cultural barriers, but because of its utter bleakness. It is not just in scope that it differs from the Kurosawa pictures of previous decades, it also foregoes the heart and humanism that made those earlier affairs so affecting. Ran is one of the most aesthetically beautiful films ever made, and is certainly a powerful commentary on the war-torn chaos of the twentieth century, but it seems slightly sad that Kurosawa has rejected making an emotional connection with his audience.",9,0,2,19 March 2011
Jackie Brown," 'Didn't I blow your mind this time?'
","These days, when a director becomes a household name, there's a pressure on them to live up to their established reputation. If the formula changes the fans don't take it well. This is at least partly thanks to the auteur theory, which tends to value a director's work on its consistency rather than the actual quality of each movie. After his revolutionary hit Pulp Fiction, his follow-up Jackie Brown was not exactly a flop, but its reception among critiques, awards ceremonies and the general chitchat of Tarantino aficionados was somewhat lukewarm compared to the raging success of Pulp Fiction. What was wrong?Jackie Brown differs from previous Tarantino projects in that it is adapted from a novel, rather than being an original screenplay straight from the director's brain (albeit filtered through his many cinematic influences). It contains rather less of the dialogue-for-dialogue's sake that was so integral to the appeal of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, so no 'Royale with Cheese' business here. It still has plenty of cracking dialogue in pursuit of plot though, and scenes such as Lewis trying to explain what went wrong with the switch are glowing examples of Tarantino's black humour. Overall it's a finely constructed thing, a nod towards the lovers-in-crime sub-genre of film noir as much as it is a stylistic homage to blaxploitation. And perhaps it's those romantic undertones and the slightly more low-key violence that put off many of the less broadminded Tarantino admirers.Always something of a minimalist behind the camera, Tarantino's visual style here is at its most simple. Like a Sergio Leone picture, every scene basically boils down to a stand-off between two characters. Tarantino mostly eschews camera movement, just giving us stripped-down shots of people glaring at each other. Of course some may miss the more flamboyant touches that could be seen in his earlier movies, but for the sake of story and character, he is better without them. Special mention must be made of the music in Jackie Brown. Tarantino is of course known for his use of popular music soundtracks, but here it is more apt and co-ordinated than ever. The opening sequence is perfectly timed to 'Across 110th Street', the aching melody and lyrics setting the tone of the whole movie as Pam Grier strides along to the beat. At other times the soundtrack is even witty, as when Robert Forster steps out of the changing room. Tarantino should try making a musical one day. It'd be amazing.The simplicity of Tarantino's approach has given more prominence to the cast. Blaxploitation star Pam Grier here gets her most significant role in years, slotting into Tarantino-world with ease and confidence. She has a lot of silences – her refusal to answer when she's asked if the envelope can be searched, the long close-up of her while Michael Bowen interrogates her offscreen – but she constantly acts through them, subtle reactions flickering across her face. Crucially she has the necessary strength of character to make us believe she would stand up to cops and gangsters. Other honourable mentions must also go to Robert De Niro, bringing presence to his small part, and his unlikely but fruitful pairing with Bridget Fonda, who matches him for comical delivery.Jackie Brown clearly lacks the superficial pizazz and deconstructed narrative that wowed everyone in Pulp Fiction, but in its place there is a clear, strong story arc and a slightly more human, emotional slant. To my mind that's more than a fair exchange. But perhaps it's most helpful not to consider what it is or is not in comparison to its predecessor. Jackie Brown is an excellent movie in its own right.",9,6,8,20 February 2012
Saboteur," 'I'm willing to back my taste with the necessary force'
","Saboteur is the second of three wartime propaganda thrillers that Hitchcock directed. Espionage adventures like this had made up the bulk of his mid-to-late 30s work in Britain, and Saboteur provides some good examples of the very precise method he had by now developed.Important to these thrillers was the idea that this could happen to anyone, and it was not enough simply to create an honest John Doe character - he had to show the hero's ordinariness, that he was a random victim. This was before Hitch began using the device of panning over a city before homing in on one window, but he achieves a similar effect here with protagonist Robert Cummings emerging as a face in the crowd of factory workers. For different reasons, it was also important to establish the villain as an apparently non-threatening family man - the last person anyone would suspect. Hence we first see Otto Kruger playing with his granddaughter.Once he has established that his hero is an average Joe, Hitchcock's aim is to keep us with the character and draw us into his experiences. We of course have plenty of point-of-view shots so we see what he sees, and these are not only used to show us information, but also to reveal his paranoid state - for example with those ironic billboard slogans. A subtler but equally effective trick is to cut to a close reaction shot while another character is talking. This is done for example in the scene where he gets a lift from a truck driver. As the driver prattles away, we see them both framed together, but whenever he says something worth listening to, we cut to a closeup of Cummings. This not only draws your attention to crucial information, it also really focuses you on the character's thoughts.Finally, to keep us watching Hitchcock needed to keep the action balanced and varied. Each of Cummings' escapes is played for a different effect. When he gives little Suzi a piggy-back to prevent his getting shot at, we are impressed by his cunning. The scene in the river is pure nail-biting action, whereas cutting through the handcuffs is an exercise in race-against-time tension. The episode with the blind man is a neat little reference to Bride of Frankenstein, drawing the parallel between the outcast monster and the innocent fugitive. This sequence also contains some of the picture's few decent gags, and is marred only by the appalling acting of Vaughan Glaser.Speaking of acting, this is unfortunately one of the blandest casts Hitchcock ever worked with, Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane being ironically very average leads. None of the supporting players really stands out, with one exception: Otto Kruger, who brilliantly manages to capture that blend of decency and villainy. Add to this dull cast a lifeless screenplay, full of patriotic rhetoric - understandable in the circumstances, but still rather clunky and clichéd - and short on wit and sparkle. The score is by Frank Skinner, one in a long line of composers who failed to get Hitchcock's style.For all the meticulous construction of Hitchcock's Hollywood pictures, he had already made his best espionage adventures in England in the 30s. I think films like The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes were more effective simply because they were successful at merging comedy and action, with a lively cast that made them fun and breezy. Saboteur has plenty of strong set pieces, but is otherwise fairly flat. Conversely though, Hitch's mastery of his method was beginning to pay dividends in his domestic crime thrillers, as can be seen in his next feature, Shadow of Doubt.",6,8,11,21 February 2009
Gangs of New York," 'Criminal's braggadocio'
","Over the years, Martin Scorsese has established himself as the cinematic biographer of New York City. In Gangs of New York, he recounts one of its lesser-known but intensely fascinating chapters, in what was a long-cherished project. Like The Last Temptation of Christ, a similarly personal picture, it seems a perfect vehicle for his ostentatious directorial style.The inspiration for this movie was a non-fiction book of the same title and screenwriters Jay Cocks, Steve Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan have woven a decent action story around a few kernels of historical truth and half-truth. The documentary-like detail is there, although it's more about period background than recreating events, as the main plot is largely fiction. Within this plot certain themes are writ large - the honour of one-on-one combat, the idea of revenge as something almost sacred, the hero's coming of age and so forth. There's also lots of rather obvious religious symbolism both in the script and Scorsese's imagery – the bible in the water, the rosary beads tossed aside, crucifixes popping up all over. There's even a bit of a Christ allegory going on with Amsterdam's betrayal by the Judas-like Johnny and his subsequent resurrection. It's clichéd, to be sure, but it's rather good fun too.And Scorsese's portrayal of old New York is as surreal and baroque as it is factual. No doubt this was a strange time and place to be around in, but Scorsese whoops it up to almost operatic proportions. Take for example, in the opening scenes, the various gangs' campy self-introductions, or Daniel Day-Lewis's top hat disappearing off the top of the screen like it goes on into infinity. To be honest, it's all a far better match for Scorsese's zooming, swooping camera-work than his straighter dramas were. Scorsese also gets big plus points for doing almost all of it with real people and real sets without resorting to CGI. The movie looks far richer and livelier for it.This was the director's first outing with his new fave lead man Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is not exceptional here – it's simply another good-looking hero role that doesn't tax him much. The part that commands most attention is that of Daniel Day-Lewis. His ability to disappear into a role so different from his real background and persona is commendable, though at times his Bill Cutting comes across as a hammy impression of Robert De Niro. But such theatricality is all very much part and parcel of Gangs of New York. Many of the smaller parts are in a similarly extravagant vein; most worthy of mention are Gary Lewis and Jim Broadbent.Stylised as it is, the movie couldn't really afford to be too esoteric, and there are a fair few concessions to commercialism. Some moments have a modern action gloss, typified by the 'schwoomp' noise when we zoom in on Day-Lewis's glass eye. Then there's the fact that, even though the script says DiCaprio will 'walk among you as a freak' his scarring only amounts to a faint white blotch; actually marring his pretty-boy features presumably not being viable. But these are minor quibbles. From its haunting introduction to its apocalyptic finale, Gangs of New York makes a mighty yarn.",9,0,0,1 April 2012
Gladiator," 'There was a dream that was Rome'
","Historical epics set in the classical antiquity were a cinematic staple for a long period in the post war era. The genre died a death in the mid-60s, and even though big historical pictures did crop up from time to time, the Sword-and-Sandal format of Ben Hur and Spartacus seemed vanished. That is, until Gladiator. All at once, the vast ancient-world movie was back. Hollywood and the cinema-going public welcomed it with open arms.Of course, movies don't quite look the same now as they once did. One of the biggest changes in cinema since then is not one of style but one of logistics. Back in the 1950s you could put out a call for a few thousand men, give them all a free meal and a tin hat, and hey presto, you had an army. Now, every extra must be paid properly and you just can't afford masses of them. That extras are getting their due is a good thing, but it has changed the way we make movies. It's one of the reasons why CGI became so widespread – it's essentially a cheap option. However with Gladiator, Ridley Scott has done something Cecil B. DeMille used to do during The Great Depression, back when he was the only person mad enough to make epics in that cash-strapped era. He employs a mix of rapid editing and obscure cinematography to make it look like there's a lot more in the frame than there really is*. It's a neat trick and it works fairly well in battle and crowd scenes. The only trouble is the style is used for much of the picture, and it is somewhat tiresome to see a simple dialogue scene chopped up into a bewildering mess of shaky close-ups.Back in the Sword-and-Sandal heyday there were certain actors who were associated with the genre. Now that the format was being revived, it would be a gamble finding their modern equivalents. Luckily, I can't think of any contemporary player better than Russell Crowe for this job. He has that rugged tough-guy look, but with a quiet dignity that is absolutely in tune with the notion of Romans as civilized warriors. While his performance does not have any exceptional moments, its strength is in his overall embodiment of the character of Maximus, convincing us that he is every inch a general who leads from the front. Also very good is Oliver Reed, bringing a bit of old-style presence to the proceedings, and a slightly pervy Joaquin Phoenix.There is one final big difference between Gladiator and its predecessors. The older epics were almost always religious movies, with stories taken from the bible or the days of the early Christians. However, where those '50s pictures were religious, Gladiator is spiritual. There are no miracles or grandiose sermons here, just one man's very fervent belief in an afterlife. And while this is still just a piece of mythology, its context here – the hope of reunion with his murdered family – is incredibly touching, and is effectively what binds the whole movie together. In fact, Gladiator is arguably the first epic to achieve what so many of the earlier examples strove so hard to be – an epic that is also intimate.*Note that there is some CGI in Gladiator, but it's relatively minimal and is even comparable to the use of matt paintings in those '50s epics.",8,1,2,12 March 2012
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'X marks the spot'
","A good franchise has to tread a fine balance. On the one hand it must adapt as it goes along; audiences don't like to simply have the same movie rehashed every couple of years. But then again, you can't mess too much with a winning formula, and each successive picture must contain all the basic elements that made the original a hit. This third instalment of 1980s neo-swashbuckling Indiana Jones series builds on its household-name character, giving him a backstory and a family. It's a move which opens up several new possibilities without taking the franchise in too unfamiliar a direction.Last Crusade is the most dramatic and human of the trilogy, giving us a story arc (no Raiders-related pun intended) regarding Indy's reconciliation with his estranged father. Following on from the thing about giving the rock back to the village at the end of Temple of Doom, there is very much a sense of what's important and what's not, except here it's family and friendship that are the stakes. Not only is Jones, Sr. included as a major character, Marcus Brody and Sallah are reprised from the first movie, now playing more significant parts in the action. And Indy is betrayed by some of his new companions, making the older ties seem all the more significant. The screenplay was written by the bizarre combination of Jeffrey Boam and Tom Stoppard (although the two didn't work together, Stoppard doing a rewrite of Boam's earlier drafts). It's a testament to the skill of those two renowned writers that they can include all these ideas, make them work, and not detract at all from this being in body a rip-roaring action adventure. And of course its raison d'etre is still to be an action movie, but beginning and ending as it does with the relationship between the Joneses it gives the intervening adventure so much more meaning.Spielberg's style as a director has not changed exceptionally; he still likes to show key moments indirectly, focusing on close-ups of hands and props, but here it's used to add a layer of delicacy, showing us things in a tentative manner. For example, when Donovan tells Indy that his father has gone missing, Indy is holding his hat in the foreground. The hat dips slightly, giving us the merest hint of an emotional reaction from our stalwart hero. In the same scene there's an interesting juxtaposition, as Donovan tells Indy about the life-giving powers of the grail over a close-up of him pouring out champagne. In contrast, the action sequences are shot with simplicity and clarity, in nice straightforward mid-shots – quite unlike the confused mess of close-ups you get in today's action movies. As always the escapades have a lot of comedy to them, and Spielberg's no-frills approach to them is not unlike that of the great slapstick directors.The scope of Last Crusade introduces several crucial new figures to the Indiana Jones universe, and Spielberg has chosen his supporting actors wisely. The first who deserves a mention is River Phoenix, perhaps the most impressive youth actor since James Dean, and like Dean he sadly didn't live far into adulthood. Phoenix doesn't get to do much deep acting here, but what is neat is how he imitates Harrison Ford's stance and manners, giving us a very believable depiction of the young Indy. Then there's Sean Connery playing Indy's dad. Connery was cast in a nod towards his James Bond days, but the part is very different to the debonair persona of Bond and the many other heroes Connery played. Still, he proves himself to be very apt at playing the bumbling old professor. And yet there is an occasional forcefulness to his performance which, as with Phoenix, makes him appear a plausible member of the Jones household. Last Crusade also gives us a nice opportunity to see the delightful Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies in larger roles. Ford himself appears to have more fun with the part than ever before, the character now clearly fitting him like a glove. I love the scene in which puts on a bad Scots accent, presumably a tongue-in-cheek reference to Connery's unshakeable brogue. Then, again we also get to see Alexei Sayle playing Arabic with a hint of Liverpudlian.Last Crusade is not quite the best of the Indy movies. I find the business with the Grail and eternal life to be a bit less engaging than the Arc of the Covenant or the Sivalinga stones, as well as prone to plot holes. However, the theme of family loyalty and forgiveness is the real point of this story, which is perhaps why the Holy Grail angle is a little underdeveloped. In any case, the father-son dynamic more than makes up for any flaws in the plot, and makes this a fitting coda to a hugely enjoyable trilogy. I'm just glad Spielberg and co. decided to keep the Indy series as a purely 80s phenomenon, quitting while they were ahead and leaving us with just the three canonical classics. Oh, hang on, they did make another one didn't they? Oh dearie me",8,1,2,8 April 2011
Goodfellas," 'Bustin' balls'
","The gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with The Godfather pictures in the 1970s. Such classics soon become clichés and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (Prizzi's Honor, Married to the Mob). Goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks.Goodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. And storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. Most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. It's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. But there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. Take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with 'Spider'. These go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. Writers Nicholas Pilleggi and Martin Scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco arguing. This demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. The vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which Quentin Tarantino would soon specialise in.Martin Scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. Like Hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. In effect he's illustrating Henry Hill's words. And often he's showing a little more than that. Sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. There are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. In one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. The camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. We are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. Of course, a lot of Scorsese's technical business here – the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. But so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together.There is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. We don't really get to see the performances at their best. Poor old Ray Liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. The same goes for Lorraine Bracco. Robert De Niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other Italian American gangsters he has played in his career. The only player who really comes out well here is Joe Pesci. Pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. It also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece.Coming from the peak in Scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, Goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. The only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. Old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start.",7,1,2,19 April 2011
The Birds," 'Poor things'
","An unusual picture this, one of the earliest examples of animal horror, and the only Alfred Hitchcock film with supernatural elements. Still, atypical as its subject matter is, the business of building up tension and thrilling the audience was by now simply a case of going through the motions for Master of Suspense Hitchcock.The line between horror and thriller was always vague in Hitch's work, since while most of his pictures are generally categorised as the latter, they always work upon scaring and unsettling the viewer. It is unsurprising then that despite the mysterious nature of the bird attacks the director still uses many of the same techniques as he would to build up suspense over a murderer on the prowl. There's usually a period of silence, or at least without dialogue in the build-up to each attack – this is in contrast to the extended scenes of discussion after the tension of a bird attack has been diffused. There's one scene where Veronica Cartwright is distraught after an attack, but she remains silent while there is still danger around, beginning to talk only once they are safe in the car. This switching between normal human chatter and eerie silence or bird noises is really effective in the pacing of the movie. There's also a great use of space, for example in the famous scene with the crows outside the school. There's a shot of Tippi Hedren with the jungle gym, as yet empty, behind her. The empty space is conspicuously against normal cinematic convention and we expect something to fill it. Later on we start to become nervous and suspicious of every empty spot as a potential source of attack.An honourable mention should also go to the amazing process shots devised by Ub Iwerks, the original and unsung genius of the Disney studios. His trickery with the layers of birds effect is more or less seamless in credibility, unlike the rather clunky-looking bluescreen shots that Hitchcock seriously overuses here.Evan Hunter's screenplay structures the bird war phenomenon around a story of love and jealousy, and if this is to work as a proper counterpoint then there need to be some decent acting performances amongst all the special effects and suspenseful technique. Although his is not often referenced, I feel the best performance here is that of Rod Taylor. He seems to react most plausibly the birds, giving a portrayal of a man who acts best under pressure. Suzanne Pleshette is very good too, subtly showing the audience her hidden thoughts on the situation between Taylor and Hedren. Jessica Tandy does a fine job as well, although unfortunately in her best scene (where she tells Hedren about her late husband) she is shot from a rather aloof angle and she isn't really shown to her advantage – perhaps because Hitch didn't want to unbalance the bird war theme by getting too maudlin at this point.And to be honest, the human side of the story could have done with some more work. The way Taylor and Hedren are initially set up does not make them especially likable, and in many ways seems a little far-fetched, in basically what amounts to stalking, with friendly locals all willing to give away someone's details to a complete stranger. And while the build-up to individual bird attacks is masterful, the bird war as a whole peaks too early, and there are some disappointments later in the picture. The Birds has a great idea at its heart and some fabulous individual moments, but this isn't enough. All in all, it's a technical picture, not a good piece of storytelling.",7,4,6,29 December 2010
Beetlejuice," 'The strange and unusual'
","It's difficult to make a truly scary horror these days, simply because the staples of the genre have become so familiar culturally. A Dracula in a dinner jacket or Frankenstein's monster with a bolt through his neck nowadays appear more comical than creepy. And there's always been a fine line between what frightens us and what makes us laugh – in both cases it's the twisted and the offbeat. Perhaps this is why horror spoofs have the potential to be so rich and enjoyable.Beetlejuice takes a cunning idea for its story, with similarities to classic afterlife fantasy pictures like Here Comes Mr Jordan, but with an Addams Family slant thrown into the mix. The development of this plot was not a straightforward one. Michael McDowell's original script was much darker and more violent, and somewhat more complex. As well as adding a good-natured comedic tone, the Warren Skaaren rewrite is incredibly succinct in its storytelling. The Maitlands are introduced with expert brevity – in just a couple of minutes and a few lines of dialogue we know all about their idyllic lifestyle, and their only regret being that they don't have children. The narrative then wastes no time in killing them off and getting the real story going. How many lesser pictures would have faffed around for ten or fifteen minutes before getting to this crucial plot point? Integral to the overall look of Beetlejuice is its having been directed by Tim Burton. Credits may go to various individuals for production design and visual effects, but it's fairly clear they are all working from Burton's own sketches. In interviews Burton often claims to have little formal knowledge of classic cinema, but his tribute to German expressionism is especially clear in this picture, although for Burton it is largely employed for his own bizarre aesthetics. Incidentally I also spy a nod towards the work of Dutch painter Vermeer in the shot where Lydia writes her would-be suicide note. And there's much more to Burton's visual scheme than simple design. He often begins a scene with close-ups or mid-shots, rather than a wide, establishing shot, so that we don't really get a proper impression of the space in which the action is taking place. Another ace director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus) uses a similar tactic, but whereas Forman does it to focus us more on the performances, Burton's aim seems to be largely to disconcert and disorientate the viewer. After all, Burton does emphasise the settings, throwing in bizarrely angled outdoor shots and props overhanging the foreground. Again it's all calculated to make the movie's world as weird as possible. But none of this is ever exaggerated enough to distract us from story and character.Not that we are likely to lose sight of characters when the acting performances are so attention-grabbing. At the heart of it all is Michael Keaton's wild portrayal of the titular antagonist. There's so much going on in his performance – look at the range of facial twitches he goes through in the few seconds after Adam says he has a few questions. Keaton is also a great improviser, and thought up with a lot of his own material here. You can tell when he's improvising, because he comes out with stuff you just couldn't script – example: 'Now that is why I never do two shows in a night. I just won't do it, I won't.' It wouldn't work on paper but it's hilarious coming out of Keaton's mouth. The other stand out is Sylvia Sidney who gets a small cameo. Not many modern viewers know Sidney, but she was a lead actress back in the 1930s, usually a warm-hearted romantic figure and quite the opposite of this grouchy old lady. Still, she brings the necessary memorable impact to her small but important role. Honourable mentions also go to jolly character actor Jeffrey Jones and the appropriately oddball Glenn Shadix, who sadly died last year.The icing on the cake is that Beetlejuice is filled with inspired touches that make it stand out from the crowd, little ideas that are not strictly required by the story but elevate it from some wacky spoof into a horror-comedy classic. There's the use of stop-motion animation, which Burton has long championed. Stop-motion doesn't look especially realistic, but compared to CGI it has a kind of life to it (if you'll excuse the metaphor). Then there's the complete non-sequitur use of Harry Belafonte songs. There's nothing remotely horror-themed about Day-O or Jump in the Line (apart from the tenuous link between Afro-Caribbean culture and zombies) but it doesn't really matter. Beetlejuice is a horror-comedy let loose, in which anything can happen, and frequently does. And that's what makes it so fine.",9,2,3,4 April 2011
The Wizard of Oz," 'There's a land that I've heard of...'
","Forget about polls and box office records. In real terms The Wizard of Oz is almost certainly the most beloved motion picture of all time. It glitters among the brightest jewels of the most effective movie-making factory in cinema history, in the industry's undisputed golden age.Oz is of course a timeless masterpiece, enjoyed by every new generation that discovers it. However, much of its secret is in how much a product of classic-era Hollywood it is. Rather than simply turn the book into images, the writers and producers' aim was to meld the story around the best elements from contemporary movie lore. The dialogue, and in particular Yip Harburg's lyrics, are full of the wisecracks and wordplay of 1930s comedy. Herbert Stothart's arrangements of Harold Arlen's sublime melodies have the same playful harmonic style that he used for the popular Jeanette MacDonald musicals. Even the art design references the fashions of the day – the Emerald City looks like nothing less than an art deco hotel! And of course the ingenious decision to shoot Kansas in sepia and Oz in Technicolor expresses the wonder of that vibrant and at the time relatively novel process.But really the most Tinseltown thing about Wizard of Oz is its cast. People like Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr aren't acting in the sense of submerging themselves and trying to become the characters they play. They are doing the reverse; playing the characters in the style of their own persona. Whatever role he appeared in, Frank Morgan always played the part of a lovable charlatan, fumbling his words and bluffing his way through. Billie Burke was perennially fussy and mumsy, and was only ever a wand away from being a fairy godmother. Bolger, Lahr and Jack Haley did not have quite the high-profile screen personas of Morgan and Burke, but they were nevertheless the kind of comedy-novelty players upon which the Hollywood musical thrived.And the directors were not of the arty, individualist 'auteurs' that mainstream film theory has reserved for posterity. King Vidor (who directed the Kansas scenes) and Victor Fleming (who directed almost everything else) were professional studio employees. Nevertheless each had their particular strengths they brought to a project, and, even though it is coincidence that the switch was made when it was, each is ideally suited to the material they are responsible for. Vidor was very much the romanticist of the outdoors, and his measured pace and beautiful shot composition give the right note of sentimentality to the place Dorothy calls home. Vidor's delicate camera-work for 'Over the Rainbow' adds to the enchantment of the number. He keeps Judy Garland at the centre of the screen, but gently pans and tilts to bring the horizon and then the sky around to frame her, keeping the image moving in time with the music. Fleming on the other hand was a man of action, and he gives a punch and dynamic rhythm to the vivid fantasy world. The Wizard of Oz may be fashioned in the Hollywood style, but studio production was more than just a collection of gimmicks and trimmings. They really knew how to tell stories. The movie adaptation transforms a cute fairy tale into an epic fable about wanderlust, homesickness and finding one's true self. Its appeal is universal and timeless because it speaks so sincerely to its audience. And to do so with such wit and beauty is really what cinema is all about.",10,3,4,23 March 2010
From Here to Eternity," 'Re-enlistment blues'
","It's often said that the simplest stories are the best. This isn't true. The simple stories are easy to get right, but a complex ensemble piece with multiple protagonists and numerous subplots can be just as effective, although it's a lot harder to pull off successfully. From Here to Eternity stands in the tradition of The Best Years of Our Lives, Seven Samurai and The Godfather, of pictures with interwoven plots that have become classics thanks to strong screen writing, intelligent direction and powerful acting performances.Part of the reason From Here to Eternity works is because it is very quick in establishing its characters and plot lines. It opens with a series of interlinking scenes, introducing us to Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Philip Ober, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, giving us clues about Clift's past and hinting at the future relationship between Lancaster and Kerr, all in the space of five minutes. Director Fred Zinnemann, with a confidence that is lacking in his earliest features, shoots these scenes with subtle technique to give them maximum storytelling effect. For example, he gives Clift's character a superb introduction, walking at a right angle to the marching column until he is brought right into close-up. Once the dialogue begins he uses sudden changes of angle to highlight certain lines, for example the close-up of Lancaster telling Kerr 'I'd be happy to help', at which point the audience know exactly what is going to happen between those two characters. Donna Reed is of course introduced a little later, but to compensate she is given a very distinctive first shot, framed on her own immediately after some busy crowd shots.But Zinnemann's direction isn't all pure functionalism. He makes sparing use of attention-grabbing stylisation when the moment demands it, such as the dolly-out through the rain-soaked window during Lancaster and Kerr's first kiss. And this stylisation even helps keep the narrative together, for example cutting from the roaring sea at the end of the famous beach scene to the smoke rising from Clift's cigarette. Throughout the various parallel plots there is a tone of melancholy and regret, and Zinnemann keeps this commonality with his consistency of style.Of course, you get the same problem or at least the same feature in From Here to Eternity as you do in They Died with Their Boots on or Titanic, in that the audience, knowing their history, know what is going to happen at the end. The strength of the non-combat story lines is such that we forget when and where we are, and as such it is important that we are eased into the finale of the Pearl Harbour attack so it does not seem such a surreal break in tone. This is done with characteristic subtlety, with two objects placed noticeably yet not obtrusively into the frame to jog our memories. The first is a calendar showing December 6th on the wall beside Burt Lancaster, and the other a signpost reading 'Pearl Harbour' after his final meeting with Kerr.One of the biggest challenges for the makers of an ensemble piece is that you need a larger than normal pool of leading players, and yet you must ensure none of them will overshadow the others. This is another thing they got right in From Here to Eternity. Clift, Kerr and Lancaster are all competent performers without big egos, and they all give steady performances, even if they are far from career-bests. As to Sinatra, what's amazing is not the quality of his performance (it was always evident he could act) but that he was even allowed to play a dramatic, non-musical role. It just goes to show the increased flexibility of cinema in the 1950s, as well as the rising status of the musical genre. To give it some perspective, can you imagine Fred Astaire or Bing Crosby having done the same thing in the 30s? From Here to Eternity won 1953's Best Picture Oscar, and like all successful pictures was followed by a host of imitators. 1955's Battle Cry for example is another many-stranded story about soldiers at the start of World War Two, and even features a rather tepid knock-off of the famous beach scene. However, while Battle Cry has some nice moments, structurally it is an absolute mess, an example of how easy it is to do a botch job on a complex storyline. That's why From Here to Eternity is such a rarity, being an ensemble piece that really works.",8,24,26,17 May 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 'An old-timey harmony thing'
","America is a young country, but it is not without a rich mythology. We may not think of it in this way, but the modern era has its folk tales, and they are defined in literature, theatre and of course cinema. In recent years some of the best American folk tales have been woven by that eminent fraternal writer-director team, the brothers Coen. O Brother Where Art Thou? was among their most profound yet playful.In writing this picture the brothers weave together numerous cultural motifs, many of them from the movies. The title itself is that of the fictional movie in Sullivan's Travels. We see depression-era legends such as the good-natured bank robber and the blues guitarist selling his soul alongside cinematic references as disparate as The Wizard of Oz and Doctor Strangelove. All this is loosely structured around Homer's Odyssey, drawing together the strands of this modern mythology with that of the ancient world.And as a directorial team, the Coens have a mark of simplicity and gentleness which allows the best elements of the movie to shine through. The pacing of each scene is considered and languid. This doesn't make things boring; it allows us to savour each glorious country scene or earthy expression. There is so much packed into each moment, showing us a rich world beyond the storyline. The Coens bring out period details, not through the wider shots but through seemingly inconsequential bits of background business, like the copy of Ward's catalogue that props up Hogwallop's boy on his seat.The resultant movie is both witty and meaningful, but also beautiful and human. The brothers Coen show us a people whose peculiarities are just as beautiful or as harsh as the landscapes around them. Filled with deliberate anachronism ('You Are My Sunshine' for example was not written until some years after it's set) and broad stretches of logic, O Brother Where Art Thou is not so much a historical movie as a mystical yet familiar dream of America's past.",10,1,2,26 March 2012
The Godfather," 'It's strictly business'
","There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets – voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience – and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot – we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence – no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top.",10,2,5,22 July 2010
