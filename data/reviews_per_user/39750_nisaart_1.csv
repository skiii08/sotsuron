Ford v Ferrari," Definitely not a waste for your popcorns!
","I must say, this is a movie that holds a perfect plot execution. Trust me, I watched a couple of true story based movies and not all of them succeed to deliver a fresh product while being 'a copy of something that happened in the past'. But Ford v Ferrari? The movie just nailed it. There's some kind of seasoning that the actors' performances and the movie itself added which makes every scene enjoyable, rather than a dull plus boring one.The performances of Bale and Damon, I don't have to say much. Their qualities are above all, especially Bale who had always played his role leaving a unique impression on the audience. This movie was another example of his fine work.So, whether you're a racing fan or not, Ford v Ferrari will always be an enjoyable offer even for the muggles. 9/10 for a masterpiece!",9,2,3,4 December 2019
