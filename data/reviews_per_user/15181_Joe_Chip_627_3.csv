The Ring," What a terrible ending!
","Based on the Japanese film 'Ringu', which is based on the novel by Koji Suzuki, 'The Ring' follows a woman named Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the mysterious death of her niece, in the process discovering a videotape that kills all who watch it in seven days. The final twist is not one of your typical Hollywood clichés, but thats only because Hollywood clichés do not negate the entire film, which is what the ending does. There have been so many movies with a little boy who looks and acts similar to Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman), that watching all the scenes with Aidan are difficult because you feel like you know exactly what he is going to say and do. The visuals are excellent, but that doesn't make up for the mediocre acting and direction and the terrible ending. When compared to recent horror films, 'The Ring' really is not that bad. Just about every horror movie within the last decade or so has been terrible, except for '28 Days Later' and 'Dawn of the Dead', and 'The Ring' is without a doubt better than something like 'Freddy vs. Jason' or 'Alien vs. Predator'. All the previews said that this was one of the greatest horror films ever, and everyone who saw this said it was so scary, so I expected to be scared. There is nothing in the film that makes you jump out of your seat, which is obviously what most people look for in horror movies. While 'The Ring' is probably one of the ten best horror films of a 21st century in which good horror films have been almost impossible to find, there is no way that this film could rank among the truly great horror films of all time.",5,1,3,24 November 2009
The Battle of Algiers," Superb anti-war drama
","'The Battle of Algiers' is a film that everyone should see. It presents the historical account of the struggle of Algerian nationalists for independence from French colonists, and in doing so clearly displays the total futility of war. While not as renowned as 'All Quiet on the Western Front' or 'Paths of Glory', 'The Battle of Algiers' is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, 'The Battle of Algiers' has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war. Add in Ennio Morricone's score, and you have a great film that is completely different from almost anything you will ever see.",9,1,2,24 November 2009
Pulp Fiction," Best film of the 90s
","Following several interlocked tales of criminals, 'Pulp Fiction' is about as well-written, well-acted, and well-directed as any film out there. The first storyline centers around Jules and Vincent (Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta), who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). The second story line focuses on Vincent taking Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) to dinner, and the final storyline is about Wallace bribing a boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) to take the fall is a boxing match. Of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order, but going through everything that happens would take a while. Tarantino won a Best Screenplay Oscar, but the movie should have won many more awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson), and Best Supporting Actress (Uma Thurman). In most years, I would say that John Travolta should have won the Best Actor Oscar, but I give the nod to Tom Hanks in 'Forrest Gump'. The acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere. Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, Rhames, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvy Keitel and Eric Stoltz are all terrific. The only sub par performance is that of Tarantino himself. The style of direction that Tarantino uses is one of those 'love it or hate it' kinds. If you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character, then you will like Tarantino's style of direction. In conclusion, 'Pulp Fiction' is the best movie made in the 90's. I was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time, but after sitting through it, there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out. This is a film that once you see, you will want to watch over and over again. That is the true sign of a masterpiece.",10,1,2,24 November 2009
