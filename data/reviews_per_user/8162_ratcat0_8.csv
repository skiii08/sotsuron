The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Coming of age meets repressed emotions and love almost lost
","How ironic is it that the mad girl from two and a half men plays a mad Aunt who causes almost irreparable damage to her nephew although what exactly she did do is a little sketchy. Not that it really matters, you kind of get the gist of the effect this has on the main character (Logan Lerman) as he struggles to make friends and find love. And love is what he does find - with Sam (the most superbly beautiful Emma Watson). Some may say that Logan bears a stunning resemblance to Amanda Bynes in her guise as a young man from that teen movie 'She's the man'. This is a wildly crafty movie that will hold you till the end. A little bit of the old college geek bully syndrome done to death but not enough to give this movie a thumbs down. Well worth a look and even worthy of any home movie collection with just the right mix of know actors and fresh new-comers.Yes we can be heroes. don't forget to see my 3D games reviews as the only 3D nVision reviewer on IMDb!",8,0,1,18 November 2014
Divergent," Yet another Dystopian society bent on Gentrification
",Featuring the new brat pack of Hollywood (at the time of writing)this is yet as the title suggests another Dystopian society AKA 1984 complete with drab grey clothing/overalls. If George Orwell were to view this movie he would gaffaw at its lack of depth but should you find yourself in a position where you are unable to extricate from the proceedings you may find some entertainment in the inevitable love interest of the leading lady. Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet provide some shining moments of professional acting as does the lead female actor Shailene Woodley. Ansel Elgort plays the brother to Woodleys character Tris. Most people will remember the pair in the sad romance movie 'The fault in our stars' Perhaps worth the distraction on a cold winter afternoon but not a movie that most would go out of their way to watch.,6,0,0,21 January 2017
Bridesmaids," WTF? WTfwaahahhaaa
","How did this Gem of a movie escape my attention for so many years? A friend of mine gave me 30 or so 'B' grade movies on a flash drive each worse than the one before until this. At first I was mildly interested but as the movie progressed the obvious animosity between the brides best friend and an almost new acquaintance created a comedic situation that increased exponentially with each scene. Instead of your Willy wonkas, Jaws and Pretty woman's - the average free TV network should screen this movie on a Saturday night for ratings and give all those Adam Sandler and Fokker movies a rest for a change. The cast is full of characters from every sitcom you have ever watched and brilliantly executed. Nine out of ten (do yourself a favour) stars.",9,0,0,8 April 2015
Revolutionary Road," Too many words, please stop talking now!
","This movie is strangely reminicsent of American beauty. You have the odd one person who seems to be at odds with societies norms, the office workaday non-person who is at odds with his wife, and a really very odd almost crazy person in the mix who really makes the most sense. Its a one time viewing sort of movie that works on many levels but doesnt quite seem to hit the mark, Di-Caprio, Winslet and Kathy Bates all do an extraordinary job to make this believable.When DiCaprio's character does all he can to be the doting husband suddenly does an about face in what would have been the 'Out' that his wife had been hoping for everything seems to fall apart. The deep complicated relationship between Kate and Leonard just quickly gets bogged down in a verbose frustrating quagmire of hurt and to top it off an unwanted pregnancy seals the deal. Hence we get too the point when Kate simply says 'stop talking' A point made clear at the end when the husband of Kathy Bates turns down his hearing aid to deaden the sound of her voice. A sad and bitter end an almost nonredeemable situation. Worth a look.",8,0,0,17 February 2018
Whiplash," Clean the blood off my drum set
","Clean the blood off my drum set - brilliant. Don't go past 'Go' do not collect $200 just watch and appreciate. Just don't... whatever you do don't clean the blood off my drum set. Mostly the worst part of this movie is trying to get past the angry angst of a perfectionist with a temper. This review does not employ tactics that require extraordinary talents to appreciate verbosity so I say again clean the blood off my drum kit. If you hated your teacher in grade 4, 3, 7. Well you will hate the teacher in this movie. The point is no matter how you hated him/her did you come out the other end better off anyway? Only you can answer that.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The world is a critic
","Isn't it funny how in only a few short years the internet has given the power for even an average Joe like me to critique a movie despite the fact that I wouldn't have a critics bone in my body. Be that as it may this review wont use loose adjectives and a couple of paragraphs much like Michael Keaton said to that critic the night before opening. A movie has to be absolutely horrible for me not to sit through it entirely so that gives this movie a plus. Keaton does a stellar job portraying his character but sadly the same cannot (this is just an unprofessional opinion) be said of Galafianakis with his horrendous melodramatic overacting and Watts with her bland.. well just bad acting. As an Australian I surely found myself squirming in my seat every time she appeared on screen knowing that she was dragging this movie down with her poor imitation of an actor and that was quite surprising considering that this is the crux of the movie... being mainly about acting. Nevertheless all that aside this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie, one which you should not miss. See it if not once just for the experience. 9 out of ten rubber actors.",9,2,6,26 April 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Bland tripe just not worthy
","I had heard so much about this movie (and book) that expectations were high. Wrong! Its quite simple. A movie will entertain, make you laugh , cry get turned on. This movie did none of the above. So much hype for such a sad piece of garbage. So this totally filthy rich dude thinks he can pick up a female and get exactly what he wants. The female protagonist is not so ready to give over to his good looks and grand bank account. This would never happen in real life. If a multi millionaire with super hero looks approached just about any woman she would bend over backwards (literally) to satisfy him. Not so this average looking virgin. Sorry the whole thing smacks of Hollywood over-hype tripe rubbish. Don't bother. Oh by the way the acting is bad the female is not sexy even totally naked. 'A' bust little boy chest? Really? They could have at least tried!",2,0,2,1 October 2017
The Martian," Wrong direction and lack of insight burns this movie
","While not an extremely bad movie the direction this movie takes seems to disappoint. Survival movies always work well but when a survival movie turns into an obvious rescue drama, well the outcome can be somewhat predictable. For the first 40 minutes or so the audience is treated to the angst ridden fear of death but the protagonist pulls himself together and designs a way to eat and live. It would have been far more dramatic had he survived to the point where he possibly would never need to be rescued. Imagine how much better this movie would have been when after several attempts at almost making contact with Earth he resigns himself to the inevitable life on Mars. Fade to a rear image of him staring out into the blankness of space as the credits roll. Now that would be a true Martian! But no unfortunately (or fortunately) the makers of this movie decide that there should at least be an attempt to rescue the poor sod. Did they get him off the Red planet? Well you will just have to watch to find out wont you?",6,2,4,18 January 2016
