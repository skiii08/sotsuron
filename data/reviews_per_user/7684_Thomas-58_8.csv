Requiem for a Dream," An eye-opening experience (just look at the box cover)
","If anyone deserved an Academy Award last year it was Ellen Burstyn for her portrayal of a lonely old woman who longs for yesteryear.  Her obsession to relive that life that she once had leads her down a degenerative spiral of (pharmaceutical) drug-addiction.  However, Burstyn was not the only player to put in award-worthy performance.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and, surprisingly, Marlon Wayans each contribute spot-on portrayals of people down-on-their-luck, whose struggle to overcome their hardships eventually turns them into hopeless, pathetic life-forms on the dark path to death; they are the anti-thesis of the American dream.  Darren Aronofsky deftly blends the characters with a yearning for the innocence of childhood and a desire to be appreciated that is at once omnipresent and smooth, but secondary.  The film never lags as all four main characters each have strong character arcs.  I have heard many people say this is a depressing film, but I think it is this only for viewers whose real-life mirrors that of the characters.  As for the normal, 'clean-cut' audience segment, shouldn't the fact that you do not act as the film characters do make you glad that you do not?  While I was surprised that there was not a twist at the end, the ending is still extremely sound the way it is (the final shot of Ellen Burstyn is chilling to the point that it puts Tom Hank's emaciated body in the second half of 'Cast Away' to shame).  This is an extremely powerful film, even if this is not the first time we have been warned about the evils of drug addiction.  Final Grade: A",Null,0,1,29 November 2001
Fight Club," Fight Dud
","The members of Fight Club are hopelessly pathetic junkies who believe self-destruction is the most productive way to counter their failures to be what society tells them they should strive to be, but who they didn't become.  In the world of Fight Club, there is no need for aspirations to achieve goals and dreams, so they resort to their counter-programmed, repressed sadistic tendencies for therapy.  But what does this accomplish? In the end, the answer is nothing  nothing more than one man's awakening from an eternal dream-state.  It is attempting to speak to the dazed and confused among us by way of the ridiculous notion that violence creates an understanding of oneself. The first two hours of 'Fight Club' is a stark and vacuous rambling that plays out like a like a wannabe hard-core, tough-guy's movie for Gen Xers who think it's cool to watch grown men smack each other bloody.  And herein lies the irony  The film plays up the violence quotient to highlight its characters' worthiness, while we the audience (presumably) cheer these guys on vicariously through cinema, all the while distanced from the film's `your id should dictate your being' holy-otherworldliness.  We do not experience what it is like to be Tyler Durden outside the film's reality, and this hypocrisy is something he would frown upon.  Those of us not in Fight Club, are we not living? The film gets more ludicrous as it goes, pounding the audience over the head with the idea that an ever-increasing mass audience would continually embrace Fight Club, lead by a loser who succumbs to his dual-personality disorder.  But maybe that's the point  we, the audience, are the newest members of Fight Club, and we are the victims of a brutal beat-down on our first night.  But we are entertained by it nonetheless.  Fight Club is an attack on our senses and sensibilities, one that would make even Tyler Durden jealous.  It is a knock on materialism, but a champion of irreverence.  Fight Club is an all-encompassing religion-like way-of-life, straight out of the school of hard knocks.  It is also a film who's main character must go through an epiphany of violent escapades and unconscious musings before he understands what any `normal' person on the street already knows  that life does offer possibilities and unspecified pinnacles of joy and enlightenment.  It does not take a wrong before one can understand productivity and do good. I don't think the film glorifies violence; in fact, it's conclusion puts to rest the edgy leanings that came before it, deploring violence, brutality, and self-destruction as a waste of time and human life.  However, morals cannot exist out of context, and the way the filmmakers present them results in an acidic residue inside the minds of the audience.  It used to be no blood, no foul; now it's no blood, no self-fulfillment.  I guess pain really is love.  The film's ultimate effect is one of wanting you to treat it as a non-sentimental, non-preachy statement on human behavior and aspirations, but lacks an excuse for us to do so.  Violence brings out the best in all of us, right Tyler?",Null,1,3,7 October 2001
The Others," Excellent combination of the Sixth Sense and Beetlejuice
","MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:  In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' raised the bar for the modern day horror/suspense film.  Now, despite the disappointing similarities to Shyamalan's arguable classic, 'The Others' raises the bar higher.  Like Shyamalan's film, director Alejandro Amenabar clutters his film with many subtle details to sink your teeth into.  For example, the religious overtones of the film (from Grace's stern biblical morals that she instills in her children to her belief that the living and the dead will coexist ONLY at the end of eternity) are not just intriguing as character traits of people in a horror film but as pieces that assemble together and form the film's story.  Since the film is told through Grace's eyes and since the film ultimately builds up to Grace's realization of herself and her family, it is imperative that we the audience experience the same feelings that Grace does.  And, thankfully, the acting is superb all around, anchored by Nicole Kidman's flawless portrayal of the hopelessly tormented Grace.  She manages to pull off the tough task of convincing the audience that while she is grounded by her religious convictions, she is internally conflicted by the madness around her.  When can she trust her daughter?  How can she keep her sadness directed toward her husband away from her innocent children?  When does she have time to rest?  It seems as if this woman always has something to worry about, but has nobody to talk to about her problems.  Even so, the audience never is unsure of what Grace is feeling inside, and this is because of Kidman's tremendous performance. Unfortunately the film's payoff is not as tremendous as the film sets it up to be.  Now, there is nothing wrong, per se, with the film's resolution. But, like others have pointed out, one can not pretend when critiquing this film that 'The Sixth Sense' does not exist.  In fact, I repeatedly attempted to predetermine the film's twist ending, and was unable to conjure a satisfactory conclusion.  The film stumped me.  But when the last minutes did unfold, I felt as if I were cheated.  Basically, if I knew the filmmakers did not mind retreading the twist to 'The Sixth Sense,' I would not have tried so hard to think of an ending that was not similar to that of 'The Sixth Sense.'  As it is, in relation to 'The Sixth Sense,' the ending is too similar even to warrant one's forward perception.  Along with this drawback, add to it the fact that, ahem, the ending admits that the whole time we were watching just a serious retelling of part of the 'Beetlejuice' concept (Grace and her children are just like 'Beetlejuice''s Maitland couple in the beginning of that film) and the ending turns out to be a real downer.  Therefore, the best advice I can give is to see this picture before 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Beetlejuice.'  Nevertheless, even if you have seen those pictures, the strong performances (Kidman deserves that Golden Globe nomination) and the film's first 95 minutes make for one taught, thrilling, dense, and sometimes tense, ghost story.

Léon: The Professional," Euro-slick action with strong characters
","This movie was a strong directing debut for Luc Besson. Unlike, say, his The Fifth Element, it tends to emotionally connect with the viewer, which is rare for an action movie. However, the characters are well drawn out, which explains the viewers connection with Leon and Mathilda. It is conceivable why this movie may not be liked by all; its European style is not for all tastes. But there is more emphasis on development of situations, granted they are average run-of-the-mill at that, than there is on the action, which is refreshing. Gary Oldman is over-the-top, but that's to be expected. And the Lolita-esque subplot between the two protagonists is intriguing. Besson should be more proud of this film than The Fifth Element. His attention isn't overconsumed by the action to give too-little time and care to the other aspects of a motion-picture like this. As thus, its succeeds as it wanted to back at the drawing board stage.",Null,0,1,19 July 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A very good adaption despite a couple of setbacks
","I mentioned in my one line summary above that this film has a couple of setbacks that detract from this film being a classic fantasy epic.  Since so many people have seen and will see this film and will form their own opinions - and since so many people have already written so much about this film - I will get right into the film's flaws.  In doing so I will leave its positives to be commented upon by others who have already written about this film. In effect I pretty much agree with them about those aspects of the film. Essentially, there are two problems I have with 'The Fellowship of the Ring.'  First, this is an unnecessarily dark and gory film.  Its joyless action and overbearing heroics take away from the audience's enjoyment of what is intended to be a rousing adventure.  I liken it to a heavy meal whereby one eats too many thick, dense foods and, while enjoying the food when one actually eats it, he regrets doing so afterwards.  It looks like the film makers put too much of a good thing into this film, just like the meal analogy.  In relation, this film takes itself way too seriously, to the point where it does not ask us to delight in hating the many antagonists of the film.  It just plain wants us to hate them, and because of this quality the 'bad guys' are too horrific for their own good. Second, the film is rather long.  It does not matter if the film makers wanted to keep to the story line of the J.R.R Tolkien's novel.  What seems like a never-ending yarn of excitement as a book does not directly translate into a similarly thrilling experience as a film.  The film should have been injected with a greater sense of brevity about the proceedings because the film becomes a tad bit tedious after a while.  However, I should mention that the vague homage to the grand Harryhausen epics of the late 50's and early 60's apparent in the fellowship's battles with an assortment of ghastly ghouls in the film's third act is effective and is the best part of the film. Taking into account these reservations (which I should not downplay; they certainly do have a negative impact), 'The Fellowship of the Ring' just barely manages to live up to the hype.

Saving Private Ryan," 7 and 1/2 stars for successfully depicting the war experience
","Coming out of Saving Private Ryan, one detail was surprisingly clear. This is not as gruesome or violent a movie as most make it out to be.  The violence occuring onscreen is realistic, but never is it gut-wrenchingly unbearable.  For example, many images of soldiers being shot in the middle of their forehead look completely convincing, but at the same time are not disturbing.  I suspect this is due to the fact that the violence itself is not gratuitous or dwelled upon for long periods of time.  In Schindler's List, there is a scene were an old man is taken out of a line and has a gun pointed to his head by a German soldier, while the viewer gets a closeup of this cruelty.  A couple of seconds pass where we just await the man to be shot dead.  And it is in these few, passive seconds where the viewer is viscerally shaken because he or she has the preoccuring knowledge that the man is about to be killed.  Whereas in Saving Private Ryan, every soldier is either shot down quickly, or the act of violence is not as closeup in the viewer's objectivity.  The violence is not there to be just flat-out disgusting but to reflect upon its effect on the characters and the film's ideals.  Although is this the film's virtue or disadvantage?  Anyway the hype is undeserved.  Never do you see a soldier's head blown away from his torso or the like.  If you can handle award-winning pyrotechnics, then you can sit through this film. With that being said, perhaps something more important should.  Saving Private Ryan just is not the best war film ever made, or even Steven Spielberg's best directing effort.  It is bogged down by a number of cliches (it begins to rain right when our protagonists approach danger, one soldier accidentely reveals the enemy simply by sitting down, the band of soldiers is comprised of the usual wide-range of character types, etc).  It lacks the thorough plot and execution of theme that Spielberg accomplished so easily and satisfactorily in his own Schindler's List.  The tears and awe of the experience people had when they left the theater after that film was not there so much this time.  Maybe that's the exact point the film is trying to get across, though.  Perhaps its purpose (and only idea achieved) is to simply show that war is hell and what it is really like--to settle the look of the war film once and for all.  If this was the movie's objective, then it does so in flying colors.  But that's about all.  The spiritual aspect is missing, and this is why the film could have been better.  Schindler's List told the horrors of the Holocaust, but left the viewer with lasting images and lessons on basic humankind--the kind of secondary impression Saving Private Ryan lacks.",Null,0,0,13 June 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," truly a 'great film'
","This movie has it all.  Great photography, solid acting, splendid editing (using sound links and other ingenious transitions), masterful directing, legendary music, lavish production design, and a completely engrossing script.  What more can be said?  If you haven't seen it, then do so.  And if you have, see it again for a reminder of how great movies used to be made. Absolutely worthy of its classic status.  The only gripe may be that the story may not be comprehensible to first time viewer's if they have no prior knowledge of the actual events the movie is based on.  Otherwise help yourself.

Tarzan," Barely Above Average
","Tarzan is the latest offering in Disney's annual animated feature-film routine.  So, based on those Disney movies that have preceeded this one, the viewer knows what to expect going in.  And, suffice it to say, Tarzan does not stray from the usual, tried-and-true Disney formula.  The plot is nothing new, kind of resembling Superman: the title character is born normal and is such until he is suddenly deposited in a new environment upon which circumstances his parents are killed.  He is brought up in these new surroundings, and then, when he is older, he falls in love with a woman that he is not allowed to love or be with because he is too different from her. He ultimately tries to become like her to be with her, but this fails, and he returns, once and for all realizing his true self, to what he actually is (in this movie, an ape-man, not a civilized human).  There are also the obligatory bad guys around to disrupt our hero's plans, but really are not essential to our hero's journey from the beginning of the movie to the end. Oh, there is also the one-note, 'for-the-kids' character (this time voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) to provide comic relief; it wouldn't be a Disney summer offering without one. Sure the movie looks good, but the CGI does not blend seemlessly with the traditional animation.  There is basically one eye-popping sequence in the middle of the movie where Tarzan rescues Jane from baboon-types.  He does so in magnificent fashion: swinging, gliding, and careening from tree to tree, that plays out like a roller coaster ride at a theme park.  This sequence alone makes the movie above average, but not much.  Final grade: C+",Null,0,1,21 July 1999
