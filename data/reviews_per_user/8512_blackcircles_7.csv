Requiem for a Dream," Drugs are bad? Tell me more...
","Darren Aronofsky deserves kudos for his ability to create such a jolting movie, and Ellen Burstyn has given the year's most heartbreaking performance. But I have never, ever had a harder time watching a film, and have never felt so bombarded by such disturbing images in my life. After I left the theatre, I felt like I had been through a war, and I was at a loss to figure out what I was supposed to get out of it other than, 'Drugs are bad.' That's something most of us realize, and for those that don't, I don't think Aronofsky's sledgehammer is going to do the trick. Aronofsky has one of the bleakest visions of any director working today, and if his next project is indeed Batman, I'm worried. He's loaded with talent, but I would like to see him inject a dose of humanity for the first time into his next film.",6,1,1,8 November 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Perfect family film
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was 11. I saw it again when I was 14. I'm now 28 and have recently seen it a third time, and my eyes began tearing up on two different occasions. It's amazing that a movie about a boy and an alien can trigger such emotions. A beautiful film.",10,1,2,13 November 2000
Batman Returns," Just one villain next time, please
","If people are scratching their heads trying to figure out what exactly went wrong with this franchise, the answer is right here. It is a mistake to cram more than one villain into a movie. The Penguin has always been a fine villain for Batman, but in this movie next to the dangerously sexy Catwoman, he comes off as simply boring. Catwoman should have been the only villain in Batman returns, just like the Joker was the only villain in the first movie. It wasn't bad enough that a great villain like Two Face ended up getting the short end of the stick to the Riddler in Batman Forever, but we had to fit in another hero in Robin. By the time we upped the ante to three villains and three heros in idiotically titled Batman and Robin, it had simply gotten ridiculous.So, if anybody out there reading this is even thinking about making a superhero movie, remember this. One hero and one villain. That's all one film can handle, and that's all you need.",6,1,2,27 April 2000
Cast Away," Too much Memphis
","If they had started the story in the plane, with all the courier packages (which company did Chuck Noland work for again?) that would have been fine. Noland could look at the watch his girlfriend gave him, but then something goes wrong and the plane goes down. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** From this moment on the movie could play out exactly as it did until the moment the ship passes by his raft. Why couldn't the movie end there and simply be about what drove this guy to survive for four years? It's the meat of the movie, and it's wonderful. By hiring a big star like Helen Hunt, Zemeckis and company forced themselves to supply her with a big role, and a satisfactory ending became an impossibility.",7,0,0,3 January 2001
U-571," British or American, it's the heroism that matters
","Would U-571 be a better movie if it had British officers stopping the Enigma signal? Sure, and maybe for the sake of accuracy it should have. Perhaps there is a certain amount of American arrogance at work here, having these officers portrayed as American, but, at the risk of upsetting a lot of veterans, I don't think it matters in the long run who did what. I think what matters in the end is that it was done at all. Say what you will, but anyone who has watched U-571 has to admit it's a balanced film. The German characters in the film are every bit as human, flawed and virtuous as the Americans. The film respects both sides of the conflict equally. Speaking as a Canadian, I have to be honest about my feelings about our past war efforts. All Canadian students are taught about Canada's great victory at Vimy Ridge in World War I. It can not be denied that that was an important victory in the war and that incredible heroism was involved on the part of the soldiers. If Hollywood made a movie about the battle of Vimy Ridge and replaced the Canadian soldiers with Americans, I admit it would probably upset me, but only because I'm Canadian. My nationality would prevent me from looking at the situation objectively. Nowadays it seems odd trying to find trying to extract some source of national pride among the horrors of an old war.If people think the United States is arrogant for portraying British officers as American, the arrogance displayed as the British remind everybody, 'Don't forget. We did that,' also has to be acknowledged. The fact is, somebody had to do it. These men did it and they are heroes. Their nationality doesn't define their heroic act, and neither does it matter if they are portrayed by Matthew McConaughey or Ewan MacGregor. As time passes by, wars become more and more meaningless, and it's not as if they were loaded with meaning in the first place.",9,0,2,30 June 2000
Dreamgirls," Entertaining but confusing
","I enjoyed this musical, and I now understand that it is the film version of an old Broadway musical based on the career of Diana Ross and the Supremes. Now that I know that, it's obvious that Deena Jones is based on Ross and Curtis Taylor is Berry Gordy, and Rainbow Records is Motown Records. But my main reason for seeing this was to check out Eddie Murphy's first Oscar-nominated performance.However, knowing a little bit about Motown, I'm confused about some things. Why would they have Curtis prohibit 'message songs?' Some of Motown's biggest successes were highly socially conscious albums by Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. One of Wonder's earliest hits in the sixties was a cover of Dylan's 'Blowin' In the Wind.' It seems that the writers really needed a villain and picked Curtis. It just seems unfair to Berry Gordy. It places the deterioration of the Supremes completely on Gordy's lap, and Ross comes off completely clean.I'm also puzzled as to who Murphy's character is supposed to be. At first I thought it might be Little Richard or Wilson Pickett. Then, later on, he's singing a message song and wearing the same hat Marvin Gaye wore on the cover of What's Going On. Then he becomes James Brown. Murphy did do a great job. Both he and Hudson deserve their nominations. The music and presentation are very good. The story? Not so much, but that's like a lot of musicals.",7,0,2,26 January 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," WOW
","I have seen most of Stanley Kubrick's films and consider him to be, at the very least, one of the greatest directors who ever lived. Throughout his career he never ceased to challenge his audience with movies like the deathly quiet 2001, the disturbing A Clockwork Orange and the horrifying The Shining. None of his films had as much impact on me as did Eyes Wide Shut, which, after multiple viewings, has become my favourite film of all time. For the life of me I can not understand how people can emerge from this film saying, 'I hate it.' People have complained that the sets feel unrealistic, that you would never find an orgy like that in the real world. If you wanted the real world, why did you watch a movie? I love the surreal and dreamlike state of this movie? I love how most of the conflict is internal and I appreciate the turmoil Dr. Harford has been thrown in when his wife admits to nearly throwing away the marriage for one night of passion with a stranger. With that confession, she admits that she is not as committed to the marriage as he is, which throws into question the entire authenticity of the union. When the doctor goes out into the night he finds himself on the receiving end of advances from various women. If he resists temptation, to what exactly would he be staying faithful? As much as I love this film, I refuse to buy it until Warner releases the unedited version in North America. The film is definitely worth seeing in any version, but I love it so much anything less than Kubrick's unmasked version will not do for me.",10,0,1,26 April 2000
