The Devil's Advocate," A clever film with a clever twist
","If you have seen the trailer or any promotional material for this film you will generally know the rough story of it. I won't tell you the in depth story of the film but I will tell you the story before it is actually all revealed, the trailer gives far too much away of the final act which breaks the surprise of the conclusion.The film starts with Kevin Lomax (Reeves) defending a paedophile school teacher who is clearly guilty. Lomax manages to win the case and it is then revealed that he has won every case he has fought in. After winning this latest one, he heads out to celebrate with his wife Mary-Anne (Theron) where he is approached with an offer from a firm in New York who want his help picking a jury. Due to the financial gain, Lomax and his wife take the plunge and move to New York, where Lomax's great work in picking a jury see him lead the line defending a possible triple homicide case and moving into a top end fifth avenue apartment. This is a man at the pinnacle of his career, with a gorgeous wife and now a glorious apartment in one of the most attractive cities in the world. What could possibly go wrong?As Lomax begins to grow into his new job, and work under the supervision of his new boss John Milton (Pacino) things do take a turn for the worse. Mary-Anne begins to feel lonely and craves the baby that could make her life complete, however Kevin's concentration remains on his job. This forces Mary-Anne to socialise with the other lawyer's wives and partners. One day when they are out shopping, Mary-Anne begins to hallucinate and the wives begin to turn into demonic figures. She decides to lock herself in her apartment, where things start to become much worse for her in the hallucination stakes, as well as in the neglect from her preoccupied husband. On the side of his concentration on his job, Kevin begins an infatuation with a co-worker, who he envisions whilst having sex with his wife. His neglect doesn't go unnoticed by Mary-Anne and she slowly begins to free fall into possible schizophrenia, with her ending up in a metal hospital. Has Kevin let his life spiral out of control due to his job, his new boss, or himself?The film is very clever, even if it does become a little supernatural at the end. The courtroom set up works really well, and the fact that the 'demons' belong amongst lawyers seems to be sending out a hidden message. The story here has been developed well and the writing is top drawer. There are many twists and turns in the film, and I'm sure many of you are aware of the outcome, that slowly bring the story to its final conclusion. At several points throughout it is hinted towards what is going on, and the only person that doesn't see it is Kevin. You will find out when you watch it why that is though. Everything pulls together well and it is a real intriguing watch.Al Pacino is fantastic as John Milton, and when you hit the conclusion you will understand how brilliantly he portrays his character. The cinematography also aids in his character with many red lights and dark shadows really highlighting him, as well as Pacino's devilish smile. Theron is also great as the psychologically frail wife. Her emotional ride is clearly visible as the film goes on and she also shines in possibly the most horrific scene in the film, one that forced my jaw to the floor and my hand over my mouth. It was shocking. Keanu Reeves on the other hand plays Keanu Reeves. At times his portrayal works, especially in the final half of the film, however his accent becomes more of an annoyance and his delivery of his line make his performance even more wooden. Another actor may have done the character more justice, but Reeves is known for acting like that. The first half of the film is very slow, and it isn't until about half way through that it really starts to kick in. The hallucinations at times are freaky and it is at this point where you really will become hooked. The story is intriguing and is thoroughly enjoyable considering it is a slight courtroom drama. The twist of the film may not be a surprise, but it does hit you hard and it makes much of the film make more sense. The tension is high throughout the long running time and it had me gripped from start to finish. I do think the final climax could have been cut slightly though, and it does slowly border on farce, but the director holds it together and has produced a film full of tension, and with several biblical themes that refer to many of us.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",7,0,1,2 May 2012
The King's Speech," Rush and Firth are just sublime
","Let's be honest, if a writer was to pitch an idea of a film about a man with a stammer it would more than likely be rejected flat. Not much of a conflict for a man with a speech impediment other than struggling to fit a one minute sentence into, well one minute. Therefore I believe this film was only really made due to the fact that our King at the time of war had a stammer and was needed to speak to fill the nation with confidence. I suppose now you can suggest a little conflict.The film follows the Duke of York, Prince Albert (Firth). After failing to deliver a speech at Wembley Stadium his wife Elizabeth (Carter) decides to find a man who can treat her husband. After struggling with several speech therapists, Elizabeth enlists the help of Lionel Logue (Rush), an Australian actor who helps people with stammers. The story then follows Albert and Lionel's relationship along with Albert's rise to the thrown through the death of his father and the abdication of his brother, who was more interested in women then leading his country. The story shows the arrival of King George VI. The father of our now Queen Elizabeth. Reluctant to take the thrown but knowing he must the King must now try harder to solve his speech problem, especially with Hitler rising and war with Germany is beckoning.The plot of the film is weak but seeing as it is true British history we will let that slip. Also because the film isn't based around plot but around the characters involved. Let me just say the acting in this film is fantastic. Firth is so acceptable as a man struggling for words and will have you believing that in fact he is a man with a stammer. Rush is out of this world as the cocky therapist whose controversial methods must help the King. He's a man filled with wit and fearful of going deeper into someone who he should not treat as equal but does. Bonham Carter is also good as Queen Elizabeth and her chemistry with Firth feels real. In fact when these three are on screen the film really is something. The dialogue just bounces between Firth and Rush as if it was an actual conversation and not coming from a script. The lines also deliver humour and bring a light hearted feel to a part of history that is so pivotal to us Brits. Sadly though as the chemistry is so good the film slows slightly especially when Rush isn't on the screen.The film also holds several cameos coming from Guy Pearce as Albert's brother Edward, Michael Gambon as their father, King George V and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. All delivering good performances all round.The film delivers some lovely scenes and this is thanks to the fantastic direction. Shots are used here that won't be seen in many other films and the cinematography is so good that many of the shots involve more background than actors. Several shots having one actor in the bottom corners of the screen and the rest just being a multi coloured wall. The script is also brilliant with every bit of dialogue top notch. Like I said before the dialogue between King and teacher flows brilliantly. The script has the two as if the King is in fact a school child with Logue giving the King privileges if he participates in a task. Something a man with Royal power would never normally adhere to. One of Firth's speeches to Rush actually states that he always wondered what it would be like to know the ordinary man and to even have friends. Logue's character fits into both these aspects and helps this King to acquire the confidence he needs.The film is very very good but I feel it is only at its best when the two leads are on screen, especially Rush. When he is not on I felt myself not as interested especially as the plot is overall only about a man with a stammer. I believe the film may not have been such a big success as it has been if it wasn't about the King but having said that it is still at the top of its genre.I advise everyone to watch this. See how brilliant true acting can be and if you don't really like the film you will come out having learnt something about an important part of our history.",Null,0,0,18 October 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Claustrophobic and long winded
","Kill Bill Volume 2 isn't really a sequel. Granted it is called volume 2, but really it is one film that has been split into two. This volume is technically a complete follow on from the first one, so it is highly recommended to watch the first one and then possibly straight into this one. I didn't take on this recommendation so it took me a while to remember the pivotal points in the first one in order to catch up with the second. Do yourself a favour if you are planning on watching this film and watch the original first.Volume 2 begins with the shoot out at the wedding chapel, where the Bride (Thurman) was left for dead by her former team of assassins. This is what sent her on the journey of killing all those involved in her betrayal. In the first one we see her destroying many who were involved and partaking in many huge fight sequences. In this volume we continue on with her journey, with the only three left to be killed; Budd (Madsen), Ellie (Hannah), and Bill (Carradine). Her first target is Budd, who has been warned by Bill that the Bride is on her way. Budd puts in a plan to stop her in her tracks and when his plan seems like it is working it is very disturbing. Basically he begins to bury her alive. Her next target is Ellie and obviously eventually Bill, the man who ultimately betrayed her. On route we see some flashbacks that tie up several plot holes of the first film, and to just why and how she became the big assassin that she is claimed to be.I won't indulge too much into what happens. I'm sure you are all aware that she will plough through them and have her face to face with Bill but it is the way she gains her revenge that is the shock. There is not as much action and violence as there was in the first film but when the action does kick in it is riveting. The Bride and Ellie standoff in a fantastically choreographed fight sequence, and there are some nice touches when the Bride is taught her kung fu by her Master, all pays homage to old school kung fu movies.As well as having action, I also found this film slightly scary. Sounds weird as it isn't a horror, but there are moments that are quite frightening. Claustrophobia is brought to the max here and that is what is scary. At one point the Bride is buried alive and her reactions make you believe you're in there with her, which would make it even more claustrophobic. The sweat dripping off her head helps you feel the heat she is also feeling. Tarantino does a great job of highlighting all this by using minimal light and some tense camera angles. This scene is uncomfortable. Also there is a scene with a poisonous snake which jumps out at you. This is frightening to me as I hate snakes. Watching it slither across the floor and attack helpless victims really spooked me out. The final scary moment is one that will make you grimace. A fight scene culminates in an eyes being gauged out. This also feels claustrophobic as you can just imagine the pitch blackness this person has been plunged into. To me this was horrific. It isn't supposed to be scary but I found it to be at certain points.As I can't really remember the first one I am struggling to really decide on how good this film is. It is alright at times but at other times it becomes slow and has a lot of talking and telling us what is going on. This though is typical Tarantino and a lot of his films do have much time given to character's talking. Not that this is a problem but at times it causes me to drift out of the film. Much of it kept me on the edge of my seat but other parts I lost a little interest.The acting is good in the film, Carradine is excellent as Bill, and Thurman, as well as looking gorgeous, really brings the character to life. The plot is over strung but the acting and camera work help you to ignore this. This is a typical Tarantino film and if you love him this will be a big deal, if you don't then it will probably just be average.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6,0,2,9 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Time to disappear Captain Jack Sparrow
","This is the fourth time our cinemas have been graced with Captain Jack Sparrow and his swashbuckling gang of inept pirates, and I have to say I hope that it is the last. The next instalment is just another carbon copy of everything we have seen before only less thrilling and without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.If you have seen the other films you will know that Jack is on a quest for something mystical but is kidnapped by a fearsome Captain and his haunted ship. He must escape; get to the end of his quest before them and also before another mysterious third party. Oh and also throw in Captain Barbossa somewhere. Basically like every other film in the franchise.In this one Jack begins in custody of the King who demands the where about of the Fountain of Youth. Jack claims he doesn't know and escapes their clutches. He then has a talk with his Dad before being told that another 'Jack Sparrow' is recruiting for his ship. He investigates and finds it to be his long lost love Angelica (Cruz), only disguised as him. She then kidnaps Jack and he ends up captured on the ship of Blackbeard (McShane), Angelica's father. They are on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth as Blackbeard's fate suggests that he will die if he doesn't find it and drink from it. To use the Fountain however they must acquire two chalices and the tear of a mermaid. So off they set in search of this.Also the King of England has sent his own ship of pioneers after the Fountain lead by Captain Barbossa (Rush) who seems to have deflected and changed sides, but secretly he has a hidden agenda and is in fact after Blackbeard for being the reason he lost his leg and his beloved Black Pearl. Alongside that is a random Spanish fleet also after the Fountain but they are mentioned at the beginning and shown at the end, they are just completely pointless. We finish up with all three parties arriving at the Fountain and fighting to the bitter end, as usual. You get all that? If you've seen the others you may be able to understand some pointless, confusing plot lines. There is so much wrong with this film. I will start with a couple of positives though. The opening thirty minutes are entertaining, and the introduction of Jack is great. Barbossa's deflection is a decent plot twist and casting Penelope Cruz is a nice touch as without Knightley there would be no eye-candy. Of course Johnny Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow as always but this is where my negative assessments begin, we've seen it. We have seen this pirate do the same things in different places time and time again and in this one he seems to have more feelings than in previous films and he has become less selfish, that is not the Jack Sparrow we know and love. To continue, the villain Blackbeard is one of the weakest villains I have watched. He is not a patch on the original Barbossa or Davy Jones, hell even Lord Beckett was more fearsome. For Blackbeard to be classed as the nastiest pirate is ludicrous as he does nothing other than shout. The addition of the Spanish is pointless as they have no input into the story and seem to be there to add the political edge like Lord Beckett did in the previous ones. The story as a whole has just completely run out of ideas. The writing is appalling. Things just seem to turn up half way through so that they can be used in the climax. If these things were bought to our attention at the beginning than I may buy into them but they were just placed there to tie the story up.I could go on for ages moaning about this film, but I won't as there are some parts I liked, such as the fight scenes, although they have all been seen before they still do entertain. I also like the idea of using mermaids and of Blackbeard shrinking ships into bottles; this is something I think should have been more explored.The thing is I loved the initial Pirates of the Caribbean so I hate to be slating this one but I'm sorry they need to nip these stories in the bud and fast. Mr Depp I also think it is time you broke away from Mr Sparrow and proved that you don't just play eccentric roles. The majorly disappointing thing is that this will be the first time I have said that a film would benefit from keeping Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley in it. Now you should be able to imagine how bad this film really is.",4,0,0,9 December 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Great imagery but poor story
","Howl's Moving Castle is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a well know Japanese director for producing some of the best 2D animation films since the old school Disney ones. His vision is always extraordinary and inventive, and this trademark is continued in Howl's Moving Castle. Unfortunately though it is not as good as his previous film Spirited Away, which is a lot better. This could be because at least Spirited Away had a story that you can grasp onto. Howl's Moving Castle doesn't have much of a plot to really hook you in, and I found myself floating in and out of the film due to this problem.The story follows a young girl called Sophie, who is rescued by some obnoxious guards by the notorious wizard Howl (Bale). This moment is watched by the Witch of the Waste (Bascall) who, when Sophie is alone, casts a spell on her out of jealousy, turning Sophie into an old woman. After this change Sophie, who is now known as Grandma Sophie (Simmons), heads up the mountain in search of Howl, in the hope that he can reverse the spell. When she finds his home, which is a giant misshaped castle made out of unshaped metal pieces on legs, she enters it to find a young wizard learning from Howl, and a talking fire call Calcifer. When Howl returns to his home she tells him she is the new housekeeper, and decides to befriend Howl before asking for his help. Whilst she cleans for him she mixes up his box of magic, causing him to lose his power. At this Sophie must go and visit his former mentor, Madame Suliman (Danner), to gain back his power and this visit causes the Madame into uproar and she declares war between two worlds, with Howl seeming to be one of the only ones who can defend it. From here the truth about Howl's magic powers come to the surface, and we find out that he may not be all that he seems. Will Sophie be able to ever go back to her former self?The synopsis above is rather vague as the story of Howl's Moving Castle is also very vague. It is slightly difficult to follow and doesn't really make much sense. These animated Japanese films, directed by Miyazaki, are often about magic, potions, and objects that are not of this world, but usually we can buy into them easier then what this film allows us to. The characters aren't as well developed as well as they are in Spirited Away and this helps less in enjoying the story.Half of this problem though could be down to me. This sort of film isn't particularly to my liking, Spirited Away was a slight exception, and due to this I find my mind wandering throughout and not really concentrating on the film. Reading other opinions on the film, I do see that I am not the only one who struggled to really grasp the plot, but I do seem to be the only one that isn't a huge fan of these movies. They can be good just this one wasn't particularly.I watched the English version of this film, which is why I have credited English actors above. I have been told that the Japanese speaking version is better as some of the dialogue is lost in translation and the Japanese voices are much more enthusiastic. The voices in English are typical of the actor and little emotion seems to be involved, that is other than Billy Crystal as Calcifer who steals the show. Christian Bale doesn't strain his voice, and is so much like him that the minute he spoke I knew it was someone I had heard before. It took me a few minutes to realise and again this was a few minutes that I spent not really indulging in the film. I do prefer a good animation when the voices aren't obvious of the actor.All in all it isn't the best Japanese animated film. Some of the imagery is beautiful and the moving castle is very imaginative indeed. However this is nowhere near as good as Spirited Away and if you feel the need to watch a Japanese animated movie, I suggest you rent that instead.2 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",4,5,9,4 May 2012
Lucky Number Slevin," He may be luckier than you think
","The title of this film had put me off seeing it, also the fact that Josh Hartnett is the lead didn't do it much favours. I don't have much against the guy but he seems to make every character he plays turn into Josh Hartnett and that is why it seems that he brings out a movie every few years or so. Saying that, once this film got going he had drawn me into his character rather well and I actually believed I was watching a guy with the weirdest name, Slevin and not Josh Hartnett.The film is based around mistake identity. Slevin has come into town after losing his job, flat and girlfriend all in one day. He has come to New York to stay with his friend Nick Fisher, such a good friend that when he arrives he isn't there and still hasn't returned the following morning, leaving Slevin to make himself at home. Slevin then meets Nick's neighbour Lindsey (Liu), who instantly falls for Slevin's charm, and I'm sure manhood considering she gets a complete eyeful with him only wearing a bath towel. Moments after she leaves another knock at the door produces two heavies, both of whom work for the Boss (Freeman) and have orders to bring in Nick Fisher. Despite not being Fisher, Slevin has no way of proving otherwise and is dragged in front of the Boss who is demanding the ninety-six thousand that he/Fisher owes him, or kill his arch nemesis, the Rabi (Kingsley)'s son to wipe off his debt. Slevin leaves to ponder and almost instantly is dragged in front of the Rabi, who also believes he is Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher happens to owe the Rabi thirty three thousand and Slevin has forty eight hours to pay up. What to do next?The narrative is very jumpy and the story twists and turns throughout and you find yourself guessing and then second guessing what is going to happen to this poor guy, who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He must somehow come up with a plan to worm his way out as he is no killer and has no money to his name. I won't let you in on anymore as you won't know which way this film is going and it will have you confused until the very end, where every little seed of detail falls into place, and I have to say it works bloody well.The cast is full of A-List stars and not one of them disappoints. As well as the leads we are treated to a bit of Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, both of whom are very good in their roles. It isn't only the plot that takes surprising turns, it is also each character, all of which seem to have a trick up their sleeve at some point and all the actors present their tricks with surprise and intrigue. It is a thinker and if you are not really watching you will become confused. It isn't a crime thriller, more of a dark comedy. The first half is very quirky and the dialogue is sharp and snappy and some of the best pieces of dialogue I've heard in a while, all delivered with great punch from each actor, including Hartnett. It was a film that had me thinking but also had me laughing. What more can you ask for?One minor fault I have with it however is the lack of direction shown in a few very poor shots. There are also a few jump cuts which make very little sense and there wasn't much point of them. At times they make you notice several continuity problems and to be fair they needn't have done it. So for me the choice of shots and some of the editing does let it down but the acting, story and dialogue do make up for that. The first half is quirky, showing some poor filmmaking and the second half becomes dark, a complete change of tone, and shows some great filmmaking, especially in the editing. It is like two different films and both were very good.Let it all sink in and laugh along and I tell you, you won't be disappointed.4 / 5 TolliCheck out my blog: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Null,1,2,18 January 2012
Kung Fu Panda," Not that awesome
","DreamWorks brings out yet another animated production but does it fill the shoes of the other films that they have recently made? Although this film is good the answer is sadly no. For starters an issue with this film is Jack Black. Granted he isn't that bad in this and it is his voice that is doing the work and not his acting, but his voice is so distinct that I couldn't help but imagine that it was actually him on the screen, especially when the part he is playing is an overweight, cartoon panda. Far to life like for me. Other voice members of this team remain hidden, Hoffman is brilliant as Master Shifu and his voice becomes lost in the character, also Ian McShane as Tai Lung the deadly snow leopard is deep and menacing. The same can't be said for all the other voice cast which includes such stars as Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui and David Cross. All seem to get about ten lines each. Perhaps this isn't a problem with the voices but the character as they are so hard to connect with. Five animals, a tigress, crane, monkey, mantis and viper, all kicking ass but saying nothing, yep I can see why we can't connect with them. My favourite character I have to say was the Grand Master Oogway, an old tortoise that seemed to get everything right by accident and then state that nothing is an accident.The film is about the Panda, Po. He dreams of being a kung fu warrior and not running his Dad's noodle bar, his Dad who is somehow a stork?? On the day that Oogway has a premonition that the feared Tai Lung will escape from jail, Shifu states that they must chose a Dragon Warrior to fend him off. The nominated Furious Five stake their claim but it is the panda that is selected when he accidentally flies into the arena, trying to catch a glimpse of what is going on. Reluctantly Shifu begins to train him and we see that this panda is completely incompetent and the only thing he can do is eat. This however, as noticed by Shifu, is his strength. Relate aspects of kung fu to food and the panda will become awesome. Tai Lung breaks out of jail, which is a very good sequence of CGI animation, and hurtles across the land to gather a Dragon Scroll out the hands of the Masters. The Dragon Scroll is what the Dragon Warrior possesses and it is an accomplishment that Tai Lung continually misses out on. Tai Lung's tale is told through a back story and his connection brings emotion to the film. Tai Lung eventually arrives at the palace and after defeating the Furious Five and Shifu it is down to the Panda to save the day.As you can tell from the synopsis there are no real twists or turns and the film holds true to a very simple formula. This becomes a slight issue for me as it means children can connect with it more than adults, which certainly wasn't the case with Toy Story, Shrek, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo and this is where this film lacks compared to those. There is nothing for an adult audience to really grip and enjoy. There is very little emotion in the film and the main humour is childish or slapstick. The animation is still good. The Panda and Master Shifu having good genuine expressions but the Furious Five are undeveloped in character and animation. They could have all just been made into one character that has been worked on. Their story is just poor and very uninteresting.That all being said it is a very easy watch film and I would happily sit down, chilling on a Sunday afternoon and watch it again. However using the term Jack Black must have written into the script as it is all he ever says in other films and over uses in this one, this film is certainly not awesome.",6,0,0,8 December 2011
Chinatown," Nicholson at his best. Before he became a Joker
","Jack Nicholson starts his career as a headlined actor in style. The first film in which he takes the lead showed the world exactly what talent this man has. This film, to me, is his best acting experience, especially since it doesn't involve him laughing hysterically but delivering lines from an excellent script with brutality, wit and sarcasm.He plays Jake Gittes, a Private Investigator, specialising in adultery cases. He is approached by a woman claiming to be the wife of Mr Mulwray, the owner of the water supply for LA, a man going through hard times due to the drought currently occupying LA. She believes her husband is having an affair with a younger woman and asks him to investigate. Just as Gittes begins his investigation, the real wife of Mr Mulwray (Faye Dunway) surfaces, threatening to sue Gittes for his intrusion. So what is going on?Gittes pure curiosity into the situation and the arrival of Mr Mulwray's murdered body sends Gittes into a world of deceit and corruption, all stemming down to the importance of the city's water problem and some shocking family truths. The truth to which Gittes is to find, turns out to be darker and more sinister than many will be expecting, a realisation that had me baffled. This reveal, you may feel, has no link with the rest of the movie but thinking back to a few one liners and a strange John Huston, you can see where this back story links in and how important it is to the final outcome.At no point in this movie did I find myself uninterested and it kept me guessing as to what will come in the next scene. This was due to Polanski's brilliant direction. From the first shot of Nicholson spying on Mr Mulwray, I felt myself applauding Polanski's directing. The shots were beautiful and a single frame seemed to reveal so much.Polanski slowly drips information to the audience, giving you enough information to move onto the next scene but not enough so that the answers can be figured out before the credits role. My only complaint about it would be that I would have liked the ending to have been wrapped up a little better but perhaps Polanski felt the need to allow the audience to think about this film passed the end credits. Many others have come to like this ending but I think it ended too abruptly considering the rest of the film reveals itself very slowly. The ending seems rushed and this is not just from the story as the acting in the last five minutes seemed weaker and the camera work became lazy.The film reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock style of filmmaking and I could compare this film to his classic Vertigo (1958) with its long lingering shots that build plenty of emotion and reveal all through the image and character on the screen.The music works well with the film, bringing out lots of tension whether it is when Gittes is help at knife point or is leaning in for a kiss. The music brings the film to its noir roots despite it being recorded in colour.I can see why this film is classed as a classic but the overly rushed ending takes a little away from it. Nicholson though is brilliant as the Private Eye and in my opinion surpasses the Joker (Batman) and McMurphy (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) interpretations audiences love him for. See this film for Nicholson and for the disturbing revelation that caused my jaw to hit the floor.",Null,1,2,21 September 2011
Gravity," One of the films of the year. This is the platform for future space films.
","Contains mild peril is the brief accompanying the release of Gravity, however the problem with this vague statement is that it doesn't tell you if that is aimed towards the characters of the film or the audience members. It also doesn't help that to me being cast adrift in space, with nothing to grab a hold of, doesn't sound like mild peril it sounds mega peril to me! For ninety one minutes Gravity does not hold up. Even the calmer moments are filled with peril because let's face it would any of you want to work on the side of a space craft in the depths of space? This film has it all; tension, action, stunning visuals, strong performances, catharsis, cheese, and tears. It is only ninety minutes but boy does it cover some ground. Or space ground. Or no ground.Sandra Bullock is Doctor Ryan Stone (that's right apparently her parents were hoping for a boy, a sure fire sign she has parent issues), a first time space traveller brought onto the last mission of Matt Kowalski, a veteran astronaut who is determined to break the record of the most hours accumulated space walking. Stone is fragile, struggling to cope with her new environment whilst Kowalski sees it all as a zero gravity playing field, that is however until debris from a broken down satellite sparks a chain reaction in Earth's orbit and sends shrapnel heading straight for them. On destruction of their ship the two astronauts are left to float with one objective in mind; making it back home.What instantly sets Gravity apart from the rest is the stunning visual element that Cuarón has used in telling this story. Not only does it look breathtaking on the big screen it also does justice to the use of 3D. Most films use it as a gimmick or a cash grab but with Gravity it feels entirely necessary. Cuarón wants you cast adrift as much as the characters are and by creating greater depth he has achieved just that. In 2D it is bound to still look stunning but in comparison it may look flat. The sound is also critical to the development of the film. The non-digetic sound is loud, building to a climax that leaves you in silence. It pounds along hinting towards the sense of danger and adds to the tension soon to come. The digetic sound on the other hand is quiet, dull, and non-existent. Other then hearing the characters through their radios the atmospheric sound is as if you were in space with them. Drills are muffled. The destruction of space stations is made with a whimper. What Cuarón has done is given the audience the feel that they are right there alongside them and all by providing sound possibly recorded through a wooden door. Mild peril is as much for the audience as it is those characters.The acting must also be applauded, especially from the inconsistent Bullock. At times her choice of movie has baffled many but here she proves why she is A-list. Having little to work with in terms of stage surroundings, she conveys the traits and internal conflicts of Stone as if she were real. What is incredible is that the character is fairly generic and has little in terms of back story but little is all Bullock needs to work with as she convinces that Stone has a past and is determined to reach the future for the sake of all she has been through. We are right there with her and if you don't will her to survive then Cuarón has failed to immerse you, which I find highly doubtful. Clooney is also the arrogant contrast to Stone and is the cool, calm charmer that we expect from him. His character is less developed but he is there to shift the attention to Bullock, who is left to drive home the themes of human nature and how having little going for your life doesn't stop you fighting for survival.Every elements of the film is of the highest standard. The weakest element is possibly the script, with the ham-fisted dialogue, but Cuarón and son get away with this due to the awe inspiring visuals. That is not to say the visuals should make a story better but when an entire space station is ripped apart to the sound of echoing silence within the frame, with a solitary female astronaut floating in the middle of it all attempting to avoid certain death, then I think one or two corny one liners can certainly be forgiven.If you haven't seen this yet then don't wait for the DVD, get yourself out there and see it on the big screen to experience it in all its glory. All the elements make up for a fascinating original movie which the film world is seeing less and less of each year. You want to sit on the edge of your seat for ninety minutes being dragged through space than this is the film for you. It is the closest experience to a fairground ride I have had in the cinema. Do not miss it. It is one of the movies of the year.Rating: 5 / 5Directing: Cuarón's camera decisions have you floating right there with the characters. Acting: Bullock gives the performance of her life. Clooney oozes charm.Script: The weakest element of the entire production but isn't deterring in the slightest.Cinematography: Stunning, absolutely stunning. The use of light is a contrast to their situation.Score: Loud but silent. You just won't understand till you hear it through big blaring speakers.Editing: This was edited? Wasn't it all done in one shot? The first 13 minutes certainly were. Overall: One of the films of the year. This is the platform for future space films.",10,3,6,27 November 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Didn't make me a fan of the Pythons I'm afraid.
","Starring: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry GilliamRunning time: 94 minutesYear: 1979Directed by: Terry JonesWritten by: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones & Michael PalinI, personally, am not a huge fan of Monty Python. I thought The Holy Grail was overrated and I didn't really understand what was so funny. I have to say this second instalment is a lot funnier, well in my eyes anyway.Brian (Chapman) is born on Christmas Day, the same day Jesus Christ was actually born, not just on Christmas Day. He is nearly mistaken for the Messiah by the Three Wise Men who visit him on the day of his birth, soon realising their mistake they leave and take their gifts with them and deliver them to the actual Messiah, Jesus Christ, who has been born next door.Thirty years later and Brian has grown up to be just a normal man whilst Jesus is everyone's saviour. During this time hatred for the Roman Empire is building and Brian is recruited to help take them down. When he is caught and then escapes custody, he is mistaken for the Messiah once again and must prove he is not the man they believe he is.I had trouble explaining the concept as it certainly isn't overly clear throughout the film but that is not really what the Python films are about. This one does have a better story then Holy Grail but that is not what drives this film on, or any of the Pythons for that matter. It is the pure stupidity and humour that goes on throughout. The humour in the film quite often requires a laugh out loud moment, compared to some comedy films that just get a forced grin. Look out for a hilarious scene involving the name Biggus Dickus. So stupid, silly and immature I know but it had me laughing my head off and that's what I mean by these films, they are so stupid and unbelievable you have to just take them with a pinch of salt and for the stupid parody that they are.The performances in the film are great. Each actor taking on several roles, with forty roles spread between six actors, each delivering the individual role with perfection and the right amount of humour. Cleese and Gilliam are definite stand outs. The script is excellent, especially the dialogue as let's be honest the film carries no story and no real emotional attachment. It is purely just here to be laughed at and trust me there are several scenes where you will be doing just that. The film is utterly daft and really won't be everyone's cup of tea. The first film certainly wasn't mine but I do believe this one was much better. Many people believe the Pythons are some of the best comedy films ever made, I on the other hand do not. The comedy is funny, not constant but when it comes it comes thick and fast, but I like to engage into a half decent story as well as being made to laugh. I have never understood why these films are rated so highly as they do not have a patch on other parody films bought out. All parodies are stupid but these sometimes take the bit too far. Not far enough however to be banned for blaspheming, which is an absolute joke. The film does not make fun of the story of Christ but of a man born at the very same time and attempting to live during this period and undergoing the same nasty routines that Jesus went through to tell people his beliefs. It is not an outright parody of the man himself.I don't want to get too involved into why people banned this film as I am one who is not a huge fan of the film but one who can watch it once to see what the fuss is all about and then perhaps shelve it to not bother with it again. It is a funny film and did have me laughing and there for I do rate it as an average film but to me it is not the classic comedic masterpiece people worship and praise. Sorry avid fans of the Python series but it hasn't managed to entice me in.",Null,2,6,7 November 2011
127 Hours," Franco is the reason this is worth watching
","127 Hours follows the true story of arrogant adventurist Aron Ralston on the biggest misadventure he could come across. He takes a lonely exploring, mountain climbing hike in Blue John Canyon but when he falls on a rock, dislodging it in the process, he finds himself trapped in a narrow crevice with his hand wedged firmly behind this rock.The story follows Aron as he goes through pain, emotional stress, dehydration and hallucinations whilst trapped for five days in this narrow, lonely crack. His only utensils are a bottle of water, which he must ration in order to survive, a cheap utility tool which is nothing short of useless, some rope which isn't much use to a guy who can only use one hand, and a camcorder, which ends up being his prized tool as it is his way of documenting his situation and keeping himself in check with reality whilst he waits for his demise or his emotional blow out. The film manages to ask the question, what would you do? If you know the film, or the story you will know the outcome but again, would you do it?The film is basically served around James Franco, bar a scene at the beginning where he meets two lost girls and shows them the time of their lives (swimming in the depths of a canyon, what else could that mean?) and the people he holds places for in his heart which we see in flashbacks. These are the people and the situations that he believes led him to this crisis, losing the love of his life, ignoring his Mother's phone calls, his constant neglect for telling people where he is going, a lone wolf as he seems to be. It's not until a premonition shows him all that he could achieve in life, the fathering of his son, where he finally makes the sacrifice that others would chose not to. The film is not so much a story as it is an emotional journey with a man whose self belief is so strong that he will do whatever it takes to pursue future moments in his life.The film is generally good due to Franco's fantastic portrayal of Aran, he has you believing all of his pain, all of his anger and remorse. A particular scene is when he interviews himself on a make believe talk show called 'On the Boulder'. The way he delivers his split personality situation is just brilliant and also the final scene where the inevitable happens, where Franco really allows you to feel like you're in his shoes and has you squirming away until he finishes his make or break choice. Franco's performance is top notch but so is most of Danny Boyle's direction. The sound used for pivotal moments, the split screen movements and some of the music are great. It's just a pity that some of the score seems out of place and a few editorial decisions, such as the photograph snapping sequences, seem like they just don't need to be there. It is an area which lets down Boyle initial direction.Although a lot of praise goes into the acting and directing, it is the only thing that makes this film tick. The story seems better suited for a half hour news reel or hour long documentary and it only stretches to the ninety minute mark because of a pointless opening scene with the two girls and an overuse of flashbacks. There was a point in the middle where I was drifting out of the movie as it was becoming a bit repetitive. Of course the movie is moving as it is true but there are not a lot of things you can do with one man in a canyon.The acting is superb, definitely Oscar Winning worthy, the direction was good, the score was up and down and sadly these are the things that really drive this movie. If it wasn't for them then I think this film would dive and it only has seen great reviews because of these aspects. All in all just a good movie and nothing more, unfortunately.",7,1,3,7 October 2011
The Great Dictator," Shouldn't be a laughing matter....but works
","The Great Dictator Starring: Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie, Reginald Gardiner. Running time: 125 minutes Year: 1940 Directed by: Charlie Chaplin Written by: Charlie Chaplin In his time, Chaplin has made some great films. Compared to lacklustre comedy of today it is still a masterpiece, despite still being completely out there. His comedy is not for everyone and at times is very subjective, especially with it being repeated from film to film, however with The Great Dictator we find something completely different, this is a comedy but one with huge themes and a giant message. The film is based around the beginning of the Second World War and pokes fun at the tyrant that is Adolf Hitler, before he had even become his most evil. The film brandishes him for all of his sins before he has even committed them. After doing a little research, some believed that this film could have been the tipping point for Hitler himself! We start off following Chaplin during the First World War, where he accidentally saves a man's life on the eve of its end. This man ends up rising high in the new government where as Chaplin suffers memory loss from his exploits during this war and ends up being hospitalised. When he finally returns to his home in the Ghetto, where he is a barber, he sees that a new Dictator has taken over and his town is being terrorised by Storm Troopers. This new Dictator is Henkel, a portrayal of Hitler himself, also played by Chaplin. He is the leader of Tomania and is deciding whether to issue war or a truce against fellow Dictator Napaloni, leader of Bacteria. If this isn't taking the mick I don't know what is. In the Ghetto the Barber , on several occasions, attacks the Storm Troopers for racially abusing him as a Jew, and upon capture is save by the man he saved years before in the war. The Barber is then deemed untouchable and continues his life whilst wooing the woman next door. However his luck changes when the man he saved is outcast as a traitor and the Storm Troopers cease their chance to get their own back on the Barber, leaving him in a Concentration Camp. The film is hard to believe considering it came out before many of Hitler's war crimes took place, especially with on watching you see how true all this seemed to become. At the time the film was tarnished as unwittingly brandishing the Jews. Little did Chaplin know that in hindsight he was right on the money. On reading this you will think the film is very unlike Chaplin and to be fair it is, but we are still treated to the very same Chaplinesque moments, all which break the tension when it is needed. At one point Henkel shoots a guard dead before walking off and tripping up his own feet. You get his evil brandished with his stupidity. However Henkel is portrayed in a way that you never sympathise with him and in fact always hate him. You laugh at him, not with him and I can only imagine how hard that must have been to do at the time of this film. In hindsight we can happily laugh at the man that attempted to destroy the majority of the planet but back then, on the eve of the beginning, this must have been seen as a step too far. It is deep considering it is Chaplin and upon watching I found myself enjoying it but not for all the typical Chaplin reasons. Yes it made me laugh but it is nowhere near as funny as some of his previous work. On the other hand there is a much deeper plot and narrative and ultimately a real meaningful message. The only thing that keeps this in keeping with previous Chaplin is the horrible continuity problems, but I'm starting to expect that from old films. It's just something though I can't allow my eye to miss. It is a decent film and you will be engaged, however you will find yourself at times thinking that the comedy elements are completely out of place, especially when it is not seen in hindsight by Chaplin himself. Not one of Chaplin's best but I'm sure the film he will be most remembered for. His final speech, spoken out of character by Chaplin himself, is a message to all those out there during the war and does put a lot of their pains into perspective.3 / 5TolliCheck out my blog: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6,1,4,18 January 2012
Megamind," I'm afraid Megamind does not save the day.
","Now it is time for DreamWorks to have a stab at a cartoon hero, and after Pixar's brilliant The Incredibles this film can only be doomed to failure. I am pleased to announce that although nowhere near as good as The Incredibles it is still half decent.Megamind is an alien, sent down to Earth as a baby due to his planet being destroyed. Along with Megamind another baby is sent down to Earth from an opposing planet. Megamind lands in a prison, being raised by criminals and the other baby lives the life of luxury in a manor house. As they grow up they become rivals with Megamind adopting the villain persona and the other adopting the hero, Metro Man.The two battle out with Metro Man always coming out on top, until Megamind finally succeeds in killing him. After this he then realises that life is no good without a hero to fight, so decides to create one for his own, Titan. Although Titan doesn't work out according to plan and due to jealousy becomes evil, leaving Megamind to become the hero and save the day.The story does work and there are several hints to outside influences such as Superman, the vulnerable reporter, and Frankenstein, the creation of a monster. The film is very much a super hero in reverse and at times does employ the tired tactics but seeing as this is a children's film at heart, it was never going to go any deeper. The premise is good and, although recently Despicable Me took a similar premise, seems original but I think a lot of that is done through the voice work provided by the actors.Ferrell is very good as the voice of Megamind, delivering his typical comedic role which I'm sure most was ad-libbed. Jonah Hill is fantastic as Titan, really bringing the character out into a three dimensional world and Fey is fine as the reporter, Roxanne Ritchie but the star of them all is David Cross playing Megamind's sidekick Minion. The character has some of the best lines and considering he is a fish in a helmet attached to a robot, his facial expressions are brilliant.The film employs a lot of comedy but unfortunately I never really found myself in hysterics. Many of the gags used have been played in the trailer and others were more aimed at kids. Considering other brilliant animated films like Shrek also appealed to adults perhaps a superhero film could have done to. This film does not live up to its predecessors from DreamWorks and Pixar, so if you are going to the cinema to see another Toy Story than you will be disappointed. I know you shouldn't judge movies on others but with so many fantastic animated films out there than we can't help but. The problem with this movie is it doesn't live up to the hype of any other animated film at this time, which is a shame due to the great cast. It just feels like something is missing from this film as I could only connect towards the end. The end scenes are great but the ones leading up to it just seem a little dull at times and it's hard to empathise with Megamind until the end, so he will never be a remembered cartoon character like Shrek. There you go comparing again.The film is worth a watch for some light hearted entertainment and I think kids would love it but for me it was just a mediocre cartoon alongside some brilliant animated films.",Null,0,1,29 September 2011
Burn After Reading," Not up to the Cohen's usual brilliance
","Prior to Burn After Reading the Cohen brothers made the fantastic film that was No Country For Old Men, which scooped awards galore at the Oscars of its year. When their next feature was announced, and it was to be starring some of Hollywood's best acting talent, most people could be forgiven for thinking it was going to be brilliant. Unfortunately however either No Country For Old Men was that good it will make anything the brothers do look less than average, or Burn After Reading is that poor that it makes their other movies look amazing. Whichever way round it is it doesn't change the fact that Burn After Reading is a poor film despite the fantastic acting talent and the great directors and writers on show.The plot of the film is all over the place for starters. It begins with John Malkovich being downgraded from his job in the CIA, to which he accepts by quitting. Instead of telling his wife that night, they host a party where we meet George Clooney's character who it is made clear quite quickly is having an affair with Tilda Swinton, Malkovich's wife. Once the party is over Malkovich tells his wife that he has quit his job and will begin writing his memoirs. Not taking this too well she heads out to begin divorce proceedings against her husband and hopes to run off with Clooney.Alongside this we find ourselves in a gym, whose workers are Frances McDormand's lonely and unhappy with her looks Linda and scatty and off his head Chad played by Brad Pitt. Linda is clearly looking for love and spends her spare time searching internet sites for dates, which she seems to never find a perfect match, and being rejected for plastic surgery due to money issues. Her luck soon changes however when Chad finds a CD revealing Malkovich's memoirs in the ladies changing rooms, to which they use in an attempt to blackmail him. To bring the entire ensemble full circle Linda's next date from her website is with Harry (Clooney), with whom she begins a full blown affair. It is highlighted quickly that he is a serial cheat. From here the film twists and turns between the leads and the entire plot comes round full circle, although not everything seems to really be cleared up.There are moments in the film that seem to make little sense. Unless I'm missing something I don't understand the point behind the invention Clooney has built in his basement, and if anything I found his character a little bit of a throw away. To me the main plot was with Pitt and McDormand blackmailing Malkovich, and Clooney never is involved with this story thread. The ending is also skated over, and practically omitted in the same way Llewellyn Moss's fate is decided in No Country For Old Men. Perhaps this is a typical director trait.Despite the few issues with the plot the acting talent do help this story along. Each of them are brilliant in their roles and they do not disappoint with their involvement in the film. Special mention should go to Pitt and Clooney for their against type turns. The script is also a good part of the film with the dialogue being original and free flowing. The problem however is the mess of the storyline which seems to go off in unnecessary tangents and at times becomes slightly boring. It does have its moments but they are few and far between. It has been stated that the Cohen brothers were writing this at the same time as No Country For Old Men and would alternate the days for which one they would work on. It seems like one of them got priority.What makes this film most disappointing is the actors and directors are great at what they do, but they all seem wasted in this film. The actors are actually what make this film a bit better than rubbish, whilst the directors don't seem to bring their usual excellence to the proceedings. It is a shame really as there is so much that draws you to this film and the problem is that you will watch it and feel slightly bored and over expectant of what is coming next, because quite honestly nothing ever actually comes about. The ending is also just thrown in and suddenly happens out of nothing. If you are a fan of the Cohen's you will either love this as you feel you should or you will be disappointed as it does not live up to their previous work. If you are unaware of these two great directors then hire the other film I have mentioned a good few times in this review, and give the film I'm actually reviewing a miss.1.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",3,0,1,20 August 2012
28 Weeks Later," 28 Weeks Later.....
",I thought this sequel was much better than the first and the reason for that was because of the way they Hollywooded it up. I much prefer a Hollywood action film and the way they turned this into one was brill. I think the all action approach was much better than the indie approach in the first one. Some of the scenes in this sequel were better too. For example the underground scene with the night vision was very scary and was acted very well. Actually made you worry someone was lurking in the background. Yeah a lot of plot holes but is an enjoyable film and great for action/horror fans3 1/2 out of 5 ***,7,2,3,23 November 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Some good humour but not enough to enthrall you.
","This is a review where I don't really know where to start. For those of you that have seen this film will understand why as it is a very strange experience. The film centres round the idea that the U.S Army set up a separate unit that trained soldiers to fight with their minds rather than weapons, in order to make an attempt at peace. This is apparently based on a true story and I have to say it is so unbelievable it may well be true.We begin with Ewan McGregor who plays a journalist who has just split up with his wife. In a way to make himself look like he is over the break he heads to Kuwait in an attempt to report on a big story in neighbouring Iraq. Once there he meets a man whose name came up in an interview he took part in a few months earlier. The interview was with a guy who was part of a new unit within the army that trained to kill things with their minds. This man mentions one guy as the only one to ever do it; this guy is George Clooney, who McGregor meets when in Kuwait.Clooney agrees to the journalist tagging along with him into Iraq and McGregor heads on to a journey he will never quite be able to explain. Their journey is due to Clooney believing he is on a top secret mission and he begins to tell McGregor about it which ends up in many flashbacks showing how this army unit came about. We see Jeff Bridges become a hippy and force army officers to dance. We also get Kevin Spacey attempting to guess an object inside a hidden box. The whole process of this seems ridiculous and it really pokes fun at the army. The two continue their journey across the Iraq desert, coming across many ludicrous hurdles that only a man who can kill a goat with the power of his mind can jump over. The film generally is told in flashbacks, which shows the rise and fall of two key characters as this new found unit is developed. The plot sounds crazy and by sure the film is. Much of it is very funny and it mainly comes from people believing they can jump through walls or that simply thinking someone won't shoot you is enough to stop them from doing it - added on after this speech is the line, 'and then you stab them in the neck with a nearby pen,' which completely defeats the purpose of stopping the violence. This however works for this film as this is where the dry humour comes from, the fact that these 'Jedi Warriors' as Clooney calls them, believe that they are in fact doing it all with their mind. This is an absolute tribute to the writing as the dialogue is brilliant and the dry humour delivered in ironic one liners really hits the spot. A problem with the writing though is that there isn't really much of a story to get yourself attached to. The first part of the film is interesting and the middle section involving the mind techniques is funny but the final third becomes a little dull and by this point I didn't really care. The film worked better when it was told in flashbacks which unfortunately meant there was no real story. The initial idea is intriguing but I think, other than the dialogue, the writing really falls flat.The actors are on top form though. Clooney is brilliant as the best man in his business, and his scene where he stares at a goat is great. Bridges is also at ease and brings humour and a life to his role. Spacey is also on good form despite his short screen time. He is rather menacing here and all because he can't master the mind technique. McGregor drives the story from the beginning and his bewilderment as the story unravels relates to the audiences reaction.The film is a little disappointing and it is only really the acting and dialogue that can gain positive reports. Some of the lines for Clooney had me in stitches and the entire bizarreness will have you baffled, however it doesn't help the film really being a disappointment. Some of it is enjoyable and I wish that it would have been better.2 / 5Fir more reviews and news: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",4,1,6,30 May 2012

Only downfall is Don Cheadles awful cockney accent..........maybe thats why he wasn't credited!! George and Brad had great chemistry between them and some of their banter really was funny. As well with the 2 brothers, although I find it very strange that they entered the casino as 4 different set of guys but never got noticed by anyone!!

The Conjuring 2," The Conjuring 2
","Following the cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two psychic investigators, this sequel pits the duo against a demonic entity haunting a small Enfield home in London. Despite Lorraine's worry that their jobs put them in harms way, Ed is still eager to save desperate families from their spiritual issues and they are convinced by the church to head to England to assess the Hodgson's case. Is it fact or fiction? This is the question that the film threatens to delve down and if anything is the theme that could be of most interest. It is a different angle to other horror movies and could tip it to being more advanced then your typical scare-fest. However that theme is never developed and the story slowly evolves back into the less original frights. The story is slow moving, with the Warren's failing to really get involved until half way through, and actually isn't really very scary. When we start to unravel what the demon is it becomes a little laughable, making it less terrifying than it should have been. The performance of Madison Wolfe is a saving grace for this problem however. As the possessed child she brings a frightening presence more so than what the demons do. There are many good moments but it never delves as deep as what it should have done. If the Warrens were brought in earlier we could learn more about the family and the demons and understand more of what is disturbing Lorraine Warren, however we have two stories that collide when it is convenient for the plot. Characters are also too slow to react to situations, for instance a screaming toy fire truck fails to wake a house of three sleeping children, and solutions come by too easily, mainly through asking questions. James Wan is well known for his horror entries and to be fair his direction and choice of shots are chilling, however he struggles with the emotional moments. The soft score during these scenes is out of place and off tone. These moments are required but are not helped by being forced home. The Conjuring franchise is a step up from many horror films but this second entry could have gone further and never really does so.",5,0,0,23 October 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Pitt and Affleck's acting pulls this through the second act dip
","In 1881 Jesse James (Pitt) was an outlaw. He was known to steal and murder. In 1881 he took part in his final train robbery, with his brother Frank (Shepard) and a new crew of his, after the death or arrest of his previous crew members. One of these new members is Charlie Ford (Sam Rockwell). Charlie's brother is Robert Ford (Affleck), a twenty year old in complete awe of Jesse James, being able to cite his stories and his trivia off the top of his head. He asks Jesse to join his gang and when Jesse accepts he does all he can to prove his worth, so much so that after the robbery Jesse asks Robert to stick around with him whilst the other members scatter across the country. Jesse seems to like the attention Robert puts on him. It makes him feel celebrity like. However after a while Robert's infatuation becomes too much and Jesse begins to wander about his new friend. He sends him off to join his brothers as the star struck Ford becomes too much.Over the next few months the Ford brothers live at home with two other gang members who are constantly at each other's throats. So much so that one day it ends in one of their deaths. Meanwhile Jesse scales the country, killing those who are likely to betray him. He finally catches back up with the Ford brothers and asks them to accompany him on a bank heist. They set off to Jesse James house, for refuge until the robbery will take place, where Jesse's brutality, unpredictability and intimidation shine through, turning Ford from one time stalker to a potential killer. Ford's new emotions toward Jesse and a huge reward prize over his head, leave Robert Ford only one option. An option he must take before it is too late.You may think I have given away too much there, but if you read the title you will realise I have not. We all know that the story is about Jesse James murder, and how he was betrayed by one of his most faithful partners, Robert Ford. This just shows you how and why it happened. You may already know if you have researched into this outlaw but if you don't this film is the exact story of his death, including the aftermath where Ford is labelled the coward.The film is really brought to life by the performances. There are other good things about it, but the best aspect is the acting talent. For starters Brad Pitt is fantastic. He plays James with a sense of mystery and fear. The look in his eyes allows you to register what he is thinking without giving too much away. He also starts off as charming and ends up as a man you hate. The performance alone does all of this, even the dignity shown in his death when he either realises that his time is up, or he is testing Robert Ford's bravery. The entire performance is one that shows us so much. One of Pitt's best to date. Sam Rockwell is also very good as the slightly brain-less Charlie Ford. His reactions when lying are realistic, and they make us feel as if he really is hiding something. Jeremy Renner also pops up in a small role and is also very good, except from when he is obviously wearing a fake beard. The surprise breakthrough however comes from Casey Affleck who seems every bit Robert Ford. He begins timid, stuttering through his lines, in awe of Jesse, and as the film continues you can physically see him hide deeper inside himself before plucking up the courage to commit his deed. The events shown after the death are some of Affleck's best work, where he expects applause for shooting his gang leader but is surprised to see himself branded a coward. His slide back into his cave is brilliantly shown by Affleck. He is a great acting talent and here he really shows it. The cinematography is also beautiful showing us some lovely shots in wide open lands to show how isolated these characters really are.The problem with the film then lies in the running time and the dire middle sector. The opening thirty minutes and the final forty five are great but the middle seventy minutes become dull. Too much time is spent away from the two leads, following characters that are not as integral to the plot. Sure they all have reasons for being there but we spend too much time concentrating on them when we really want to see the two leads. During the entire middle sector Pitt and Affleck hardly share a scene and they are the two you are really there to see.The acting of this film pulls it through the middle slump, and I only think that if the film was cut slightly it could have been better. The bookends of the film are riveting but the middle becomes boring and the film becomes a drag, which is a shame considering the positives within this film. People seem to slate Pitt's acting talents and I advise them to all watch this to see how good he actually is. They will also be pleasantly surprised to see a man with the surname Affleck actually can act.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6,0,1,26 April 2012
Twilight," Greta for young girls, not so great for everyone else.
","Everyone has a different take on movies. Some people will think one film is miles better than what someone else thinks of it. Twilight however seems to fall into a different category all together, where most will despise it and anyone female and in their teenage years will absolutely love it. A teenage girl could watch a classic love story, such as Casablanca and find it utterly boring, but with Twilight they are enthralled beyond belief. Now is that the story or the actors? I know the answer to this but it is one hundred percent the wrong choice. The story is by far better than the actors. This film isn't a great film by any means but the story is slightly intriguing. Bella (Stewart) has moved to her Father's house in a place called Forks, the wettest place on the continent of the U.S. On her first day at her new school she becomes curious towards the pale faced, good looking weirdo in Edward Cullen (Pattinson). From there an infatuation starts from both parties. Throughout the opening half an hour we get lots of smouldering looks in the other ones direction. As the infatuation continues, Edward beings to warn Bella that he is dangerous and that she should stay well away, but she has already began to fall in love with him and refuses to leave him alone. After spending long periods with each other, Edward feels enough trust to let her into his little secret: he is in fact a vampire. The signs were already in place, he is ghostly white, has shiny eyes and is cold to touch, however sunlight doesn't seem to harm him here and instead makes him glisten like diamonds, which is slightly weird considering people believe vampires to be burnt in sun light. Obviously this is a different type of vampire.Edward explains that his family are 'vegetarians' and don't eat humans but other vampires out there do, so she must be aware of what she is getting herself into. Her acceptance into his life quickly turns to regret though when a dangerous trio of vampires smell her scent and one makes it his challenge to have her, causing Edward to do all he can to save her.The story is quite interesting. We usually see vampires as evil creatures and here we get a different take on it, although he does state that in fact he is the 'bad guy'. It is different to see a vampires different kind of struggle. What happens if they fall in love with the creature they intend to eat? It is kind of a mix of Romeo and Juliet with bestiality really. Coming away from something not in tone with the film, it is good to see a different side to a creature we are supposed to be frightened of and how love allows someone to take the risk of getting into a relationship with a vampire. The story is nice but now to the rest.The dialogue is poor. At times it is worse than poor. It is as if it is lifted straight from a source which is known to be expositional. Film is supposed to be visual and at times the dialogue explains too much. It also can become a little dull where we spend a lot of the time listening to Bella and Edward talking. The dialogue at the beginning of their relationship is slightly laughable and makes you wonder how they even fell for each other. At times as well the film seems to be very set up, like the line of dialogue is telling us that in a minute something is going to happen. In the part of the film when complications should arrive we get Edward look in a direction and state, 'there is a complication'. This is just cringe worthy. It tells us too much. The acting as well is not great. Stewart is possibly better than Pattinson here but it is obvious they were cast on their looks and suitability together as opposed to their acting abilities. They do look good together but it isn't really enough to believe the characters.To be fair the film isn't the worst. Many completely slate it, which I can understand why, but I don't think it is quite that bad. I did enjoy parts of it, mainly the story side, but some of the filmmaking and acting let it down. By all accounts this is the best one of the entire saga and if that is the case they can only get worse from here.2.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",5,1,4,24 February 2012
Drive," Gosling proves he really is damn good
","Set in present day LA but with a large finger pointing towards the 70's & 80's, Drive stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed driver, alongside Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, and Ron Perlman. An all star ensemble cast you would have to say. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, of Bronson fame, Drive is an action thriller with a hint of old school movies as an influence. For me A Clockwork Orange seemed to be on show here.Driver works in a car garage, drives cars for movies, and getaway cars for robberies. He is the best driver around and is soon to be the racing for Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks combined adventure into NASCAR racing. However our anti-hero soon becomes distracted when he strikes a connection with a woman in his building, Irene, (Mulligan) and her son. He soon finds out her husband is to be released from prison and when he is the husband is instantly threatened unless he does one last heist. Out of his infatuation with Irene, Driver decides to help her husband in order to protect her from this violent mob, only the job they undertake goes array and Driver is left holding a million in cash of one of the most dangerous men in town. Our Driver must act fast using cunning, speed, and ultra violence to be able to escape these men and protect the woman and child he has fallen for.For starters the acting is fantastic. Gosling is given very little dialogue, very little back story, and very little characterisation. He spends most of the film silent, talking only when he is spoken to. His thoughts and emotions are portrayed through his expressions and his body language alone and this is something we haven't seen Gosling do before. He shows that he really can lead a film and without much to say as well. His character change about half way through is also handled excellently, from the quiet, subtle character in one line becomes frightening when sitting in a diner he snaps at a man, 'shut your mouth before I kick your teeth down your throat and shut it for ya!' This is the moment Driver finally shows some emotion and in one line Gosling has intrigued us into who this character really is. Mulligan is sweet as the girl next door and Cranston really shows how good an actor he is, once again not showing us any signs of any other character he has played in the past. Another star was Albert Brooks as the primary villain. He may seem as an odd choice considering the whole way through you will hear him as Nemo's Father from Finding Nemo. But in some violent actions we realise he certainly isn't a clown fish. The acting really does drive this story that actually has very little substance in terms of plot but delivers in performance and direction by Refn. If I had to criticise a problem with the characters it is that I never particularly felt hooked by them and by the end of the film I didn't feel overly moved I just felt like I had watched some top acting in a good film.The music certainly has to be mentioned. From the opening scene where the music purrs in the background along with Gosling's heart rate and car engine during an eight minute chase sequence through LA, to the booming songs from the Chromatics, Vincent Belorgey, and College. The music gives you a sense of where you are and a big hint to the 70's and 80's. It fits in perfectly with how the film is told and the visuals. Gosling's attire is very thirty years ago and his actions whilst wearing it reminded me of Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Even the feel and look of the opening credits sets the style of the movie instantly, the letters being as if scribbled on and in fluorescent pink. A nice touch from Refn.Overall the film is a must see. It maybe isn't quite as out of this world, like many have said, in terms of story but the acting, music, and vision are things you have to see. The direction of the opening scene alone is also worth paying the money for; the camera never leaves the car whilst Gosling attempts to escape the cops during a getaway. It throws you into the film almost instantly. The slight problem is that after this it does become quite slow whilst we learn the placid nature of our Driver, and his emotional connection with Irene. Here we never feel like they totally connect and I was never drawn into these scenes. When the action kicks in about half way we are treated to a severe case of the ultra-violence, and despite being very well done it doesn't particularly make us care for the characters. That being said you shouldn't see this for the story as it is one downfall in an otherwise very good movie. Gosling alone makes this worth watching, and combine that with the excellent music and great direction and you will be very happy with the film you have just watched. Recommended to all those out there who would love a hint back to the 80's.3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",7,3,6,27 September 2012
The Illusionist," The Illusionist failed to wow me!
","The Illusionist fights a losing battle from the minute you press play. The automatic problem it has is that it is so similar to The Prestige that you instantly compare them. Unfortunately for The Illusionist, The Prestige is such a fantastic film; meaning from the start The Illusionist doesn't live up to expectations. I know you shouldn't really compare films but these two came out within six months of each other, both are period setting, and both about the art of illusion and magic. The Illusionist was released first, so maybe if you saw it first you will like it, however for those who saw it second will only be disappointed. The Illusionist follows an illusionist called Eisenheim (Norton). As a child he fell in love with a young girl named Sophie. Their friendship was frowned upon due to their substantial class differences, so he found himself running from town to perfect a new found talent; magic. Fifteen years later he returns to Vienna to perform a new magic show. When he asks for a member of the audience as a volunteer, the new fiancée to the Crown Prince (Sewell) steps forward, she turns out to be none other than Sophie (Biel). Instantly their love for each other comes flooding back, and Eisenheim begins to mock her fiancée using his tricks. Knowing that Eisenheim is attempting to win his girls affections, the Crown Prince attempts to find out his secrets and shut him down using Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti). As Sophie begins to choose Eisenheim over the Crown Prince, Eisenheim must devise a plan to leave with his girl, especially since the Crown Prince is known for indulging in murder when he doesn't get what he wants. I don't want to delve into too much detail of the plot as I don't want to give away whether or not Eisenheim is a master trickster or a man with supernatural power. The whole second half of the film Eisenheim raises spirits, and changes into a man of few words. Is it actually an illusion? This second half is where the film seems to run out of steam though. The film is based on a short story and it is very noticeable that it is as the film does begin to wear thin. The characters aren't very well developed and the plot seems very flat. Also the final twist to the film was very predictable, and came around all too easily. The characters spent the whole film unaware of what was going on and then all of a sudden someone understands it. The acting was very average. Norton was not his usual self. His delivery of lines seemed to lack tension, but that could have been due to his accent he was putting on. In the second half however, where he mutters minimal words, he is much better as his eyes and facial expressions do the talking. Biel was average and shows that she can do period films as opposed to just teen romantic comedies. Giamatti is in first gear as was Rufus Sewell. I think overall the entire film was a disappointment really, but I think my problem is me comparing it to The Prestige, because I have to say this is nowhere near as good.Some of the illusions are impressive, especially when Eisenheim removes his gloves, throws them in the air and they turn into crows. These tricks are all impressive but others, where he manipulates reflections in a mirror, have no explanation and it seems a little too unrealistic. This is where I much preferred The Prestige as at least they explained how the tricks worked, here he just raised spirits, and we never know how or why. I suppose maybe a magician never tells his secret.I was expecting much more than what I ultimately got. I believe that I may have been harsh on this due to my love for Christopher Nolan's period magician piece; however this film could still have been as good if it had managed to make me believe in it. Unfortunately it did not. With a film exploring a plot like this I at least expect a fantastic pull-the-rug-from-underneath-me twist, but I'm afraid the ending seemed an easy way out and was guessed at the half way point. Regrettably The Illusionist failed to wow me.2.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",5,1,2,26 April 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," See for Lisbeth Salander alone.
","Based on the novel of the same name, this film follows three characters as they intersect each other's lives. Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) is a journalist who has just been sentenced to three months in prison after claims of libel from a corrupt business tycoon. Blomkvist believes he has been set up but nothing helps his case. He is given six months to handle his affairs before being locked away. Henrik Vanger is an elderly man who receives framed, dead flowers once a year from an unknown source. The flowers used to come from his niece who disappeared forty years ago and Henrik believes she is dead. He has never given up hope on finding her and hires Blomkvist to look into her disappearance to give him piece of mind, especially since he still receives the flowers. Blomkvist accepts this last job before he goes inside.Next we introduce the most intriguing movie character I have ever seen, Lisbeth Salander. A socially inept lesbian with short hair, nose, ear and lip piercings and tattoos draped across her back and arms. She is the girl of the title. She is introduced as a researcher who is secretly photographing Blomkvist during his trial. Also being an expert computer hacker she is hacking into his computer so she can see what he sees. After having a troubled up bringing she is left in the care of a guardian, with her Mother in a hospital. Her new guardian however attempts to blackmail her for sexual favours, before savagely raping her, something she manages to film and gain revenge on by tattooing this man's chest. These scenes are some of the most harrowing I have seen and expertly filmed. During his investigation, Blomkvist is sent an email from Lisbeth which helps him with the clue he is struggling to solve. After this he recruits her to aid in his investigation. This is where the film really gets its wheels. From here on in we dive into a world of family conspiracy, incest and rape and the battle of vulnerable women against controlling men. I did not realise that this is what this film was about. Those of you who have read the book will but those who haven't will get a bit of a shock.I have to say I struggled to get into the beginning of this film. Many have told me that to enjoy the book you have to persist with the first fifty pages and once you do the book gets a hold of you. I felt this was definitely the case with the film also. It took a while for it to get going and considering it is subtitled I found myself becoming a little switched off. However I'm glad I didn't as once I had got past that section I was gripped. When Blomkvist and Salander finally meet, the film really gets going. Before that seems too long and at that point of the film I thought that too but now I have finished it I realise how important it was in giving insight into the characters, especially Lisbeth.The plot of the film is nothing to shout about but where the film really grips you is the characters. OK maybe not characters but character. Blomkvist is a little dull and not your typical hero and considering the title of the film, I was surprised to see him be the main character. Lisbeth on the other hand is intriguing. I want to know more about her, even know. Very little is told and the character alone keeps you hooked on the film. She is bigger than the entire plot and she makes you take notice whenever she is on screen. Noomi Rapace is fantastic as her and even manages to give a Gothic woman covered in piercings and tattoos a very sexy edge. The chemistry between the leads is great and the relationship is not clichéd in the slightest.I don't want to say too much about this film as it is one you really have to see. Get past the first twenty minutes and the subtitles and enjoy the characters on that screen. Lisbeth Salander is fascinating. She is to be played by Kate Mara in the American remake and she has a hell of a pair of shoes to fill. There is so much to enjoy in this movie and 'she' is a character you will all enjoy watching. The film is definitely for adults only with scenes of violence, rape and bondage but the excellent direction and cinematography handles it all tastefully although they are a little harrowing. The performances in these scenes are just fantastic. I can't state this enough: go and watch this movie.",8,2,2,8 November 2011
Jerry Maguire," An average film made better with strong performances
","Jerry Maguire was released a good few years ago and, despite knowing a few of the quotes from the film, I had never seen it. I knew it was Tom Cruise as the sport's agent Jerry Maguire, but never really knew the ins and outs of it. I was quite surprised to find out it has a good hint of comedy in it, and isn't as sporty as I thought it was. I was shocked when I sat down to watch this.The film begins showing Maguire as a hot shot agent, who represents many top sport stars across the country. One night however he has an epiphany and writes a 'mission statement' about how his agency should worry about the cliental instead of the money. He posts this 25 page mission statement in everybody at the company's pigeon hole and is greeted at work the next day with a huge round of applause. The big bosses of the company though don't agree with his document and instantly fire him, to be fair why would a company earning millions want to stop earning millions? After being fired he heads off to set up his own business, but first tries to persuade his current sport stars to come with him. They all choose to stay with their current representation, apart from one who is willing to still use Mr Maguire as his agent, Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr). Maguire's company consists of himself and, an assistant who followed him from his former job, Dorothy (Zellweger). The company gets off to a bad start when the biggest football star in the country drops him and goes with Maguire's former company, leaving Maguire to put all his worth into Tidwell, who is an egotistical footballer with a severe attitude problem. As the film goes on Maguire and Dorothy begin to fall for one another, and Tidwell becomes more of a friend than a client. Maguire and Tidwell, who both have different views on life, manage to teach each other subconsciously how to be the men that will make their career flourish. It isn't really a film about sport, it is more about the relationship people have, and especially since it is stated, Maguire struggling to be alone but lacking intimacy with anyone he is close to. The themes are deep, much deeper than a typical sports movie.The script for the film is very good. The characters are so well drawn, and each one manages to bring something to the forefront, all to aid in Jerry Maguire's development as a person. The character of Tidwell is a great character and he is so pivotal for the outcome of this movie. The characters are also aided by some great acting. Cruise is very good in his role here, and is utterly believable as Maguire. He has the look and the mannerisms of an arrogant sports agent. Tom Hanks was originally slated for the role, but Cruise is definitely the right choice for it. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as Tidwell. He is over the top, brash and smitten with his wife. Gooding Jr. brings this character to life so well and thoroughly deserved his Oscar for Supporting Actor that year. Zellweger is also on top form as Dorothy. Her scenes with Cruise are full of emotion, and their chemistry is full of romance, despite one very uncomfortable scene where he kisses her all over on the doorstep. She is clearly in love with Maguire, and Zellweger shows this very well.The film does have a good script and a strong cast but it isn't the best movie out there. The best this movie could possibly be is average. It is an easy watch but the middle sector especially is a little dull. The opening of the film, where we see Maguire have a slight breakdown, is good but it begins to run out of puff towards the end. It is a fairly long film and probably doesn't need to be. The end has a strange climax, and I wander why Tidwell manages to become a bigger star due to him having an injury on the pitch. It was something I just didn't understand. At the end they also announce Tidwell's new contract on the air of a television show, would they do that? Why would people want to hear about it? If anything I would say that would put fans off of him. Here it was pushing the audience to love the football star but why would you be happy for him securing a huge contract. Small issues with this film really bring it down. It isn't a bad film but it also isn't great. The script and the acting are good but there are points that really bring the film down. It is an average film at best, made better by the talent on show. It does have some brilliantly quotable lines, and if you haven't seen this than you will notice which ones I am on about when you watch it. Despite being average I would suggest you watch it, mainly because it is an easy watch and one you won't particularly be disappointed with.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6,3,5,3 May 2012
The Hangover Part II," More like The Hangover I Part II
","Have you ever seen The Hangover? I will be really surprised if anyone is thinking no! If you have seen the first just take the entire story, remove it from Las Vegas, take it across the world, and drop it in Bangkok. Then start the story again and replace any pivotal moments from the first with a new animal, incapable human or disfigurement.The second one is based around Stu's wedding. He is about to marry a gorgeous Thai woman (not a Thai bride and way too pretty for him), and is making Phil and Doug come with him to the wedding, especially since his father-in-law to be hates him. Initially Alan is uninvited but after much persuasion from Doug and Phil, Stu allows it. Once we are in Thailand each character begins to show their typical characterisations: Phil is the party animal, Stu is Mr. Sensible and Alan is stupid as can be. Stu is adamant no bachelor party will take place but agrees to one quiet beer on the beach with Phil, Alan, Doug and his fiancÃ©e's little genius brother Teddy. Zoom forward twelve hours later and the original 'wolf pack' wake up in a shady hotel in Bangkok. From there we are back in the Las Vegas hotel room with Stu waking up with a tattoo (not missing a tooth) and a monkey in the bathroom (not a lion) and one of the group missing, Teddy (not Doug cause he's boring and stayed at the resort). From here we see the group trying to remember what happened the night before and trace back their tracks through the stuff in their pockets and find themselves at a police station, a hospital, a tattooist and a monastery. Does this all sound familiar? Well if it does when you think of the first one and piece together how they found Doug, you may know where Teddy is from the beginning. Honestly this film just takes the entire thread of the first film and changes a few details along the way. It takes away all element of surprise. There are still some good laughs in this film. Many will be disappointed but many will still be laughing. The jokes in this one are a lot cruder and darker. It also shows well the dirty shady areas of a place like Bangkok compared to Las Vegas. The jokes though mainly come from Alan (Galifanakas) and mainly at the expense of Stu (Helms). Once again like the first one I found Phil (Cooper) nowhere near as funny as the others and seems to be the one that less funny stuff happens to. Alan's stupidity is really the driving force of the comedy and there are a few very funny bits including the whole scene of have 'a demon' in Stu. Probably the funniest part of it all. The problem with the Alan character though is that they seem to have made him even more stupid and over the top. They've done to Alan what the American Pie franchise done to Stifler. He just got more silly and it became worse rather than better.The Hangover II is an easy watch, and you will probably be laughing at the anticipation of it as opposed to the comedy of it. We also get Chow (Ken Jeong), back from the first one. He appears much more in this one and at times is completely over the top and it can be a little cringe worthy. Even more cringe worthy though would be the cameo from Mike Tyson. Something that was completely unneeded. He can't act or sing for that matter. There is also a fatter Paul Giamatti. His talents are wasted here and he may watch this and see how bad he looks.I have to say I am a little disappointed with this sequel but I was expecting that. If the writers had of taken it in a different direction it could have really worked, but by producing a carbon copy of the original they have ruined it. In parts it is funny and it is an easy watch so it won't be the worst film you have ever seen but it is not a patch on the original. You may as well give it a watch as it is a bit of fun but let's just hope, with The Hangover Part III in the pipeline, that they at least take us in a different direction and not just show Alan getting married in Amsterdam, with a snake instead of a monkey, Stu having had a nose job and Alan's Dad going missing. Oh wait I could be onto something here!2.5 / 5For more review check out: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com Follow: @WorldofMovies",5,1,1,10 February 2012
Prisoners," Gripping and bleak with powerful performances to keep you hooked until the whistle is finally blown.
","'Two wrongs don't make a right' is a common phrase but with Prisoners we may have found an argument against its meaning. It raises the question of what is right and wrong when you are fighting to save a life. This is shown through faith, torture and upbringing with each character's personality questioning these themes. What is right? Who is wrong? And is it right to do wrong?On Thanksgiving the Dover family enjoy dinner at their old friend's house, the Birches. The enjoyment levels are at an all time high, for the only time in the film, until the youngest daughter from each family disappears. The parents begin to search frantically as the cops find the chief suspect in the RV that was parked up the road. This suspect has an IQ of a ten year old and the police believe they should look elsewhere but Keller Dover thinks otherwise and instead chooses his own methods of getting truth from the suspect. Will they find the girls and who will first?Starring Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, Prisoners raises these intriguing issues by pitting the doting father against his daughter's potential kidnapper. As a parent you'd do anything to get those answers and in Dover's case this resorts to torture, imprisonment and fear. In opposition to that we have Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, an officer who relies on hard police work. These two may be aiming for a shared goal but ultimately they are each other's antagonist as they hunt for truth in very different ways. As an audience member it is up to you to decide which one is right. Villeneuve's direction and Guzikowski's script squeeze the themes to tears by covering each angle and every scene in opposing morality questions. At times these are deep but at others they feel forced, such as a priest who has killed a child killer to prevent him from continuing. This is here to be bleak, depressing and full of moral issues and it doesn't let up from that. Its pace is slow, the music dreary, the cinematography grey and wet, all adding to the tone of Villeneuve's piece. The script at times may feel 'on-the-nose' but it does raise these questions through it. Is it right to kill in order to prevent a killer, even if you are a priest? Added to the bleak tone are exceptional performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal. Jackman portrays the grieving father with power and emotion leaving you unsure whether to route for him when he tortures the mentally confused suspect played by Paul Dano. At times his character is empathetic but at others he is frightening. This may become a problem if he was the hero to route for but instead during these scenes we promote Gyllenhaal's Loki to the forefront and it is his desperate search for the truth that we believe in. Gyllenhall also provides a wonderful performance as the Detective who suspects everyone until they are proved innocent. Both of these men can be seen as our protagonist but in reality neither of them are and instead the shared goal is what we route for. You may have a character you believe in but that all depends on which side of the fence you come down on.All in all Prisoners is a powerful movie, oozing in contemporary and moral issues. They are all prisoners in some way or another, even those fighting to put things right. At times the script laces these issues to the max, causing a few overly uncomfortable and expositional scenes but the gorgeous cinematography, towering performances and the cold atmosphere will have you leaving the theatre questioning what your move would be if you were ever in this position. This is not for the faint hearted and if you fancy a light popcorn entertainment film than Prisoners certainly isn't it.Rating: 4.5 / 5Directing: Villeneuve keeps the story's pace slow and adds more power from doing so.Acting: Strong performances from all involved with a star turn from Jackman.Script: A taut script that is let down slightly by nailing the themes too neatly.Cinematography: Deakins keeps it grey putting a shiver continually down the audience's spine.Score: Adds to the tone and engages you fully.Editing: Seamless. The slow pace remains constant and works. Overall: A thought provoking story that keeps you gripped throughout.",9,1,2,16 October 2013
Into the Wild," A fascinating journey of a selfish and stubborn man running away from himself
","Before I begin let me just state that this film is based on a true story so I will mention the outcome of the film. If you know the story you will know the outcome and if you don't maybe you should stop reading, although I'm sure the outcome is pretty obvious.Chris McCandless (Hirsch) is a young man who has just graduated from college and has the opportunity to move on to Harvard Law School, something his parents are extremely happy about. His parents seem to be of the pushy kind and the sort that believe that a career and money is worth more than humanity itself. It is shown that Chris has been lead down this path when he has dinner with his parents and he tells them he has twenty four thousand dollars saved up. His parents then go on to offer him a car but Chris' reaction to this, in that he rejects it outright, shows that he is a boy who wants to do it all on his own, so much so that once his parents leave him that is exactly what he does. He donates all his money to charity, chops his credit cards and ID, and burns any leftover cash in his pocket. He then climbs into his car and drives west as far as he can, before being wiped out by a flash flood. At this he sets out on foot in an attempt to realise a sudden dream; fleeing to Alaska and living in the solitary wild.The film begins with Chris already having achieved his goal; he stumbles across an old bus in the middle of the forest and uses it as his home, he hunts for deer as food and ensures that the bus is in a good liveable condition. We then flashback to the beginning from when he set off to each character he encounters on his journey. All of this is intertwined with the present moment of him in the forest. Along his journey he meets hippies, farmers, travellers and a lonely old man who each give him something valuable for when he is on his own, be it an item or information. All believe that his dream is crazy and their gifts come with warnings. At the end each gift and each warning have a huge part to play.The film does jump in the timeline. We see him meet a character, they give him his need, and then we move forward to the present and see him taking on this advice or trying to avoid their warning. The flashbacks build towards a happy dream that he is close to completing, and the present scenes in the forest show his depletion towards death. This man learns a valuable lesson of life as it drifts away from him.This is the sort of film that I find frustrating; one because it is something I would like to do, I couldn't think of nothing better than getting up and heading across the country and winging it. On the other hand I couldn't stand it when he clearly begins to struggle but is too stubborn to head out of the wilderness and find a way to his parents who would happily pay for him to get home. This probably frustrated me more as I couldn't understand why he was doing this too himself. I really enjoyed the idea of his journey but he seems to be on a suicide mission.Chris is not a likable character. I hate to say it as he technically was a real person, but he was selfish and willing to hurt anyone who got in his way. It is as if he gets him comeuppance at the end for following a stupid dream. The characters he meet all tell him this and all show good reason for him to stay with them but he won't. He has this idea that he will only be happy if he is alone. This is shown in a heart warming scene towards the end when he meets a lonely old man who sees him as a grandson, but Chris treads all over him and leaves him in tears. This was a huge problem for me in this film, I really disliked the character.That is not to say that the acting by Hirsch wasn't good because he was great in the role. He showed his selfish, stubborn side at the same time as being likable to the people on first impression. He also lost a lot of weight to portray the role which deserves a round of applause. There is also a great turn from Hal Holbrook who plays the old man, Ron. There one final scene really is touching.There wasn't enough in this film for me to say it is brilliant. Too much of it frustrated me and I didn't like the lead character. Some of the scenes seemed pointless which meant the overly long running time could have been slashed. It looks great and there are some truly touching moments, however it isn't enough to make me think it is a great film. It is simply about an arrogant, selfish boy attempting to flee his parents but all he really is becoming is just like them, bringing him to a worse off conclusion.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6,0,1,9 May 2012
Toy Story 2," Not as good as the first but still great!! Another Buzz Lightyear to the rescue
","The original Toy Story set a new level, one that you would struggle to beat. The sequel although not beating it does remain close to that mark and doesn't fail to impress. This one has moved forward in the sense of the animation, with the effects being even more impressive and although the story isn't quite as good it still manages to take us on an exhilarating journey.This sequel starts with all the toys playing happy families. They still get up to their usual tricks when Andy is out the room and still manage to replace themselves just as he comes in. Woody is anxious at the start, struggling to find his hat, the one missing piece of his outfit ready to accompany Andy to Cowboy Camp. They find the hat and Woody is relieved to be able to go but when Andy decides to have a five minute play before he heads off he accidentally rips Woody's arm meaning Woody will have to stay behind after all and up on the highest shelf ready for repair.Woody's second problem is when Andy's mother has a lawn sale in his absence and poor Wheezy (a squeaking penguin) is placed out in the yard. Woody being an all action hero uses the dog to transport him to the sale and save his friend, however a toy collector spots him and steals him, knowing it will complete his collection and earn him big money. It turns out Woody is part of a collection known as the Round-Up Gang. The collection have been locked away in storage for years waiting for Woody to be found and now he has they are all set to be jetted off to Japan and be looked at through a glass box for the rest of their lives. Woody, at first, is reluctant but upon getting to know Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the Prospector he falsely believes that he is more part of something here than at Andy's as Andy will eventually grow up. This scene is shown in a heart moving song from Jessie's point of view another great piece from Randy Newman although he doesn't perform.Buzz and the gang decide to rescue their faithful leader and head off into the wilderness, known as the real world, in search of him. Buzz, Slinky, Mr Potato Head, Hamm and Rex however all encounter their own problems, like meeting another Buzz in a toy shop who they mistake for their Buzz (he performs very much like when Buzz was introduced into the first film) a busy intersection crossing in which they must cross using traffic cones (a brilliant sequence) an aisle of Barbie dolls who each toy can't get enough of and Buzz's long lost enemy, Zurg. All obstacles on the quest to find Woody and to do all the things he has done for them in the first film.The film doesn't surpass the original but at times it definitely matches it. Some of the humour is top class, with the other Buzz providing a lot of laughs especially with our Buzz's reactions to him. It is like watching Buzz and Woody's initial meet in the first one. The chemistry between the other toys on their journey is also well written with each character being very three-dimensional. The same however can't be said for the Round-Up Gang where I found myself less interested in their story than I was with Buzz and the gang's journey. This is where the film lacks compared to the original as only half the story is engaging and we would rather see Buzz's problems than Woody's. The Round –Up Gang aren't as fun with Jessie becoming annoying and Stinky Pete having a sudden turn. Bullseye is also very 'Looney Tune' and although I didn't mind this others will. Unfortunately these are the few problems with the film which don't let it reach the heights of the original. Also the climax seemed to be over far too quickly and seemed far sillier than what it should have been. I understand that the whole concept is unbelievable but an unbelievable concept can be made real but when a stuffed horse is running at the same speed as a plane I was thinking this is getting a little bit too silly now. I can draw the line at five of them driving a car.Don't get me wrong the film is great and I found myself laughing at so many points, especially the Buzz vs. Buzz scenes, they are great. There are also references to the first film and to other films that you will find yourself enjoying pointing out. Despite my slight issues with the film it is still a worthy addition for Pixar and for the Toy Story franchise. It doesn't quite reach the heights of the original but let's be honest not many animated films ever will.",8,0,1,24 November 2011
Drag Me to Hell," Maybe hell isn't such a bad place
","Horror can be a tired, old, clichéd franchise. Many horrors attempt to scare the wits out of their audience by providing insanely loud noises or incredibly strong killers who refuse to die wielding a nasty weapon and some obscure face mask but Drag Me To Hell pulls itself away from both of these boring problems. Lohman is Christine, a loan officer at the bank. She has recently been making progress in her work and is in line for a promotion to Assistant Manager. Only thing in her way is her manipulating colleague Stu (a brilliantly love to hate character played by that brilliant love to hate actor – Reggie Lee). According to her boss Stu is more willing to be aggressive, a skill recognised as highly important in the bank loaning industry. Seeing that she needs to be more firm with her customers, Christine rejects a mortgage extension to an ill, old woman with nothing left but her long term house. Christine though decides that a promotion is much more important than this old witch's life. Upon this rejection the old woman, a gypsy who can conjure black magic, sets a curse on poor Christine, a curse that will have her tormented for three days and then dragged down to the depths of hell. By enlisting the help of her boyfriend (Long) she attempts to tackle this demon before it burns her in flames. Drag Me To Hell brings back the typical old school horror, reverting back to previous Raimi classic The Evil Dead. The thing is though with the technology imputed into films of today, this approach seems to wear thin and instead of finding myself scared, I found myself laughing. Raimi may have had this in mind and attempted to make this film in that way but where the pea soup for sick worked in The Exorcist it fails here. Filmmaking has moved on in such a way that most audience members like to see things look a little more realistic. (Not saying that CGI makes things anymore realistic but brown goo doesn't either)Having said that though this film isn't that bad. The scares are still there just shown in a different form. The high screeching music and the brilliant sound affects mean you could close your eyes and really imagine what is happening on that screen. The different thrills in seeing an eye opening in your cake or an old woman try to eat your face without any teeth. These things people not only freaked me but sent a tingle down my spine.The acting and directing of the film is not up to the participating people's usual standard. Lohman is sometimes good and as soon as you think that, she acts in a way that makes you strip it all back. Long is even worse but whether this is the script, the acting or the casting is another thing. He just doesn't seem old enough to be a college professor with bag fulls of knowledge. In fact the only actor I really liked in the film was Reggie Lee. Maybe this was Raimi's objective all along though. To implore a sort of sixties feel to a naughties movie. Lame special effects, poor acting, comic horror. If that's what he was going for than to be fair he did succeed.All in all Drag Me To Hell does bring a fresh view of entertainment. Something different for all to watch as it is not entirely what you expect. I didn't mind this film but I think that those who loved Raimi's classic The Evil Dead will love it and those who don't or haven't seen it will find this cheap and nasty.",Null,0,0,21 September 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Absolutely brilliant!!!
","I believe this film has set a new benchmark for DreamWorks pictures. Shrek established them as a top class animation production company but since the first sequel they have not hit the same class of movie but I have to say How To Train Your Dragon has bought it back to the heights Shrek bought them and perhaps even surpassed it.How To Train Your Dragon is a story about Hiccup (Baruchel), the son of a fearsome Viking warrior, Stoick the Vast (Butler). The only problem with Hiccup is despite wanting to be a Viking, he physically can't. Compared to the large physique of the Vikings he is like a pussy cat. Desperate to follow in his Father's footsteps he forces his way into battle against the dragons attacking his home town and shoots down the most dangerous dragon of all, Nightfall. With the town folk not believing his story he sets off to find the dragon he shot down, the dragon that has never been seen before let alone caught, the one dragon the Vikings know nothing about. Hiccup finds the dragon but can't bring himself round to killing it to prove he actually did shoot it down, instead he releases it after seeing the scared look in the dragon's eyes. The dragon reacts furiously and attempts to fly off but his damaged tail means he can't get far and becomes trapped in a gorge. Hiccup, blaming himself, brings the dragon food and a handmade flight he has made to help the dragon fly. From there on in a special bond forms between man and beast and Hiccup ends up flying the dragon and keeping him as his own sort of pet. His Father sets off in search of the nest and leaves Hiccup in dragon fighting training but Hiccup has managed to see a softer side of the dragons and instead of slaying them he uses his training methods to calm them. When his Father returns he is furious at Hiccup's betrayal and he captures his dragon which he has named Toothless and again he sets sail intent on destroying the nest with the aid of Toothless' directions.The story is like no other that DreamWorks has created and the film is not a comic film. There are a few moments of comedy but the story is more about the connection seen between the boy and the dragon. It is all so sweet. The dragon is like an over-sized dog who obeys his master's command. The boy forms a trust between the dragons and even has them shuffling up alongside him wanting to be stroked like a cat or dog would do. The movie has heart and doesn't rely on laughs to see it home. The voice cast are good and most of them go unnoticed in their roles, which is good as the last thing you want is to think of the actor rather than the character. Baruchel's voice is very distinct but it works with the weak and feeble Hiccup and of course you can tell it is Butler as the Father as his voice works so well with the large, broad stereotypical man he is playing but I had no idea the likes of Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill or David Tennant were in the film until the credits rolled, which is what I want from an animated film.Adults will love this film just as much as children and if anything I think it is a more adult film that children can love as opposed to the other way round. With few moments of childish comedy and a lot of character connection the film can be related to adults with the childish elements being put in with the colourful dragon's, the slightly clichéd final act and the fact that it is a cartoon. This makes the film loved by everyone but in a different way that people loved Shrek or Toy Story.I loved this film and hope that adults aren't put off watching it due to the animation as it was one of the sweetest, heart moving films I have seen. The cast are great, the animation's great, the characters are great and the dragons are so unique. The ending is also sad and not a stupid cliché. The film was near perfect and the reasons it isn't are these two lines: 'we live in an old town' – but all the houses are new and 'it snows nine months a year and hails the other three' – spoken when they are flying on their dragons in complete sunshine with no snow or hail in sight. Having said that I am not going to let two petty things spoil an otherwise brilliant movie. See it whenever you can.",9,0,0,25 October 2011
Total Recall," It will make your eyes pop out of your head.
","Set in a futuristic world Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker with a gorgeous wife who suffers from nightmares involving the now colonised planet, Mars. Quaid believes these dreams mean something and thinks he has once been to planet, something his wife (Stone) desires not to be true. Quaid's obsession with Mars continues and he signs up for memory implants at Rekall inc, a place where they implant a memory of a holiday as opposed to you having to actually go on one. As a special option to his package, Quaid chooses to have an implant of his profession being as a secret agent and getting the girl of his dreams. Midway through the procedure Quaid starts to lose control and awakens, remembering things that he didn't before. The doctors knock him unconscious and drop him in a cab, denying that he ever came in. When Quaid gets home it becomes apparent that his memory has already been erased once and his life is all just a set up. On the run from an armed secret group, Quaid must go to a communist run Mars and prove to himself who he actually is.Unlike many other Arnie movies, this one does provide some back bone. The story is good and takes you away from the world we live in and into one that everyone will be intrigued by. Who wouldn't want to go to Mars? The science fiction aspect shows a colonised Mars, housing hundreds of mutants dictated by a communist leader, who is under threat by a rebel group attempting to force the government out. Mars is played out like it is a country rather than a planet and a popular holiday destination at that. It serves up brothels, pyramids, tube lines and also what looks like an underground Times Square. Looks like a holiday destination everyone would love. Until the rebel organisation comes along of course. It seems to be a Western country mixed with a South African country. Verhoeven manages to create an atmosphere on Mars and makes you believe in the planet as opposed to having to convince yourself that it is actually real. His set up fills in all the blanks you need and for all you know it could just be a different country.I have reviewed Arnie's films before and let's be honest I don't let the guy live down his poor performances but in this movie he actually had me convinced. Let's get it straight, he can't act, when it comes to emotion he just fails, but in this film he shows confusion and vulnerability and strangely he delivers. Of course there is the odd cheese ball line, spoken with more v's and z's then it should be but the odd one I am willing to let go. Other than The Terminator this is Arnie's best performance.For its age the effects are brilliant. Special effects are used throughout and they really do capture imagination. Sure some of them look a little overdone and it is obvious they are fake but that is one thing that makes the film fun. One for instance is when Arnie pulls a golf ball sized tracking device out of his head through his nose. Sure it looks rubber but it looks good.Most scenes are also filled with gung ho action and firing guns. To some people this is too much but it is all so fitting here. Also the effects of a man being shot look so realistic that it has you clenching believing it is real. Only one other film has made me feel awkward during a shooting and that was another Verhoeven film, Robocop, where the villains kill the cop who ultimately becomes the hero. Just the thought of it sends a shiver down my spine.The film gives off a fun feel and has several aspects that many will like. The talking Johnny Cab is one that everyone will love and the mutant child who can tell you your fortune. Lots of areas really help you connect with the film and although many serious themes are involved most of the action is taken with a pinch of salt. It is just fun.Overall an enjoyable film and one I always remember for people's eyes popping out their heads. I hadn't seen this movie for years and although not one of the best I have ever seen it is one that always entertains me and one I always look forward to watching.",8,0,1,21 October 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Very good, but Snatch surpasses it.
","This film must show Americans that not all the English speak with posh accents and act in pretentious ways. Whenever I watch an American sitcom or film portraying someone British I find myself on my high horse as hardly anyone speaks in the way they think we do. If we give all Americans this film to watch they will soon realise that England isn't as pretty in pink as they seem to believe. This film is gritty, dark, humorous and filled with all kinds of cockney rhyming slang that Americans would need subtitles. This is the London they all fail to see. The film is about four friends, one of whom Eddy (Moran) is a brilliant card player due to his ability to read people's emotions during a game of cards. Being onto what they believe as a winning deal, the group all pitch in twenty five thousand pound for him to use in an underground card game. Little do they know however that Hatchet Harry, the organiser of the game, doesn't believe in a fair game and cheats his way to taking all Eddy's money and incurring him a five hundred thousand pound debt on top of that. The debt also includes his friends who will all start losing their fingers if they don't repay in seven days. The friends have no idea where to start but manage to overhear their drug dealing neighbours discussing their plan to steal a large amount of money from some incompetent drug dealers. Eddy's plan is to rob these guys once they have robbed the other guys. Meanwhile two antique shotguns have just been priced at three hundred thousand pounds and Hatchet Harry sends two scouse lads in to steal them. Miscommunication construes and Eddy and the gang end up with five hundred thousand pounds worth of cash and two antique shotguns. Breathing down their neck are also the neighbours, the incompetent drug dealers and their dangerous boss, Hatchet Harry and his cronies and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who 'collects' for Harry. The film plays out with lots of interweaving plot lines and several twists and turns all filled with irony. Each twist and turn ends up with someone not realising just what they have a hold of. For example the group find themselves in possessions of the guns which would solve all their problems but they have no idea that these guns are actually of some value. Also the two scouse lads tracking down the guns don't realise they are actually hunting down the person they robbed them for in the first place. The plot is completely confusing and will make no sense in writing but to watch it you will see exactly what I mean.The script is fantastic, all the dialogue is realistic and well thought out and the majority of the acting is spot on, especially from Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham. The opening five minutes set it all up with an Only Fools and Horses style selling technique. Bacon (Statham) is attempting to flog some dodgy jewellery before being chased by the police. The dialogue and acting in this sequence sets us up for the acts to follow and really creates the world that we will be living in for the next two hours. Bravo Mr Ritchie a compelling script you have bought to our attention. One scene that is brilliant is when the neighbours are locked in a cage during the robbery and are being shot at with an air rifle. The whole sequence is fantastic.However the film does have its downfalls. At times there are just too many characters and people are introduced and then disappear for long periods before returning and others show up so late you wander why they were bothered with in the first place. In the end it does all come together but throughout the overuse of characters sometimes makes the plot seem a little disjointed.I personally think this is a very good film but it has to be your cup of tea otherwise you won't enjoy it. It is one of Guy Ritchie's best films but certainly not his best, Snatch gets that award hands down. I believe that if I was reviewing this film in 1998 then I would be more impressed but as I am viewing it after I've seen Snatch particularly, I can't rate it quite as highly. It is a good film but I suggest you watch it before Snatch. That way you will be treated to a very good film followed by a great one.",7,1,3,30 November 2011
Thor," A poor man's Iron Man
","For those of you that don't know, Thor is a member of the mega assemble that is The Avengers. Later this year The Avengers hits screens globally and will show several big named superheroes such as Iron Man, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk. Another one of these is Thor and that is the reason I believe this film was made, as an over long trailer for The Avengers movie. Thor's story just does not seem good enough to warrant an entire movie. The film is just hinting at the Avengers throughout and if you are not aware of The Avengers than you may struggle to really understand what is going on. To be fair nothing really happens so you may find it an easy follow.It starts in a completely different realm. The realm that is Asgaard. A place lead by Odin (Hopkins) with two sons, Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston). Throughout time Asgaard has been at war with the Frost Giants and when it is finally resolved Thor stupidly heads back to fight once again, taking his team of warriors and brother with him. This causes uproar with his Father who deems him unworthy of being the next King and of his power, so he casts him out and Thor ends up down on Earth.He arrives on Earth as three scientist are out in the dessert looking for a scientific light. Instead what they do is hit a random man in the middle of a tornado with their van. This man is Thor. As well as Thor landing on Earth so does his power, the power of his hammer. Aided by Jane (Porter), one of the scientists, he heads to the location of the hammer, which is now surrounded by S.H.I.E.L.D agents (This is an Avengers nod). Thor breaks in but can't move the hammer, his power is no more. From there he must adapt to human life but a threat on Earth causes him to defend its honour. This comes about all too easily.Back up on Asgaard, Odin falls ill and is on the verge of death meaning a devious Loki takes command and decides that to become King he needs to kill Thor. This means destroying parts of what Thor has now become to love, Earth.The story is weak, I'll give you that. Don't see this if you expect twists and turns cause you won't get them. Instead you get a typical jealous family member, a typical love story and a lot of poor humour and cheesy lines. Such a step back from Iron Man which is fantastic, especially compared to this.The film feels too short. It's nearly two hours but something about it just doesn't make it feel very long. Maybe it's because nothing ever really happens. The second act is very dull and a lot of unbelievable change seems to take place. The film is rushed and I was surprised when I saw it was nearly two hours long. The opening war on Asgaard is far too long. If they cut it down they could have made room for considerable character development as I have to say there is none what so ever. Thor is arrogant, selfish and irresponsible but over night changes his entire outlook. So much so that he goes from fighting federal agents to drinking beer (do they do this in other realms) and then cooking breakfast the next morning with a tea towel over his shoulder. What the....? Natalie Portman's character must fall in love with every guy she meets. No development took place upon Thor and Jane's new found love but all of a sudden it just happened and this was supposed to be the catalyst into Thor's decision to defend Earth. It is so unbelievable, no development in their relationship what so ever. Also the other scientists might as well not be there as they do nothing for the plot, especially Kat Dennings who brings a few pointless lines. Loki is also not developed, he seems a wimp at the beginning but, again, overnight manages to become fearless. He already looks sleazy when we meet him, so it is obvious he will cause some sort of deception. Despite slating Loki, Hiddleston does play the part well and it isn't his fault the character just changes, he does manage to play both attitudes very well. Not a lot can be said with the rest of the acting however, which isn't great. Hemsworth is OK but Portman is poor. To go from Oscar Winner for Black Swan to this is a huge mistake. She may look good in a cheesy, slow motion shot of her running to aid her beloved Thor, but it does not mean it is a good casting choice.In fact most of this film is poor and makes very little sense as to why they even bothered. Branagh is not the right choice of director for this kind of film but he does manage to produce some great effects. The effects in Asgaard are great but the story on Earth is much more intriguing. See this if you like Marvel or special effects. Avoid if you enjoy though provoking film.2 / 5More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",4,0,2,1 February 2012
Zombieland," So silly it had me laughing my head off
","I have just finished watching Zombieland and I have to say it is so much fun. I was laughing throughout and I'm pretty sure that I was watching it the whole way through with a silly smile on my face. That is how this film will make you feel because it is so silly, but so good at the same time.The plot is a little threadbare but I'll let you know what the plot is meant to be. Jesse Eisenberg plays Colombus, a student who is one of the few survivors of the epidemic which has turned everyone else into zombies, hence calling the USA; Zombieland. Due to him being a bit of a loner, he decides to head across the country on route to his parents in Ohio. As the film begins we see him begin his journey and via narration he tells us his situation, and also explains the rules he has to endure to survive. These rules are put forward with funky graphics on screen and with a short hilarious clip of the problems if you break them. This shows you how quirky this is going to be from the start.Whilst on route he meets a bad-ass zombie killer called Tallahassee, played brilliantly by Woody Harrelson. They become a duo and both head across America, Colombus en-route to Ohio and Tallahassee to find the last box of Twinkies in America. As they travel they encounter zombies and Tallahassee shows us why he is such a bad-ass when it comes to killing them.As they continue they meet two sisters, Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin), in a supermarket, who end up coning them and leaving them car less and weapon less. They set back off on foot and find themselves a hummer, complete with machine guns galore in the back, their lucky day. In their new car they eventually come back across the sisters and this time they join forces. The sisters are en route to a theme park, in order for the youngest sister to enjoy a bit of her childhood instead of living in a post apocalyptic world; also they believe it is zombie free. On their way they take refuge in a Hollywood stars house, resulting in a hilarious cameo, and then once again they hit the road, attempting to avoid zombies and get to know each other a little better.The film doesn't have a lot going for it in terms of story, but what it lacks in it makes up for in laughs, acting, and chemistry. So much about it is fun that you forget the films negatives. The cameo scene steals the show, and one of the lines, their final lines in fact, is absolutely brilliant. The final scene at the theme park is also great and the zombies themselves look hilarious as well as slightly scary.The four leads are brilliant together, especially Eisenberg and Harrelson. Harrelson has some great scenes when he takes out zombies, with the graphics flashing up 'killing of the week' when he makes a good take down.I can't praise this movie enough. Don't get me wrong it isn't the best film out there, and isn't the funniest comedy but it is a hell of a lot of fun. People will state that it is an American rip off of Shaun Of The Dead which I agree it probably is. The director even admits that he wanted to make this because of Simon Pegg's zombie comedy. The point is it knows it is a slight rip off but doesn't take itself seriously enough too care. Shaun Of The Dead has a better story than Zombieland, but Zombieland is just as much fun. Watch this film and I'm sure you will laugh out loud a lot more than once.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.uk",7,0,2,19 April 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," Could have killed me....yawn!!
","I watched this film as I decided that it was about time I watched some of the classics that 'Greatest Films of All Time' lists keep raving on about. I have to say after watching a couple of them I feel the list needs tearing up and starting over.To Kill A Mockingbird is a famous book written by Harper Lee. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her writing and I believe that this is the reason the film is deemed a classic as I have to say I found it utterly dull and boring.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a lawyer who looks after his kids alone after the death of his wife. The beginning of the film is from the point of view of his daughter Scout, who plays in the street and has a good relationship with her brother Jem. They have a belief that a man who lives down the street is actually insane and they taunt this man by sneaking onto his property and banging on his door. The fun of being a youth hey. Their fun soon changes though when their Dad is offered the job of defending a black man who is accused of rape. Due to them living in a racist era the town's folk don't take too kindly to Atticus defending a clearly 'guilty' black man and they intend to make his life hell. Their kids fight Atticus' kids, they lynch mob the police station and threaten Atticus and they all lose great respect for this man and his family. As the film gets to the trial we see the children losing a part of their innocence as they realise there is evil in this world.The trial scenes are not as tense as they should have been and they take all the attention away from the children. For forty minutes or so they are barely in a shot. Atticus tries to defend the black man, Tony Robinson and although he is clearly innocent he faces a losing battle against an all white jury. Tony is killed after the trial and the father of the man Tony apparently raped, goes after Atticus' children.I won't tell you what happens after as I wouldn't want to give away an ending of a classic, although if you listen to me I wouldn't bother watching it. People will though due to its status in society and I am aware that it conveys a meaningful message, especially for the era it was released in but the whole ending throws out the principal Atticus is fighting at the beginning. The film to me is just a mess. I know the book is a classic and no I haven't read it but that doesn't make the film a good one. It is just plain boring.I had this problem a while back whilst watching another film voted as one of the greatest of all time: Citizen Kane. Oh my, that film must have been the most boring film I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt tears streaming down my face. This wasn't quite as bad but it is one of those classic films that people of today won't get, especially if they are under thirty.I have no problem with the acting in it. Gregory Peck is very good as Atticus and there are a few good scenes that I found myself interested in but very quickly I would be falling asleep again. Maybe I'm not appreciating what is supposed to be beautiful about this movie but to me there is absolutely nothing.Disappointed to say the least but there is one thing To Kill A Mockingbird has taught me, to not trust the 'All Time Greatest Movie' lists that are around unless of course they actually have something about them, like The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Now that is a classic.",Null,2,5,16 November 2011
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Best movie to quote EVER!!
","If you are a fan of Will Ferrell than you are in for a treat. Anchorman is Ferrell at his absolute best and absolute funniest.Ferrell is Ron Burgundy; an Anchorman in the 70's who is enjoying his life on top of the pile. In an era plagued with feminism, Ron's manly news team are the celebrities of the news room, leaving other channels traipsing behind. These members of the cast are played by other popular current comedy actors in Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson. We are also treated to a Tim Robbins cameo although this feels a tad out of place.Ron's news team are put under threat with the appointment of Veronica Corningstone. A woman, yes a woman, hell bent on becoming the first female anchor. A feat she achieves when Ron is involved in an unfortunate burrito incident with Jack Black.This sets up the tale of love and betrayal although done in a way that only makes fun of itself and the opposing characters. Not one area of this film takes itself seriously and it also pokes fun at the serious issues of chauvinistic work places and feminism of the late 70's.It works because the cast perform brilliantly. Ferrell was made to be Ron Burgundy and he delivers all his lines, and I am sure most were improvised, with perfection. Carell is also ace as a dim witted weather reporter who has one of the lowest IQ's known to man and Paul Rudd plays a sports reporting ladies man who enjoys wearing the smell of panther, much to the dismay of others.This film will have you in stitches. It had me laughing out loud on several occasions although there is a slight lull in the middle where the jokes start to run thin. I cannot blame the writers for struggling they did fit so many brilliant lines into one film. Lines that will have you and your mates imitating and giggling at over a beer down the pub. That though is the problem with this film.This was not the first time I have seen this film. As a matter of fact I have seen it a few times and during the first time I shut it off. I found it stupid and moronic humour. That's where I thank my friends for reciting so many brilliant lines down the boozer. I was intrigued and that's what made it so funny when I finally heard them spoken from the horse's mouth.I am telling you now, give this movie a chance. Watch it then watch it again and repeat the hilarious lines for your own amusement, they never tire. However, do not watch this expecting a good story. If you are a fan of Ferrell it is worth it, if you cannot stand him it is not. You will want to tear your eyes out. I didn't and, if you are like me you will never tire of hearing someone question their own name. I'm Ron Burgundy?",Null,4,7,21 September 2011
The Reader," Secrets, sex and death
","People will think The Reader is another holocaust story. Granted some areas of this film are based around it but it is the deeper subtext of this film and the questions it asks us that take it in another direction entirely. This film intends to show that not everyone involved was a monster.We start with a middle aged Michael (Ralph Fiennes) preparing to meet with his daughter. He seems to be holding a secret. A secret he takes us on in his mind. We transport back to the fifties where Michael (now played by David Kroos) is eighteen and throwing up in the street. He is helped by a thirty year old woman, Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) who cleans up his mess and gets him home. When Michael is finally better he visits Hanna with a bunch of flowers to say thank you. Within minutes he realises that she is a secretive woman albeit seductive and when he spots her getting changed he finds himself swelling up and leaving. Of course he goes back, Hanna has left a lasting impression in a matter of minutes and upon his arrival an affair triggers. One which must be kept secret. Hanna blows hot and cold with a young naïve Michael, where all he wants to do is fall in love she seems to just want sex. She shows her distance when it takes the third time they sleep together before she tells him her name. As well as sex Hanna asks Michael to read to her, refusing to read anything himself. Over a summer the couple hold a steamy affair involving reading and sex, distancing Michael from the things an eighteen year old should be doing. Hanna begins to realise this and disappears leaving Michael distraught and wandering who this woman really was.Years later he is attending law school. The class sit in on a war crime trial of six guards who would select people for death at Auschwitz. To Michael's horror he sees that Hanna is one of the guards on trial and that her distance and secrets were of her past but that isn't entirely accurate. Eventually Michael works out her secret and knowing it could help her in the trial he must decide whether this secret will bring justice to her victims.Michael still beats himself up over his choices and still in his fifties he finds himself writing and taping himself reading books for Hanna's benefit as she rots in prison. He can't seem to see evil in her.The film ranges from a love story, to a political drama, to a war-crime holocaust piece to a non linear grudge story. It never seems to really settle on a genre and as we go through we change into different tones. The film starts great and continues well when we find out Hanna's secret. Although the secret becomes a twist to the film it seems to be very minimal for the circumstances this woman finds herself in. The secret could lighten her sentencing but instead she would rather not be ashamed. The only way I can see through this is as if she realises the pain she has caused and believes she should be punished.The Reader does show the holocaust in a different way. We see it from this woman who is not particularly evil but of one following orders and her job. She is deemed as bad as every other soldier involved and that's where the differences is, we strangely sympathise with her when really we shouldn't. She even says to the judge, 'what would you have done?', when he asks if she was involved in the selection of people next in line for the chamber. Not giving her an excuse but it shows how several people chose to dust the occurrences under the carpet in order to continue with life.Many will find this a little off putting as no one wants to give sympathy to the criminals during the holocaust but the film has a lot of subtext which go deeper. It's all about secrets. The affair is a secret for starters, at only eighteen Michael can't tell his parents he is sleeping with a thirty year old woman and it is something she also wants to keep hidden. Also the secret which he knows can get her off the hook. Does he reveal it or doesn't he? The film is about false love, false hope and choices. The choices we make that define a person and a generation and this film shows how different generations attempt to understand each other. The acting is great, the young Kroos and Winslet hold great chemistry with an erratic relationship and Ralph Fiennes comes in to add an emotional edge in the last forty minutes. His first meet with Winslet after years is sad and perfectly acted from both parties. The cinematography is realistic and believable and really shows a post war Germany as they attempt to cover the cracks and forget the horrific past. I would have liked to have seen it told more linear however as at times it became confusing.Not the best post war Germany film to be released and also not the best holocaust film but it does force you to ask different questions towards what went on in these times and although it will not change anyone's opinion on what actually happened it may make you start thinking about it much deeper than you did before.",Null,0,0,16 November 2011
The Wrestler," Rourke and Aronofsky make this a moving, powerful film
","In 2008 Darren Aronofsky helmed the movie that would bring Mickey Rourke's career back to potential stardom. The Wrestler is a film about a former legend refusing to accept when his time is up and would rather be respected for something he can't do than be forgotten for something he can. It is a powerful, moving story that simply uses wrestling as a way to highlight the obstacles that approach a man who has lived life from the inside out.We open watching Randy 'The Ram' (Rourke) preparing for his next match up. In the title sequence we see that he was once a top wrestler, one of those ones we all gawp at on the television, now twenty years later he is performing in front of a few hundred in a sports arena as opposed to the millions in front of a TV camera. We witness him and his opponent going through the motions of their fight back stage and then we see the real thing. It may be fake, but boy it is still brutal. The wrestlers cut themselves with razors in order to gain affect and literally talk to each other so they know the next move. Even the poor referee gets in on the action. This is Randy's world. This is where he is appreciated. We later see him meet the woman he desires in Cassidy (Tomei), a stripper at his local bar, who he sees as a sounding board for all of his wrestling experiences. He used to have it good and he wishes to one day get back there, but his crippled body now sees him struggling to pay rent and having to take on a part time job at a grocery store. His next fight pits him against the 'crazy one' who uses staple guns to hurt his opponent. This is a bloody fight and although premeditated they really are hurting each other. So much so that once the fight is over Randy suffers a heart attack. After being told he can never wrestle again Randy cancels his big comeback fight and settles for attempting to woo the affections of Cassidy and renew the friendship between him and his estranged daughter, but he soon realises that without the ring, without the cheering, without the bloodshed he can't cope with life and the temptation of one day fighting again is just far too much.The first thing that deserves a mention is the personnel involved. Mickey Rourke is fantastic as 'The Ram'. He isn't playing this character, he is this character. It was rumoured that Nicolas Cage was first in line for the role and I am so glad Rourke got it as he is the only one you can really see playing it. The long bleach blonde hair, the fake tan, the steroid induced body all work when it comes to Rourke's style and look. He is Randy 'The Ram'. When he isn't kicking lumps out of fellow wrestlers, Rourke pulls us into his trouble personality with an emotional turn at the midpoint. His world is on the up and he is enjoying his new found life, but when it all turns bad Rourke's performance makes us feel his pain. Emotion is his pain not the ass kicking in the ring. Tomei is also brilliant and very daring in a role that has her wearing nothing but a tiny g-string. She is 'The Ram's' sounding board although they are very similar, she is the female version of him in a different world but manages to handle it a whole lot better. Evan Rachel Wood is also affective as his daughter but doesn't have as much screen time as the others. Aronofsky's direction is also top notch. This man has always delivered fantastic films (Requiem For A Dream being one of my favourites) and he delivers yet another one here. His decision to not show us Randy from the front until at least ten minutes is a great one. At first we see a fighter but when we finally see him for what he is a lonely old man. The choice to give us many following tracking shots also works. Many of them are following Randy as he walks through corridors, through the shop, through the woods, basically through life, and it makes us experience his world. The best piece is when we hear the crowd as Randy prepares for his first day on the Deli Counter at the grocery store, only for the crowd cheers to disappear when he enters the deli instead of the ring. It's such a meaningful shot.The story feels like that of a prisoner who struggles to live outside of a jail cell. This is the sort of man Randy is but his prison is the ring. He doesn't know how to be or how to act when it isn't in spandex. This set up and story arc leads us to a powerful ending that really shows how a man can struggle through life when he has tasted something he loves. It is emotional, it is powerful, it will make you understand the world of a onetime hero, Rourke and Aronofsky are to thank for that. Don't be put off by the fact it is wrestling, there is a much deeper story and his profession is simply the rope he leaps off to find himself in a troubled world. This is a must see.4 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",8,0,0,19 October 2012
Raging Bull," Ladies and Gentlemen the Raging Bull, Jake La Motta
","Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the raging bull, Jake La Motta. This has got to be a film almost all of you would have heard of. It chronicles the rise and fall of boxing middleweight champion Jake La Motta. The man who was so powerful in the ring but so judgemental out of it. The story begins with his first divorce. He struggles to control his temper with his wife and they argue ferociously about small issues such as the cooking of a steak. The rows begin to change his wife who begins to react to any comment he makes causing her to yell at him down the street from the window for all to see. The marriage is doomed from the moment we witness it. His life begins to change though when he meets Vicki (Moriarty). She is a bubbly young girl who all the men want to be with, but she takes a liking to Jake and they begin to date. She follows his success in the ring and it looks like she takes every punch that he does. She is a young girl falling in love.Over the years, Jake's happy life outside the ring causes him to excel in it. He fights his way to a position where no one wants to fight him. Once he reaches this point he seems to believe that it's his wife that wants to fight him. Inside of Jake a jealous monster is released.There is great chemistry between Jake and his brother Joey (Pesci), the brother that idolises his sibling. He does anything he says including punching him in the face and siding with him over the jealous spats against his wife. Jake's jealousy really becomes apparent to us when his wife states that the guy he is fighting next has a 'pretty face'. Something Jake can't accept. In his fight with the guy he pummels his face so hard that afterwards he looks into his wife's eyes from the ring as if to say, 'he ain't pretty no more.' After this Jake is given his title fight, which he wins, causing him to be away from home a lot. Joey is given the duty of keeping eye on Vicki and whilst doing this he causes a full on bar brawl in a posh venue because she is having drinks with friends. This is no business of Joey's but what his brother asks he does.Later however, once Jake becomes aware of the brawl, he turns on his brother and suspects him of sleeping with his wife. This causes the two to fight and leaves the siblings parted. Jake continues his career without his brother and eventually loses in what would be his last fight. Years later a divorced Jake is a fat failed comic and his life has changed significantly. From being on top of the world he quickly becomes underneath it. The film manages to show us lots of angles on his life. It isn't really a film about boxing, it is about jealousy and how one man can hold his temper in the ring but not out of it. How much of this is fact I will not know but if it is this man could have been something great but let it all go due to low self esteem and selfishness. He slaps his wife around and then his brother causing him to lose all he loves. To look at Jake la Motta at the beginning of the film compared to the end will show a significant difference to how this man has changed.I keep referring to the man as Jake. As you will all be aware is that Jake is played by De Niro, but De Niro is that good that he IS Jake La Motta. He is brilliant, from the muscular boxer to the fat stand up. He hits every emotion brilliantly especially when he is locked in prison and realises what he has lost. Pesci is also brilliant and his chemistry with De Niro is as if they are real brothers. Some of their interactions, like in the accusation scene and the scene discussing that 'if he wins, he wins and if he loses, he wins', is top drawer and some of the best scenes you will see. Moriarty should also be mentioned particularly as she plays a middle aged woman with ease considering she was nineteen when she starred in this film. She starts off so bubbly and ends as if a prisoner, shown in a fantastic shot of her surrounded by mirrors. The acting was great, the script great and the story great.My small qualm is with Scorcese however. I know he won several awards for this film and he is a fantastic director, but I have an issue with him. Every film he makes I continually spot continuity problems. Maybe I am just anal about it but with a film maker as brilliant as Scorcese these things shouldn't be happening. Sometimes it distracts me when I don't want it to.I don't want to leave it on a slight downer though as it is a very good film. Don't watch it for boxing as you are not getting a Rocky, watch it if you want Rocky with a bit more depth.4 / 5Read more reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",8,1,2,1 February 2012
Blade Runner," Looks great, deep message, poor story
","Blade Runner is a film I had grown up hearing so much about, but one that I had never actually watched. It is a film that is often called the most inspirational and I hear it changed sci-fi movies for the better. Due to this I thought it was about time to sit down and watch it.Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop in Los Angeles in 2019. LA is now entirely futuristic, which back in 1982 you may have presumed it would be but today you will see how away from the mark it is. It is home to giant billboards advertising anything and everything. A dark, gloomy, and wet atmosphere heavily influenced by the Japanese, and above all flying cars. To be fair some of it was right on the money. Deckard is a cop known as a blade runner. A blade runner is a certain unit that hunts down replicants (artificial humans) that were created for off-world work. Every now and again replicants go missing and blade runners must stop them and retire them. Deckard is brought out of his own retirement to hunt down six replicants who have escaped and are on Earth searching for their maker in order to prolong their life. Due to replicants growing emotion over time, each has a life span of four years, however when these replicants realise this they head to meet their creator and keep themselves alive. Deckard must stop them before they get too far, unfortunately for him he meets one of these replicants and falls in love with her. Does he retire her?All of that is generally the back story and what you need to know to understand the basis of the film. Really the film is about Deckard hunting the replicants and falling in love. For those of you that have seen it you will understand what I am about to say, it isn't really about any of that. It is full of philosophical issues that will have you thinking after the film has finished. When this film was first released it wasn't well received and people have taken to it after numerous viewings and discussion. Believe me you must have to watch it more than once because I've seen it once and it is really dull. That may cause unrest with people but I have to say I didn't think much to it. I understand the philosophical views hidden deep but I don't see how that makes it a good movie. There is no real story. The themes could have still been explored with more going on but it was just a lot of sitting around and not doing much. It really wasn't what I was expecting. For starters the villain doesn't really show up till over an hour in, so far into it that I forgot there was even a bad guy. The love scenes didn't work as the characters weren't believable, I understand after reading discussions why that might be, but that isn't good for the average movie goer that wants to leave the cinema happy and finished with it. Not everyone likes to research into the movie. I can really see why it has taken time to be a cult film as it has given people time to put forward their theories which people will then relate to it on another viewing. I'm sorry but I don't get it.I can however understand why it has influenced so much. The visuals alone are stunning, and the fact it was made twenty years ago is not noticeable. If it was released in cinemas tomorrow you would not have known it was made two decades ago. The production design completely outshines any story within this film. I can also see the influence within the philosophical themes and how they have opened up many questions. Are replicants human if they believe they are? In the film they are implanted with memories to make them believe they are real, but are they real if their memories aren't actually theirs? I get that these questions are well explored, and I do like to see this in a film, but I was not hooked on the story. It never really drew me in and I was waiting for the action to kick off and it never did. It was so disappointing. It does have brilliant things about it but the entire outcome of the film is completely dull. Hopefully over time I may come to like it and understand it more. Maybe I don't like it because I don't get it and maybe that is the problem. I'm sure people will completely disagree with this but something more had to grab my attention and it didn't.The look of the film is the top draw of this movie. It looks absolutely fascinating, and I would say to watch it just to see how good it is. The acting is generally OK but nothing great. To be fair the characters were so dull that they had little to work with, although some are replicants so that could make sense. The love story is really forced and I never believed it. However there can be an explanation for all of this..... This could be a spoiler, but then again after watching it you'll realise it is not. Six replicants escape, we only ever meet five! Have a watch and you might understand why the movie is why it is.2 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",4,6,15,28 March 2012
Thor: The Dark World," This film suggests Thor can't live without Loki and should really be saved for The Avengers' movies
","Marvel Phase Two is fully underway now with the second instalment of the section coming in the form of Thor: The Dark World. Kenneth Brannagh has vacated the director's seat and Game of Thrones' Alan Taylor has replaced him with the principle cast all returning, including that scene stealing tycoon Tom Hiddleston.This time out Thor must reconcile with the un-too-happy Jane, who is fully aware he graced his presence on Earth during The Avengers (perhaps like the rest of the world she saw it in her local cinema) and enlist the help of brother Loki to stop the evil Maliketh who has threatened to destroy all nine realms of the universe. The plot is utter nonsense, like we expect from superhero films, but it lends itself to what director Taylor does best; epic battle sequences. Compared to its predecessor this is bigger, bolder and badder with Christopher Ecclestone bringing a darker baddie in the evil Lord Maliketh. Despite the obvious lift from the original this does however feel like a weaker movie. The action scenes are meatier (you expect nothing less from Taylor) but the story has given way because of this, something Brannagh was good at. It is as if the Thor series needs a cross between both directors to really bring through a better movie. Perhaps someone like Joss Whedon, I don't think he's too busy at the moment. Instead what we have with this sequel is an emotionless narrative that allows Loki to shine through once again. We can't help but wonder that if the character was omitted from the films that they would cease to be made. Hiddleston's appearance is briefer than previous outings but he still manages to bring the charm and humour that the first one also had. There is also an excellent and somewhat unusual performance, from Stellan Skarsgard who is a much different character to what we remember. He is also charged with bringing through the humour and via these two characters we are given a film that breaks up epic battles with comedic one liners and scenarios. This gives the film a frustratingly noticeable tonal shift throughout which eliminates any emotional impact the film may have had. Around the half way point a potentially emotional scene takes place but the choice of scenes that surround it fail to lead into and out of it. The editing makes it jumpy and there is little room to settle into one tone before jumping into another.In comic books superheroes are faced with a host of villains. Some are noteworthy and some are trash receptacle fodder. Unfortunately Marvel appears to have picked the latter of the two in their choice of Maliketh. His motives are never explored and his involvement adds little to the plot other than to bring Thor and Loki together.The plot is where the film is really let down. By the time the epic climax takes place (a well constructed battle in Greenwich) the story isn't up to speed and there must have been a scene or two cut that would have brought us emotionally to this level. It is all rather rushed with too many stories being nipped in order to gain more Loki. Even encounters with Jane are skimped on but I can't see this as an issue due to her being a highly unlikeable character. The problem with Thor is that without Loki the character has little going for him but with Loki plot strands are under developed or merely Macguffin's to bring Loki into the story. It makes us question as to whether Thor is really a strong enough character to hold his own movie in the way Tony Stark/Iron Man is. For me he isn't.Thor: The Dark World is a disappointment to the Marvel universe. It is probably slightly better than the original film but that was a weak instalment also. The tone throughout both films alters and it is as if no one really knows what to do with the character. There is suggestion a third movie will be on the way but if Loki isn't around it could fall flat on its face and if he is it may feel repetitive. Perhaps it is time for Thor to hang up the hammer until the Avengers come calling.Rating: 2.5 / 5Directing: The battle scenes are awesome but the emotional elements have little impact. Acting: Hemsworth is fine; Portman is flat so it is a good job Hiddleston is still on form.Script: I can't help but think the script has been altered throughout production.Cinematography: The film looks great (Asgaard especially) and the epic final battle is breathtaking.Score: Adds to the battle sequences.Editing: At times it is far too pacy and doesn't allow the quieter moments to sink in. Overall: Not one of Marvel's finest and raises the question of Thor's ability to carry an entire movie.",5,0,1,22 November 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A horror fans dream
","Towards the end of the seventies and beginning of the eighties, we were blessed with some great horror films that have become cult classics today. First off there was Halloween, that introduced us to Michael Myers. Secondly was Friday the 13th which gave birth to Jason Voorhees. Next came A Nightmare On Elm Street which unleashed a demon into our dreams in Freddy Kruger. Looking back on this film now, after having Freddy Kruger being a huge horror villain as I grew up, I see that in the very first film he is nothing like he is interpreted today. The sequels seem to have ruined the character slightly as in the first film he is frightening, unpredictable and kept in the dark for most of the film, leaving you anticipating his next move. There are none of the wise cracks that he is resembled with today, and he is nothing like the version we saw in the 2010 remake.For those who don't know, the film follows a girl called Nancy (Langenkamp) and her group of friends. One by one they begin to have nightmares, each involving the same man, Fred Kruger. This man is heavily scared, wears a hooped red and green jumper, a tatty hat, and has knives for fingers. As the group begin to realise they are dreaming of the same guy one of the girls is killed in her dream by Fred Kruger, which kills her in real life. Shown in a fantastic scene where this poor girl is dragged across the ceiling, blood spilling from her but no other person in sight. Once this girl is killed her boyfriend becomes the main suspect and he has no way to prove his innocence. The only one that believes him is Nancy, who has now started to have these nightmares more frequently, and finds herself attempting to stay awake for days on end in order to avoid her nightmare. Once the truth about Freddy is revealed she devises a way to finally bring a stop to her nightmare and sets up a trap involving her boyfriend (Depp) to finish Kruger once and for all.What makes this stand out from other horror films of its time is that it explores the notion of dream against reality. At times during the film you are unaware of which reality we are in and this really adds to the visuals of the film, especially when we see Freddy's destruction in reality and he isn't even there. We are also introduced to another horror icon who doesn't remain silent throughout, and walk like a machine hell bent on death. We have a killer insistent on laughing at the poor children he is tormenting, and one that also looks feeble in comparison to other icons. He may not be as scary as Michael Myers but something about Freddy Kruger really sends a shiver down your spine.Considering the film was made nearly thirty years ago, it is still pretty scary. Scenes that show a blood soaked girl calling out from inside a body bag is chilling, and when she is dragged around the room is incredibly disturbing and one you won't be able to shift from you minds.Other scenes however aren't as scary and can look a little comedic, but I think that is due to the low budget and standard of film making back then. Robert Englund, who plays Freddy, is brilliant in this film. He brings the character to life and I'm sure would scare children if they watch this film. The make up for him is brilliant and his costume is now very iconic. Langenkamp unfortunately is not great in her role as Nancy, and it is her kind of performance that stereotypes today's horror female leads as poor actors. Her delivery of lines at times is amateurish which makes you struggle to route for her. Really all you want to see when you get into the film is Kruger. Depp is average in his performance, and it is hard to see the Depp of today in his performance here.The film is full of clichés but you can over look these as horror in the eighties was designed like this. To watch it now you would cringe or roll your eyes at the character decisions to venture into the dark due to a noise, but when this was made that was brand new and wasn't as frowned upon. There are some scenes which are bad though and can't use the excuse of when it was made. One scene Nancy manages to set up a house full of booby traps in ten minutes, which includes setting a sledge hammer up above a door. There would not be enough time to set this up and certainly not if she had to find the items to use as well. Also she lives alone with her mother, what use would they have for a sledge hammer. It is parts like that in movies which is really frustrating. Also the ending disappointed me. I know it was supposed to be a twist but it didn't really make sense with the rest of the film. This ending also shows the worst piece of special effects on show.All in all I can see why this is a classic. We are introduced to a new villain, and asked to believe in the notion of dreams being real. To look at it now it isn't as good as it would have been thirty years ago, but it is still better than the poor remake. The poor effects of this film really do add to the suspense of it all. Halloween this is not, but an influential horror film it certainly is. 3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6,2,3,25 April 2012
300," See for the visuals alone!
","Zack Snyder is a director with a lot of potential. This was his second film after the Dawn Of The Dead remake but since this he has moved on to direct Watchmen and Sucker Punch, both with great visual effects that wow audiences, and he is working on the Christopher Nolan produced Superman reboot Man Of Steel as we speak. 300 was his first effort with the comic book visuals. It has been done before with a previous Frank Miller comic book adaptation in Sin City, but here we have it on a different scale entirely. Here we witness epic battles as if they were a moving comic book.300 is about the war at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., which was fought between the Spartans and the Persians. The Persian army has begun to take over Greece and requests that King Leonidas of the Spartan's (Butler) joins in his new empire. Leonidas however realises that this would mean slavery for his women and children and this he can't accept, so he declares war on the Persian Empire which consists of one hundred thousand warriors. Due to Leonidas' disrespect, the King of Persia marches to take Sparta but Leonidas recruits 300 Spartan men, plus 700 Thespian soldiers, and blockades them in a narrow valley which will mean numbers mean nothing. For three days the Spartans hold off the barbaric attacks from the Persians, whilst back in his homeland his wife comes under attack by other Spartans who aim to take over Leonidas' thrown. It is a fairly simple plot as all it really sets up is a lot of battle sequences, and I tell you now this is the plus side about this movie.The film does have a story but it doesn't ever go off on tangents nor have many sub-plots. There is little character development or back story and very minimal realistic dialogue. (Some of the dialogue is good it just sounds very preachy). The film isn't about the lack of key elements I have described above; it is all about the epic battle scenes and the togetherness of the Spartan army that will fight till the death.It does simply consist of battle after battle. The short talky scenes in the middle are a little dull and you only ever want to see the fight scenes, and when they happen you are not disappointed. We see slow motion shots of decapitations, spears landing in chests, blood splattering over the floor in a comic book fashion. It is such a different take on a battle film. The colours are stunning, the reds and yellows really bring a different visual film. It is worth a watch for the visuals alone. You shouldn't be put off by the content of the film. The epic battle films are not my favourite genre, but if you put up with that for the sake of the brilliant visuals of this film you may change your mind.The acting is also top notch. All actors take on their roles brilliantly and I actually believed that they were in fact Spartan warriors and not the actual actor. Butler is lost in the role and we actually see the Spartan he is betraying. That may be because he is hiding being a bushy beard and a rippling six pack though. The only time he becomes recognisable is when he shouts his epic line, 'this is Sparta', which we have all come to know him for since the release of this film. All the other actors are also great in their roles and we also get a very good Michael Fassbender in a side role. Little did he know back then what brilliance awaited him.The film is a good watch. You will be confused and lost by much of it, like when the Persian leader is fully pierced, or at the Quasimodo look a like's cameo, but you will be completely enthralled by the battles. I know little about the history of this moment, but as far as I'm concerned I have seen what I wanted to know. The visuals are breath taking, the direction and acting brilliant, the camera work ace. See it for those reasons and you can forget about the lack of anything else it really has.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",7,1,4,14 March 2012
Back to the Future," Where your going you don't need any other film.
","Back To The Future was a film I grew up on. It is one of those that I always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it recently and couldn't remember most of it. That being said I was right in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing. Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down poor jobs and aren't particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and needs Marty's help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc's latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty's shock and amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting thirty years into the past.Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen. Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose, except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing, and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all will on to win. He is a character we can all relate to and all want to be. Right from the offset we want Marty McFly to succeed. Christopher Lloyd is also great, it is as if the role was specifically designed for him. He plays the crazy scientist with ease and he is a lovable character despite his tendencies to do the wrong thing. Marty's parents (Thompson and Glover) are excellent, Glover maybe more so. They both portray the elder parents and the teenage versions of themselves as if they are the age of the role they are playing. In fact they are the same age as Fox and were cast based around the story in the past and made up for the story in the future. Glover is just brilliant as the bumbling nerd and the hair style just works on Glover and Glover alone. We also get a bully in Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is also so pivotal. The acting for Biff is also top drawer and you really do hate him.The film has everything; humour, action, family fun, love, you name it, it has got it: even the creepy thunder storm and lightning strike. It will please any sort of movie fan whether it be the typical movie buff or the guy who only tunes in every now and again. It is a film not to be missed.My slight negative about it though is the relationship between Doc and Marty within the past. In the present we really believe they are friends but they don't spend too much screen time together in the past and I didn't quite believe that they were going to 'miss' each other like they said they would. I would possibly have liked to have seen a few more minutes of them two together. Maybe that is just me but it is my only negative with the film.I understand that this will probably make little sense. The referencing to past, present and future within this review is confusing. One thing I have thought about though is this: surely if you are watching the film Marty is always in the present? If there is a continuing time line on a constant loop will you ever be in the past or future? Wouldn't you just always be in your present? Just one to think about but do it before or after the film as it is one you just need to kick back with and enjoy.4.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",9,1,1,22 February 2012
