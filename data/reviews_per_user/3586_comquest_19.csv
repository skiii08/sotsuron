The Monuments Men," Monumental Snooze Fest
","I was really looking forward to this film, as it's based on actual events that seemed interesting and appealing. What a disappointment!This flick is so hopelessly slow and boring that we only made it through the first 45 minutes or so. By then, we were all falling asleep ... at 2:00 in the afternoon. Fortunately, we rented the movie for only $1.28 and didn't suffer a major financial loss. It must take exceptional talent to combine such an intriguing story with a killer cast and end up with a total waste of film. The acting is so low key that Clooney and Damon both seem to be hooked on Valium. Plus, if there's a war going on, it's hard to tell. The cast spends most of their time sitting amidst rubble but rarely do you hear gunshots.If you spend more than $1.28 to see this boring mess, then you are being foolish. My advice: skip it all together. The monuments in the nearest cemetery are more fun to watch.",3,0,0,27 May 2014
Skyfall," Don't Believe the Hype
","If Skyfall deserves a best picture nomination, then I am Mickey Rooney.The title sequence, opening action scenes and the final 45 minutes or so are exciting and compelling. But I had to be shaken not stirred just to stay awake during the middle of this slow-moving, boring film.The screenplay is poorly developed and fails to tell the story effectively. Naomie Harris is, in my opinion, the only actor who turned in a stellar performance. Bond (Daniel Craig) and M (Judi Dench) were so deadpan throughout the film that I swear they were overdosing on Valium. There are times when I felt as though I was watching the Walking Dead. It's not a crime to show some emotion every once in a while.Is this the 'new direction' of the 007 franchise? Then count me out. It would be more respectful to bury it altogether and film the memorial service.",3,5,12,31 March 2013
Training Day," Right actor, wrong film
","There's no doubt that Denzel Washington deserves AT LEAST one Oscar for Best Actor.  I've watched him turn in so many Oscar-caliber performances, then go unrewarded.So, now that the Academy finally decides to recognize his acting prowess they pick the wrong film.  Don't get me wrong ... Denzel is great in 'Training Day' ... but he has been better in at least a dozen of his earlier films where he played more complex, meaningful characters.'Training Day' is a routine good cop, bad cop street epic.  Exciting? Sure. Packed with action?  Indeed.  But it didn't deserve mention at the Oscars, let alone any awards.  Movies and TV series like this are a dime a dozen.My guess:  the Academy finally realized they should have recognized Denzel's work years ago and chose this film simply because it was current and eligible.",8,0,11,1 April 2002
Kung Fu Panda," Save The Pandas - But Not This One
","My wife and I watched the Blu-Ray DVD of Kung Fu Panda for 30 minutes but could not take any more of it. This is, without doubt, one of the absolute worst animated features we have ever seen. It's a real snoozer -- not the least bit funny or entertaining.So much top-notch talent was wasted on the weak storyline and pathetically bad dialog! It's hard to believe that this second-rate production came from Dreamworks Animation, the studio that created the fabulous Shrek. The animation is mediocre and seems amateurish in comparison to any Shrek feature or Pixar film of the past decade (Nemo, Cars, Wall-E, Ratatouille, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, etc.).Save your time and money - not this unfunny Panda. Take a nap instead.",1,11,35,22 December 2008
Unbreakable," Disappointing
","Though not a sequel to 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' was written and directed by the successful film's creator, M. Night Shyamalan.  Bruce Willis is the leading man in both movies.Unfortunately, 'Unbreakable' fails to break any new ground.  Instead, it takes the screenplay formula established by 'The Sixth Sense' (deadpan acting by Willis, a series of odd events, dark atmospheres, etc.) and injects a new premise that is even less believable than the 'I see dead people' theme of its predecessor.  The film has a few interesting moments, but is largely derivative, contrived and painfully slow-moving.The unexpected ending intends to shock, but is so far out there that the audience reaction was more of a 'huh?!?' than anything resembling surprise. If you're a Bruce Willis fan, dust off your tape of 'Die Hard' and forget about this one.",3,0,1,15 November 2000
The Mummy," Where's Indiana Jones When We Need Him?
","The computer-generated visuals of thriving ancient Egyptian cities are breathtaking.  The action is non-stop.  The storyline is even pretty good. But Brendan Fraser, the leading man, injects a brand of slapstick humor that gets rather tiresome after a while.  The Mummy would have been a better movie if the hero were 'Indiana Jones' rather than 'George of the Jungle', and if it were, perhaps, a bit less campy.  The exceptional visuals make it worth the price, however.",5,0,0,27 November 1999
The Others," Very few 'scares'
","'The Others' fails to live up to the studio hype.  Despite an interesting premise, the film is slow-moving and often boring. The few 'scary' scenes are somewhat creepy but never genuinely frightening. Overall, it's extremely tame for this genre.The actors, including Nicole Kidman, offer satisfactory performances but none really stand out as being memorable. Even the 'unexpected' ending didn't work for me.  I figured it out about 30 minutes before it was disclosed on the screen.  I cannot recommend this film, as there are hundreds of horror flicks out there that deliver far bigger scares for the buck.  This one simply creeped me out.",5,1,2,21 May 2002
Cast Away," Overblown
","Cast Away doesn't even begin to live up to the hype that surrounded its theatrical release.  It's not a bad movie, but this updated version of 'Robinson Crusoe' would warrant little attention without a box office megastar like Tom Hanks.  Rating: 6 stars/10.",6,0,1,26 June 2001
Little Miss Sunshine," Where's the Beef?
","I watched Little Miss Sunshine because of the buzz generated by the Golden Globes and Oscars. I expected to see a movie that was beyond the normal comedy. It's not.I enjoyed the movie. It's truly funny - at times hysterically funny. The cast is great. But Oscar material? I don't think so. It's very similar to previous dysfunctional family tales, like National Lampoon's 'Vacation' series, that would never be considered for Best Picture honors.The film is very entertaining, but simply doesn't live up to the over-the-top hype.",7,0,1,4 February 2007
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Everything but Heart
","From the very beginning, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' seemed to be missing something. Despite an all-too-brief appearance by Frodo and the return of several 'Lord of the Rings' characters (Bilbo, Gandalf, and others), the story never became very compelling.Sure, there were some nail-biting scenes, cool special effects and creatures galore but did you really care who won or lost? I didn't. I never felt the attachment to the characters in this film that I felt throughout the LOTR trilogy. I was never 'on the edge of my seat' like I was so often during LOTR.Perhaps 13 dwarfs were just too many to get your head around. Snow White pushed the envelope with Seven Dwarfs, but at least most people could remember seven names. Not so here. How many dwarfs can you remember by name? And don't get me started on creepy creatures! There were just too many of them and they got way too much screen time -- even Gollum. I got the feeling they were deliberately stretching scenes so the movie would play for nearly three hours.It's not a terrible movie, but it lacks the heart and passion that made Lord of the Rings such a masterpiece.",5,10,16,24 June 2013
Moulin Rouge!," A Circus of Weirdos
","'Moulin Rouge!' is, without doubt, one of the ten worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  It's loud, annoying and senseless with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Though it's billed as a 'musical', most of the music is drowned out by sheer noise.  And the musical directors cast historical accuracy to the wind as we hear contemporary songs including 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' performing in Paris of the 1890s(?)!  What schlock!As much as I usually love Nicole Kidman, even she could not salvage this awful movie for me.  A Golden Globe ... !?!  C'mon.  Nicole should have won a Globe and an Oscar for her performance in 'Dead Calm', but certainly not for this unadulterated mess.  The acting ... by everyone on-screen ... is so irritatingly hammy that it cries out for brown sugar sauce. Yuk!What were they thinking!?!",1,24,44,3 February 2002
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Cloudy with a Chance of Meat ... heads?
","This animated film is as dumb as they come. I have to wonder why the Meatheads wasted so much time and money creating pretty decent visuals for a story that is just plain silly and lame.The plot is so one-dimensional that it could be told in five minutes rather than 90. The laughs turn to snores after 15 minutes of non-stop silliness.Skip it! There are two many intelligent animated features out there to waste your time watching schlock like this. I'll give it a 4 only because the production values and animation were good. For the story, though, 1 or 2 would be exceedingly generous.",4,14,33,10 January 2010
Lincoln," Disappointing
","I so looked forward to seeing this film, as I am a great admirer of Abraham Lincoln and all that he achieved against staggering odds.First of all, let me say that Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful as Lincoln. His performance is really the glue that holds the movie together. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones were also outstanding in their roles.My disappointment is with the script. This was an amazing story waiting to be told, but the screenplay does a very poor job of telling it. There is so little character development that important characters -- and even some leads -- are often not identified at all, and even if they are, you are told little about their role in things.Parts of the film become really boring with excessive banter that seems to have little relevance. This film could have been so much more than it is with some good, old-fashioned story telling.",4,1,4,15 April 2013
Inception," Slow, Boring, Silly, Too Long and Completely Pointless
","After several weeks of hearing praise about Inception from friends, critics, and glowing reviews on IMDb, I finally gave in and took my wife to see it this weekend. I really wanted to love this movie as I am a huge fan of most Sci-Fi and Ellen Page. My wife usually loves Leonardo and Ellen.We could not have been more disappointed with this train wreck of a movie. We were both bored and ready to leave the theater after the first 45 minutes but stuck it out till the end hoping for something good that never came. We agreed that it was one of the WORST films we have ever seen in our lifetimes.Yes - we did GET the gist of the convoluted plot, but the dialog and visuals were at times laughable and silly as Christopher Nolan force-fed the audience with course after course of nonsensical explanations of how dreams work, their layers, and the non-specific techniques the poorly defined characters would use for 'extraction' and their 'inception' caper.I felt zero attachment to any of the characters in the story and didn't much care about their fate. If you've seen the trailer you've seen ALL of the cool special effects nearly in their entirety. The much-ballyhooed scenes that involve floating people were just ripped-off variations of similar scenes from The Matrix series.The only explanation I have for the popularity of Inception is my theory that more than 70% of theater audiences fell asleep during the first 10 minutes and dreamed that they saw a good film.If you want to experience excitement in dreams, just lay down and take a nap. Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this boring mess.",3,11,20,9 August 2010
Arrival," The Best Part of Arrival Is Its Departure
","After seeing the trailer and so many glowing reviews, I was really looking forward to 'Arrival'. Everything pointed to one of the best sci-fi movies in recent history, but the film failed to deliver on nearly every count. It's a snooze fest. What a disappointment!Amy Adams did turn in an excellent performance as Dr. Louise Banks. She is really the only reason to ever watch this film. It's slow, boring and devoid of anything that borders on entertainment. I've seen it compared to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' but that was a compelling story with stellar production values. 'Arrival' is neither. I've seen sci-fi movies from the 1950s with more convincing visuals.The story is as muddled as the visual effects:<ul><li>The alien vessels look like giant grains of black rice. </li></ul><ul><li>The creatures are basically large squid floating in dense fog. </li></ul><ul><li>They bring us a 'universal language' that they demonstrate by squirting ink on a window pane and refer to as a 'weapon' (apparently there is no word for 'language' in their universal language.) </li></ul><ul><li>Jeremy Renner as Ian Donnelly, the supposed physicist, didn't seem to know anything about physics. He did nothing but follow Louise around. </li></ul><ul><li>Most of the story line involves Dr. Banks and Ian going back and forth to the big black rice ship trying to communicate with the foggy squid. Their painfully slow progress is as exciting as watching a snail derby.</li></ul>The ending is laughable. As I filed out of the theater, I turned to my wife and said, 'I'm totally confused'. She laughed and said, 'I was about to say the same thing.'We overheard other people near us expressing similar reactions. One man said, 'I didn't get it, did you?' and another said, 'What did we just see?!?' By midway through 'Arrival' I was praying for its rapid departure.",3,5,14,21 November 2016
Signs," My Favorite Sign of All
","Last night I attended a screening of 'Signs', the latest motion picture written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan ('The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable').  I looked forward to seeing it!  The trailer, already airing on TV, portrayed the movie to be a very exciting sci-fi thriller.Mel Gibson stars as Graham Hess, a former reverend whose wife was killed in a grisly car accident six months earlier.  After that, he quit the ministry and abandoned all belief in the existence of a higher being.  The supporting cast includes Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin and Cherry Jones.  All turn in good performances.The movie opens with the discovery of giant crop circles in Hess' corn field.  Who made them?  Do they have some profound meaning, or is it just a prank?  Without exposing the plot, I will tell you that the crop circles are just one of many 'signs' that lead the characters toward the conclusion.Some early scenes have a good sense of humor, taking full advantage of Gibson's wry wit.  The funniest involves Phoenix, Culkin and Breslin in silly tin-foil hats.  But the film is frequently as dull as its dark lighting and subdued atmosphere.**** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****At one point, the screen goes totally black -- for what seems like an eternity -- while noises are heard.  Then, a face is illuminated (chin up) by a flashlight beam.  For a split-second, I thought I had stumbled into a rerun of 'Blair Witch' by mistake.  But no, this was just one of several scenes that mimicked other films a bit too closely.  I spotted near-perfect renditions of scenes from 'War of the Worlds', 'Field of Dreams', 'Children of the Corn' and others.The scariest moments are the classic 'bump-in-the-night' variety.  Special effects are nearly absent unless you count the alien, who looks like a tall man dressed in two-dollar spandex tights from a Halloween close-out sale.Yet, the film is spellbinding because you constantly feel as though something really extraordinary is about to happen.  Unfortunately, the anticipation is never rewarded and the story ends suddenly with a disappointing and unsatisfying conclusion.  (As the credits began to roll, I stared at the screen in disbelief.)'Signs' is really not the movie portrayed in the trailer.  The sci-fi story you came to see -- dealing with extraterrestrials and crop circles -- is merely a subplot to the internal, spiritual strife suffered by Hess (Gibson).  Sci-fi is simply a colorful wrapper used to conceal the movie's true focus:  a ponderous message about human spirituality.That brings me to my favorite 'sign' of all.  It was bright. It was red. It had four letters.  They read: 'E-X-I-T'.  So I did.As I filed out of the theater, I overheard several conversations expressing the same sense of disappointment that I was feeling.  A teenage girl, talking to her girlfriend, said it best:  'Well, I never want to see that again!'Ditto.",4,1,1,11 July 2002
The Sixth Sense," Sloooow moving
","The underlying story behind The Sixth Sense is intriguing, but the movie fails to exploit it effectively.  The screenplay drags and drags.  My advice:  arrive about an hour or so late and you'll see every scene that has anything to offer.  It could have been a 10.  But it's more like a 4.5. Too bad!",6,0,0,14 July 1999
Slumdog Millionaire," So Overblown
","After all of the hype and awards for Slumdog Millionaire, I expected more. The film is really quite average in every way. It has three things going for it: 1) Freida Pinto is drop-dead gorgeous, 2) the ending 'music video' at the train station is fun and invigorating, and 3) Freida Pinto is drop-dead gorgeous. That's about it.From beginning to end, the story zig-zags around like a snake in a traffic jam. Sensible dialog is lacking much of the time, character development seems like an afterthought, and the film is often ploddingly slow and boring.The plight of the poor in Mumbai is a topic worth exploring, but Slumdog does a poor job of it. There is little depth to the storyline, aside from the outhouse scene. I have to admit -- that looked pretty deep to me!",5,11,15,7 June 2009
High Fidelity," Prime John Cusack fare.
","As one might expect, this is NOT your garden variety romantic comedy. It's quirky, often a bit odd, but fairly engrossing throughout.  John Cusack offers a fine performance as vinyl record store owner Rob Gordon, and overall the acting is very good.Jack Black and Todd Louiso are standouts as Rob's over-the-edge employees, and Iben Hjejle (how do you pronounce that?!?) is genuine and attractive as the primo love interest (Laura).This is the kind of 'little' movie that can be endearing to some.  It won't exactly rock your world, and will probably do only modestly at the box office.",7,0,0,15 March 2000
