The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Very Slow
","This movie was very slow and draw out...not as good as the others. It took forever to explain what they were doing and to get to anything of excitement/the action in this movie.If this movie had been the 1st hunger games, the entire series would be in trouble. With the success of the previous movies, maybe this one had just too much to live up to & that didn't happen.Nothing about this movie will leave you talking or craving the next one. Katniss made her name from her survival skills, the movie made us yearn more because of the action and neither of these surfaced for the 1st hour or 2 of this movie.Slow and Disappointing. Their plan of setting up a plot for future movies was fine, however they didn't have to make this one so boring to do so.",4,18,25,21 December 2014
