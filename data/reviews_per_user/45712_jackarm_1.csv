Blade Runner 2049," Story line good
","We liked the story line, even had some quirks that seem like something Philip K. Dick would have used... The soundtrack is horrible - too loud and self-important, with some dramatically loud occurrences that seem irrelevant to the story and the point in the story. As we left I felt that I had been audibly assualted! Previous reviewer - you should watch the original! It holds better and then you may understand some of this movie. Agree that there are parts that are pointless and over-long. The movie could be 2 hours and be a better movie.",Null,3,7,9 October 2017
