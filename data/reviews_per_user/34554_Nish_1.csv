Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ignore the critics, its a good night out
","The critics have been quick to pan this film and the media has tried to spoil it with all the extra hype. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story and the acting was nowhere near as bad as critics would have us believe, in fact some is excellent, Liam Neeson is superb as Qui Gonn Jinn, Ewan MacGregor is not far behind and really worked hard on his voice and mannerisms to be a convincing Obi-Wan and is plausible as a young Alec Guinness. The film is of course ultimately the greatest special effects showcase ever to be seen on screen, you will be astonished be the amount of CGI and constantly be thinking 'how did they do that?' George Lucas could not have done better. Go see it (before someone who already has ruins it for you!)",8,0,0,24 July 1999
