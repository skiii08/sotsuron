10 Cloverfield Lane," Shocking Conclusion
","The story is intriguing from the very beginning of the movie. What I liked the most in general is that you have no clue what will happen next. I quickly noticed a resemblance with the story of series Wayward Pines. The accident, life saved by a stranger, suspicious intentions, incomprehensible circumstances... You just put yourself in the same position and it does not feel comfortable. It is hard to trust anyone and you feel curious about the life outside the borders. How could we ever know what is it like to lose everything we had and to be forced to forget about everything we know about our world in only a matter of hours? I must confess that I am a bit disappointed with the ending, probably because I am not really into Mystery and Sci-Fi. Anyways, it didn't ruin the whole story, it just made it a lot more interesting to think about and surely a lot more shocking.",7,0,1,30 November 2016
City of God," An Inspiration
","What I taught from this movie is that you need to believe in yourself and your success whatever the circumstances are. You may be surrounded by criminals and killers in a village where few got out, you may be called a loser and weak but as soon as you know it, you are an overall winner because you followed your dreams and actually made something of your life. Karma is unforgiving for the bad but it rewards the good in any which way. It's something everybody underestimates. As a European, I find it completely incomprehensible that people live this way. I judged them the complete movie and it's really hard to watch all of those lives get wasted for actually nothing but I guess it's something me and my culture (in general) can't realize. I found a connection with Rocket. He was a guy which was aside most of the time, has some friends but no enemies. I believe many innocent people like him get killed in favelas, which is frustrating, but surely you have much more chance in succeeding than gangsters and drug dealers. Anyway, an inspiring story, it was easy to watch as well even though a lot of people were involved in it.",8,2,4,22 June 2015
Room," Perception
","To start up, I honestly haven't seen such a good movie as this one for a longer time. It is so emotional and heartbreaking watching those two, firstly in Room, then in the real world as well. I found interesting realizing the oscillations in getting used to the whole massive change between a grownup and a child. Freedom is relative, this movie proves it. So is space and boundaries. If you don't know what's on the other side of the wall and don't even know the other side even exists, you feel safe. You don't doubt your freedom at all. Jack felt like everything is happening with a reason, just the way it should be. His imagination made him believe that. It was also quite interesting watching how Jack's thoughts broadened up as time was passing by. I was surprised how well he adapted to new surroundings, unlike his poor mother. She was questioning herself a lot, every single day, got really overwhelmed and I saw her crash coming a few times throughout the movie. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her considering how strong and resilient she stayed.",10,0,2,11 March 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Sad True
","First I'd like to say how unbelievable it is finding out the concept of mental facilities. No matter this movie was filmed over 40 years ago, I still think it's mostly applicable to methods that are being used in modern age as well. I suggest it's much easier to give a patient 'a happy pill' to do all the work. I find it very disturbing, especially a part where they put electricity through your brain. Like that can do any good for a patient. In my opinion, those people weren't patients at all when they first arrived. I think it's applicable to present situation when people are sent to these madhouses. They arrive mostly like Mac did. I definitely wouldn't call him crazy. Those people just need someone to talk with, someone who can understand their feelings and help them solve any sorts of problems in a healthy way. But it's much easier to make a plant out of a human and announce he is insane, isn't it? I felt throughout the whole movie like they didn't even want their patients to recover from their, so called, madness. You convince yourself in that kind of environment that you actually are crazy, especially when you follow their rules and schedules. The littlest confrontations and changes of rules shock the whole system. That's exactly what Mac has done. Anyway, I didn't even feel like I was watching a 40-year-old movie because of its timeless thematic. Well, I only realized it because Jack Nicholson is not so young anymore.",9,2,4,12 October 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Simply a masterpiece
","This is surely in top 10 of the movies I've watched. I find almost unbelievable how people can put themselves together in jail and be even more productive than outside the jail, opposite of the expectations. This topic is really interesting, when people are left with nothing but communication with each other and it makes them stronger and give them hope to live the next day. Hope is good, as Andy would say... Filled with phrases to remember, it strongly contributes to the quality and impression of the movie. Robbins and Freeman fantastic, as always. I'm not surprised this is on top of IMDb ranking list, it's a masterpiece. I wouldn't feel sorry watching it several times, it's totally worth it.",10,0,1,18 June 2015
The Martian," Another Sci-Fi Perception
","As a person who is not really a Sci-Fi fan, I must say I'm highly impressed with this movie. It actually gave me another perception, rather than dealing with Space objects, forces, etc. which has been seen many times in 'Space movies'. The introduction of stationary survival mode, which is ensuring food and water supply (roughly) makes you think in whole new direction. How to fight with literally nothing around you? How to get yourself quickly back on feet and pull yourself together? Sounds a bit tough, doesn't it? To sum up, just like Interstellar, this is incomparable with other Sci- Fi movies. Completely unpredictable outcome, a lot of ups and downs, twists and turns, makes your heart beat a bit faster than usual. So for me, it's a 9, almost a 10, because I still think some parts wouldn't be so possible or luckily completed, but I guess it's just my pessimism (or ignorance) speaking!",9,1,4,18 December 2015
