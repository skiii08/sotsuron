Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Lack of proper research?
","I would guess that Sherlock is one of the characters that would interest the more intelligent film enthusiast. I also have seen the much more intelligent written series from the BBC(of which I am awaiting the next season), and they clearly mist it by a big one with this poor excuse of a Sherlock Holmes. Aside to this, I think it's quite annoying to see a film that has not done it's research properly. For instance: The time in what this movie plays is around 1891, the luger pistol that they use wasn't invented until 1897. Germany wasn't really there yet as we see them talking about the whole time. The side that was near the border with France was Prussia. There is a moment they talk about coloured contact lenses, These did exist but covered your complete eye. Not very hard to detect I guess.And how the hell can they shoot with artillery on them, when there is no one giving the coordinates? Come on Guy Richie, We all know you can make a much better film then this. This was an insult to intelligent people clearly! Please watch the BBC series before you shoot another one lad!",4,16,30,28 April 2012
