Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Big Disappointment
","I must say that I expected much more than fluff and flash.  The dialog was strained and lacking, the characters were uninspiring, and the special effects overpowering.  Mr. Lucas should be ashamed for putting out such trash.",2,0,1,4 June 1999
