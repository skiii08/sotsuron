Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," crap
","this is the crappiest movie i have ever seen i didn't laugh once it was also really discriminating to everyone especially, Jews, women and black people. i can't believe he was aloud to do this... it warn't even funny, the only people who would find it funny would be people who laugh at anything....this movie should not have been made... i Can't believe a wasted my money on this crap i also can't believe people in the cinema were laughing at it, shows how much respect they have for people's race, culture and religion... this movie should be banned... and it was rated a 15...he is such a bad example for people and now people are gonna start copying him.",1,16,36,5 November 2006
