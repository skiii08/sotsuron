Alien 3," best of 3
","I think that the story was crafted best of the three alien films. The vacant prison premise sets the stage for a very dark and creepy atmosphere. The drama slowly builds the tension up to the inevitable climax when The rescue arrives and Ripley makes her sacrifice. The conflict between the new found religion and the heinous background of the inmates add to the irony of Riply's situation. Good acting all around and Believable sets, costumes and make up support the storyline. A great film!",Null,1,3,19 August 2004
