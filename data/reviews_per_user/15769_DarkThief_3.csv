The Blair Witch Project," Over-rated
","After hearing all the hype I was expecting a chilling movie along the lines of classics like Salem's Lot or Halloween. But I was disappointed. I don't think I really felt anything other than a headache from all the camera shaking and bleached  footage.Still... I liked the story, and the acting was very good in places, and the ending did send a slight shiver down my spine, but I seemed to be the only one out of 4 that went with me who saw the link between it and the start of the movie!Yet another film this year (like The Phantom Menace) that didn't quite live up to its hype I feel.",Null,0,0,6 November 1999
X-Men," Best Comic Adaptation Since Tim Burton's Batman...
","... and definitely the most difficult to pull off. I read the comics for about 4 years and watched the cartoons religiously, but was always apprehensive of anyone trying to pull off a movie. But oh boy did it work!The characterisations in the most part were practically spot on, but it was obvious from the beginning that Wolverine was the star. He couldn't have done a better job. Right down to the scene when he walks through the metal detector <chortle>.Overall, the movie was sufficiently dark and stylish with some top special effects (but thankfully relying more on the characters to carry the story). The humour was just right too.Recommended for anyone, fan or not, and any age at that. This slots in right behind Gladiator for me in this years best movie releases. Roll on the sequels!!",9,0,0,19 August 2000
Pearl Harbor," ::sigh::
","Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay make entertaining low-on-story blockbusters... so why the hell did they try to tackle this? The trailer makes it look like a summer blockbuster of entertainment but all you feel after the grueling 3 hours is a sore backside and a stiff neck... and the sinking feeling half the film should have been left on some dusty cutting room floor.That aside though, there were a few good things... Michael Bay's eye for a good scene kept things moving for me, although the the raid on Pearl Harbour itself was more lifeless than the one shown in the trailer due to the complete lack of musical scoring. Hans Zimmer what the hell were you up to?As for the actors... well i never did like Alec Baldwin. Affleck reprised his role from Armageddon minus anything that vaguely made that character human. Hartnett and Beckinsale were alright. Cuba rocked. Jon Voight... star of the film.Overall: Disappointing, not very entertaining, too long although not a *bad* way to spend 3 hours, and definitely not moving. Not even my girlfriend cried and she's a soppy muppet <grin>.",6,0,0,2 June 2001
