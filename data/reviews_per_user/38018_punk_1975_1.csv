The Devil's Advocate," Clever and Smart Movie
","Astonishing! As I have seen the movie, it just opened my mind to the fact that only you and yourself alone can play the part on w/c you partake the temptation of life and just can't blame anyone including people around you ,nor your conscience and let me say, the devil himself w/c the people all over the world believes influenced them on every evil deeds that he sown in their minds, and other say it's instinct.A great role portrayed by Al Pacino(the devil)who reveals his true character at the near end of the movie thus explaining the reality that co-exist between man and God to his supposed tormented offspring which played by no other than Keanu Reeves.
