Hereditary," Crazy Ass Movie
","Truly a Scary movie, not like anything I've seen before. it does start off a bit slow but around the 30 or 40 minute mark it makes up for all that build up. It's an incline from there.... listen to me! if you like scary movies you have to watch this film. I don't do IMDB Reviews but this movie was so good I had too... It will have you talking about it afterwards!",9,16,29,22 June 2018
