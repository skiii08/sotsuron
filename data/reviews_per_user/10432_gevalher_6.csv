Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thinking to use The Force to sell toys?
","The film is so-so. it takes a lot of scenes from the other movies of the saga (IV, V and VI), and from other movies chariots race scenes in 'Ben Hur'. In the end I think the result is  good, but I'm always wondering if it could been a little more consistent. The only plot interesting I can see is the plans and moves from a man who plays with the lives of thousands (humans or not) in search of absolute power. This is a film full of FX's in all splendor, but is sad that they don't make any advance to improve the storytelling, as other people comments I must say that many sequences of this movie are aimed to make video games and action figures. Other movie makers aim at this target and learned (I hope), that if you don't care the plot of the film in the first place you will have a LET DOWN, and then you can kiss goodbye to the revenues of the film-marketing. But we have another 2 films in the horizon, I hope things go up. The entertaining sequences to me were the battle of the Jedis, and the battle of Jar Jar Binks and his people against the droids.*********",Null,0,1,20 June 1999
The Mummy," An entertaining film, but not a outstanding one
","Well, I liked the film.It has a lot of actions scenes, the FX's were very good, and there is a plot, simple, but a plot in the end. Many of the things that I saw in 'The Mummy' I've seen on other films --Indiana Jones trilogy comes to my mind--. The film is packed with action but almost all of the FX's I wanted to see, I've already seen on the trailer of this movie, so I feel cheated a little. The villain of the movie, was very scary at the beginning but while he was gaining organs and flesh from other humans he was getting less scary. I liked the final battle of Brendan Fraser against the troops of the Mummy, it made me remember that old classic movie 'Jason & The Argonauts'. I liked the two scenes with the cat too. The dialogues when the characters are not in an action scene lacked of a sense of realism, and those were the boring sections of th film. I think Brendan is developing into a more mature actor, and hoping to see more about him in the future.All in all not a film for all people, those who watch a film to get answers about life, surely will hate this film, but if you like no more than be entertained for a while then you can",Null,0,0,24 July 1999
Scary Movie 2," What a waste of time & money!
","Well, the first movie was OK at least due to the 'originality'.But the second only reinforced the failures of the first film.The moments I got a laugh were so few that I can count them withthe fingers of one hand.The parodies of some movies were great. but they were spoiledfor so many gross jokes about sex and bodily functions, that theWayans ruined the intended effect.I don't know, but the people who likes this bad film, must bepeople either very young or very inexperienced moviegoers,because I can tell you, with my 38 years of moviegoing, that thisopus from the Wayans Bros., is a total waste of time & money.",Null,11,24,6 January 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Simply brilliant!
","Again  as in many times before, I was counting the hours to seea new (and in this case, the last) film of Kubrick, with thebonus of Cruise and Kidman.As always Kubrick manages to tell us a story about love and sex,but overall about the real forces that drives to us, the humanbeings.Alice (Kidman) in an unforgettable sequence tells his husbandabout her really feelings about him, marriage and sex. Afterthat Bill (Cruise) begins a journey to discover his ownfeelings, motivations and needs about, sex, his life, and hismarriage. That journey drives him for some risky paths, but inthe end you can only bet if he really achieves full understanding of it or not.As other Kubrick films this lets the viewer thinking about whathas been shown on the screen. I highly recommend to people towatch this film.",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
The Matrix," Good ideas... but drowned with amazing FX's
","As the film begins to unfold, one was awaiting how this film will develop, next the main character ('Neo'), is slow at first, and fast later, immersed into a total change of his reality and besides all of these, being credited as the 'savior' of the human race.This flick brings to us some interesting ideas about how 'real' is our reality, but slowly this line of storytelling is dropped to favor the show of the FX's (outstanding, but more of the time submerging the story line than reinforcing it).The supporting characters were all dull and plain, and the bad guys never looks really menacing or chilling. But after all you can enjoy with 'Neo' becoming the savior that he told he was.Hardly this movie can top 'Blade Runner', film that many reviewers compares with. But in the end I liked this movie for the FX's and the original ideas. It's a sorrow that they were interfering between them, instead of collaborating to do a flick that may have been a really cool one.Very nice nods to 'The Wizard of Oz' (Say bye to Kansas, Dorothy...) & 'Alice in Wonderland' (Follow the white rabbit...) that leased some thoughts and ideas to this film.A very nice try for the Wachowski brothers, I'll be looking for another film of them, because I really hope they'll find a way to improve their storytelling...",Null,0,0,11 August 1999
Tarzan," A very pleasant surprise.
","Tarzan was a familiar character for me, just like an old friend. I grew up reading about his adventures in comic books and comic strips, hearing his characteristic yell on the radio, and watching his adventures on the big screen (The best Johnny Weismuller).I was reticent to see this film, because I'm not so sure about how the Disney factory would treat this classic character. But seeing the trailer in the cinemas and on TV I've decided to give it a chance. I'm glad that I did.This is the story of a boy left alone in the jungle, and raised by gorillas. The story of a boy who feels that don't fit to his 'family'. A boy raised with the love of his foster gorilla mother, and rejected by his foster 'father'. Then one day, he discover people of his kind, and he must confront his doubts about where he belongs. You need to see the film to get the answers.The animation as all of the latest works from Disney, are astounding, the backgrounds are so well done that they are the another character in the film. The relation between Tarzan and his foster dad, were always tense. On the contrary the relation between he and Jane are completely delicious (this was one of my worries about the movie). The two principal human characters were well depicted, but the others doesn't get the same treat, they look more cartoonish.The dynamic of the movements of Tarzan were dazzling, but sometimes a little unreal, (but hey, remember this is an animated movie after all). To get this a little short, this was a film with very touching moments, a lot of fun, some cameos from other animated Disney movies,and the songs of Phil Collins were great too. (I saw the spanish dubbed version, but Phil sang in Spanish!, and I know that he voiced his songs in other languages too! Wonderful!) A great movie for all the people who like films -animated or not-",Null,1,1,30 June 1999
