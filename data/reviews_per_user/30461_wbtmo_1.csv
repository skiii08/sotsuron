The Blair Witch Project," My favorite horror(sp?) movie
","I've watched so many horror movies in the past.. but not many movies gave me genuine scare. However this film, especially that ending scene, gave me genuine creeps. The more I think about it, the more disturbed I am. Well how can I say.. all the movement abruptly comes to a holt at the end... well done!!",10,1,3,12 January 2000
