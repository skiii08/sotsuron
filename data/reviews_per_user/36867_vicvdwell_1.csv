Hereditary," Paranormal Activity/Insidious without the scares
","The story adds nothing to themes that were already explored in recent horror films such as PA/Insidious (spirits of the deceased, possession, yada yada). The first hour is incredibly slow and it feels like 80% of the plot development takes place in the last 30-45 minutes. The thing that made PA/Insidious and similar films entertaining for me were the suspense and the scares, which are few and far in between in this film, and they're not as scary. The acting was pretty good but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even to friends who love the genre. Frankly I was really surprised this movie is rated at 7.9.",5,3,6,17 June 2018
