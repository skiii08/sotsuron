Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just upsetting
","I think upsetting is less than awful. If I could give less than 1, I would. I went to the theater to watch this movie back in '99. So many people I have/had respect for said the movie was atrocosious, but I didn't believe anyone could do harm to the franchise. I believed the haters went in expecting to be blown away and because they didn't leave the theater with that euphoric feeling they had after episodes 4,5 and 6 a void was created and then was filled with anger. Because of this furious uproar I received from my associates, I innocently bought my ticket with low expectations. I definitely should've left feeling I got the upperhand on the matin√©e fee I paid.My low expectations weren't even close to met . Menace was the first and only movie I have ever walked out. Everything was upsetting. Character development was terrible. The revelation about Midi-chlorian was mind numbing. Obviously, Jar Jar was more corrosive than alien blood. Young Anakin, well, I blame the writing for his destructiveness. The parts of the movie that should've portrayed the ominous of the dark side looked like a cheese pizza with extra cheese hold the crust and sauce.I went into this movie thinking that if it was actually bad, then those whom produced it tried to make it bad. A theory that can never be proved but probably should be delved deeply into.",1,1,6,8 May 2016
Fight Club," How is it top 100?
","You have Norton, a guy who was born to be in intense movies and you have Pitt, this guy taught himself to act over the years, so the ability for a great movie is there, I will not argue that.When I found out they were the same person I had to really hunker in to try and let myself appreciate the movie. It was not easy.I know that if one is a movie watcher one should let go of the realistic. I get this lecture all the time when I say something from a movie is just not believable. 'It's a movie, it's not real.' But, for me when something in a movie doesn't make sense, it can be just as bad as a cell phone going off in the theater. I can't just let it go.Here is what bugs the dooty out of me. You have to realize that the group of people - other than Pitt and Norton - had to watch some guy punching himself in the face, and say to themselves, 'Hey, I want to be a part of that. I want to hang out with that guy.' It lost me.",5,0,1,9 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Episode 2 currently at 6.7?
","I feel I'm out of touch. This movie should be at most a 5.I went into this movie with the lowest of expectations, given to me by episode 1, and this movie was able to meet all of them. There is no reason to give a play by play of what's wrong, once you get passed the pain it's all down hill from there.Here is my spoiler alert: Oh you just killed off a whole village? Great, lets get married.The only way the editors could've saved this film is by running the closing credits right after the opening credits and junked everything else. The one time I felt a subtle glimpse of glee was while reading 'directed by George Lucas',I knew the agony was over.If movies were made to consume the sense of smell, this would've been a fart; and not the good kind.",1,3,7,9 May 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," eh
","Close to the beginning of the movie Pitt's character drives his car from the house of Dicaprio's character. We see Pitt drive home for what had to be a minute. From that point on I was wondering what QT was doing. Then the end, which everyone seems to think was awesome, was, I thought, fairly lame. Is rewriting history really that great? Especially after he has done it in the past?",5,7,15,31 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It was OK
","Everyone whom disliked the movie already described my feelings about it. Except, I will disagree with those that say they loved the first 45 minutes and disliked the rest. I thought the first part was too fast and development was lacking. I thought the second half had some jokes that hit their marks and even the realization of the force in our protagonist was at least interesting.But, gone are the days of what I see as quiet revelation. I think back to A New Hope and miss that simple scene in the Falcon, where we see C3PO playing some version of chess against Chewbacca; and Luke learning how to blindly defend himself with a light saber. Without action, the scene quietly fascinates the viewers, while teaching us that wookies have bad tempers and fill our imagination with the mystery of the force. That is gone. Been gone since episode 1.",5,10,13,8 May 2016
