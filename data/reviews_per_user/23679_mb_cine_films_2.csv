The Monuments Men," Superficial and predictable
","I went to a pre-release fund raiser screening not knowing anything about this film or it's topic. I was disappointed to say least of the superficial, uneven nature of how such a historically important topic (which I don't believe a lot of people actually know about), which I don't believe has been documented on film prior to this, was handled. There was a lack of depth in the narrative as we were taken in a particular direction only to have that suddenly interrupted to be taken off in another and not returning to original in a lot of cases. Most frustrating for viewers like myself, keen to know more about this topic. The tongue in cheek humour was the deal breaker for me - it was as if trying to appeal to the masses and win them over and like the film further taking us away from any depth or exploration of this dark time in history and and depth of the topic. It seemed like a pointed insult to the real life people working under such perilous circumstances, but you wouldn't have known that only for the fact the WWII and Nazi's were mentioned. Film can be a powerful medium in reminding the world of the true horrors of war, in particular the kind inflicted by the Nazi's. I think it's important to do this. This film has a great ensemble of actors but simply misses on a lot of levels in doing the above and it's silly humour only makes it a trite futile exercise. Simply indulgent - a gluttonous waste of talent and time.",1,5,7,16 April 2014
