Ford v Ferrari," Great mix of action and character driven story - time well spent for race fans and movie buffs alike
","It's hard to compare Rush (racer biography by Ron Howard) I suppose Rush race scenes were more intense, but the 2 leads didn't have chemistry like Bale and Damon in this one. Their friendship, colleagues and families really helped carry the story for 2.5 hours.The story is relevant in both auto race and corporate history. The director did a great job bringing the audience to this specialized industry with effective narratives so we could all enjoy the ride without feeling lost.There were so much to digest in the dialogues and so many good action scenes to admire that I would recommend watching it again! p.s. try covering your ears in the theatre, because I overheard spoilers in the hallway (*__*) not cool~! Another occasion, I had to put on my headphone on the train to avoid hearing spoilers.",9,1,3,19 November 2019
Train to Busan," A surprisingly touching horror film loaded with gripping suspense and intense action scenes
","Some of my favourites are 28 Days Later, Zombieland, and A Girl with all the gifts: I prefer memorable characters, action scenes, dialogues, introspection about humanity, suspense, and dark humour over gory jump scares.This movie, albeit predictable plot lines and character stereotypes, the actors and pace engage the viewer to root for their (good & ill) fates. Characters' actions mostly remained convincing: their behaviour is driven by consistent, reasonable motive, and some characters transformed through meaningful incidents naturally, not in a sudden to fit the ending. Each survivor is well acted.Camera work was effective in portraying a sense of dread and chaos, while keeping focus on the main characters and plots moving along the train corridors. At 2 hours in length, there wasn't much dragging scenes at all. I just skipped the character intro (10 minutes), and from then on, the story runs along. How realistic is the ending depends on the viewer: are you an optomist or a pessimist? Either way, it's 2 hours well spent.The 15 minute behind the scenes bonus feature actors and production crew rehearsing, teasing each other, including bloopers, quite a strange shift in mood :)",8,2,4,31 August 2018
Us," Interesting suspensful premise, good job from all cast, not 'scary', more of an intense thriller sprinkled with some dark comedy moments
","As a big fan of horror-thriller genrre of all sorts (1970s-current: Omen, Let the Rigth One In, Descent, Devil's Backbone, 28 Days Later, etc.), Us feels more like an intense thriller rather than a bone chilling psychological horror. Or, maybe it's because the older I get and more movies I've seen, it's hard to feel surprised or panicked by a movie anymore.Get Out started out slow, and built up to frigthening scenes of survival.Us also had a slow start (first 1/2 hr is more of an introduction to characters). The middle part is full of frightening chase-fight scenes, sprinkled with witty dark humour and the cast carried the story well with convincing chemistry. The last 1/2 hour was a bit heady / psychological thriller + social critique.I'm happy that in the recent decade, more quality scripts, directors and actors are joining the horror/ psychological thriller genre, especially original stories instead of sequels and reboots.As a movie-goer, the more choices the better: biopics, documentaries, drama, comedy, musical, animation, action, sci-fi, thriller.",7,1,4,23 March 2019
Knives Out," A fun mystery movie with stellar cast, morbid humour abound!
","Sit back and enjoy: if you like the cast, you will not be disappointed: they clearly had a great time playing off each other's characters. The plot twist was not as surprising as I have hoped for, but there were no dull moments either. I'm glad to see different genres being successful on the big screen - neither every script requires, nor every studio can afford, blockbuster productions.",9,2,8,1 December 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 still brings interesting new characters and action-packed giggles to all ages, and touches audience with inspiring life lessons about self and society.
","If this is the last instalment, Toy Story 4 ended with a very high bar for other sequels - live or animation wise.The film runs a tight script, so every scene is full of action, smart dialogues and hilarious situations that are relevant to today's society: e.g. throw-away society, where toy characters question the difference between being 'trash' and 'a toy'; changing gender roles and existentialism - delivered by unforgettable new and old characters, hands down.What amazes me is that the script was able to demonstrate conflict resolution between toys through trust, communication and empathy - an important lesson on building a cooperative society in a competitive world.The story left me with belly laughs and heart-felt tears.",10,2,7,2 July 2019
Joker," Affecting, dark and timely film, with superb cast; would have been perfect if ending kept short and 'bitter-sweet'
","There's no surprise in the plot. What draws audience is the acting and timely theme of social equity and senseless crimes. The film suggested the causes and the ending seemed to portray Joker in a triumphant way - I gave the writers benefit of the doubt; that this ending was meant to show the ironic turn of Arthur from being an unwanted comedian who liked to cheer people young and old, to being accepted and even followed as a villain-vigilante. I would have given it 9~10 if the film ended in the night scene, but it dragged into more scenes inside a hospital which felt redundant to us sympathetic audience.The film message to me is not about provoking civil unrest and violent rampage. I see the story as a cautionary tale about missed opportunities for society to come together especially during difficult and uncertain times. Give, not take; trust, not judge. Peace.",8,0,1,26 October 2019
Life," Good acting and terrifying scenes make up for the predictable plot
","Being a fan of Aliens series, this movie can't be a 10 since it didn't break any moulds. Also, audience may find it frustrating to switch mood between fear, melancholy and contemplative.However, I'd give it a solid 7 for the good actors, believable alien design and frightening (at least unpleasant if you're a seasoned sci-fi thriller fan) death scenes. The alien was menacing physically as well as intelligently, so a reboot or sequel may be doable.The movie is long enough to build empathy towards characters, and serves as a cautionary tale of 'don't mess with things you don't know'. I saw the movie twice, so the second time I skipped the first 13 minutes. Most of the characters' behaviour stayed consistent, i.e. dumb troubles were caused by the more curious characters. The rest of the movie adequately showed a mix of sci-fi horror, human drama and moral lessons.The ending was meant to be a surprise, but it's unpleasantly familiar to horror fans. The blu-ray special features include a few short (7 minutes each) interviews and production comments on alient creature design based on genetics consultation.If you're in the mood for a mix of sci-fi horror and drama, you'd enjoy the movie.",7,0,2,7 August 2018
