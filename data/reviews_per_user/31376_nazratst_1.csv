Come and See," Great Hypocrisy
","This movie is another propagandistic thing that old 1950-1960's Russian war movies were suppose to do. It is great filmed, I couldn't deny. But its message is an hypocrite idea. It seems that an real event were took place in Belarus in that time, OK. But why this guy made this film in 1985 repeating the same...thing? I mean about de 'devil' Nazis beside the Russian angels? I liked the image that look germas like crazy vikings hailing ang drinking, very funny.... Have anyone an idea how was the russin occupation of eastern Europe in the late of WWII? How many murders, rapes?... The Nazis was professional killers, OK, but they were yet civilized (if I could say so) beside of a savage hypocrite murders called russians with their red army!.. Nazis were stupid kids beside Red Holocaust and Stalin. Be serious!!!!!",1,15,111,27 July 2007
