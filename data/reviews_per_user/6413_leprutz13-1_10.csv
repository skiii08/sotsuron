Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Just one sequence is worth it.
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) The certainly most famous detective of all times returns in an action packed adventure of lies and treachery. Holmes and his side kick Watson are trying to assemble bits and pieces of a puzzle to find out the identity of the person who is behind terrorist attacks, that took place in Europe, and foil his evil plans.After watching over half an hour, trying to find out where all this was going, I found myself closing my eyes (unwillingly) for a couple of minutes, because of boredom, simply bad slapstick comedy and more then horrendous storytelling. The Screenplay is predictable, yet ununderstandable, trying to hard on creating a suspenseful script a la Robert Ludlum. Nevertheless, after an hour we get to know where the screenwriter wants to take us, but the beginning is just messy.The Direction and the photography (technically speaking) have pros and contras - I appreciated a lot the use of tripods and other technical devices like travelling or steady cam to get some clean still shots at the actors and make the action more comprehensible. Specially nowadays, that most Hollywood action movies are shot with shaky cam. Simply embarrassing. - Less appreciated, was the fact of non innovative narrating, everything is as we expect it to be. The fighting sequences are rather slow, using multiple slow motions, way over used and sometimes repeating the same action too often which kills the surprise effectThe editing is likable in most non violent sequences. During the fights, it is flashy and unbearable at most. Already seen jump cuts in the time motion makes the action anything else then fluid. The rhythm of the whole narration is rather deceiving, boring and maybe too distracting sometimes.The actors did quite well. But I wouldn't throw flowers on the stage either.I am not wise in special effects but they are mostly well done and I must admit that I was quite impressed in the forest bombing sequence. The Time Motion jump cut was rather pleasant, I would even say needed if not, actually impressive in that sequence.Anyway, Guy Ritchie has proved to me once more, that he is a very talented director who lost it all after Snatch. Not even with a Blockbuster, bearing the name of one of the most respected Man on earth ever, was he capable of returning to his magnificence of filmmaking. For me, Guy is a one hit wonder and will always be. 4 out of 10 for an unmemorable movie, but a plus for one impressive sequence.",4,7,12,24 January 2012
Dawn of the Dead," Already seen stuff but New somehow
","I gave this movie a ten out of ten because I think that Zack Snyder deserves it for his filming debut. I hated 300 Because it has absolutely nothing and Zack died this instance for me. But when I saw Dawn of the Dead, (I do hate zombie movies) I was amazed by the way he treated the story. Like many of the already seen zombieflicks, This movie has almost none of an explanation background. But The young director shows how you can turn something already seen lots of times, into something new and original. The way he treats the characters and their behaviour is different to what I have seen and creates a new kind of suspense.All in one It is just a movie for entertainment (what movies should be in some way) and I think it is worth a peek.",10,0,1,13 March 2008
Juno," Not a bad movie but certainly not a good one either
","I Must say that I have been awaiting this movie for a long time. I hoped to, finally see a movie and that would have somehow taught us or make us think about unwanted pregnancy on teenagers.But to my loss of joy forwarding to this movie, I just think that both, the writer and the director forgot about the telling of the message. If it has a message it's certainly not about nowadays unprepared and uninformed teenager. This movie has quite nothing but Ellen Page who is always marvelous. And so the one who played her dad. The directing itself was cozy but hey, I'm not a pro yet, but for sure this could have been done better.Nothing special, They completely missed the point",4,1,8,19 May 2008
Being John Malkovich," Crazy and funny
","Being John Malkovich: The attempt to portray the life of an internationally known actor, through the eyes of random people, makes this story unbelievingly funny. Even though I sense that the meaning of all this, might be: 'we should not interact into other peoples lives, or businesses' , I therefore think that the movie itself made quite well. You should be someone accustomed into viewing, strange and bizarre stories. The start maybe what seems to be a typical drama regarding a looser puppeteer living with his wife and some animals. We actually get caught into their lives till one day our protagonist finds a secret portal to Being John Malkovich. Starts out to be a realistic movie but the deeper you get the stranger and surreal it gets. A very well written screenplay in which the information is passed onto us through different characters in different ways. Meaning: We know exactly as much as the protagonist, we know more the some characters and we certainly know way less then someone else. This brings me to the editing, which is good for it's purpose. It get's the story running, never makes you feel bored and has a good rhythm as well as some pretty interesting cuts.I would say the directors choice of using two different visual styles, depending on who he focused, makes the story much more understandable as well as funny, some, but far from being really innovative, the screenplay, again makes it so different.Acting wiseÂ… great. Each actor knows exactly the character they have to be and how to make them believable. All in one, I'd give it a 7 out of 10, for being absurdly funny, unrealistically true and above all entertaining, leaving you a quite indescribable aftertaste after watching the movie.",7,0,0,21 January 2012
No Country for Old Men," I do not understand why.
","I do not understand why this movie gets a high rating. Believe me when I say that I do know a little bit about cinema, I am not one of those youngsters who watch just action with nonsense.So to the movie No Coutry for Old Men: I went to see this one with my mother and I still feel ashamed of myself having taken her to watch this movie. I do like the Coen bros. but honestly, besides of the very good directing of this movie I really don't know what Mr. Coen wanted to tell me there. I just don't get the message and to be honest, the movie after a the first hour decays into a complete loss of time. Please somebody tell me what is it the directors want to tell me besides of a psychopat killer killing everybody for some money that's not even his own.Or do I have to remind you that the job of a director is to tell a story no matter what...",1,20,62,13 March 2008
The Hurt Locker," Why make such a big deal?
","OK, first of all, I think Kathy Big is a talented director but who in my point of view just wastes my time with Hurt Locker. I loved her early works, Point Break and Strange Days. But what I don't understand is why do most of the people think this is such a good picture?For this movie was plain boring. Nothing happens throughout the whole film and the only maybe breathtaking scene in that film doesn't take place longer than one minute. I want to educate people to learn that movies are not just a bunch of images cut together, it is about telling a story. But nowadays it seems to be in, telling stories with no PATHOS. In other words: message or meaning. The direction and the editing are more than obvious and very predictable. Direted like many other war movies that have been made and better than this one. There is nothing new in this film, therefor, fellow readers. A good director is also a director who changes the way of telling a story. Thanks for your time.",2,9,23,16 July 2009
The Dark Knight," Hoolywood should think forward not backwars
","Poorly told movie, none of the Batman essences is here, It looks more like a realistic, movie about terrorism where two completely insane lunatics in weird costumes battle for the security of so called Gotham City. To be honest with you all, I just liked the batman movies done by Burton and since than Hollywood made one trash after another. This one included. Batman begins was really awful, to turn the story into such a way where you actually destroy the true starting of batman and now a Batman who is supposed to fight against his own ego, is powerless. I mean it's quite good when a super heroe has his problems fighting the bad, but here I didn't see what he is fighting against. Only good thing, is very well done special effects avoiding all this CGI fx. And maybe Heath ledger has done well. But that doesn't make a good movie. And oh yes, who the hell is Harvey Dent? For Christ sake, making out of bad two face a good two face. They should have given me the script in the hands then people tell would tell me now this is a truly dark film. This one was poor, too much light, too shiny and to luxury to be the dark gotham like I know it from the first comic books. I almost fell asleep. Sad.",3,4,9,22 September 2008
Avatar," People are weak minded.
","First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.Storywise, there is no story at all. It's the typical good vs bad scenario shaped out of cowboys against indians in space mixing it with a yogi everything connects us to the world impression plus a goddamn planet called Pandora and looks like f...in' paradise. Lot's of shiny colours and huge monsters who eat flesh are your best friends. Come on. You gotta be kidding me.Maybe I might be the only one here, cause all reviews I've seen got great score, but that is not what a movie is supposed to be. I was very unimpressed by the CGI and the artistic development because I might be used to computer games such as Final Fantasy series which has been the shaper of such incredible stories, only that these games have a very strong story to tell and and you feel totally involved.It impresses me that people give this such a high rating because of it's visuals. I mean it was clear that sooner or later a movie would appear with such incredible CGI. If it wouldn't have been Avatar another would have been the winner.I am sad that nowadays cinema is ail centered only about violence, good looks and a huge lack of brain.3 out of ten only for the cgi which I thought is not the center of a movie otherwise I would have rated it beneath 0.",1,425,717,25 December 2009
The Wrestler," You gotta be kidding me!
","My rating is fare and I will tell You why. Technical part: Nowaday movie business is going hell knows where. So The people who are in this industry just try to do anything in a movie, hand-held camera to give it a modern look. I am for hand-held but please explain me why wasting lot's of money when there is nothing else needed. No tripod, no crane, no crew to use all this stuff. Story: Then half of the movie we see a maybe well acting Mickey Rourke from behind walking through some hallways. I don't see what is so huge about this fact. They are telling me a story of a wrestler loser in life who finishes up dead because nobody loves him. I don't see anything artistic in that movie. Not a single beautiful shot, the direction was poor and unoriginal for a Daren Aronowski who used to teach us that in cinema you can do lots when you have little. So He just turned into any other director who isn't capable of creativity and innovation anymore with a huge team behind. In other terms, we get lazy with lots of help. The editing was mediocre at best and the plot is much more then predictable. I wasn't snoring during the movie so this is why it gets at least three stars from my side.",3,5,11,23 December 2009
300," The first 300 seconds I knew this would be crap.
","MY rating is 1, because of the following...First of all this is not a movie because of all of its CGI, it should be animation. So nothing goes to the director but to the animators maybe.Second: The story tells you of how bad non white people are (which means that all ethnics are monsters) See Racist.And number three, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. Bad directing and the action scenes are the most seen sequences ever. (Peaople are talking about Choreography) There is no such a thing like choreography in this movies. Watch Once Upon A Time In China or Time And Tide or The Blade or B 13 or Ong Bak or Tom Yum Goong or a Bittersweet Life, etc, etc, etc...These are choreography.Besides the acting is not that tremendous. I can shout too.",1,2,5,27 March 2008
