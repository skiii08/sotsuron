Skyfall," thrilling and great cinematography experience !!
","Absolutely stunning cinematography ! IMAX was outstanding I must say.For sure better than the previous bond movie of Daniel Craig. Better performance from Daniel. He seemed too much into character and really good performance ! Kind of humor given time to time in script is something really good.Script is good too, audience (including me) were glued to their seats expecting what's going to happen next.All other character have given great performances too.One of the lady shown in Shanghai, that part could have been shortened. But it was almost up to mark. Judi did a good job !Better than Quantum of Solace ! Good movie to watch !",9,2,9,20 November 2012
