Blade Runner 2049," One of the best movie sequels ever made. And I'm not exaggerating

So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Blade Runner 2049, as most of you may have already know, is a sequel to a beloved sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner (1982)'. And just to warn you, like its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 isn't fully consisted of action. It's more of a sci-fi mystery filled with action-packed scenes and serious tone. So don't expect lots of action when watching this.But really, this movie isn't much of a sequel. It's actually a story of its own with some plot points that continue from the first movie. And I respect this film for that!And Denis Villeneuve knocked it out of the park once again! The style and feel of the world the film takes place feels kind of dystopian, dark, and mysterious, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is top notch!And thank heavens, the movie's plot isn't the same as what it seemed to be from the trailers that portrays this film as another one of those 'to save the world' films. It has a story of its own, and it does its job telling this story excellently.There are still two flaws that didn't actually bother me, though. I just find these points flawed for other people to watch.As stated, the trailers had a different feel from the film. And it made the movie look as if it's a sci-fi action film. And that's going to be a problem with other viewers, since what they get is different, though they get what's better than the expected product.And lastly, this film wouldn't probably please normal viewers. The runtime is too long, the other people in the theater I watched this movie at were yawning at some parts, and those same parts would feel slow for normal viewers.But hey, I enjoyed the film a lot. And I rate films depending on how much I've enjoyed them. And I surely enjoyed this one.Overall, I think Blade Runner 2049 is a great soon-to-be classic sci-fi mystery film that will be always remembered as time passes by. It's a cinematic achievement for being visually stunning (like its predecessor), and being one of the best movie sequels of all time. Please go give this film a try! It's flopping at the box office last week, and it deserves more attention!Final rating: A+|10/10",10,8,20,9 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," MCU's most audacious entry yet.
","*Just to note, 'Do You Find This Review Helpful?' doesn't mean if you agree with the reviewer's opinion or not, but rather, it means if the review actually describes the film, and what are its pros and cons. So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I brought that up just to tell you that Marvel is still standing strong until today, even at its seventeenth film, and the fact that this is one of my favorite Marvel films.I'm glad the film takes Thor differently. Unlike the first two, which are both mostly boring and trying to be very serious, this film is fun, and energetic.The best thing about this film is that it's probably the most fun entry of MCU. It's 90% filled with humor. Almost all of the main actors in the cast steals the movie. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, and even Taika Waititi as Korg. They were all very interesting and funny characters, thanks to these actors that did great in their roles.I also have to give props to Taika Waititi for his direction. The film feels very fast-paced (in a good way), energetic, and fun overall. The reason why it's different to most of what MCU gave us so far is that, again, it's filled with humor most of the time. It's just a straight up superhero-comedy film. And that's what makes is MCU's most audacious film yet.Sure, the previous MCU films may have humor, but throughout the film, it's laughs and giggles. Though it sounds bad that the film is mainly comedic, the way the comedy is executed is very well done.Another plus for me is the action is very well-executed and visually stunning. The film is very colorful, and I loved the animation for the closing credits.The only flaw for me in this film is that there may be a lot of jokes in some scenes. There's this one joke, and then there's another. In return, the viewer wouldn't handle all of it. It's a minor flaw, but I thought of it, so I had to include it here.Overall, it's a very fun and colorful film. Easily the best of the Thor films, one of Waititi's best works as a director, and one of MCU's best efforts.Final Rating: 9/10 <> A",9,59,107,31 October 2017
Baby Driver," An action-packed music-induced funride!

So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Also, minor and unnecessary spoilers are here!Baby Driver is one of the best films I've seen so far this year. A great addition to Edgar Wright's filmography, though it's not his best film.There are lots of pros than cons in this one. But I mean, we're talking about Edgar Wright so... First of all, the sound editing is Oscar-worthy. Seriously! The way the music syncs with the action, or even small tidbits of the characters' movements, it's so refreshing to see in an action film. I think not much people have done this fully in feature length films like this, which is quite an achievement, if you ask me. The cinematography is top notch, too. Since it's an action film, you, of course, need to watch the action and the stunts/choreography of each scene in films. And thank heavens this movie isn't a cut-to-cutfest. And when it does use cuts, it actually shows what the characters are doing! Learn from this guy, Hollywood!And another thing is, though the story isn't original, the plot isn't as predictable as you'd think it'd be. Sure, you would know what things would happen as the film goes on, but the thing is that you wouldn't really guess HOW these things would happen. Especially the ending, which disappointed some people, but really, I think it fits the film, only if you'd understand the motivations between the two leads (Ansel Elgort and Lily James).Speaking of the two leads, a major con for the film is that the romance between the two is under-developed. Knowing crap about music, and driving to different places isn't enough to make a believable romantic chemistry. I know this is an action film, but their chemistry is a major plot point for the film, meaning it has to be developed. Another thing is that Jon Bernthal is kind of wasted here. Literally, he's only in the film for, like two scenes or more. It's a shame, since Bernthal is a really good actor in films such as The Accountant, Fury, and this year's Wind River. This is a minor flaw, though. It's nothing personal.Other than the two flaws I have mentioned, this movie is amazing! It's action-packed, music-inducing fun ride 'til the end of the road! It's one of the best movies of 2017 so far! It's up there with Logan, The Big Sick, and Blade Runner 2049.Final Rating: A | 9/10",9,1,3,7 October 2017
