Hereditary," Rubbish!
",Everything good you've seen in the trailer...it's starts of well after a surprising 'incident' after which it goes down hill then the last 10 minutes are good then falls flat with a terrible ending that the whole cinima laughed at! Bit late on writing this review bit still had to be done! Wait for it to come on Netflix/prime or sky movies don't waste your money!,2,4,9,9 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Boring and dull actually want my money back!!
","I heard about the bad reviews before seeing Captain Marvel but figured from all the reviews saying it's people slayting on it cause she's a women (which didn't make sense as this isn't the first movie we've had a women in the lead role and as a superhero eg wonder women,Alita and ghost in a shell to name a few) I went in there with the mind set it may not be great but good enough...well me,my wife and sister all thought the same...this is rubbish!...the whole time I was waiting to get pulled into the story and get excited to see her use her powers and fly but you sort of see her powers straight away(minus the flying and when you do see it it's nothing like a wow! Moment) you find out how she gets her powers near the middle-end) so most of the film Your just wondering how she got them and when you find out your like 'oh right ok was that it' I just felt like it had lots missing to it...I didnt really care much about her..I was never really woried or felt much toward her like I did for wonder women or any of the avengers...I think the actress who played captain marvel was very woden and not a very good actress...scarlet johanson played her part really well In the avengers so hopefully she can get some tips of her!....I was just really disappointed that this is the hero who's supposed to save the day in Endgame...I thought her powers were not amazing and felt like when she used them they didn't really do much(unless your a juxbox or door) tbh if your seeing this to the up to endgame you don't need to!...has nothing in it that ties to endgame apart from the credit scene which you can get on YouTube and tbh it wasn't all that(if you wondering how fury gets the pager.......*Little Spoiler*********** ******************she gives it to him after he hands it to her earlier in the film but this time she modified it to call her) overall I'd say it reminded me of a Netflix marvel show I'd say it was watchable but nothing more...annoyed at myself for sticking up for it before I saw it and now I actually want my money back!",1,494,939,17 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once upon a time....I was soooo looking forward to this!
","Well that was disappointing!...firstly I know it's a love letter to Hollywood but I really expected more!...it didn't feel like a tarantino movie till the last 10 minutes...the acting was superb though and loved the look of the movie but man was the story lacking!...or was sold as a love letter to Hollywood around the Manson family so I figured 'ok so like an hour or hour and half of Hollywood then the Manson family etc instead it was 2 and half hours of Hollywood (driving around,fixing stuff. Making movies) then 10 minutes of the Manson family and some story. I was just really disappointed with it. For me definitely his worst but hopefully not he's last as the rumours say x",3,1,3,17 August 2019
Joker," Fantastic! A masterpiece! A breath a fresh air!
",Well what can I say that hasn't been said already! I just got back from seeing it and I have to say nearly the whole film I was on the edge of my seat! It's so tense! The performances are all amazing and joaquin phoenix portrayal of the Joker was astonishing! I can't praise it enough! Don't go into this film thinking it will be like a normal comic book film cause it wont! This is an adults Comic book (infant i wouldn't even think of it as a comic book adaptation) This is a Joker I've waited to see for a very long time! GO AND SEE JOKER NOW!!,10,2,3,4 October 2019
