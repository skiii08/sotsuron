The Blair Witch Project," Jipeeeeeeee, finally after all those stupid special effect movies a realistic movie.
","I was scared during the whole movie, i think that's more because of the expectations that i've had. During the whole movie you have the feeling everything can happen and nothing really happens, until the end. It was worth waiting 80 minutes for this ending, it was the best ending i've ever seen. I have to say i'm not really a horror movie lover, but i will remember this film for the rest of my life. It's a pity you can't rate this movie 10+. My compliments and thanks to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez (II)for letting having me a good time for 87Min",10,1,2,19 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Peter Jackson, 'You bow for no one'
","-Minor Spoilers- I don't know where i have to start describing the feeling i had after the last line of the credits scrolled before my eyes on the big cinema screen. I was not able to turn my head and look at my friends who where cheering their lungs out. This is the best movie ever made (followed close by Lawrence of Arabia) and will probably stay the best movie for more than a few decades. I don't know how a director who made movies like, bad taste, braindead and not to forget meet the feebles is capable to make the best trilogy ever. This is not only a great book been made into a movie but a magnificent personal effort of Peter Jackson who made these movies the best they can be. Beautiful pictures of middle earth dancing on the score by Howard Shore, are being followed by the biggest and best cinematic action sequences i've ever seen. This movie will simply blow you away. It's better than the first one, better than the second one and even better than the first two combined. If you are reading this and haven't seen the movie, your wasting your time, rush out to the cinema and go and watch this. The movie is a great team effort with beautiful and intriguing acting by all of the characters. John Rhys Davies is even more funnier than in the two towers, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are showing that they don't have to be together to act. Sean Astin is interacting better to Elijah Wood than in the first two movies. And Elijah is the best Frodo in the whole world, you see it in his eyes that he's becoming more afraid every minute he is closer to Mount Doom. And not to forget Orlando Bloom, who's showing that he's a great actor with a facial expression that will make the Elfs proud. And then last but not least there is 'THE KING' Viggo Mortensen which is a true king. There isn't a greater king than him. Oh, i forgot Ian McKellen, everybody knows he's a great actor. This brings me to the following conclusion. Rush to the Cinema and go and see 'The lord of the movies' 'Peter Jackson' i don't think you read this, but if you do, i thank you on behalf of myself and the rest of the Cinema loving world. Thank You Peter Jackson",10,0,0,18 December 2003
