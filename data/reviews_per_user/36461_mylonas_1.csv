Alien 3," an amazing sequel
","I just saw Prometheyus which sucked unbelievably and thought to write a review in my favorite alien sequel. The movie justifies the title Alien. Compared to the first 2 movies: Alien 1 is a masterpiece and the begging of all this hype. Alien 2 is total fluke, you know exactly what is going to happen before it even happens, for a few brief moments but that's it, it doesn't really keep you in there. Its a typical futuristic movie where the writer can just invent new scifi guns to support the script (like automated sentry machine guns). Newt and Hicks was a nice touch in 2 but I'm so glad they didn't use them in 3, i would really hate to see the aliens franchise turned into a chick flick with romance and happy endings... thats not what the alien movies are all about. Alien 3 on the other hand was a masterpiece, all the actors were great. I have to say the dialogs were not the best but lets face it, if the aliens movie is about keeping you in a sense of despair, helplessness, fear of the unknown then alien 3 is right next to the first movie.The set is in a remote prison planet were resources are limited (including weapons), habited by a small group religious prisoners, the alien is only one and the only way to beat the monster is by using their wits. No flashy sci fi other than the monster and maybe the medpod, no space ships, no super guns, no reactors waiting to explode. The characters were well played and they were not just there to feed the monster like the previous movies.Bottom line: Eventho the movie had many problems during the shooting this one turned out to be a great one. A lot of reviewers here complained about removing Newt and Hicks and using a set that is not as sci fi as the previous ones but thats just a matter of opinion, i think the makers of this sequel did right and changed the whole scene radically, if they didn't then they would have to kill at least one of them in the next one, so taking them all together and changing the scenery was the best.. a bit sudden but a good one :p",Null,3,3,20 June 2012
