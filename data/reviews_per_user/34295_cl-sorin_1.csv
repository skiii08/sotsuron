Resident Evil: Afterlife," Disappointed
","This has got to be the worst resident evil so far. there is no story, some action scenes are kinda stupid, and don't judge me wrong, i like a good action movie and am a huge fan of the resident evil trilogy, but this...OK 3D,wow, big deal! you can't base a movie only on the 3D element and some cool camera movement+stop motion. this movie just doesn't live up to the resident evil name :(. The good thing is that, if they shoot a sequel, they can't go any more wrong. there were lots of other things and one of them was that in some slow motion scenes, the characters' movement was a little strange (they really didn't seem to be running/jumping). if you are going to see this movie, see it in 3D...makes it less disappointing i guess.",5,1,3,27 November 2010
