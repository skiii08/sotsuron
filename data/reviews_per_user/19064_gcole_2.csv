Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great movie
","Listen people,everyone is a critic,sure you can pick at this film and find many flaws.  What film is ever perfect, ask yourself after you have seen this movie, was it worth watching. We've all had 16 years to wonder if George Lucas was ever going to finish what he had started with Star Wars,and now here it is. I thought it was magical simply because it was like going back in time when I was 11 years old and saw the film for the first time in 77.  The familiar soundtrack blasting at the beginning of the movie with the scrolling words was a time warp.  My two young boys loved every minute of it as did I.  To all the professional critics out there, get a life.  I still remember the reviews that came out about the first three films, So why should this film be any different.  They hate success, which is what this new edition will be.  The only thing I hate is having to wait three years for the next installment.  I will see this film many times to make the waiting less painful.  You will enjoy this movie, Unless you hate sfx movies and in that case you were never a fan anyways so stay home.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," started sifi flicks as we know them today
","For its time it was in my opinion one of the greatest sifi movies ever made.  yes there have been other great movies of this type,2001, the day the earth stood still and a few others but none held the magic this movie did. in a word to me it's a classic right along with citizen kane or gone with the wind.",10,0,0,21 November 1998
