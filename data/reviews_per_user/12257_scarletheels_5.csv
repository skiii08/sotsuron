Source Code," Action/sci-fi/thriller w/a Hitchcockian/The Twilight Zone feel
","Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train to discover he's assumed the identity (and body) of someone named Sean Fentress. Confusion quickly sets in for the military pilot - his last memory is of a mission gone haywire in Afghanistan. Eight minutes later, after the train explodes, he's strapped inside a cold, dark pod. He is soon contacted by Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who bombards him with questions about the train and the explosion. Struggling to make sense of what happened, he fires back with questions of his own. Careful not to disclose too much information, Goodwin instructs him that he has eight minutes to track down the bomb and the bomber. Any deviation from the mission, including trying to save passengers, is highly discouraged. He's transported back into Sean's body over and over until, finally, he speaks to a man who appears to be in charge of the mysterious operation, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). It turns out that Colter is in a project called Source Code, which allows him to relive the last eight minutes of Sean's life in order to gather valuables clues about the bomber. For Rutledge, it's about the objective. For Colter, it's now about saving the lives of the passengers, particularly Christina (Michelle Monaghan), the pretty and flirtatious passenger he's steadily been growing feelings for. One problem: Source Code is not time travel - it's time reassignment. It's metaphysics, quantum theory, and a host of other scientific concepts that will likely fly over most viewers' heads but don't worry, you don't need to understand how Source Code works in order to enjoy the movie. Source Code has been mentioned with and compared to Nolan's wildly popular dream invasion flick, Inception. Having seen both, I urge you not to go into Source Code expecting an Inception knock-off. While both films have their strengths, I found Jones' action/sci-fi/thriller miles better with its character development. Another plus is that it has a very Hitchcockian/The Twilight Zone feel to it in that it relies on its story and the actors, rather than extravagant CGI and a dramatic soundtrack. Having said that, as much as I gripe about the over-use of CGI, the special effects in this movie are rather underwhelming and a bit dated. No biggie, though. This isn't the kind of movie that relies on grandiose computer generated imaging and it's certainly not hindered by any lack of it. Ironically, I loved this film (and its delightfully dreamy leading man) until the last eight minutes. A 9/10 knocked down to an 8/10 for its ridiculously sentimental, typical Hollywood 'and they all lived happily ever after' ending. I'm not a pessimist. I root for the underdog. I believe in soulmates and love at first sight. I like to see karma reward the good guy or gal but closure should be a resolution that makes sense for the characters and viewers in a way that doesn't completely insult either parties. There's poignant (frozen kiss) and then there's sickly sweet (let's go look at our reflections in the big, shiny thing). I think Source Code is more suited for mainstream audiences than films like Inception or 12 Monkeys so I give it the go-ahead to most of you out there.",8,0,1,7 March 2012
Bad Teacher," Not the Funniest Comedy of 2011 but It Works
","Gold-digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is forced back into the teaching position she despises after being dumped by her rich boyfriend. Instead of instructing the students and nurturing their young minds, she shows them movies like Lean On Me and Dangerous Minds while sneaking in sips of booze and cat napping at her desk. She hones in on Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a handsome substitute teacher who belongs to a family of considerable wealth but, to her dismay, he falls for the star teacher, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Intent on snagging herself another sugar daddy, she starts saving money for breast implants but her efforts to afford the $10,000 price tag aren't enough.After she learns the teacher whose class receives the highest state test scores is awarded a $5,700 bonus check, she starts making her students apply themselves but her aggressive teaching style yields nothing but bellyaching and malcontent. Determined to win the money, she poses as an investigative journalist following up on claims that the state exams discriminate against blacks and minorities, allowing her an the opportunity to steal the test questions from Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon). The hostile rivalry between Elizabeth and Amy turns into full- scale war after Elizabeth's students scores are, not only the highest in the entire county but, enough to unseat Amy's three year victory.There are plenty of rotten pranks and downright nasty schemes that go on throughout the film, along with drinking and drugs, lots of swearing, an awkward dry-humping scene, and a pair of surgically enhanced breasts that will have men's eyes popping right out of their sockets. The humor is hit-and-miss but when it succeeds, it's shamefully funny. It's no comedic gem but it does satisfy a guilty pleasure to see Diaz play a greedy, thoughtless, conniving bitch. In Hollywood years, she's 'old' but, damn, she is looking better than ever and I give her props for flaunting what she's got in Bad Teacher.I loved Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel. Who is this woman who nailed the role of a well-intentioned but batshit crazy teacher so perfectly? She captured all of Amy's neurotic tendencies, exasperating competitiveness, nervous tics, and the smarmy smile that I kept hoping Elizabeth would knock right off of her face. Thumbs up to Jason Segel as Russell, the school gym teacher pining for Elizabeth, John Michael Higgins as the overwhelmed Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as reserved, mousy Lynn. The only person I didn't get was Justin Timberlake's character - he was just plain weird and dull.This was a mediocre comedy saved by its cast. There is a lot that doesn't make sense and you basically have to toss your morals to the wayside. Don't get too analytical. This movie is not an attack on the fine men and women who sacrifice salary for their passion to teach. It's a short-sighted, bawdy summertime flick that wants to tickle your funny bone, even if it doesn't always succeed.",6,0,2,6 August 2011
Bridesmaids," Chick Flick Made Palpable for Men by Using Raunchy Humor
","Annie (Kristen Wiig), a down-and-out woman who's lost her business and boyfriend, is invited to be her childhood friend's (Lillian, played by Maya Rudolph) Maid of Honor. Coordinating the wedding is the insanely rich and pretentious wife of the bride's husband's boss, Helen (Rose Byrne), who from the get-go, tirelessly competes for Lillian's attention. In the mix are Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a housewife who is desperate to escape the confines of suburbia, Becca (Ellie Kemper), a clueless newlywed, and Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the groom's crass sister. The subtle rivalry between Annie and Helen eventually backfires on the both of them and it's up to the two adversaries to put aside their differences in order to save the big day.One of the more hyped-up movies of 2011, Bridesmaids is marketed as a raunchy, female version of The Hangover, which is understandable but unnecessarily deceiving. The only correlation between the two is an impending marriage. This is less about the bridesmaids and more about about its central character, Annie, a self-loathing, loveless character who projects her negative attitude on to anyone who has the misfortune to cross paths with her. They include customers in the jewelry store she works at, Nathan (Chris O'Dowd), the baby-faced cop she ends up romancing, and her own best friend. At times, Annie is difficult to empathize with because she's such a destructive force. She's so intent on sabotaging herself that she loses her job and drives away a man who only wants to see her succeed and be happy.You may not realize it right away but Bridesmaids is a chick flick that's been made palpable for men with some raunchy (though implied) humor and the really funny comedic relief of Melissa McCarthy. Kristen Wiig shows quite a bit of restraint, to the point where I wondered if this is the same ham of Saturday Night Live fame. I was disappointed, especially during the airplane scene, which was her moment to shine. It seemed like such a wasted opportunity, both for Wiig and her fans. Whether this was her choice or the director's, I don't know. McLendon- Covey and Kemper receive limited screen time, as does John Hamm, who plays Wiig's boorish, inconsiderate 'fuck buddy'.Besides McCarthy, O'Dowd and Byrne deserve pats on the backs for their performances. O'Dowd may seem out of place with his Irish accent but he manages to infuse some much needed positive energy. He's silly and lovable with amusing observations about life and his law enforcement profession. My favorite was the quip about the ugly carrot in every bag (and I just ate it). Byrne as the gorgeous, impeccably groomed trophy wife was perfectly cast, as well.The film clocks in at two hours and five minutes, thanks to jokes getting stretched well past their expiration. I like Kristen Wiig but her writing, especially the dialog, doesn't always gel. Sometimes, it's obvious a scene exists solely to showcase herself as 'the emerging female comedian' yet she never fully satisfies. Other times, the banter between characters is so unrealistic and outrageous that it's no longer humorous but outright awkward to watch. I squirmed more during the jewelry store scenes than I did during the much talked about diarrhea outbreak. Kristen Wiig is no Tina Fey but I don't hold that against her.",7,1,3,6 August 2011
Unknown," Escapist entertainment that relies mostly on its leading man, Neeson
","Liam Neeson is Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist who travels to Germany with his wife, Liz (January Jones, Mad Men), for a bio-tech conference. Before checking into the hotel, he realizes he's left his briefcase and passport behind so he flags down a taxi driven by Gina (Diane Kruger, Inglorious Basterds). Her expert driving skills sends them careening off of a bridge and into the drink. She manages to save herself and Martin, then flees the scene, not wanting to risk deportment because she's an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. After waking up from a coma, Martin can only remember who he is and why he's in Berlin. He finds his way back to the hotel where he finds Liz, only she denies that she's his wife or that she even knows him. Worse yet, she's with a man (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be her husband and the real Dr. Martin Harris. Lacking any identification to prove that he is who he claims to be, he's removed from the premises. And the mystery surrounding the dual Dr. Harrises begins. He tracks down Gina and, together, they try to understand what is happening to Martin and why Liz denies that she's his wife. They're lousy detectives. If it weren't for the mystery men constantly in their faces (I don't want to give too much away), they'd be wandering aimlessly around Berlin. Yes, there are plot holes and more than enough 'reeeeally?' moments, but Neeson makes it all worthwhile. At 58, he's still got it. The action is intense, the suspense and thrills are the perfect tone, and the mystery is well done. It's up to you to decide whether the twist at the end is satisfactory. This isn't a flawless film. It's escapist entertainment that relies mostly on its leading man. Unknown is The Bourne Supremacy with less action.",6,5,8,7 March 2012
Mary and Max," A complicated tale meant for adults
","Mary and Max is a multi-award winning animation that chronicles the relationship between Mary Daisy Dinkle (Toni Collette), a young, insecure girl in Australia who is the only daughter of an alcoholic mother and a neglectful father, and Max Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an overweight, panic-ridden man in New York. One day, Mary picks the first name she finds in a phone book and sends a letter, along with a chocolate bar, prompting a decades long correspondence of letters and chocolate treats. Although Max has longed for a real friend (his imaginary friend sits on a stool reading all day), Mary's sensitive questions propel him into anxiety attacks, one so severe he ends up in a mental institution. Many years pass with no mail from Max. In between waiting for word from him, Mary becomes smitten with the next door neighbor boy, Damien (Eric Bana), and continues helping her agoraphobic neighbor, Len. Considering advice from his therapist, he finally writes to Mary and confides in her that he has Asperger's Syndrome which affects his social interaction. She decides to enter into university to study mental disorders and ends up penning a highly acclaimed book with Max as her case study. The news is not well-received by Max and he cuts off communication with her, which sends Mary into a drug-induced, drunken stupor (after shredding her hard work to pieces and damning her career). On the verge of suicide, she wonders if Max will ever forgive her. Let me immediately point out that this is not for young children or tweens. Don't be wooed by the cartoon cover art or pictures of adorable Mary Daisy Dinkle with her clunky glasses and red barrette. It's a complicated tale meant for adults. If you are unable to process rather gloomy, disheartening material without being able to bounce back emotionally, avoid this movie. Aside from the celebration of enduring friendship, there isn't much to smile about. Alcoholism, mental illness, loneliness, pill popping, heartbreak, four deaths, overeating, involuntary manslaughter, schoolyard bullying... a small list of the obstacles the characters struggle to overcome. The animation is beautifully done and the characters are a peculiar, quirky bunch with a myriad of flaws but endearing in their own ways. The stop-motion figures on the screen breathe life, full of raw, human emotion in such a profound manner, it can be a distressing, suffocating experience. That's balanced with some incredibly kooky humor. The storyline flows effortlessly but, ultimately, it won't appeal to a wider audience. High praise for writer and director, Adam Elliot, for having a unique vision and sticking to his guns. There has been mixed reviews on Barry Humphries' narration. Personally, I found his voice very soothing. This film appeases two long-time love affairs, claymation and stop- motion. It tickled my funny bone at the right moments but it was too melancholy, even for me.",6,7,16,7 March 2012
