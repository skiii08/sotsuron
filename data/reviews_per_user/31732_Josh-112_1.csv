The Blair Witch Project," A movie for film critics
","If you're a film critic, this is a wonderful movie. It's a virtually new idea and a total change from traditional horror/suspense movies.If you're a fan of movies, however, you'll probably find it mostly dull, with some rather annoying dialogue. The last five minutes almost save it, but there's just too much resentment built up as a combination of the hype surrounding this movie and the inane dialogue.",Null,1,2,25 August 1999
