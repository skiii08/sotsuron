Source Code," Take my advice, Watch this movie!!
","Source Code can be easily said to be the best movie I have ever seen. Some movies are meant to be cherished ,experienced and enjoyed , questioning the concepts they use is irrelevant, story telling is a space where one has freedom to let open the doors of imagination . Source Code is one such film , it showcases Science fiction in a never before seen avatar , and that is what makes this movie one hell of a ride. Another thing which would amaze you is the fact that despite being a science fiction movie this movie shows a beautiful love story too. It is a thorough entertainer and an even better sci-fi thriller. This is a feel good movie and you surely won't regret watching it even if you are not a fan of this genre.",Null,0,3,2 October 2011
Rockstar," Out of the box! and Amazing!
","Rockstar is the type of cinema which is the result of intelligent film- making and out of the box thinking. This is a genre which has never been explored in its right approach. This is a musical in its true sense , music completely drives the story forward and is in no way enforced into the film just for the sake of entertainment. In the movie we are shown the unexpected journey of a boy becoming a Rockstar. The journey is particularly about a series of events which shape up the negativity in life of Jordan/Janardan Jhakkad as the top of the world Rockstar. Film is filled with some hilarious moments , great amount of adrenaline pumping and soulful music that goes with the story , amazing soundtrack and a wonderful love story that connects to the heart. Great performance by Ranbir as The Negative Jordan , Shammi Kapoor Ji suits the role of a shehnai maestro and Nargis is beautiful as Heer. Imtiaz Ali's direction is one thing to watch out for and hats off to the writers for the amazing transformation that takes place in story. A.R Rahman is a maestro , a perfectionist , the lesser said the better. Mohit Chauhan as the voice of Jordon does an amazing job.",8,2,2,16 November 2011
