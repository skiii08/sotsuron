The Avengers," One of the best movies I have ever seen!
","Before watching The Avengers, I watched Thor, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America: The First Avenger. It's not required to watch these movies before watching The Avengers, nonetheless I watched in order to get familiar with those superheros and get the idea where they come from. After watching The Avengers, I'm thoroughly satisfied and I can guarantee that this film is the best of those movies I mentioned. Every moment of this film is quite enjoyable. I liked every dialog of Robert (Iron Man). Actions are elegant. Everything seemed perfect. One thing I'd like to mention that in this movie, I missed Edward Norton as the character of Hulk. However, Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) did great job I admire.I like the expression of Tom Hiddleston (Loki) in this film but not in Thor. Of course he did better in this film than in Thor. After all, this is one the best Action, Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen in my life.",9,2,5,25 August 2012
The Pianist," Amazing, vivid and unforgettable Movie!
","What a fabulous movie! Very very touching and realistic. One of Adolf Hitler's first major foreign policy initiatives after coming to power was to sign a nonaggression pact with Poland in January 1934. Poland had received the former German provinces of West Prussia, Poznan, and Upper Silesia under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Britain and France deployed their force in poland. However, neither Britain nor France in 1938 was militarily prepared to fight a war against Nazi Germany.During that time, people were in exigency and crisis. This film shows that exact situation. People were inconsequential. I saw how people endured the situation, how they were killed by Nazies . Certainly I'm going to give this credit to Roman Polanski and Ronald Harwood for making this film so realistic. Haven't seen such a worst situation before this. What is crisis? You will come to know after watching this film. This film shows exactly how it was in real. A poor hungry old man threw a bowl of food from being eaten by a poor woman. The poor old man licked the road in order to eat the food that came out of the bowl. The man was deranged though. This one is my best part of this movie. Another best part is, a young boy was selling caramel for 20 zlotys. A caramel for 20 zlotys! Can you believe this? Situation materialized it. Wladyslaw's father intended to buy a caramel. However, he had only 10 zlotys. So he collected other 10 from others around him. Worse part is, he divided the caramel into 6 pieces and distributed to other members of his family. Very very pathetic and regretful. There are so many tremendous moments that touched my heart but I can't mention them all simultaneously.I'm impressed seeing the survive of Wladyslaw.Every film doesn't have a great ending, nevertheless this film has a great ending! Of course the Nazies were vanquished in the end.",9,1,1,28 August 2012
