The Mask," An endearing triumph of humour, style and heart
","Giant yellow hats off to Chuck Russell. It's easy to see how many ways this film could've gone wrong, but the commitment to quality is obvious in every single scene. The rubbery, one-of-a-kind effects, stylish art deco setting and vintage comic book vibrance create a terrific atmosphere, and the fact that it's all played so straight might be why it works as well as it does. Peter Riegert's Dt. Kelloway, Peter Greene's Dorian Tyrell and the rest of the mobsters never seem like they'd be out of place in a 'serious' '90s crime drama, so seeing them all get caught up in the Mask's cartoonish exploits is a sight to behold.The excellent supporting cast, including the late, great Richard Jeni, Cameron Diaz' debut performance, Ben Stein at his deadpan best and the superbly emotive dog Milo round out every scene with something great. At the end of the day, the film is, of course, Jim Carrey's, and his stunning comic antics as the Mask are surprisingly rivaled by his Stanley Ipkiss. It's a role he fills with one compelling touch after another, each subtle expression as impressive as his wildest face-pulls. The earnestness with which he embodies what so many of us frequently feel like - a nice guy just desperate to unleash their inner Jim Carrey - is perhaps The Mask's most impressive spectacle.",10,0,0,29 January 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Rambling and flat....a major let-down in wake of the first two
","I want to establish something: I LOVE the first two 'Pirates' films. They're two of the best, most perfectly executed movies ever made(or at least of this generation). I went into this one with high expectations.......but it really just wasn't that good.It just.... it's like they forgot what made the first two films so special: the tongue-in-cheek, the wit, the charm, the stunts-that-no-one's-ever-done-before. Stuff like the pole vaulting scene, the duel in the barn, the three-way swordfight with the water-wheel and all that.And the plot..... blistering BARNACLES that was nuts! I was one of the few people I know who actually didn't have trouble following the plot of the second one.... but with this one, I just gave up halfway through. It was like they took the script of the 'The Big Lebowski', replaced the characters and sets, added about 20 new plot lines and diversions, and then deliberately put it all together out-of-order.The was almost nothing new, and when there was, it was almost never that interesting, and when it was, I could almost never tell why it was happening and what it meant.So, it disappoints me to say....6/10. And if it hadn't been for Geoffrey Rush, who kicked absolute ass, it would've been a 3 or 4.",4,0,1,25 May 2007
Oblivion," The most amazing, satisfying big sci-fi film since District 9
","I'm a sci-fi fanatic and had already high hopes for this one, so was surprised when it transcended them. It becomes clear early on that this isn't a just another generic action movie looking to make a quick buck, but a film that GIVES A DAMN about itself, its story and atmosphere, its music, everything, and that is all too rare a thing these days. The imagery is iconic and leads to a number of the most beautiful scenes I've seen at the movies in ages.In addition to being a visual triumph, the story blossoms in jawdropping ways. I always try to avoid watching too many ads because they often give away too much, but the way this one unfolded caught me off guard again and again. Cruise does some of his best work ever and the rest of the cast(particularly Olga Kurylenko, who was wasted in the sub-par Quantum Of Solace) match him scene for scene. The beautiful, futuristic M83 score completes the picture.If you're a fan of Moon, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, or video game-wise, Mass Effect, Fallout and believe it or not Bioshock, you'd be very well-advised to check this one out. Not because it's a generic sci-fi film, but because, like those titles, it's anything but.",10,16,27,19 April 2013
Knowing," Completely gripping, daring, moving.... I loved it
","I think the concept of the film Knowing was attractive enough that it would've been worth seeing no matter what, but didn't expect to be as effected by it as I was. This is a powerful, compelling and endlessly suspenseful film that feels like something out of Shyamalan's glory days. The film-makers clearly really cared for the story they were telling and allow it to live up to its initial premise in unexpected ways. It's not just a blockbuster. It's original, and it takes risks, and they pay off.The score was also particularly good, one of the more notable and tangible ones I've seen in recent film. Proyas, Cage, and the writers all did a really good job, and I highly recommend seeing this. 9/10.",9,1,3,8 July 2009
Army of Darkness," Bruce Campbell...need I say more?
","If the title of this comment didn't make you want to see the movie, maybe these will: Zomibies, shotguns, chainsaws, exploding arrows, evil twins, and time travel. Is there anything about this movie that doesn't rock? If you've ever wondered 'Who is this Bruce Campbell guy?', or 'Why isn't Bruce Campbell in every movie?' this is the movie for you. In fact, it's the movie for you no matter what. If you haven't seen it, see it now. If you have seen it, see it again. This movie is so good that a scene in 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' was actually based on a scene from this movie(almost holding a candle near gunpowder). Be sure to watch the special edition DVD version because it has a few extra scenes inserted into the movie and an alternate ending to watch.",9,1,2,24 July 2005
1408," Equally terrifying and moving... a triumph!
","WOW, was this ever good.I was excited for this immediately after seeing the trailer, and after seeing that the reviews lived up to it, I was doubly so.John Cusack, who is alone on screen for about 80% of the film, does a superb job as always. His emotional range is amazing, and at times in the film, it takes him nothing more than a facial expression to drag you right down into the emotional hell his character Michael Enslin is currently trapped in.The scares in the film are absolutely breathtaking, ranging from shocks to carefully built suspense, and the emotional catharises verge on tear-jerking.Back it all up with a very solid supporting performance from Samuel L Jackson, and you've got a true must-see.10/10",10,1,3,29 June 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Best Movie Ever Made
","This is quite simply, the best movie ever made. Accept it. Everything about this movie is perfect. Everything. This is the only movie I've ever seen that I can truly say that about. If you haven't seen this movie, your missing out on the experience of a lifetime. Don't believe me? Will the the fact that it's tied for Most Oscar's Ever convince you? What about the fact that it's the fastest movie ever to gross 1 billion dollars? Sean Astin, Sir Ian McKellan, and EVERYONE else in this movie gives an absolutely phenomenal performance. The special effects are flawless, and even the moments of comic relief are impeccable. If you only see one movie this LIFETIME, make it this one. For the love of all that is good, make it this one.",10,1,3,10 October 2005
