Source Code," A roller-coaster ride on several rollercoasters!
","I have about 20 films that I consider my personal cult library. Source Code is presently at the top of the list. I have viewed this movie over ten times to date and have never failed to be entertained by its content! Believable characters and superb acting by all involved, including the bit-part passengers on the ill-fated commuter train. The concept of Source Code, while fantastic, leaves me wondering what might have happened on 9/11 had this program really existed. Source Code is like a jigsaw puzzle. At first all you have are meaningless pieces until, one by one, they are fitted together to reveal the final picture. Source Code not only completes the picture, but also has it framed and hung on the wall. I thoroughly enjoy the trip it takes me on. My only question about the film is what happened to the essence of Sean, the passenger taken over by the essence of Colter Stevens? Everyone on the train was eventually saved, yet Sean is somehow left in Limbo. I think I smell a sequel in the making. If so, I hope it's as good as this! Imagine two Colter Stevens' out to save the world! Maybe Sean will show up, too! Or maybe they should just let a good thing be left alone.",9,1,3,8 November 2012
