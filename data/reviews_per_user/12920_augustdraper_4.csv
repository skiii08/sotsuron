Blade Runner 2049," A great standalone movie, not what I was looking for
","Don't get me wrong. I did like this movie a lot. However, there were a couple of flaws. Remember this is all my personal opinion, so you don't have to listen to a word I say.One of my main complaints with the movie is how it's a standalone movie. It doesn't feel like a sequel at all. I think this is due to the fact that they made a sequel 30 years later. I had the same problem with the new star wars franchise. The sequel just didn't feel it was in the same universe. Rick Deckard didn't even feel like Rick Deckard. I saw a guy who had the name, but didn't share any of the qualities. He was the factor that connected the two blade runner movies, and he doesn't even come until halfway through the movie. The movie just felt like it was its own thing, which wasn't I wanted to go see. I wanted to see a sequel to the Blade Runner.My other complaint will be a lot less long. The movie was just too long. This movie definitely could have been an hour and 50 minutes, but they had to make it two hours and 40 minutes. Those other fifty minutes were unnecessary. Everyone just walked slow, and the pacing was slow, justin like in 2001 a space odyssey.Otherwise I did love this movie. It just could have been so much more.",7,1,2,13 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," This blew me away!!!
","I rarely ever make movie, but I had to on this one. I remember seeing the trailer for this and saying 'this lowkey looks bad.' Months go by and I start seeing reviews saying 'Best film of 2018' This film is amazing' so on and so on. Then I was like okay, I should go this. I saw yesterday with my film class and I blown away, like I mean blown away. The story was so well written, like certain foreshadowing and elements that came back in the end from the beginning. It was so well done. The relationships between Miles/Uncle Aaron and Miles/His father are super well done. It highlights the complexities of role modeling, which I love. Miles is such an authentic teenager and the way puberty is portrayed is too relatable in this film. Just the overall story was fantastic. The music works super well with the film, which always is something I appreciate. Sometimes, it gave me straight goosebumps for a solid 5 minutes. And let me tell you, the final fight scene!!!!!!! I'm not going to spoil it, but it's something the MCU could never pull off. It's one of the coolest fight scenes I've seen in a long time. Also, not to be political or anything, but this is the only film that I've seen where the friend zone is accepted. It's really a nice refresher of every movie that I have seen that always has the main character fall for the attractive female character. Overall, the entire blew my expectations out of the water. I was not expecting it to be this good.There are only two things that are stopping me from giving this film a 10/10 is the middle part of the film. It kinda got slow for me but the first act and the third act really made up for it so I'm not really complaining. I also didn't like the Peni Parker character because I just found her annoying in like every scene she was in. However, This film is one of the best superheroes I've ever seen. Miles Morales is officially my favorite spider-man.",10,9,18,15 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It's a great movie, but this is in NO WAY a masterpiece
","My actual Rating: 7.6/10I'm feeling so mixed about this movie. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie. However, there was just no plot to this movie. Absolutely none. It's just the everyday life of a struggling actor with no life altering events to give this movie a plot.However, I enjoyed everything else about this movie. I loved the dialogue and it's witty humor. Dicaprio gave an amazing performance (the first time I saw leo as a character rather than an actor playing a character). Pitt's character was my favorite. Margot Robbie definitely did a great job for what little substance her character had. She had 15 lines in the entire movie. I wish there was substance for her. Cinematography was good. Costumes were great in creating the nostalgia. The ending was my favorite part of the movie: true Quentin Tarantino fashion. Everything in this movie was good except for the story.Now you maybe asking why I gave this movie an 7.6 instead of 4 or 6 if I hated the story so much. Well, I was completely entranced by this movie. I was never bored when watching this in the theatre. However, after watching it, I came out of the theatre saying 'What did I just watch?' and not in the best way. Not in a bad way, but not in like the best way. I didn't really know how to process this movie, yet i enjoyed myself when watching it. So i'm honestly just mixed about this movieAnother thing I'm confused about is why are people calling this a 'masterpiece' or saying 'We don't deserve this film.' These are probably the same people who think that the actually great movies of this decade which deserve to be classics are bad movies (sorry for that phrasing, I hope that makes sense). Anyways, in my eyes, this film is an enigma I need to crack because i feel like there's something i'm not getting. I will definitely be watching this again to see if there's something I'm missing.Now coming to the end of this confusing review, should you go this film? yes, I think you go see this film. You either will love this movie, or just be confused by it (just like me)",6,24,40,29 July 2019
Midsommar," One of the most disturbing and beautiful movies i've ever seen
","I thought I knew what to expect going into this movie, based on the trailer. Yet i left the theatre speechless. I... loved this movie, and I barely ever write reviews for movies. The cinematography was incredible and the direction by Ari Aster was great, nothing I would change. I always found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Midsommar only had one jump scare and yet it made me on edge and tense throughout its entirety. This is what good horror movies should do. Jump scares are easy to do, but keeping an audience on the edge of its seat (the people in my theatre were definitely tense throughout this film): that's a feat. That's an achievement. I would definitely say this movie is 100% not for the feint hearted. There are many gory scenes (One almost made throw up) and WTF moments. However there is more to the movie than just the gore. It's a riveting story that is leaving many of us viewers confused, especially during the film's final act. I will be seeing this film again. 10/10 would recommend if you like horror movies!!!",10,30,67,3 July 2019
