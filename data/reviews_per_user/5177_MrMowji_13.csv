The Ring," Just cinematography was OK
","Some points:<ul><li>At the beginning, how did exactly Katie's friend (Becca) know about the video tape? Somebody already found out that he/she needs to make a copy to survive and tell someone else the story?</li></ul><ul><li>When they gonna watch TV, they sit very close to them, and no one wear glasses.</li></ul><ul><li>Two of Katie's friends who watched the tape too, died in a car accident (crashed into a tree). They had TVs on their car? Or was they just running?</li></ul><ul><li>So, Samara can control water, cameras, photos, and TVs (or at least their remotes), open refrigerators, call people and talk or leave a message after the beep, burn things. All of that, when she's a ghost. We must just accept it without any explanation.</li></ul><ul><li>When Rachel is visiting Becca, how did Becca know that Rachel watched the tape? Does Samara control friends of people who watched the tape?</li></ul><ul><li>What was that nose bleeding and taking a fly from TV?</li></ul><ul><li>Typing fast into a local HTML file (from Desktop) and still using the mouse (with slow motion) to click the Search button. Just press Enter.</li></ul><ul><li>How does Samara's father know about the tape?</li></ul><ul><li>Why did Rachel suddenly attract to the horse in the ship? Just leave him alone. You're hurting him.</li></ul><ul><li>'Are you OK?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Seriously, your daughter just died in a horrible way, you just watched a man electrocuted himself in front of you.</li></ul><ul><li>Too much symbolism and not-important events.</li></ul>",1,0,2,23 September 2017
Inglourious Basterds," It should be categorized as comedy!
","Another overrated movie from Tarantino.<ul><li>First chapter was very good. Waltz did his best job, even Ménochet was very good. But we deal with a Jew hunter and he simply lets one (Shosanna) run.</li></ul><ul><li>Second chapter could be good too, but Pitt's accent and his jaw was weird. I'm not American but it felt annoying. Stiglitz's character was not necessary, even for operation Kino because anybody in the cafe or cinema could simply identify him.</li></ul><ul><li>Chapter four. Why did she choose a cafe in a village for the meeting? Isn't there other places, perhaps an apartment, her house?</li></ul><ul><li>Last chapter. Hitler and almost all the important Nazis are in the cinema and we see only two guards. On the other hand, the reason why Hans suddenly changes his mind and character was not convincing. He is an intelligent Nazi and yet he trusts American Basterd Jews just after he told them he killed Hammersmark. He lets Kino to be accomplished and expects Americans to let him live!!! What was he thinking?</li></ul><ul><li>As other reviewer mentioned, long conversations didn't annoy me, especially when Waltz was talking.</li></ul><ul><li>Cinematography was good.</li></ul><ul><li>As stated above, plot didn't make much sense.</li></ul>",5,1,2,22 October 2017
Troy," Bad story!
","I should tell you that I didn't read Homer's Iliad. So I don't know if this movie is really based on his work or not. But I can tell you that this story, or at least this adaptation wasn't good.<ul><li>A prince (Paris, which is used to sleep with lots of women for fun) and his older brother (Hector) go to an once-an-enemy country to make peace, and he sleeps with their queen for at least a week (and no one finds out). Then he steals her without consulting with his brother.</li></ul><ul><li>His older brother is dumber. Hector allows him to take her to Troy. But later we see that Hector tells his father that he doesn't want his people get killed or suffer so that his little dumb brother has his prize. The father has no answer for him. What did you expect idiot?</li></ul><ul><li>Achilles seeks for glory in Troy's war. Didn't he got famous/glory already in previous battles? What do you want man?</li></ul><ul><li>The father is even dumber. 'Father, I stole a queen. Queen of the country that you **** yourself to make peace with. But I love her.' What? 'It's OK son. Keep her. We fight. We fight and get killed. It's OK, really.'</li></ul><ul><li>OK. Greeks reached the shore, but those idiots including Briseis didn't leave the temple. It was close to the shore. Oh, come on!!!</li></ul><ul><li>Achilles had 50 men and it seemed that most of them got killed when they got out of the ship. But later they're still many. And Troyanian soldiers which were much more than 50 couldn't kill them.</li></ul><ul><li>Again, dumb Hector. He sees that Greek ships are reaching the shore and his men are few, but he still walks into Achilles's trap in the temple.</li></ul><ul><li>Achilles just saw Briseis and fell in love with her and she became an important person to him.</li></ul><ul><li>Both Paris and Helen tried to finish the war by themselves separately. Couldn't you see this mess before?</li></ul><ul><li>'You just killed my people. Wash their bloods on your body and make love to me. Oops, I wasn't supposed to do that! I was a temple girl. Not anymore.'</li></ul><ul><li>After 12 days Greeks left a giant wooden horse, and Troyanians take it as a gift to the Poseidon so that Greeks would have a safe trip to home. What a nice people! Even if it wasn't a trap, who does that? 'We leave you our dirty clothes. Please wash them. We will come back for them at 3:00. Peace.'</li></ul><ul><li>Both king of Troy and Achilles got killed when they brought their swords up and no one was in front of them to kill. What a cliché.</li></ul><ul><li>I don't know if the word 'Code' was used those days, but it was strange to hear that in this movie.</li></ul>Overall, the movie is filled with a bunch of fool characters and lots of 'Why?'s.",2,2,3,28 September 2017
The Hateful Eight," Another overrated movie from another overrated Hollywood director
","Hollywood is filled with overrated directors and actors. They do the same thing over and over again and still gets praised. To mention some, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and here, Tarantino. If you saw at least three of his movies you easily understand that he's the master of dialogues and bloody scenes, and that's it. His works don't have story as you expect. They're just filled with gun shots, bloods and long conversations. Pulp Fiction, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds , and this title follow this rule. Django was somehow different. It had a story, even though it was not good and had lots of holes. I'm wondering whether Tarantino is going to make any different work, for example gun shots in Mars! We know that there will be gunshots, we know who will play in it somehow, we really don't need to know the plot because there isn't, but we know that there is lots of conversations.The Hateful Eight isn't anything else. It's about 170 minutes; too much. Its story isn't novel. It doesn't have brilliance. I don't know if actors really have those accents or they were just pretending, but it was annoying. At some points I felt they're playing in a theater or a studio. There are characters that are not necessary and don't add anything to the plot.I enjoyed Samuel Jackson, cinematography and blood scenes as usual. Some conversations wasn't that annoying. I find it better than Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. I couldn't enlist it in my Worst/Best lists. But it's in my Overrated list. You can watch and enjoy it. But it's not a masterpiece. It will be forgotten easily.",5,8,14,28 October 2017
No Country for Old Men," Overrated!
","This was the third movie from Cohen brothers I watched. First two were The Big Lebowski and True Grit. I find all of them overrated. This one was the worst because it tried to be different and deliver some sort of a not-important message which has failed to do so.<ul><li>Loved the cinematography.</li></ul><ul><li>Depiction was good, even though the plot wasn't.</li></ul><ul><li>Some say that Javier Bardem (Chigurh) put so much into this role. But I think this must be the easiest part he ever played. Just needs to stay still with no emotions oh his face. He got an Oscar!</li></ul><ul><li>OK. At the first scene Chigurh is arrested (we don't know the reason), and yet, the officer turns his back to Chigurh while talking on the phone leading to his murder.</li></ul><ul><li>Then we meet Llewelyn Moss. He accidentally finds some cars and dead bodies of drug dealers in the desert. He concludes that one of those drug dealers must be alive and took the money. So he tracks him and finds his dead body. Then he finds a case full of money. There is some problems with this behavior. We don't know him well. Why did he do that? Why didn't he call the police? Is that just because he is poor? How did he know that one man is alive, close, wounded and ran on his feet? What was his plan if he was not wounded?</li></ul><ul><li>When Llewelyn goes to bed that night, suddenly feels guilty about that poor dying drug dealer who wanted some water and must be dead by now!!! He decides to go back in dark and give him some water instead of calling cops anonymously; cops can give him water too. The rest of the story goes on because of this stupid decision, that's why this movie makes no much sense. That's not good. I even couldn't figure out his personality at all.</li></ul><ul><li>At the drug dealing location, some (perhaps Mexican) guys on a truck find that somebody is there and follow him. But they can't kill him. The truck can't reach him and it has lights.</li></ul><ul><li>Stupid Llewelyn again. He sends his wife to her mother's but he stays. We don't see any plan that he's going to follow. He just stays. For what? We don't know. Why didn't he go to another city or country? It gets worse. Trust me.</li></ul><ul><li>He hides the case in the vent. Goes out to shop. He comes back and finds out that some (perhaps Mexican) guys might be in his room. So he decides to come back later with some tools to pull that case out from back room. It seems that characters of this movie are deaf. No one hears him trying to pull that case. No one hears shooting in room 137. Later we see shooting in the street.</li></ul><ul><li>That run-chase scene when Chigurh finds Llewelyn! Chigurh uses two bullets on the driver, then decides to shoot Llewelyn. And he doesn't shoot the tires. Llewelyn can't control the truck when turning. Why? Both his hand were fine.</li></ul><ul><li>The story could be better with less characters and less conversations.</li></ul><ul><li>Wife's character (Carla Jean Moss) is the most annoying role in this movie. She just cooperates with anything and anyone.</li></ul><ul><li>At the end I didn't understand any of those characters, why they acted like that and why they say those things.</li></ul><ul><li>It should be titled like 'No Country for Police Men'. They're dumb here. No achievement in anything.</li></ul>",2,4,9,26 October 2017
Room," Bye Plant. Bye Wardrobe. Bye Reasonable Ratings.
","<ul><li>There was no need to tell the kid that everything outside the room is not real or all the things they get is by magic.</li></ul><ul><li>Her parents taught her to be nice, but didn't taught her to not trust strangers. A man kidnapped a 17 years old girl by asking for help about his sick dog!!! And she bought that. Writers, please, be more convincing.</li></ul><ul><li>The kid's character was somehow annoying. And he was talking like a thinker! But the actor played well.</li></ul><ul><li>When a Hollywood movie wants to demonstrate a drama, all the other things are at their best. For example, they got kidnapped, but the kid has good hair and skin and Ma's family are wealthy and in good shapes, so that there will be no more drama. As another example, watch The Fault in Our Stars.</li></ul><ul><li>There's a skylight. She has a knife. Old Nick sometimes sleeps in her bed. Why didn't she kill him and try to escape from that skylight or to destruct the walls with something at worst? There were lots of stuff including a wardrobe that she could use to climb. Even if there was no knife, she could use other stuffs. She says that she tried this before, but with not a good plan. Why not try again? There were not much to do except thinking. Even he could have a phone on himself. See, ideas are coming...</li></ul><ul><li>Eventually she ends up with a plan and without any training she decides to operate the mission at the same night!!!</li></ul><ul><li>So, Old Nick is a fool!!!</li></ul><ul><li>The man the kid ran into for help didn't even make Old Nick stop. He just let him go. At least write down the truck's plate number, please.</li></ul><ul><li>When they go to the hospital after finding the Ma, the Grandmother's reaction was funny. No sign of happiness, shock or anything related. Even the whole family's reaction at first night was weird. Their just eating their lunch.</li></ul><ul><li>It was slow and long with not necessary characters or events.</li></ul><ul><li>After Ma is found, movie goes into a boring predictable phase.</li></ul><ul><li>The idea was good, but the whole product didn't convince me that a young girl and her child would react to the events like this.</li></ul>",4,5,9,27 September 2017
Mulholland Drive," Who does that?!
","So, for David Lynch's movies we need a manual book too? The director has provided some hints or clues for the viewer. What?!! Who does that? This means that he did a terrible job, so he thought 'it's better to give people some hints otherwise they might not understand'!!! It's like having some guy on your next seat and he tells you where to pay more attention to, or to remember 'that pillow' for future. Seriously, Mr Lynch, don't do this. When you can't show what's in your mind by movies, try writing a book.Some reviewers state that we need to watch MD more than once. This means that the product didn't get the job done. It's filled with so many details and scenes that you need to watch the whole movie again to remember them. Why should we do that? It's 2 hours and 27 minutes.You might be tempted to watch it again (by getting help from reviews or the director's hints) to relief your mind. But I simply decided to ignore it.",1,3,11,26 September 2017
The Dark Knight," Nolan is overrated!
","Sure. Cinematography is great. Joker is great. He made this movie tolerable. Maybe that's the problem with the sequel; Dark Knight Rises with Bane. I actually didn't love none of Nolan's Batman movies as a whole.My main problem with TDK is its plot holes. TDK has lots of plot holes and mistakes. We see them from the first scene. Robbing the bank at the beginning was very stupid. No one notices them. They broke a window, moved to the other building's roof by wire, walked into the bank with masks and guns, went through the wall with school bus and went back to the street, and no one bothers to suspect. Don't get me started with the bank manager. How stupid was this scene! There are other plot holes and problems with this movie, believe me. Just google them. I just wanted to tell how this movie gets started, and a writer who doesn't put much effort on the beginning will fail through the end.And again, it's long.5/10 for cinematography, some lines and shots, and the Joker, specially his head out of the police car window (I can't forget this one).",5,0,1,29 October 2017
Life Is Beautiful," People should update their ratings!
","I saw this movie about 15 years ago and I rated this movie when I signed up in IMDb 7 years ago. Today I watched it again and I'm telling you, I immediately updated my rating. Same thing happened when I watched Hitchcock's Rear Window again.First 50 minutes of the movie was neither funny nor dramatic. The rest had a few such moments. Maybe it's considered a classic movie that every movie geek must watch. Maybe it was good those days. I didn't like it as a 8.6. I don't know how this got #25 in IMDb.I give it a 3 for its main idea and some scenes that I think will always be new. I put it in my Worst-Movies list. Because I don't want other people to waste their time.",3,5,12,30 September 2017
Pulp Fiction," One of the worsts!
","Seriously, what was people thinking? 8.9 and 7th movie in IMDb's top 250? I saw this movie long time ago when IMDb ratings was everything to me. Now, I just check reviews, and not just the first page, because at the time of writing, first page of reviews for movies that I see overrated are strangely filled with praises.<ul><li>First of all, there is no story, or if you call it a story, it isn't an interesting one.</li></ul><ul><li>Filled with long unnecessary conversations that made it 150 minutes. You can easily get bored.</li></ul><ul><li>Deciding how to clean a bloody car takes 15 minutes of this movie. And it's very cliché. Three men can't decide how to clean a car and need a specialist (Wolf) which when we see him and listen to his words, he isn't one; he's normal.</li></ul><ul><li>Butch goes back to his house to pick his watch. Then he decides to eat some toast. What was that?</li></ul><ul><li>Tarantino's acting was awful.</li></ul><ul><li>Many unnecessary characters; Raquel, the taxi driver, Wolf, Gimp, Trudi, even Tarantino's role.</li></ul><ul><li>We can drop Mia's story (about 40 minutes) and we're still good to go.</li></ul><ul><li>He tried to intertwine 4 stories, but they were ordinary. There is nothing to think, nothing to note, nothing to follow.</li></ul><ul><li>Zed's part!!!</li></ul>Please try some 'foreign language' movies, and read at least 5 pages of reviews before going to watch a title.",1,4,15,20 October 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It's about magic!
","Maybe the first problem with this kind of movies is their subject; MAGIC. We cannot argue about any aspects of it, because it's magic; anything is possible, we must shut our mouths and sit like a good kid and watch it without any digestion. And that's where the problem grows. We see lots of possible things without any background or history and yet we see some normal things that they cannot do, for example they have this cloak to hide but this could be unnecessary. Why couldn't they just hide themselves with that sticks? Oh, they're not able to do that!!!The story isn't good at all. Believe me. If you love yourself don't watch it. Don't go through the series at all, seriously. Even if this was supposed to have some philosophical meanings, the magics stacked in this series don't allow the viewer to grasp them. It isn't like Lord of the Rings. No messages I could get, no meaning as others state.Acting was awful, maybe not as bad as Twilight's actors, but it was still very bad. Funny moments wasn't funny at all. No drama. No nothing. Couldn't care about any of the characters. It's really a family movie as categorized. It has the story to make a movie colorful.Worst thing about it: Harry Potter takes 8 episodes to finish. What was the writer drinking? It could be done in 180 minutes at most. Lots (and I mean lots) of unnecessary characters and subplots. I think the writer got bored herself and decided to end writing, because if you see all 8 episodes you can see that the story is flexible and can be easily stretched out as the writer did. Any teenager can do it.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.",1,4,12,28 October 2017
Rear Window," Really?!
","<ul><li>First of all, we don't know how Lisa fell in love with Jeff in the first place. They don't match. However we see that about 30 minutes, movie tries to develop some characters. It seems that Lisa and Stella exists in the script just to make it work.</li></ul><ul><li>Doors are just open for public, even after Thorwald found out that Jeff is watching his apartment.</li></ul><ul><li>Lots of unnecessary characters/windows that didn't add anything to the plot. It could be done in an hour.</li></ul><ul><li>What was Thorwald's motivation? Even if he is a psycho and does this for fun, you must show that. No clue for this.</li></ul><ul><li>Thorwald does almost all his works with windows open.</li></ul><ul><li>Why would Thorwald bury something important in his flowerbed? And why would he take that thing to his apartment after killing the dog? Get rid of it already.</li></ul><ul><li>They saw a ring and conclude that he killed his wife. He's a salesman. He could simply get the ring to sell.</li></ul><ul><li>Thorwald walks toward Jeff's apartment like slow motion!!! And Jeff makes his speed even slower with those lights!!! What?</li></ul><ul><li>At the end nobody sues Jeff for watching them through the window. Everyone is happy and windows are all open.</li></ul>Overall, Thorwald is an idiot. This movie is about an idiot murderer. I don't know why people made this movie or Hitchcock that big.",1,16,28,30 September 2017
Her," It's a drama, but you can't sympathize!
","Most of my reviews are good for people who already watched the respective movie. So if you're one of them and find this review useful please vote.Her is another overrated movie from Hollywood. Here is why:<ul><li>The OS was programmed to act like a humankind. We see that she can feel and define new feelings like anger and do some tasks on her own. So she can easily format the hard drive if you pi** her off. The idea of such OS is not logical. Maybe with some restrictions it'd be OK. But the script of this movie needs her to be unrestricted.</li></ul><ul><li>The whole idea is not brilliant or new. Perhaps people who have watched other AI movies could come up with such an idea.</li></ul><ul><li>It wasn't convincing that he could fall in love with her.</li></ul><ul><li>I couldn't sympathize with any of characters. Even the music didn't help.</li></ul><ul><li>Softwares in this movie (OS and that game) are very intelligent. They can have a nice (or dirty) conversation in a fluent natural language and do tasks. Yet we see that people are working and happy. At least for a job like writing romantic letters, the manager could use some AI and fire all his/her staffs.</li></ul>",1,2,8,21 October 2017
