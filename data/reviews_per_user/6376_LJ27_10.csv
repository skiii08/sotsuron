The Blair Witch Project," Let's hope nobody tries to copy it
","Had I never heard of it before I saw it I might've thought of it as some brilliant piece of work but after the hype, all I could see were the flaws. Best part is the short running time (80 minutes).  It pushed the limits of my attention span at that length but anymore and I'd have been snoozing. It's not a bad film but it probably won't hold up to repeat viewings.  The shakey camera work and home-made style gets old fast and I found myself checking my watch.  When things get going at the end, they had my undivided attention but then it just stops and leaves you feeling you never really saw a whole movie.  This movie cost almost nothing to make and made a fortune so I fear there will be many films made in this style - but we can hope not.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's all true
","I heard that Jar Jar's voice would drive me to distraction but didn't believe it.  Unfortunately, it's true.  I heard the effects were excellent. That's true too.  So much happens that it's hard to keep up with it all and I'd love to see it again but I just can't stomach that Jar Jar guy's voice. I really liked Darth Maul, as did everyone else I talked to.  Why do we get so much of Jar Jar who everyone hates and so little of Darth Maul who everyone likes?  Go figure.  Without Jar Jar, I'd have probably seen this movie several times by now so I think Lucas is hurting his films with his fanatical desire to keep the outer space equivalent to Gilligan in the series.  In the sea monster sequence, Jar Jar distracts you from the coolest sea monsters ever put on the screen.  I'll wait till this is on video to watch it again so I can at least turn off the volume.  I keep hoping Lucas will do a 'special edition' with Jar Jar digitally painted out of the film and his voice stripped off the soundtrack.",Null,0,1,23 August 1999
The Ring," Enjoyable, scary little film
","Most American remakes of films that originated elsewhere are inferior to theoriginals (THE VANISHING being one example).  I went into this film notexpecting to like it but I found that it had won me over by the end.  First of all, the film sustains a creepy atmosphere for the entire duration of it's running time. The cinematography is some of the gloomiest I have ever seen.  You feel thatthe characters are in danger pretty much every minute because of the excellent lensing.  I won't be able to say much else about the film for fear of givingsomething away but if you want to see a well-made, scary little film thisHalloween, look no further than this American remake of THE RING.  I reallyenjoyed it a lot and the pacing of the film is very good considering how thick the plot is.",Null,0,0,29 October 2002
World War Z," Zombie Movie for people who hate zombie movies
","Might Contain Spoilers* Brad Pitt needed a blockbuster. I guess that's why he optioned WORLD WAR Z and then proceeded to make a movie that used only the title of the popular Max Brooks book. The problem with this movie is that it is neither fish nor fowl. It's not really an adaptation of the novel because other than the title, it has little to do with the book. It's not really a zombie movie, at least not one that fans of zombie movies would like. Not sure what drew Pitt and company to the material since it would seem that Pitt cares nothing for zombie movies. I doubt he and Jolie sit around watching things like NIGHTMARE CITY or THE GATES OF HELL. He probably read or heard that zombie movies do well at the box office and probably needs a hit to be able to adopt more kids so he bought the rights to the book thinking it would provide the framework for a hit. It's a best seller and it's about zombies, right? Okay, so start counting the cash that will come in. However, he probably didn't know enough about zombie movies to know that part of the reason why they are profitable is because they are cheap to make. Most of the better zombie movies feature slow-moving zombies and what makes them scary is that while you can outrun them, eventually you will tire but they will keep on going unless you can find a way to stop them but how do you kill what is already dead? Most zombie movies are usually gory too. Seems to go with the territory as much as sex goes with porno movies. However, Paramount spilled anywhere from $170 million-$200 million on this movie and yet, couldn't put any blood or gore into it. With that budget, you could hire every make-up effects artist in Hollywood and have lots of blood and make-up effects but they didn't do that. Instead they hired the guy from TRANSFORMERS effects, Scott Farrar, and had him come up with ridiculously sped-up zombies that are laughably fast. The effect is less sinister than it is just plain silly. Hopefully Brad will learn his lesson and stick with other genres of films than horror. It's just not his bag. He's a good actor and all but he doesn't seem to even like zombie movies but he has succeeded in making the perfect zombie movie for people who hate zombie movies. If you actually like zombie movies, then go rent NIGHTMARE CITY instead of watching this. It's a better movie about the same subject.",1,28,59,22 June 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," I enjoyed it
","I went in thinking it would be pretty bad...I mean this is the same guy who directed STARGATE and GODZILLA, but was pleasantly surprised to find an enjoyable film that moved along at a decent pace.  This movie has an epic sweeping feel to it that is rare in movies these days.  Most of these digital films really look cheap in a lot of ways but not this one. The effects are so well done that you don't get pulled out of the story as easily.  Also, the sets look huge.  The score is one of the better ones I have heard lately and the characters are also likeable.  One thing about this movie, it LOOKS like it cost a lot of money to make. There are some shots that are simply awe-inspiring.  They really grab you and generate a true sense of wonder.   The money spent is definitely on the screen.  The cinematography is also excellent with wonderfully moody lighting in places.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS
My only problem with the film is that if you have seen the trailers, you have already seen a lot of the effects but there are details on the big screen you just dont see on TV.  Also, the effects seem like ILMs Master Thesis.  You have a much better tidal wave sequence than in DEEP IMPACT and a much better tornado sequence than anything in TWISTER. There is a scene where three helicopters are flying and it is about the only thing in the movie that really looks fake.  I was really glad I saw this movie in the theater.  It is definitely a movie that is more effective on the big screen.",Null,0,0,29 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Where good special effects and bad acting meet
","Like most people, I hated Jar Jar and the good thing about this film is that there is much less of him in the movie.  Special Effects are pretty cool and might even earn this an oscar.  Except for Christopher Lee, most all of the acting is on the level of a high school play.  Watching Back Street Boys - esque AnakinSkywalker emote is almost painful and what's up with that hair?  It's hard to believe that the bad guy that seemed so cool in STAR WARS and THE EMPIRESTRIKES BACK started out as such a goofwad.  Natalie Portman is still actingstiffer than a corpse for most of the film.  Supposedly she is some great actress but you'll never know it by watching this film or PHANTOM MENACE.  The CGIeffects are impressive even if John Williams only recycled most of the material from other scores he has written except for the love theme.  Actually, Samuel L. Jackson is pretty good too but he's just playing the same old tough Samuel L. Jackson you see in any other movie he's in.  The action scenes are very goodand keep you leaning forward in your seat.  This film is a big improvement over PHANTOM MENACE in a lot of ways.  As for the much-hyped High Definitionshooting, I could not tell any difference between it and film so Lucas may be on to something.  He probably saved a couple of million bucks on film stock. Maybe he can use the money he saved to hire actors who know how to act or adirector who knows how to get good performances from the actors.",Null,0,0,30 October 2002
The Mummy Returns," Makes the first one look good...
","I didn't expect much from this film but I have to say that it performs the service of making the first film look like CITIZEN KANE by comparison. Sure, the dog-critters in the beginning are cool but we have no idea where they came from or why they are here.  The Rock, for all of the publicity surrounding his appearance is on the screen for maybe 5 minutes maximum. The mummy himself seems to be something of a supporting player behind Branden, his wife and kid and brother-in-law and even the pilot.  The movie can't seem to decide what it wants to be about so it is about the 'Scorpion King', the Mummy and some midget pigmy creatures that appear to be refugees from a bad video game.  I've read where people have gushed over Alan Silvestri's score and claim it's better than Jerry Goldsmith's score for the original film.  Goldsmith's score for the first film was magnificent and even better when compared to Silvestri's.  Not to say Silvestri cannot write a great score - he can and has done so with his scores for PREDATOR and CONTACT but the score for MUMMY RETURNS is far from being his best work. Funny thing that even though the scenes taking place in London were filmed in London, they don't look like it.  They look like they were filmed on a set in Burbank and could have been making you wonder why they went to the trouble to film in London.  The thin storyline could barely support the first movie.  It sure can't support two movies and although they are filming SCORPION KING as I write this, that is an idea that's already D.O.A. Universal Pictures needs to realize this series of films has already run it's course and do the all CGI FRANKENSTEIN film they shelved last year instead.",Null,0,0,25 May 2001
War of the Worlds," Best Movie I Have Seen This Year
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: I read the H.G. Wells book as a kid and saw the George Pal movie a few years later and was familiar with Orson Welles' radio play. However, for me, no one has ever REALLY made WAR OF THE WORLDS. One of the biggest things missing was the tripods. Those cool walking machines are on the cover of almost every edition of the book that can be found and I wanted to see a faithful adaptation of this wonderful book. When I read that Cruise and Spielberg were making this film, I was kind of dreading it but when I heard Dennis Muren, one of the greatest effects men in the history of cinema was on board, I felt a lot better. I knew Spielberg was doing a modern update so I felt it might stray from the book too much but I was amazed to find this movie is remarkably faithful to the source novel, including the ending so if you do not like how the book ends, don't expect to like the movie's ending either. For the fans, Spielberg includes nods to the original 1953 film (look for Gene Barry and Ann Robinson in clever cameos) and some scenes are almost straight out of the original and one great line spoken by Les Tremaine from the '53 version is said by a news reporter in this one. If you are familiar with both films, you'll know what I am talking about. This film is dark and scary in tone and closer to SIGNS than INDEPENDENCE DAY. Spielberg shows once more that he is a master of suspense and dread. Cruise is at the top of his game here. He is totally convincing as the struggling father trying to keep himself and his family together in crisis. He is no hero...just a regular guy facing a deadly test of his will to live and carry on. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and some beautiful scenes suddenly turn into scenes of horror, such as the one where Dakota Fanning approaches a beautiful river in the morning. Spielberg's editing turns it into one of the most horrifying scenes in the movie. Tim Robbins is also excellent playing a character from the book, who is a little warped but likable at the same time. All the acting is excellent - there is not a bad performance in the bunch. Score by John Williams is also good and the special effects alone are worth the price of admission. Dennis Muren and ILM deliver the goods here and their work blows away even STAR WARS: EPISODE III. I fully expect them to get an Oscar or at least a nomination for their work. The tripods themselves are beautifully designed and completely menacing. The scene where they first appear will someday be remembered as one of the classic suspense and horror moments in cinema. They make a sound that fills you with dread to hear it and you really feel what the characters are feeling. The only weakness is the red weed. It's a nice addition from the book but it isn't explained so it leaves audiences wondering why it is there. Still, that's a minor gripe and I was so impressed that I saw the movie twice in one day and will be going back again. I highly recommend it. Spielberg and Cruise made this film better than I ever expected they could have. Everyone involved with making this film should be proud.",10,1,5,2 July 2005
Godzilla," The Godzilla movie for people who hate Godzilla movies
","So, I watched the trailer for this and saw a lot of destruction scenes, several of which are not in the movie, a few scenes of Godzilla, several of which are not in the movie and the guy from the show, BREAKING BAD, and I think almost all his scenes are in the trailer. He's barely in the movie. There is another 'actor,' who plays the lead when the guy you thought was the lead suddenly stops being in the movie. There are some monsters in the movie but they aren't the ones you expect, especially when you paid to see a movie called, GODZILLA. Even when the main attraction finally shows up, he's mostly confined to reflections in windows and on
TV monitors. If you enjoyed the movie, THE VILLAGE, after seeing the trailer for it, you will love this version of GODZILLA. If you really just pretty much hate Godzilla movies, then this is the movie you've been waiting for, because you won't have to worry about seeing him
much. The director cuts away to
something far less interesting anytime you think you're about to see him. If you could give the same crew and budget to director, Ed Wood, of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE fame, I bet even he probably could have made something more entertaining than this endurance test, that costs the price of a movie ticket. I still don't see how they messed this movie up so bad, but the problem started when they promised the audience things they didn't deliver...such as a giant radioactive lizard monster.",1,2,2,6 June 2019
Thirteen Days," ...seems like how long I sat there watching this.
","THIRTEEN DAYS.  Highly appropriate title for a movie that seems to go on for 13 days or more it's so boring.  Kevin Costner gives probably the worst fake accent in motion picture history.  I cannot believe so awful an actor can keep getting jobs in movies.  He just gets worse with age.  I have decided to quit going to see any movie he has anything to do with because everything he does now is garbage and if it isn't garbage already then he makes it garbage.  He used to be good in films like UNTOUCHABLES and BULL DURHAM. What happened?  THIRTEEN DAYS is a long-winded, talky movie and there's no real suspense since we all know what happened anyway.  I fell asleep while watching it in the theater - no lie.  Avoid it at all costs unless you suffer from insomnia.",Null,0,1,25 May 2001
