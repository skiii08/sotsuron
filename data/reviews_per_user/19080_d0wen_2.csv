The Expendables 2," Actually much better than the first + very enjoyable!
","I disagree with some people feeling that this film was no better than the first. It is easily better than the first, which is a very hard thing to do (normally). I thought the first movie wasn't brill but it was OK, it was kind of what I expected but I did expect a bit more in the fight scenes and I felt that Jet Lei just like the story wasn't up to much. Everything Stallone is doing here is a great idea and it has a great feel to it. Expendables 2 has finally got to where the first one should've been. This one is far more enjoyable, the action / fight scenes are better, which is mainly why we watch these sorts of films, but also the characters and their relationships with each other are better. Some of the scenes are pure genius. Some of the scenes are not but hey ho. I am really looking forward to a 3rd instalment but I do feel that they will take it too far and end up with some of the most annoying and worst ones appearing like Steven Seagal and Vin Deisel... I hope not! If they do then they might as well go the whole hog and get the Heather Small bird from M People on there to just totally annoy us all!! Expendables 2... Anyone who is between the age of 30 and 60 that remembers the best 80's action flicks with the likes of Arnie, Stallone, Bruce Willis, van damme in will know that these films didn't ever really have great acting in, it was all about the action and the fight scenes. Expendables 2 has got it going on! Really enjoyable film.",8,2,2,23 October 2012
Joker," Jokers Origin - a very good origin story.
","For those that aren't aware ... this is not a big comic book action film CGI fest... enjoy the story you are being told, the emotions are there.
As a stand alone film, it's brilliant, for those that want references to you know who, it's has slim pickings and that's how it should be, this story is not about him. I did want a little more madness in regards to Joker kicking off but I think that's because of the hype the fainthearted have created. I've read people feeling uncomfortable and it's so violent. I think there's two moments of violence, that were acted out very well. You get pulled in, waiting to see where the story will take you.
It's a very good portrayal as origin for the Joker, great acting and story line. You can end up with a number of interpretations to this movie. If you already know background and interpretations of Jokers origin, be it comics, animated, big screen previous, you will enjoy this for sure.",9,1,1,9 October 2019
