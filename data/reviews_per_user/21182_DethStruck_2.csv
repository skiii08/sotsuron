Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cool, sad, cool, sort of dumb
","I loved the movie. It really got me going. I saw the first one when I was about 6. Qui Gon and Obi Wan were very cool as characters. Amidala was good, very noble air. Darth Maul was very evil looking but underplayed. Anakin was good and childlike, I feel sorry for him because I know what his future holds. The Senator/Emperor is a slimy no good...You get the idea. The saber duel was great with Maul pacing and Qui resting. It was a classic scene that helped make the movie. Jar-Jar was sort of lame. Not as bad as I was lead to believe but his voice was annoying and the animation wasn't that good. My view: See it, it was good.",7,0,0,5 August 1999
Event Horizon," Horror/SF and very, very cool.
",I noticed a lot of people gave the movie a bad rap. I loved it. For a movie to give me the creeps it has to be scary. The suspense was non-stop and the acting was fine. And for being original: Find me one idea that is. Everybody borrows ideas from other sources. Scream was so unscary it wasn't funny. It had a good plot twist but nothing else. Aliens is an action film with big bugs in it. I don't like the Hellraiser movies really and some of them outright sucked. My girlfriend cried because the movie scared her so bad. I felt bad but loved the movie.,9,0,1,30 July 1999
