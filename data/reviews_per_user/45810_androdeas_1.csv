Blade Runner 2049," Full Immersion, No Prequel Needed
","Let me preface this by saying I did not like the original Blade Runner from 1982 nor am I a fan of Philip K Dick so naturally I did not read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Which also means this movie rated high on my list. If you did like the original your opinion will not line up with mine.I am in love with this world that has been re imagined in Blade Runner 2049. The opening scene alone with solar farms, flying cars and growing maggots for protein. The future doesn't seem that far away. It looks plausible.Yes, the movie does run a bit long. The pace is slow enough that you can enjoy seeing the sights. And yes, there are some scenes--especially the last part with Harrison Ford and snowflake--that are utterly unnecessary but the entire film is beautiful.The interplay with memories was excellent. Ryan Gosling fit his role very well. For a first time watch most of the plot twists are surprising but could be made stronger with the removal of a few scenes. Settings are wonderful. The grating 80's feel of the original is made subtle. The technology is my favorite part. I want to be a memory maker in the future!",8,5,13,7 October 2017
