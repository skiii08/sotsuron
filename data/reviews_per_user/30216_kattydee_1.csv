The Hangover," Lite little romp
","This movie will be one to watch while recovering from a hangover. It doesn't require you to think about anything, you'll get a few little laughs from it, and it's mildly entertaining. The actors do a decent job with the outlandish circumstances. There is such a huge truth to it... when men go away for a guys weekend, they behave like adolescents on steroids. Had some of the preceding evenings incidents been plausible, the movie would have scored higher with me. As it was, it was very clich√© and very predictable, but still generated a few laughs. Wait for this one to come out on television and don't spend any money to watch it.",4,0,0,29 November 2009
