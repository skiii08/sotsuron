Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat - One of the best experience this far.
","What a Marvellous film! I was laughing almost the whole film through, laughter after another I was suffocating in the cinema. 'Man, this is a great film'. The clashes between this fictional character and the American people is astonishing, we makes a well job in pretending to be a journalist from Kazakhstan in his journey in the 'US and A'.I recommend this film strongly; this film is one of the utter most original and brilliant films ever made.The 'Hotel scene' is a bit to outraging, but It doesn't take the films 10stars point down a bit, but well, if there wasn't this scene would it then still be Borat ?Well, if you have a ticket to the movies, this is the right film to see, Borat, 'You like' !",10,3,18,11 November 2006
