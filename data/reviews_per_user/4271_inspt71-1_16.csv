Alien 3," A Good Third Sequel.
",This movie is good for the most part. It is slower than the other two but it has enough to keep you interested. I was more impressed with technical accomplishments on this film such as Alex Thomson's cinematography and Elliot Goldenthal's music and good film editing by Terry Rawlings. Sigorney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley for the third time and does it great. Charles S. Dutton is the best supporting character if there is any at all. As I said before this movie moves at a slower pace but it's not bad. I give this movie three out of four stars and I would certainly recommend that any fan of the Sci-Fi movies should check this one out.,Null,0,4,30 March 2004
Spartacus," Kirk Douglas at his best!
","I thought this was a great epic movie. It is certainly one of my favorites. All of the actors did a great job. Laurence Olivier certainly makes you hate him in this movie. Russell Metty's great cinematography along with Alex North's dramatic music score make this a great movie. This movie shows that Stanley Kubrick is one of the great directors of all time and knows his stuff. My only question is, why wasn't this movie at least nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards? I think that was a mistake. This is a great one and is in my opinion an older version of 'Brave Heart.'",Null,2,4,25 March 2004
Chinatown," One of the top ten best movies ever made!
","Chinatown is a classic film that you could watch over and over again and never get tired of it. Jack Nicholson plays Private Investigator J.J. Gittes, who get's involved with Evelyn Mulwray (wonderfully played by Faye Dunaway) in trying to find out who's behind her husband's death. This film has a mix of humor, suspense and romance which make a movie great. One of Gittes' associates is played by Bruce Glover who played a killer in the James Bond film 'Diamonds are Forever' in 1971. One of the other things that makes this film great is an unforgettable music score by Jerry Goldsmith who should have won the Oscar in 74 for this score. But he lost to Nino Rota for the Godfather Part II. If you haven't seen this film yet, watch it. You won't be disappointed. **** out of ****.",10,2,4,2 December 2004
Alien," A good Thriller.
","This movie is a good Thriller and a great start to a great trilogy, until Alien Ressurection anyway. This movie is great, it's Oscar winning special effects are great and the characters are great as well. Signorney Weaver is excellent for her role and Tom Skeritt makes a good team leader. Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Katto are funny at times and bring some laughs early in the movie. The Alien design by H.R. Giger is great and would certainly scare me if it snuck up on me in an airduct. If there is one thing about this that I didn't like, was the scene where the Nostromo blows up. It looks like a planet is exploding. I thought that they would change this in the Director's Edition but that didn't change the movie any. This is a good movie to show on Halloween night and scare you. Watch this and get scared!",Null,0,1,30 March 2004
Taxi Driver," Typical Scorsese Movie.
","*Possible Spoilers*
       Bernard Herrman's music score was the only thing that interested me in this so called classic movie. The rest of it was a bunch of nothing. Robert De Niro and Jodi Foster are good as they usually are. This film had no plot and if it did, it wasn't very good or believable. Robert De Niro's character was a first class idiot who one second was asking out Betsy and later trying to kill someone. The only live part in this movie was the shoot out at the end.  Other than that, this movie is a waste of time and a great music score by a great composer and two greatactors.",Null,0,1,1 May 2004
Aliens," Excellent Sequel! Possibly better than the first.
","This is a movie that is certainly worth your while. I thought it was better than the first movie but both of them are different. This movie is more of an Action/Thriller. The first Alien is Scarier. This movie is packed with action, memorable quotes and unforgettable characters. Bill Paxton has a great impact on the movie, having comments about everything. Signorney Weaver reprising her role Ripley and receiving an Oscar Nomination for Best Actress (Very unusual for a movie of this Genre) James Horner's music is also great and also receiving an Oscar Nomination for Best Music. I can't say enough about this movie. If you're looking for Sci-Fi excentment, this is it.",Null,0,0,30 March 2004
Die Hard 2," Underrated Sequel!
","Die Hard 2 is every bit of fun as the first. The plot may be familiar to the first but it takes place at an Airport in Washington D.C. not at a 40 story building. This film is entertaining, the three characters that return are McClane and his wife Holly and Reginal Vel Johnson. The action is great and it never lets up. Fred Dalton Thompson is the Airport Manager under a lot of pressure and then there's Dennis Franz who seems to say one cuss word after another. The only cast member who I thought was miscast was John Amos even though he did a great job. Amos was more of a comic actor who was in 'Coming to America' and appeared in an episode of 'The Cosby Show.' After seeing him in those, I had a hard time seeing him as a bad ass turncoat villain. His role should have been given to Bill Duke from the 'Predator'. That didn't stop this movie from being good. **** out of ****",Null,0,3,22 August 2004
Independence Day," One of the Sci-Fi greats!
","I thought this was one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made. It had a great cast, a good script, good special effects and good humor throughout the movie. When this movie first hit the theaters, I had my doubts. When I went to go see it, I loved it. Will Smith is good, as he usually is. Bill Pullman makes a good President and I was surprised to see 'Star Trek's' Brent Spiner playing the role of Dr. Okun. To me personally, I thought this movie is better than a lot of the other Sci-Fi movies that came out around this time like 'Godzilla' and some of the remakes of older Sci-Fi movies. This is a great one and is not to be missed.",Null,2,6,25 March 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Great War Scenes, Dull Story!
","*Possible Spoilers*      Saving Private Ryan is a good war movie only to watch it's battle scenes. The story itself is rather dull the cast was great but one character wasn't to my liking. I didn't like the man that was carrying the ammo for the battle in the German town. He sat around crying and scared which is understandable for awar because there are no men who will just stand up and shoot a bunch of guys and not be afraid of everything. I know in a war you're scared all the time or most of the time but this character just didn't seem to fit. His comerades were being slaughtered around him and he didn't do anything and that made me hate him. If you want a good story for D-Day, settle for 1962's 'The Longest Day.'",Null,2,3,17 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Very Good!
","This is a good action film. Uma Thurman kicks some butt in this movie and her acting is good. Lucy Liu does well as a member of the murder squad underthe Mysterious Bill, played by David Carradine. The stunts are good in this as well as Robert Richardson's cinematography. Thurman plays a woman whogoes on a revenge mission to kill the people responsible for attacking her. For all those men she faught near the end, i'm surprised they didn't just quit and give up after Thurman killed the first five, but it kept the movie going.  I recommend this movie. ***out of ****.",Null,0,1,1 May 2004
Total Recall," TOTAL DISASTER!
","This is a really bad movie in my opinion. The film has a cheesy plot, all I can really say is that it's Arnold Schwartzenegger and Michael Ironside goingaround shooting everything in sight when not shooting at each other. This is a typical Verhoven film, it contains a lot of violence, and some sexual content which Verhoven loves putting in his movies. The best thing about the movie is Jerry Goldsmith's action packed music score. I think he should have won anOscar for it or at least have been nominated. But other than the music, this is a horrible movie which I named 'Total Disaster!' Schwartzenegger should havefound something else to do.",Null,2,6,2 April 2004
Die Hard," Wow! This one will blow you away!
","Die Hard is a must see for action fans. The plot is great. A bunch of bad guy terrorist, Oh wait a minute, Alan Rickman says 'Who said we were terrorist?' Oh Well, Bad Guys take over a 40 story building in Los Angeles and take 30+ people hostage. Willis is the invisable 'pain in the ass' cop who gets away and hatches a one man war against the bad guys. The stunts are great and the characters are great. Reginald Vel Johnson is great is pure comic releif. Alan Rickman is a great villan and the bad guy comic Clarence Gilyard Jr. I think this movie is great and anybody wanting action and top rate suspense, this is the ticket. One thing, if you've read the back of the DVD case, it says that John McClane is armed with a service revolver, that is wrong. McClane (Willis) is armed with an automatic not a revolver. Just thought I'd point that out. **** out of ****.",Null,1,1,22 August 2004
Rear Window," Hitchcock at his best!
","Rear Window is a definate classic. The plot, the actors just everything about this movie is great. James Stewart as the wheel chair bound photographer delivers a great performance along with Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter and Wendel Corey as the supporting cast. Raymond Burr as the mysterious neighbor also does great. This movie had a great blend of humor, suspense and drama which are the three things that make a movie great. Thelma Ritter is the comic relief in this movie as the insurance company nurse and always has something to say about everything. This was also a simple movie because it took place only in an apartment overlooking a courtyard and a perfect view of your neighbors. This is a great one **** out of ****.",Null,0,1,19 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Best of the Star Wars Series.
","This is without a doubt, the best of the Star Wars Saga. It has endless action, good characters and screen play, special effects and music. It would have really been something if this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1977 but Sci-Fi movies aren't likley to do so. I would have given Harrison Ford an Oscar nomination because he has the best character which practically made the first three great. Alec Guiness is great as Obi Wan Kanobi and receiving a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Peter Cushing in his best role and taking a break from the Hammer horror movies. This is a movie loved by many and is a classic from beginning to end.",Null,2,3,31 March 2004
The Thin Red Line," One of the Worst War Movies Ever!
",*Possible Spoilers*              The Thin Red Line has to be one of the worst excuses for a war movie ever. This movie lost me right from the beginning and on to the end. The story didn't seem to make sense. It was all about cheesy action sequences andwasting talents of a great cast of actors. I will give this film credit for it's sound effects I thought they were good but that didn't make it a good movie. It seemed all during this movie that more Americans were being killed or wounded thenwere put ashore in the beginning. I thought the cinematography in the film was good and that was the only thing good about it really. I would avoid this one if I were you.,Null,1,4,17 April 2004
Goodfellas," One of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen!
","What the heck was this? This was one horrible movie if I've ever seen it. Martin Scorsese again bring a movie with a terrible plot, terrible characters and a very slow moving film. What was with Joe Pesci's character? It seems to methat Pesci got an Oscar for saying the F-word over and over again. While Pesci might have kept up the show for a while, his two supporting actors Robert DiNiro and Ray Liotta played weak characters. As I said before, the plot washorrible. Why this movie received as many Oscar nominations it did, I'll never know.",Null,3,8,1 May 2004
