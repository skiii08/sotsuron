Catch Me If You Can," Great but a few minor flaws
","I fully enjoyed this movie it was great to see and great to see DiCaprio prove how good an actor he is which we haven't seen since 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'. I thought Tom Hanks was slightly disappointing but as the film went on, he seemed to get more into it and started to match Leo's acting supreme.The one thing i noticed and didn't like in this film was how Frank Abagnale Jr.(DiCaprio) at parts was completely in control of everyone around him and you just felt 'this guy is COOL' but then...he'd go and ring up Tom Hanks and be all weak as if he couldn't handle the situation he'd gotten himself into....when really...if you can fake being an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a teacher, you can handle ANYTHING. Other than this, the film was great and hats off to DiCaprio, he's now right up there with Edward Norton on acting ability.Christopher Walken should be in EVERY film that's EVER made from now on!",Null,0,1,25 January 2003
