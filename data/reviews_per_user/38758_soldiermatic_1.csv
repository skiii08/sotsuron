Requiem for a Dream," A excellent portrayal of the consequences of drug addictions and obsession.
","A very good movie about three friends and one of their lonely mothers and how drugs, addiction and obsession ruined their dreams of having a good life. The three friends were hoping to make it out of their poor lives by selling drugs and making enough money to move out of their very poor neighborhood. The lonely lady hod no one in her life and developed an obsession for being on television. She was too overweight to be on the television show, so she adopted a detrimental diet regime. The acting, plot and characters were very well played. The message is very strong, and the movie was overall very touching. A excellent portrayal of the consequences of drug addictions and obsession. The theme song well correlated with the 'depressing' theme of the movie.",8,1,1,2 November 2006
