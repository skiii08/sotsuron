The Incredible Hulk," Terrible, awful, abortion of a film.
","I thought I should warn you, because after reading some of the other comments, I think people came of wildly off base when reviewing the movie. Zak Penn should have his knees bludgeoned and Liv Tyler should be hung for putting us through that. The writing was flat out awful, an abomination if you will, and Liv was just unbelievably bad. Who does Betty Ross think she is running around shouting at heavy artillery and abominations of science to, 'STOP!! PLEASE STOP!!!' He other lines consisted of her whispering, 'it's okay now,' and ,'...Bruce,' even though he was hundreds of feet away.The romance scene came up drastically short, and if anything could have saved Liv Tyler from being the worst actress I've ever scene it would have been a steamy romantic scene. The action was mediocre, and the only parts I enjoyed were ones with Ed Norton and Ed Norton alone. If it had been a self-aware superhero film, like Ironman, it could have been at least a 5. Put $8.75 to better use and go see Kung Fu Panda.-Zeke",3,5,16,15 June 2008
