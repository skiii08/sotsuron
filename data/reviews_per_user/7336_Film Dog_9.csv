Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's Wrong with Phantom Menace
","First let me qualify:  I enjoyed the Phantom Menace.  I'm not here to be a Menace-basher.  Special effects are as good as advertised, maybe better. Fantastic, as a matter of fact.  The worlds Lucas imagined and created were fantasy first rate.  Anyone who followed the pre-hype already knew the plot before walking into the theatre, but what the heck?So what is wrong with the Phantom Menace.  Three things:1) dialogue        2) acting      3) Jar Jar BinksOK, maybe bad dialogue was a product of bad acting.  Maybe bad acting was because of bad directing.  Hard to tell.  The fact is, it was horrible. Except for Liam Neeson and Jake Lloyd, the characters were incredibly wooden.  I thought I was watching statues; maybe not-so-animated f/x. Ewan McGregor looked and sounded as if he were starring in an old Steve Reeves gladiator movie.  If Natalie Portman ever changed her expression from deadpan, I think her face would have cracked.  Almost ditto Pernilla August. Which is what makes me think maybe the problem lies with the directing. How could so many actors of this caliber turn in the same kind of sterile, stoic, performance?  These people had no feel, no warmth.  Compare them with Luke, Leia, and Han.  You can't.  There IS no comparison.  The first Star Wars was such a success not just because of the special effects, but because the audience, for whatever reasons, developed an affinity with these very human people.  We really liked them.  Lucas seems to not realize the importance of this.And then there is Jar Jar.  He's really, really, annoying.  An audience can tolerate a character they hate.  In fact, they love to hate a villain. They love a character they love.  Goes without saying.  But people don't like being annoyed, and on this count Jar Jar, unfortunately, delivers.  His voice, his overbearing attitude, his voice, his dialect, his voice. Everything about him is annoying.  And for an aquatic being, what's with the stumpy feet?  How is he supposed to swim with those things?  Any aquatic creature worth his saltwater would have evolved web feet.  Name one aquatic animal that has feet which doesn't have webbed feet?  You can't.And with all that's wrong, the special effects still made for an un-paralleled movie experience.  Totally blew me away.  Lucas accomplished what he set out to do.  Too bad he forgot about the rest of the elements that make up a good movie.",8,0,0,19 June 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," An endearing quality
","Seems sort of corny by today's standards (think 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'), but a very enjoyable film nonetheless.  Newman and Redford are lovable bad guys.  They capitalize on the crooks-on-the-run-we'd-like-to-hang-out-with genre made popular a couple years earlier by 'Bonnie and Clyde'.  Their witty, lighthearted banter in the face of doom gives them such an endearing quality.  And Katharine Ross isn't hard to take, either.  Love the bedroom/gunpoint scene.",7,0,2,22 February 1999
Fargo," An OKay movie.
","Good, but not as good as Siskel & Ebert thought (they both picked it as favorite film of '96).  A sleazy car salesman wants his wife kidnapped so he can extort ransom from her father, but plans go awry.  Frances McDormand steals the show as a pregnant Brainerd police chief.  Too many Ookaays in this film.  Just a bit too heavy on the northwoods stereotype.  Still, it's one of those films that passes the test of time:  I find I can watch this movie again and again and never tire of it.",10,0,1,11 March 1999
The Caine Mutiny," The USS Bogey
","Bogart plays a neurotic captain on a Navy minesweeper.  He ends up with a mutinous situation on his hands and ultimately gets court-martialed for dereliction of duty.  So-so film, except for Bogey's performance.  In the final scene Bogey loses it in a courtroom.  Worth watching for that scene alone.",7,0,0,22 February 1999
The Shining," Defines 'suspense'.
","I saw this film in a theater then it was released, and it was one of my more memorable movie experiences.  A rather longish movie, I thought it was moving a bit slow.  Watchable, interesting, but not very scary.  But, without actually realizing it, the tension was slowly building, building, building.  Why do I say this?  Because with about a half hour left of the movie, I suddenly realized I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I don't think this has ever happened to me before or since, with the possible exception of 'The Exorcist' or 'The Omen'.  That, my friends, is a sign of a very good film indeed:  it accomplished what it set out to accomplish, which was to jangle thoroughly jangle the viewer's nerves.",10,6,10,18 April 1999
American History X," An Edward Norton prediction
","I predict that in the future we will be seeing alot of Edward Norton in alot of juicy roles.  Who would have dreamed the baby faced kid in 'Primal Fear' could have pulled off a performance such as the one he gave as Derek?  I'll bet there were alot of auditions for this role.  I'll also bet that, once Norton did his thing, it was a slam-dunk.  Simply incredible and, disturbingly, incredibly believable.  Then again, he was aided by a fantastic script.  Playing the role as a very intelligent, though misguided young man, I found it hard to argue with his logic, twisted as it was (think about the scene at the dinner table).  That bothered me.  This guy is going to go a long, long, way.  Maybe another Robert DeNiro.  Just hope he doesn't O.D. on gangster roles.  Too much of a good thing, ya know?stanhejl@netscape.net",9,0,0,15 September 1999
Liar Liar," Funny Funny
","Jim Carrey plays almost a straight role as a lawyer who can not tell a lie for 24 hrs.  The entire show is his...the rest of the actors are pretty much reduced to stage props.  But he once again proves his comedic genius. Funny as hell, as a matter of  fact.",8,0,0,24 March 1999
Caddyshack," I gopher this flick
","One of the funniest, most juvenile movies to come out of the eighties.  You just know if it was made today, in the late 90's, Adam Sandler would be cast somewhere in the mix.Love Rodney.  He steals every scene he's in.  Come to think of it, I guess he always does, so no big deal.  Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were still on their post-SNL roll.  They're hilarious.  One of those films you never get tired of.stanhejl@netscape.net",8,0,0,22 February 1999
From Here to Eternity," So?
","A highly rated film, it won eight Oscars.  I however, can't figure out what all the fuss is about.  I think the acting was, for the most part, horrible. Montgomery Clift plays the young hardhead; sort of a James Dean character. Deb Kerr & Burt Lancaster play opposite each other & turn in wooden performances, the surf seen notwithstanding.  Perhaps one of the better performances was by Sinatra, of all people.  To each their own, I guess.",7,8,18,13 March 1999
