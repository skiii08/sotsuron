Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For all star wars fans
","This was an all action film, with a meduim amount of talk.  Since its the first of episodes, all fans star wars or not can enjoy this film.  Its also an all positive film, with only obstacles and there are hardly any down-uplifting rollercoaster emotions in the film.  Again, its all positvie. Though there were suspenceful-action scenes, such as the pod racing scene.
Ray Park [Sleepy Hollow, X-men 2000] was Darth Maul who portrayed an excellent villain and did a very well eye to hand combat.  Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn)and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), also performed an excllent role of the heros.I would recommend this film to kids and adults.  Star Wars fans or not. Always cures a negative feeling.",6,0,1,15 June 2000
Sleepy Hollow," The Best Film Ever!
","This was a wonderfully made, mesmerizing film!  It went beyond my expectations.  You couldn't get a better cast and crew.  It has a numerous amount of suspsne, horror, romance, and mystery.  The story, special effects, the cast, the setting, the suspense, the comedy, the horror, the rommance, the cinematography, and the ending was not dissopinting at all. Go see it!",10,1,1,11 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Sleepy Hollow was so funny that you'll laugh your head off.
","This film's a masterpiece, a must see movie.  Has the perfect actors/actresses, ending, etc.  This is the film of the year.I give it 5 stars and the best film making movie classic of the millenneum.It had a mix between, horror/comedy/romance/etc.  This is Johnny Depp's best performence ever. And Christina Ricci couldn't of acted better. This film is the best out of all the Tim Burton film classics.In one word to describe this masterpiece film it would have to be:...'perfect'.... You won't be disappointed!",10,0,0,3 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great story
","I thought the Sixth Sense had a lot of thought put into it and it really paid off.  It had the best actors, best actresses, and the story kept building to a surprise ending.  It was beautifully made.  It has all my recommendations.",10,0,0,15 June 2000
The Matrix," One man Matrix
","The Matrix had very visually compelling effects all thoughout this film. The Matrix goes from one world to another. From the year 1999, beyond and to other worlds of reality, but yet real.Keanu Reeves(Neo), Lauance Fisbone(Morphis), and Carrie Ann Moss(Trinity) did all outstanding jobs as the action preformers thoughout this film.Though it had the best visual effects and great actors/actresses, I saw no story put into it.  There was a story, but a small one.  Not enough for me to see.But still, I recommend this film to teenagers and adults.  Kids too, but yet there's quite a bit of violance (not much gore).  If your looking for a good action-scifi thriller, this is the perfect film.",9,0,0,15 June 2000
