Raiders of the Lost Ark," Lessons of the past perfected
","What a thrill ride this movie still is today! Like the old cliffhanger movies of the old serials of the 40's and 50's this borrows heavily on that heritage. First there's the lead character played perfectly by Harrison Ford (Tom Selleck was supposed to be Indy, but was under contract with CBS for Magnum. I believe it would not have been as good, but that is speculation at this point) who plays the character with a bit of tongue in cheek and zeal like only Ford could in his prime. From the start of the movie it starts a non-stop roll of events that gives you just enough time to breath and soak in the last scene of action. It uses the old map trick to convey travel and sends us on a world wind adventure. Indy has a quote in the movie-'It's not the years, it's the mileage.' This film suffers neither age or mileage. It truly could be re-released today, and would be a hit. If you haven't viewed it, you should. You will not be disappointed.",9,0,0,18 May 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not a good adaption, at all...
","After reading the graphic novel, I had high hopes for this movie. I expected some changes to it, but not to this extent. It was horribly paced and mish mashed story lines. I was disappointed in the portrayal of Deadpool also. It was so bad, in fact, that Fox has said both following movies, Deadpool, and the next Wolverine movies will not be sequels to this film. Fans of this film are totally lost...It starts off rather well, same as the graphic novel. Then the producers/director just wave off a perfectly good storyline so they could hurry up and get Logan into his adamantium. When in fact, he shouldn't have gotten his adamantium skeleton until the sequel of this film. The novel follows him through the 19th century and has a very well done love triangle in it. These 'film makers' decide they can do better, and get it all wrong. For me personally, it ranks down there with Halle Berry's Cat Woman. The die hard comic fans spoke out loudly after viewing this film, and along with many of them, I agree. a terrible waste of possibly a really good movie. For the next movie of Wolverine, they had best bring it. I mean, really? Adamantium bullets? The procedure was what made him lose his memory in the comics, and in the first film. Poor continuity...Very poor indeed. Save your money and watch X-Men 1&2 instead. Far superior movies.",5,2,4,11 March 2012
Ready Player One," Feast for the eyes
","This was a fun movie. I had seen the book, but haven't read it. But I think this is a rare case that it translates really well on screen because of the nostalgia side of it. Anyway, great movie to make you feel as if you've been on a ride, loved it!",8,2,4,11 August 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Close to perfect
","This is one of those movies that fit with the times of it's release. With a nation under surveillance, drones flying the globe, a questionable administration, this movie makes no bones about where it stands. It is probably the best political movie disguised as a super hero movie in decades. Captain America is still on a journey to understand his new present day. After a nice set up through a little humor where we meet Sam Wilson, after this fateful meeting we get started with Black Widow and Cap on a mission to save a ship full of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents being held by none other than Batroc the Leaper. After a fun filled action sequence, we find Black Widow doing what she does best, espionage. Cap not liking the fact the mission has sub missions he knew nothing about, he faces Fury about it, not knowing Fury set the whole thing up. Once Fury's superiors realize what he has done, he (Fury) goes to the one man he can trust. Cap. After telling him just enough to give Cap what he needs to start his quest. Cap and Natasha go on a mission against seemingly everyone and eventually team up with Sam Wilson, who nails his role as Falcon. As they search for answer against gov't foes and the mysterious Winter Soldier, the risks become more then anyone could imagine. To not give away the entire plot, I'll leave it there. This movie has quickly become one of my all time favorites. Probably one of the greatest super hero movies put to film. Great story, action and visual effects (only used when absolutely necessary), it is entertainment that makes you think. Certainly about current events, but not to the point of pointing fingers at anyone. 'This isn't freedom. This is fear.'",10,0,1,6 June 2014
Justice League," Not so Rotten
","I have to admit, I was excited for this movie. I grew up to the Super Friends, was a fan of the Justice League animated series, so when they announced Justice League the movie, I didn't get my expectations too high, but still found myself looking forward to it. When Rotten Tomatoes came out with their rating, I wasn't surprised. They seem to have it out for DC movies recently. Man of Steel was better than they gave it credit for, Dawn of Justice though, was definitely not good (except for the Batman warehouse fight scene, that was pretty epic), Suicide Squad was a little fun, not as bad as critics say also.Without giving any spoilers, JL decidedly turned up the humor on this one, which many gags did not fall flat for me. The Flash stole the show when it came to comic relief. Aquaman has a hilariously 'heart felt' scene that was one of the best scenes in the movie. When Superman returns (seriously, I'm sure this is in no way a spoiler by now) he and Flash have a couple of great scenes, and Clark and Cyborg have a great one also. Batman does his thing and is played very well by Afleck. And of course Wonder Woman is once again played great by Gal Gadot. The villain is standard fair. Has a couple of decent scenes, but other than that, he plays his part, as do his minions. Don't get me wrong, this is not on par with many of the Marvel movies put out there (I don't mean to play the DC vs. Marvel card here) but this is a good entry and good beginning for the future movies. Please don't go in with a 'I'm going to hate this movie' attitude and go in for a good popcorn movie and enjoy it.",8,0,3,5 December 2017
Avengers: Endgame," The End as we know it.
","Endgame. And it is. The arc that started 11 years ago comes to a crashing finale and satisfies what I was hoping to be a gratifying ending to what is being called the Infinity Saga. After a surprising and quick paced beginning, we go into story building mode for a little over an hour, which is needed for the action to start and the build up to be worth it. I am right now debating on whether to put spoilers in, or go light review.
Well, if you don't want minor spoilers, stop right here.
The original team that started the Super Group movement every studio is trying to capture is getting a facelift. Old faces are moving on/out and surprising additions to others are coming. Thanos is still an imposing figure in the movie, just not the same one as you see in Infinity War. They tie loose ends up nicely with the characters we have loved for (me) decades. I'm sad to see these characters story come to a conclusion. But on the bright side, we have more movies of these characters than many other icons get, so I can always start at Ironman and divulge myself for a wopping 23 movies over and over if the coming movies fail to live up to what has been a superb run.",10,0,5,26 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Near perfection
","The Russo Bros. Inc. have done a three for three! What a nearly perfect movie they have delivered. Unfortunately for those of us who have been reading comics for 40+ years, we have to deal with those without the knowledge of how epic a movie this is. What a superb job they did in melding this large group into a movie that is in most parts, seamless. Like Age of Ultron, the more I watch this movie, the better it gets. It is brutal in the death of Loki, it is humorous in Stark, Starlord and Spidey's quips. It is heart wrenching in Gamora's sacrifice. It is devestating in Thanos' victory. Action packed and a thrill ride of a movie with substance. With my opinion worth a grain of salt, near perfection. Sit back, pop some popcorn and enjoy. Personally, Winter Soldier is still my favorite, but only by an inch and narrowing with each watch.",10,0,4,14 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," OK, enough of the overreacting ratings...
","Ok, so there is some issues with this movie, I'm not going to lie. But seriously, what movie doesn't have issues? With that being said...
This is a fairly well entry into the Star Wars canon. It has the humor and action that a Star Wars movie deserves to have and has emotion that is usually missing in these movies. Yes, there are opportunities missed and one in-particular scene I have a major issue with, but I'm not going to give it a horrible rating because of it. It does also have some awesome jaw-dropping imagery. 
This is where some major spoilers come into play, so please, STOP READING if you do not want it to be ruined.Still here? OK, After one of the most awesome reveals in Star Wars cinema, Luke looks off to the two suns of the Jedi planet as he did long ago on his foster home planet at the beginning of A New Hope and fades away. As in dies. Which I have no problem with his death, but how do you follow up such a tremendous scene with another like that? Should have let the great scene feed the ending and let Luke pass in the final movie of the trilogy to finish the trilogy. I feel he will be a Force Ghost, so he will be in it, but it just killed the momentum, and, in doing so, it reflects in the current run of bad ratings on this page. It may be honest ratings, but I believe it is knee jerk reactions to the gut shot people feel with the ending.
It also has a superb twist with Kylo Ren, who is much better in this movie than the last. 
Rey is just good and so is Poe with his humor and tough love lessons he learns in this film.
Finn has a side quest that seems forced, but it is just a chance to show some eye candy with scene imagery. Still, A well made film that has some issues with the plot.
Truly, it has an ending you have to come to terms with, and like life, with time something like that can work out for the better in the end.",6,1,8,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel has ushered in a new Golden Age
","Wow. What a run Marvel is having with movies! I have been thinking how great it is to be a comic book geek right now. I have waited decades for the technology to reach the point we are at now.With this movie, I now believe Marvel is in the midst of creating a moment in time. People will possibly watch these movies as we now see the epics of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The quality of these movies are undeniable. They have humor, super great effects and sound, and superb plots. Of course some movies are better than others, some being made mostly to nudge the next part of the connected universe along (I'm looking at you Ironman 2).Peter Quill is a boy born of Earth but not wholly human. His Earth mother tells him about a mysterious father from beyond while other family members, you feel, think she is hallucinating. Then the story hits full gear and doesn't stop with the tongue firmly in cheek.It does an excellent job introducing the characters and assembling them uniquely. After united, and in a common bond to escape prison they get started on the action. With characters like Rocket and Groot proving to be solid real feel beings it makes for great fun. I greatly enjoyed this film. It not only lived up to the hype, but for me, it exceeded it. A rarity in any movie genre. If you are a fan of Star Wars or Firefly (I really had a feeling of kinship between GoG and the Firefly 'verse) you will most likely love this movie. If you haven't seen it yet...Go on out there and watch it already!",9,4,9,9 August 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Same Pitches, different feel.
","While not as good as the first, it did well enough to remain entertaining and is better than most sequels in this genre tend to be. Biggest laughs are from Fat Amy (stair surfing anyone?) and has good feels throughout. Satisfied customer.",7,0,0,5 November 2018
Wonder Woman," WB needed this movie to be great
","I had been waiting on this film to come out for a while, and against my better judgment, I let myself have high expectations for it. And did it ever meet them! I love the fact that the entire movie never felt that it had to rush to tell the story. It built upon it's own foundation and took you to Diana's world and let you dwell there. Then it seemed every stage of the story effectively ran it's course on cue, not lingering too long and not jumping from scene to scene in whiplash fashion. It did well building emotion and keeping it gritty when necessary. What I was surprised about was it wasn't just for the girls. Steve Trevor wasn't there for eye candy, he did his part and pulled his weight. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and hope has been restored into the WB's DC franchise. Kudos Wonder Woman. Thank you for bringing the girls into the game.",9,10,22,4 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good movie if you're not expecting the Avengers
","I'm always amused at how people react to the new crop of DC movies. It seems some have a negative opinion before they see it. They do try to be darker than I think they should be, but that is the curse of the Dark Knight movies. But going in to these DC movies, I keep my expectations to a minimum, and unlike, apparently, more than a few people I don't go in with expectations to hate on the movies. This one could have been better if it would have followed the early 90's animated movie and had the vs. part held to more of a minor plot point, but it was enjoyable and did good enough job of introducing the DC trinity to a wider audience. If you do come into the theater in this or future DC movies looking for a Marvel spectacle movie, perhaps you should stick to just the MCU movie package. Don't get me wrong, I am more a Marvel fan than DC, but I've learned what to expect from both movie franchises.",8,3,6,4 December 2016
Pitch Perfect," Feels like an 80's update
","Good (mostly) clean fun of a movie. Seem to take what worked as a formula for an 80's movie and did a nice twist with it. It is one of my guilty pleasure movies that I put in from time to time just for a laugh or two. Not side splitting funny, but is a nice movie that has heart and good taste.",8,1,1,5 November 2018
