Blade Runner 2049," A waste of 3 hours of my life
","This is the first review I have written for a movie and the reason I am writing this is because this is the worst movie I have ever seen. About 45 minutes into the movie I asked my husband if he understood what was going on and he did not either. Not only is it difficult to understand what is going on, but it is dark and slow. (many scenes of the characters holding their hand out into the fake snow, looking at their hands. or long shots of the characters staring off into space.) The only color in the movie occurred for about 30 seconds when green leaves were shown as a memory flashback. The gentleman next to us also agreed he was glad it was over. I suppose that it gets high reviews because of the special effects, but without a story line that is interesting and engaging, special effects do nothing for me.",1,65,140,8 October 2017
