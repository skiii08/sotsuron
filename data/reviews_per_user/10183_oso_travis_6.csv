Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Politically incorrect beyond belief but very funny... NOT!
","I was one of the few guys that bought the Borat hype. How a bunch a serious critics claimed this film was one of the greatest and funniest comedies of the decade. The truth is this movie pushes the limit of political incorrectness, and... that's about it.Funny it ain't. All it was a series of stale, stupid, primitive jokes that aren't funny. I don't mind scatological humor when it's well done and witty. But this wasn't.I like my good Political Incorrectness quota in my comedies. But really, there's has to be more to it to make people laugh. I've laughed my ass off watching R-rated comedies; 'There's Something About Mary', 'Fargo' and 'Crimen ferpecto' almost brought me to tears. 'Borat' didn't.It's incredible what passes these days as good (sophisticated or raw) comedy. Uh! The wonders and magic of publicity and media hype.Well, I can always have my 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' and 'Reno 911!' on TV for some Polical Incorrectness AND some hysterical laughs.5/10",5,3,6,5 January 2007
Requiem for a Dream," 'American Beauty' rated NC-17. Deeply disturbing but truly a masterpiece.
","There are films that made history. Films like 'Nosferatu', 'Psycho', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The Exorcist', 'Platoon' and 'Pulp Fiction'. Films that will be remembered in 20 or 30 years. And 'Requiem for a Dream' is one of them.Shocking? Yes. Dark? Yes. Risky? Yes. 'Requiem...' is all that and more. It has an almost perfect direction and outstanding performances. All the actors were pushed to their limits, doing their very best. And Ellen Burnstyn, shows that she was cheated-out in almost every acting award in 2000.This film is 'A Clockwork Orange' for our generation. It shows things that hardly anyone had the guts to show before (in so crude way, anyway). And just like the author of 'A Clockwork...' could be seen as a genius after 'A Clockwork...','Requiem...' talks more about Darren Aronofsky, than drug itself. It talks about a risky and creative director(probably the best of his generation), who could break cinema rules, and expand them in the future.Why did the Academy praise 'A Clockwork Orange', and almost ignore 'Requiem...', if they are both very controversial? Well, 'A Clockwork...' is set in a distant future, in England. And 'Requiem..' is set in the US, right here and right now. It shatters the American Dream. But unlike 'American Beauty' there's no hope for ANYONE here. Although I think that the VERY LAST SCENE in 'Requiem...', it's a little tiny spark of HOPE.And as violence, HOPE is part of our human nature too.Enjoy (or Be shocked by) this instant classic.",10,1,2,2 June 2003
Hostel," The very nature of slasher films: Paying for watching someone get killed (or tortured).
","Eli Roth is a genius, and Hostel is a twisted, sick, depraved masterpiece.I was one of the few that had high expectations when I went to see Cabin Fever in theaters. Boy, was I disappointed. I still thought back then that Eli Roth was a promising guy even if his first film wasn't that accomplished.Let's say that for that matter, my expectations were kind of 'neutral' when I went to see 'Hostel', but I was anxious to see it anyway. During the first 10 or 15 minutes I was thinking 'hey! I guess Roth sold himself after all'. More wrong couldn't I be.What I found was one of the sickest, darkest and above all, most intense films I've seen in my life. I found out that Roth didn't want MTVish flashy editing cuts, and after seeing this film a total number of 7 times (5 times at theaters, and 2 times at my home theater, and still going up) I see that is true, and works perfectly for the story. Roth wanted the film to have a classic (and classy for that matter) feeling to it and he succeed in every single aspect of it. The editing is just invisible and discreet, the photography is stunningly gorgeous, and the music score is one of the finest and most memorable I've listened to in a long time; there is no need for filling up the soundtrack with your one-hit-wonder of choice.Kudos to Roth for making one of the best screenplays in recent years. The dialogues feel so natural and real, with every situation grounded in some logic. His directing skills are brilliant too. There is no a single frame or scene that is a waste. Every single shot, every single frame is as beautiful as it can be. And in a horror film that makes the whole thing more disturbing.What I found more remarkable about this film, it is the amount of intelligent ideas that float around like subtexts, consciously OR unconsciously. One of the most clever ideas is why we like to see horror films: because we like to see people being tortured, chopped, or beaten to death and that is true. As the Dutch Businessman would say, that is part of human nature. We, horror films fans, PAY for watching someone going through gruesome suffering and we don't pay once, we do it twice, thrice, or more, just to feel that adrenaline rush the American Client talks of.-Some Spoilers-It is amazing how we come to 'rationalize' the deaths to suit our beliefs, attitudes and fears. We feel bad for Josh, Kana, Oli, and Yuki, but the audience was clapping and cheering when Natalya, Svetlana, and Alex get rolled over by two cars, when the chasers get beaten to death by the Bubble Gum Gang, and when Pax finally gets his revenge at the Dutch Businessman, in the gentlemen restroom.-End of Some Spoilers-I guess it is just part of human nature. Revenge is in our genes. See the trashy state of the world for that matter.***1/2 And #02 of my Top Ten of 2006 (just behind Love Me If You Dare).Note: Though I'm certain that Roth and Hernandez won't get any Oscars nods (even if they deserved them for their marvelous work behind (Best Director) and in front of camera (Best Actor in a Leading Role), there are other things that need to be taken 'For Your Consideration'. Editing, by George Folsey, Jr., the beautiful score composed by Nathan Barr, and the gorgeous cinematography by Milan Chadime are such a fine work that deserved some nominations. But they won't get them. Roth's attitude towards American film unions (that could be resume in a big Screw You!) won't let them get the recognition they truly deserve.8/10",8,6,8,16 September 2006
The Notebook," Probably the best American film of 2004 so far. McAdams and Gosling are breakthrough promises.
","The Notebook. ***1/2
I got lucky to get a sneak-peek of this one. The film is just stunning. At some times, touching and deeply moving, other times fun and sensual,'The Notebook' has something that made Hollywood great Romances classics during the 30's and the 40's: strong leads and a fine chemistry between them.McAdams and Gosling are superb. Their performances are so true, living and real that you actually believe they did have a crush on each other at the set! Keep watching for these guys, they are going to be huge stars.The screenplay is great: fancy, well-constructed, solid, it captures the spirit of the book. Unfortunately, Cassavettes' clumsy and choppy directing skills keep the film from reaching Greatness Heights. You can feel the guy is on a rush. Geez, the film could have been 15 minutes longer!Still, a very fine film. McAdams' and Gosling's master work makes the ride worth it.8/10.",8,0,0,9 August 2004
Alexander," A pretentious and expensive piece of trash. Without a single doubt, the Worst Film of the Year.
","Alexander. Directed by Oliver Stone. *I am so grateful for a film like 'Alexander'. And here are the reasons why:1) Because its box office bombing status and the madness (in a 'we want to rip you apart' kind of way) among critics could bury the 'return to epics' we had this year; don't take me wrong, good old epics were great, but when you start getting stuffed with major turkeys like 'Troy', 'King Arthur', and our national treasure 'Zapata' it is time to say the idea good-bye.2) It is living proof that either Stone got old and lost every last bit of his talent or he has been the most overrated director around for a long time. For every Zemeckis, Howard or Spielberg there is actually a director that knows what he is doing (i.e. Payne, Haynes, Araki); but this year Stone might defeat them all and be crowned as the new Overrated Champ. It is so funny to see over 30 years old hardcore Stone's fans to stand up and defend Stone and his new 'masterwork', when in fact a motion picture should speak for itself: the film is awful.I will not go into big details on how bad this film is. Let's just say that both my ears and eyes could not believe it. Angie Jolie embarrassing herself for the 15th time. Farrell giving the audience a stalwart masterclass on Bad Acting. Hopkins granting the expression 'verbal vomit' a new dimension. One of the most dreadful screenplay written in years; and probably the most talky film in the last 10 years! There's not a moment of silence or meditation on it. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and talk. Geez!I think the only people that can keep themselves from embarrassment is Rodrigo Prieto and his photography, Elliot Cowan as Ptolemy, Connor Paolo as Young Alexander, and Rory McCann as Crateros. Holy Cow! Even Vangelis' music is as corny and mellow as it can get. Totally, out of place.Save your time, money and self from this stinker. You've been warned.Note: One thing is 'killing' a lot of extras, and a different one, 'killing' innocent elephants and horses. It made me sick. I know they are not hurt because of sues, but why do you have to abuse the audience? I hope some elephants may escape from San Diego Zoo and go straight to WB studios.5/10",5,4,8,4 December 2004
War of the Worlds," Spielberg: The invasive reconstruction
","WAR OF THE WORLDS, Spielberg's 23th film, again in full shape after shameless turkeys(Catch me if you can 02,The Terminal 04), reconstructs an exterminating invasion done by beings from an unknown planet to the Earth, all of this seen through the eyes of the divorced father Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), his son Robbie (Justin Chatwin)and her daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning surprisingly bearable and intense), avoiding all kinds of dangers, almost miraculously.A sober and fancy Science Fiction and End of the World master's film work reconstructs itself avoiding successfully, like one car alone on the highway, the cheap cheese in Deep Impact (Leder, 98), the cocky cynicism in Armaggedon (Bay, 98), the patriotic propaganda in Independece Day (Emmerich, 96), and even any kind of emotional manipulation, a thing that Spielberg is so endeared with, like in Saving Private Ryan(98) or Schindler's List (93) and denying all the way any kind of ideological trash, moralize, or verbal vomit.The heart-wrenching post 9/11 pessimism, as destructive as the lights coming down from the tripods, reconstructs the darkest Apocalypse fantasy where the hope in religion to bring salvation is forever lost and almost so, is the faith in the human race.Strange metaphysics on clear and present Destruction reconstruct beautiful poetry on Chaos and Panic, with every member of the cast properly installed in Hysteria, middle shots with hundreds of horrified and desperate extras, escaping or assaulting mobs and fear-frozen faces.Spielberg's unconscious betrays him reconstructing a cruel and brutal war in imperial American soil and not forgetting out of his personal film imagery, the Holocaust, being doomed to be repeated for ever and ever, with that gray dust as a result of the fulminating rays, the victim's clothing falling slowly, thousands of refugees traveling by foot, corpses floating quietly in the Hudson river.A narrative device apparently rooted in Hollywood's neoclassicism reconstructs itself paradoxically, not by psychological motivations, but by Fate or Randomness, in the style of the great European and Asian auteurs.And the most clever notes criticizing American imperialism, reconstructing themselves with amazing subtlety, shed new light on truths and intuitions on the essence of the human beast, as beautiful and as terrible as the film itself.8/10.
