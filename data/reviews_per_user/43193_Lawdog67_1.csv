United 93," Why do women dislike this movie?
","I have finally seen this movie. I had alternated between wanting to see it and avoiding it somewhat. I guess I knew that it would put me through the wringer again and probably tick me off mightily again. But in the end I realized that avoiding the reality of 9-11 and its results was, in some ways, being like the people who don't want to even think about or be reminded about what happened that day.My second concern was that it might be hyped-up or Hollywood-ized too much. I can emphatically state that that is NOT the case.I remember all the news coverage from 9-11 and how much it all focused on what the people on the ground went through. I always used to think about the airline passengers more, and what THEY had to go through. This movie shows just that.But - why, in every age category, do women rate this movie lower than men? I am curious what others think about this. I believe avoiding acknowledging what happened is a very poor way to deal with it. Do women tend to want to ignore the realities of 9-11? Is that it? This movie is by no means fun to watch, but it is very powerful - and, I believe, necessary.",10,3,5,19 March 2008
