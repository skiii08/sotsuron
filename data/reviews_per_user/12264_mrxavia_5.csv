The Blair Witch Project," Boring, slow and not scary in the slightest
","If you are looking for something to scare you, look somewhere else, this is the worst excuse I have seen for a horror film. The style of shooting was as expected, shaky hand held camera, which fitted the premise of the film, but you felt like you were watching an amateur film by school kids rather than actual footage of a real event which it was supposed to depict.Normally I expect a horror to get my heart racing a few times, and have some surprises, but the plot was too obvious, there were no surprises, nothing that would make you jump.I would not recommend this to any film buff, ignore the hype and skip this film.",1,71,117,17 May 2011
Gravity," Enjoyable fantasy, but bad science ruins any re watch ability.
","The film is very well made, the effects are amazing, and the acting good, but what really lets it down is the inaccuracies. They are using the space shuttle, the Hubble, so you expect they would have had a NASA consultant, if they did, how could they have let this happen.I found myself screaming at the screen throughout the movie. George Clooney is joyriding an MMU, then manages to rescue Sandra Bullock even after wasting all that propellant? Sandra Bullock seems to be missing her SAFER (a smaller MMU that would have let her at the very least stop spinning and start heading back), something I expected they would have added even if they didn't exist in real life!They have moved the Hubble space telescope, the ISS and the Chinese Space station into a similar orbit, even the space shuttle can't get between the different space stations when in different orbits!They 'hang' off the iss, they have stopped moving, then he 'lets go' and falls away? impossible as they are in free fall, once they stopped moving a tiny pull would have sent them back towards it...Really this film needed a decent consultant to tweak it to feel real, as it was I didn't feel anyone was in peril it was too much of a fantasy.Worth a watch, but only once..",3,6,11,27 March 2014
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Enjoyable, a good stepping stone to more Chinese Cinema
","This was the first film I ever saw out of Mainland China, and it hooked me immediately.The story is very balanced, a good mix of action with an interesting plot, there are scenes that make you laugh, cry & simply be amazed at the wire-work.Chow Yun Fat delivers a brilliant performance, something you can always expect from him, playing alongside an amazing actress, Michelle Yeoh, these two alone make it a film worth watching.The supporting cast are a dream to watch, with little sub-plots that are often missing from western films.Unfortunately Ziyi Zhang does not perform very well, and she is a bit wooden in her acting. Fortunately her opposite in the film Chen Chang holds their scenes together.Its not just an action film, but a good drama.I have only rated it 6/10 because there are so many better films out of China, but I would say this is much better than most of the films out of Hollywood today.I would recommend you watch this, and then soon after go and start watching more Chinese Cinema films.",6,0,1,7 February 2008
I Am Legend," Good start, but no comparison to the omega man
","This the third film made based on the book 'I Am Legend', so while its not a direct remake of 'The Omega Man' it is based on a similar story.When I sat down to watch this film, I was looking forward to this modern take on the book, I am a fan of Will Smiths work, and 'The Omega Man' so to me this seemed like a perfect combination, and I had great expectations for it.But unfortunately I was disappointed.This is not to say Will Smith was bad, on the contrary, he played the sole survivor role very well, he played his relationship with the dog very well, and the first 30 minutes of the film were very enjoyable.But after that, the film started to go downhill, it was not the acting but the writing and directing that failed it, it turned into a typical Hollywood remake. They destroy the story to a point where it just gets boring.The plot, while OK, seemed to be a push towards a 'zombie' film genre, and the writing just did not make much sense, moving towards lots of action and use of pyrotechnics to make up for the lack of imagination by the writers. Unfortunately lack of imagination is common I find in remakes. I think if you are watching a film and constantly think, 'why are they doing that?', then its not been properly though through, there should be no time for you to come up with solutions to the characters problems while sitting in a cinema.At many points in this film you have time to think why?I left the cinema with a feeling that it could have been so much more.In my opinion, its worth watching on TV, but not worth adding to your DVD collection.",3,1,2,29 February 2008
Beowulf," CGI good, acting OK, story OK, worth a watch..
","Now this was quite an interesting film, mainly because of how it was filmed. The actors basically acted while wearing suits to capture their motions, although you can tell the technology isn't perfected yet since their faces are very wooden at times.One thing that distracts you from the experience is the accents... Angelina's accent was pretty weird, as was many of the other actors.. Considering where they were supposed to be, I would have expected more consistency between them.Some people have said there is lots of nudity, this is not the case, most of it is implied nudity as you don't ever see anything. I would say it very safe to watch with your parents, nothing to go red faced over.The fight scenes were well done, but in places you start to feel like your watching a cut scene in a video game.The whole film was overall worth a watch, but not something I would watch twice.",5,0,1,9 February 2008
