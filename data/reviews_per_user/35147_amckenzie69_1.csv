The Blair Witch Project," It was excellent and exciting!
","I thought that the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was very exciting. It was an excellent movie. This movie really scared me and I could not sleep after watching it. It was the thought of not seeing the witch that scared me most. It sent shivers down my spine. I watch a lot of scary movies, they're my favorite, and out of all that I have watched I'd have to say that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was the BEST! It kept me wondering. I thought that all the actors in this film were really good. The way they expressed their anger and fears to one another seemed real, like they were actually being scared to death. To those who have not seen this movie, make sure that you watch the beginning. If not, then you won't get the movie. The beginning tells you about the things that the Blair witch has done to others and explains the events that happen later in the movie. If you don't see this part you will become confused! All in all, for a low budget film, it was EXCELLENT!!!!! I will go out and buy this movie!",10,2,4,27 November 1999
