Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Less funny than you'd expect
","Being familiar with Ali G and having seen many of Borat's TV appearances, I went into this movie with high expectations, not least because the reviews were ecstatic. However, overall I was disappointed. There were several moments of hilarity, but too often tempered by long-winded set-ups, tedious plot driving dialogue or let down by the fact that the victims of the comedy didn't really deserve it. Lampooning some cartoonishly clichéd rednecks or genuinely terrifying churchgoers is funny, if easy, but being rude to a sweet old couple doing their best to run a charming guest house just seemed misplaced. Generally, the shorter the clip the funnier (and the DVD extras are some of the funniest bits) but, whilst capturing Pamela Anderson in a sack may sound funny, I thought the execution left a lot to be desired, and was nowhere near as funny as the TV show.",5,0,1,31 March 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Not bad, but not as clever as it thinks it is.
","I pretty much went into this film with little by way of expectations  the reviews I remembered suggested that it wasn't all that good. However, I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. Sure, the all star cast were maybe on cruise control (although Hartnett and (particularly) Liu were moderately sparkling) and maybe the 'twist' was blatantly telegraphed ahead, and maybe there was nothing new, and maybe the attempt to justify one of the murders is a little shaky (as the protagonist could not have known what we learn  it was a murder of expedience. Watch out for it), and maybe it wasn't half as clever as it thought it was, but sometimes a movie can just be a movie without pretensions to being art, and can be no less enjoyable for that. This is a decent little film which may not be anyone's favourite film of all time but at least it isn't Speed 2. And that, of course, is a very good thing.",7,22,45,20 May 2007
Wayne's World," ...says what?
","This was really disappointing, insofar as it simply was not as funny as I remember it being ten years ago. Whether that is because the movie's ten years older or because I am I'm not sure (but it's not like I suddenly became mature or anything). I think that many of the gags have aged badly so, whilst there are still highlights (the James Bond style training camp gag is genius, and I always like the Oscar clip) there are too many bits which just don't work anymore (schwing! etc). However, you still have the Scooby Doo ending, Lara Flynn Boyle's scary mentalist and the scene with the cue cards, which make the whole endeavour worthwhile. And, of course, Alice Cooper.",7,0,1,8 January 2007
Monster," Not exactly a date movie...
","If you've seen Nick Broomfield's doc 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' then you'll know how uncannily accurate Charlize Theron's performance is in Monster, as the alternately terrifying and sympathetic Aileen Wuornos. Given the rest of her output, I'd be shocked if it isn't the defining performance of her career, but given the towering nature of it, most people would be glad to add it to their résumé. Monster is a bleak, depressing and harrowing film, and Theron is the centre of it. However, of equal importance is Christina Ricci, as she serves to balance Theron and give a dramatic hook to the story. As the plaudits showered upon Theron, I think Ricci was overlooked, as she also gives a terrific performance as the weak Selby, who is complicit in most of the crimes and thus just as much a Monster in many ways.Certainly the film takes liberties with the facts of the case, but so what? It is entertainment, not education. I am sure Wuornos' victims' families were not all happy that she was painted in such a way as to help understand her crimes rather than to simply vilify her for them, but as a disturbing picture of the evil that men and women do, Monster is top class.",8,3,3,8 October 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," Banal but for Bana.
","Light on accuracy, light on characterisation and light on point  this film is essentially a vaguely pretty piece of flimsy material. Taking a famed piece of history and weaving some interesting supposition around it is a good start, casting some fine (and fine looking) actors is a great second step. Leaving them with nothing to work with and having the most interesting character (Henry) as little more than an extended cameo is disappointing and silly.Johansson does her best with a tediously feeble Mary Boleyn, whose niceness quickly becomes insipid and annoying. Equally, Portman attempts to make Anne likable, when the script essentially has her as a spiteful bitch. Almost all the other characters are bland caricatures, with the exception of Bana's Henry, who would have been a great role if he'd had a few more scenes  powerful, conflicted and believable. Alas, this is a movie of poor decisions and the end product goes little better than Anne's marriage.",6,2,3,29 March 2008
Superbad," I was Evan!
","As a guy who spent a good (well, maybe not so good) few years trying to get drunk and being baffled by girls, Superbad was always going to entertain. The mighty McLovin really reminds me strongly of one of my more unfortunate friends, and Michael Cera's affable but girl-blind loser was just exactly like the rest of us. A laugh-out-loud-funny film with sweet rather than overblown performances at its heart and some excellent set piece situations that are still honest enough to resonate with your own pathetic life (especially if you've ever responded to a girl throwing herself at you by being paralysed like a deer in headlights!), Superbad is a top drawer film.",8,0,3,26 March 2008
Hot Fuzz," Shaun of the who?
","This film is spectacularly amusing. If you don't think so it is highly possible that you are, in fact, dead. Sorry if that's bad news but really, if you didn't laugh at this genius piece of film-making you've not much to live for anyway. All involved deserve some sort of gold star. Churlish gripe: it starts a bit slow. It may well be character building and set up the gags that come later, but it does drag the film down a mark or two. But when it gets going the laughs come thicker than Nick Frost's dumb country policeman (sorry, police officer) and faster than Simon Pegg's supercop's draw. The ensemble cast are wonderful, with Timothy Dalton rightly being singled out, the surprise gore and violence is effective and shocking, the direction and acting are spot on, and, well, any film that has an homage to Point Break surely must be watched and then watched again. Ace!",8,2,4,21 February 2007
Juno," Pretty much as good as you've heard
","Everyone likes Juno, don't they? I don't think I've heard a bad word said about it  and I'm not about to spoil that run. Was it Oscar-worthy? No, I'd say not  it's touch was a bit too light and the performances a little too studied in the attempts to be indie/cool, but it is a touching and sweet little comedy with great performances all round (I particularly liked Ellen Page and Jason Bateman) which managed to come across as not being judgemental despite the situations it covers (pregnancy, abortion, adoption, divorce, etc), rather simply portraying some interesting and vaguely kooky people with nice teeth in a tricky situation. Nice, exactly like the reviews said.",8,7,14,26 March 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Yo-ho!
","Not as good as the first, better than the second, basically more of the same: Johnny being brilliant, Keira being lovely, Orlando being largely useless. The plot is all over the place, and the ships seem to travel the oceans faster than a modern speedboat, but it remains a daftly enjoyable romp, and worth the entry fee just to see Cap'n Jack Sparrow doing what he does. I was disappointed that, following all the hype, Chow Yun Fat's Singaporean pirate lord Sao Feng is actually little more than a cameo, and offers little to the actual action. Other than Sparrow, the star of the film is actually the monkey, whose misadventures are genuinely excellent. The film ends with a couple of surprises (always nice, considering how predictable most films are) and certainly puts all the bits in place for a fourth film, but if this is actually the end I think we can all say thanks for the ride and agree we had a good time.",7,1,3,3 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Too many crooks spoil the broth
","This was very, very disappointing. I am a Marvel zombie and unashamed nerd, so whilst in some ways I am the hardest to please when it comes to comic book adaptations, at the same time I am always eager to enjoy, and am also enough of a cinephile to accept that changes need to be made when adapting material for a different medium. What I am trying to say is that I was disappointed in a balanced way, and I'm not about to start whining about Sandman shooting Ben Parker.OK, so, what was wrong? Things that could have been shown quickly were endlessly belaboured (did Kirsten Dunst get contractual screen-time?), things that deserved screen-time were rushed over (Topher Grace and Bryce Howard should get Dunst's agent!) and things that were utterly pointless (Sandman) were shoved into an already unwieldy plot. Whilst no one person was always guilty, much of the acting was very hammy, and the whole film was uneven. The biggest disappointment was that the dark Spidey storyline was interesting and the love triangle had potential, but it was all too much stuffed into too little.However, yes, Bruce Campbell's performance was amazing!",5,81,157,8 May 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Superb!
","How often does a film manage to be serious, meaningful and exciting? Be visually dazzling, inventive and put across a serious message? Contain childish flights of whimsy and sickening violence? Well, not that often, but this tour de force from Guillermo del Toro is one that does. This is an excellent movie based upon whatever criteria you wish to apply, although the most difficult criterion would be 'what's it like and is it better?' as it is quite unlike anything else. The fantasy sequences and characters are astonishing, and are used sparingly and so more effectively than you may anticipate from the trailer. This is far from Jim Henson's Labyrinth  a grim meditation on the evil that men may do rather than a happy-go-lucky coming of age parable, and is a film that truly explores the horrific darkness that lies at the heart of the best fairy tales. Not uplifting and not for kids, this is intelligent and serious cinema and is truly excellent.",9,2,4,16 January 2007
Nacho Libre," More Hardcore Holly than Hulk Hogan...
","I thought that this was disappointing. And, given that I had read reviews that said it was disappointing and thus went in with low expectations, that's not a good thing. The main disappointment of course, is that it could have been great  Jack Black as Mexican priest cum wrestler doing it for the orphans with a sidekick and a nun in tow  really, what's not to like? But, somehow (and by 'somehow' I mean 'due to misjudged direction') it didn't come off. Jack Black is like a wind-up toy when he's at his best, and you should just point him in the approximate direction you want and hope for the best, but Hess' films are all about little chuckles and being desperately indie and the two don't sit well. Because of this, when the film is funny it is jarring, as Ignacio (Black) seems to be two men  not a priest and a luchador, but a funny man and a not-very-funny man! Having said all of that  it isn't that bad. Worth a look if you liked Napoleon Dynamite (which I did) but I'd say rent, don't buy.",5,1,1,5 March 2007
Empire of the Sun," Uneven but entertaining
","I never saw this film on its original release, and have somehow missed it in the intervening years until now. I guess that there is nothing left to say about the eye-openingly mature performance that was given by Christian Bale (but it was!) so I'll (mostly) skip that. So, how was the film? Well, it strikes me that Japanese prisoner of war camps probably really were not that much fun. I appreciate that this was an all-ages film, and that demonstrating that the Japanese were just people too was part of the point, but I still feel that the overall terror and brutality of the situation was not as well conveyed as it should have been. The camp, as seen through Jim's eyes, seemed like a slightly grungy Butlins (well, not really, but you catch my drift). Bizarrely (for a self-professed movie fan) I've not seen Schindler's List either, and I am now even more curious to see how Spielberg handled that World War II story in comparison.",6,1,6,16 January 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Average film, great acting
","I may be missing something in this film (I suspect that my gender excludes me from the target demographic) but I saw it receive almost universal gushing praise on release, so thought I'd give it a go. And? Well, it's really pretty average, overall. Actually, in fairness, it can be looked at in two ways. First, the bad. The plot is flimsy, the message obvious, the structure by the numbers. It is a glam episode of Ugly Betty, but with no ugly people (at one outlandish point Anne Hathaway is called 'fat'?!) stretched to just under two hours. Nothing surprising happens at any stage. However, it is worth watching thanks to the good bits  the cast. Hathaway is very good and very watchable, if not massively convincing when in the dowdy phase. Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep, on the other hand, are both tremendous, with Streep excelling, and deserve the plaudits they received. Stanley Tucci is a little one dimensional, but also very endearing in his role. On the whole, this is an average film in which not much happens and is meant for a female audience, but the acting is of a high calibre so film fans in general could do worse than give it a spin.",7,0,0,12 February 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," See this film or die! (now that's an ultimatum...)
","The Bourne movies always make me wonder why so many movies are so poor. They always seem to be so effortlessly excellent, to deliver in all aspects of what they do, to be cool, thrilling, action-packed and exciting, even when they get to the threequel, What is it about Jason Bourne or Matt Damon that makes these films so good? No idea. They aren't even really based on the books, so you cannot look at the source material. Regardless of the cause, the result is a franchise that shows Ethan Hunt and James Bond up from almost any angle and is a contender for one of the strongest trilogies committed to film. Ultimatum is excellent in its own right (the Waterloo sequence is a classic of tension and cool) and a fitting end (if it is the end) to the series.",9,1,4,20 August 2007
The Thing," Standing the test of time
","I saw this for the first time this morning. Obviously I'd heard of it years ago, it being generally held as a classic and all, but had somehow never had the opportunity to watch it until I was loaned the DVD. Not being a massive fan of John Carpenter's work (Michael Myers and Snake Plissken don't really impress me) I wasn't expecting much, without even considering the 80s music and effects. However, in honesty, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst too many years have passed for the effects to scare or horrify, they at least manage to stay the right side of laughable, so there was no unintentional comedy. The cast was well chosen and stuck to their jobs, and the film was pleasingly bleak and effective. I am not sure that it is quite the classic that I'd been led to believe (maybe you had to see it in '82?) but it is a good solid movie, and worth a watch for anyone else who has gaps in their film history.",7,1,2,7 October 2006
American Psycho," Nice business cards...
","My first question after belatedly watching American Psycho is this: why isn't Christian Bale more revered? Every time I have seen him in a film he has been excellent, and as Patrick Bateman he was nothing short of electric. The film itself made a valiant stab at capturing the essence of the novel whilst also structuring it as a workable movie for the casual viewer, and was never going to be as jaw-dropping as the book. However, a top class cast and some shrewd writing and directorial decisions delivered a film that was better than I expected it to be, and Bale's mesmerising Bateman made sense of the pointlessness of his actions, creating a monster that needs no back-story  he is simply what he is and does what he does because he wants to. This lack of cohesive motive actually works in his favour and it was nice to see no compromise ending. Good film.",7,0,1,31 March 2007
Enchanted," Close your eyes and jump in the well...
","You know when your girlfriend says 'lets go see a film' and you say 'ok' but think to yourself 'damn, there's nothing out'? And then you get there and look at the 'Now Showing' board and you die a little inside? And, even though you are ace and your girlfriend is too, she says 'what about Enchanted?' And what you think is not really repeatable in a place where innocent young minds could be subjected to it? But you've driven to the cinema, so you may as well go in, so you do. And you thoroughly enjoy yourself watching an essentially harmless and goofy comedy, with great, shameless acting from Amy Adams and James Marsden. And it's all a bit silly and all a bit fun and not very cool but good all the same? Well, this was one of those times.",7,1,1,7 January 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Superb.
","In a word: awesome. What a great film. I saw this as my birthday movie (32! Damn!) and it was a real treat. It is hard to say anything new about this film  the acting, especially from Pitt and Affleck, was pitch perfect; the cinematography was sumptuous and beautiful; the score haunting and evocative; the direction assured and delicate, and so on  the complete package. This elegiac movie stands alongside the likes of The Unforgiven as a fantastic post-Western, which should be seen by all who have the patience to appreciate a slow but bravura effort which surely won't go home empty handed come awards time. Excellent.",9,2,4,7 January 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Not as great as you've heard
","When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent  visceral, terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older).",7,8,15,3 November 2007
Ghost Rider," Hell's baddies are no match for...anyone?
","The stated aim of Nic Cage and Mark Steven Johnson was to make a funny horror film, in the same vein as An American Werewolf in London. As a massive comics fanboy who is often blinded by that I still have to say  they didn't quite make it. However, Ghost Rider is still an enjoyable film, and certainly represents an improvement over Daredevil, Johnson's last Marvel outing. Cage is the star attraction, and his turn as Johnny Blaze strikes the right notes of comedy and confused sincerity, whilst Eva Mendes and Sam Elliott both give able support (and special mention to Mendes' breasts which virtually deserve a mention of their own on the cast list!) and, crucially, the look of the Rider has been nailed  an interesting mix of Blaze and Ketch, for those who know what that means. The big problem here is when they bring on the bad guys  all of whom are just a bit feeble, and are disposed of by GR with less fuss than swatting a fly. This lack of menace undermines the whole movie, as you never get a knock-down, drag-out scrap that you need to root for Ghostie in. Which is a shame, as with a tougher villain, this could have been a top film and, as it stands, it is just an enjoyable movie.",7,0,1,11 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not as bad as you've read!
","As soon as Bryan Singer jumped ship from X3, many critics seemed to start sharpening their claws, and I have read many less than flattering reviews of this film. What I cannot figure out, though, is why? It really is perfectly enjoyable, with surprises, good new additions (Beast is spot on) and well-executed set pieces. Is it as good as the first two films? Well, maybe not. Does Brett Ratner have a great track record? Well, maybe not. But is this, however, a terrible film? Not by a long shot. It is a bit muddled, which is hardly surprising with the merry-go-round of directors attached and the script seemingly based around who the biggest stars were at the time, but I think it is a worthwhile addition to the franchise and hope that Marvel decide to go for an X4.",7,0,1,7 October 2006
Stardust," Great fun and romance
","This was an unexpected pleasure. My lady is a big Gaiman fan and a big films-like-this fan, so the fact that we'd be going to see it was a no-brainer. The fact that it might just turn out to be thoroughly enjoyable did not occur to me. So, let's look at the bits: the direction was spot-on, dealing with the soppy and romantic bits with enough comedic or dramatic flair that, though never cynical, they were carried off with the right amount of tongue-in-cheek. The action delivered and the comedy was funny in the right bits. The weakest point of the cast was probably Claire Danes, and even she was engaging, believable and amusing. Pfeiffer's panto dame witch was a hoot, and De Nirowell, watch and learn. And laugh. Genius.Overall, the film had, for me, no weak bits. Well written, cast, acted and shot. Well edited. Wellwell, well everything. Never a work of art, and never a 'film of the year' contender, but the sort of enjoyable, entertaining and classy film that you wish happened more often than it actually does. They make it look easy but, like a falling star, things this fun are not that commonplace.",8,2,2,3 November 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," It's...OK.
","It's been a disappointing summer for sequels so far (Spidey 3 was poor, Pirates 3 was a little unsteady) and FF2 carried on the trend in some ways, but was probably the best blockbuster of the summer so far. Not that that is saying a great deal, given the level of competition. Basically, if you've seen and at any level enjoyed the first movie outing of Marvel's First Family, then you should see and enjoy this one (I didand did!) and if you didn't see it or did and thought it was lame then save yourself whatever the cost of seeing it may be. Like the first film, this has been harshly reviewed and has lots to enjoy  and stuff that will just annoy! It has more of the good (Johnny Storm), more of the unconvincing (she may be pretty, but I'm just not buying Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, and she's so obviously not a blonde), more of the poor (Ben Grimm) and more of the pretty good but ultimately a bit disappointing (Norrin Radd). I just hope it does well enough for a threequel and that they finally get it all the way right that time  third time's the charm.",6,1,3,21 July 2007
Transformers," Brain - roll out! Fun - roll in!
","After a series of disappointments this summer (Spidey 3, Pirates 3, FF2) I was not massively optimistic about this one, especially given the involvement of Michael Bay, despite the decent advance press I'd seen. Well, how wrong was I? This movie absolutely nails it, Bay does a terrific job, Shia LaBeouf is superb, the script is (deliberately) hilarious and the robotsahh, the robots! They're uniformly magnificent, setting a new high-water mark for CGI, and adding everything that they should to this thrill-ride. Speaking as a Transformers G1 toy geek (I can freely quote the mottos from the little stats card that was on the boxes  and Megatron was my favourite) I am totally at ease with the design and vehicle changes that have been made  movies are not toys and it isn't the 80s. Everyone should go see this film to make sure that they do the decent thing and start prepping the sequel immediately!",9,106,190,12 August 2007
Children of Men," Missed opportunity
","This feels like a missed opportunity. I suspect that there was enough in the story and, quite possibly, enough material left in the edit suite, to make this a really top class film. Unfortunately, the director opted for a heavy handed message (hey kids  war's bad, OK?) and a basic chase movie with a few interesting ideas chucked in, instead of a lot of interesting ideas and thoughts with some chases and explosions thrown in.Ultimately, it is actually a good film, which looks great and has well-judged performances, particularly from Clive Owen. I'd absolutely say it was worth watching. It is just disappointing that it could not exploit the full potential of the premise, so you tend to focus on what the movie doesn't do rather than what it does.",7,2,12,9 October 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Fair and balanced film - unlike the characters.
","The allegory in this serious piece from George Clooney would only be hard to spot if you were locked in an isolation chamber and were not watching the movie  otherwise it kind of hits you in the face with its politics. Is that a bad thing? Well, that depends on your politics, I guess. Personally, I kinda liked it. Whilst blunt, I thought it managed to avoid being preachy, and the actors all get chance to act. There are a couple of nice side-steps, and the characters all feel like real people. Oddly, it's mostly Clooney who looks somehow out of place, but that's a small gripe. This is the sort of film that is nobody's favourite film, and will probably be forgotten by history, but it's a nice little history lesson and, worryingly, will probably resonate with the times more often than it doesn't.",7,0,0,2 February 2008
Black Snake Moan," Equally sultry and silly
","In the interests of honesty, I'll state up front that my main (about 98%) interest in Black Snake Moan was the fact that it had Christina Ricci in it. Mostly naked. Okay, so, that said, let's get on with the film. This obviously has one of the most outlandish concepts that's been filmed in recent years: ageing, bitter, blues singer chains up trashy, abused nymphomaniac in his house in order to 'save' them both. I mean, really, who greenlit that?! Anyway, the end product is oddly tender, with a romantic message that somewhat flies in the face of the salacious set up. Sam Jackson is excellent throughout, and Ricci is both brave and effective (and, at times, unintelligible  I had to use subtitles once or twice to translate her drawl). It's been accused of copping out at the end, but such an odd story ought to be seen as a sort of fairy tale, and in that context it works and is, all round, pretty good. Oh, and Christina Ricci gets mostly naked!",8,1,4,14 October 2007
Blood Diamond," Chinese food of a film.
","A solid entry to the 'trials of post-colonial Africa' sub-genre, Blood Diamond is a bit like a lavish Chinese takeaway. It feels very good and is quite moving when you're watching it, the acting from DiCaprio and Hounsou is strong stuff and, as ever, Connelly is radiantly beautiful, but ten minutes after the film I feltnot much. Maybe it is just less affecting than Last King of Scotland, or, as someone without a diamond in the house, maybe the guilt trip it lays was less pressing than the unilateral Western shame of Hotel Rwanda. Either way, I think this is a solid and enjoyable movie, but less potent than the director and all-star cast were perhaps hoping for.",7,0,0,25 February 2007
Groundhog Day," Ned Ryerson!
","Until, well, today, Groundhog Day was one of those films that I knew I should have seen because everyone told me it was great but had never gotten around to. Well, now I have and I am glad that I did! Bill Murray's performance is as excellent as you would expect  wry, cynical, charming and, obviously, funny. Andie Macdowell is not horribly annoying in a break from the norm and the concept is attractive and well delivered. My only gripe is that Ned Ryerson needs his own film! What a genius character! I was praying for Murray to knock him out from the first moment he spoke. He's a spectacular comedic creation and really needs his own film, or maybe a spin-off TV show Anyway, good film, go buy.",8,1,3,8 January 2007
Inside Man," Entirely average but reasonably fun
","I watched this on a whim on a quiet Saturday night, and I'm pleased I did. It's not ground breaking and (despite being a Spike Lee film) doesn't really have anything to say. What it is is a slick, pacy, intelligent, crackling thriller with great performances from Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Denzel Washington. I would imagine that some viewers would be put off by the lack of a tidy resolution and some of the more contrived plot devices, but I was expecting nothing and was pleased with what I got. I'd be surprised to see it on anyone's Top 10 films, but it's a nice little heist film with enough plus points to be worth a watch. Oh, and Samantha Ivers' gobby bank customer is entirely entertaining in her interview midway through the film.",7,2,3,22 April 2007
Castle in the Sky," Top class Miyazaki
","My other half's a huge Miyazaki fan, so I've seen most of his films, but found that they got very samey after the first few I'd seen (and I suspect you can watch them in any order and get the same impression). Laputa, however, restored my interest. It is, of course, lovely to look at, as ever showing that 2D animation is different but not inferior to its CGI sibling. The story is classic Miyazaki (innocence, nature and kids vs badness, science and grown ups) but is much better than most (well, much better than Porco Rosso anyway) and it has flying pirates! What's not to like? If you enjoyed Howl's or Spirited Away, then definitely see this. If you've seen some Miyazaki and didn't like it, give this a try anyway - it has flying pirates!",7,1,2,16 September 2007
The Departed," Infernally good
","First things first  if you've not seen it, see Infernal Affairs (just the first one  no real need for the sequels). It doesn't matter if you see it before or after The Departed, but you should see it all the same. It is not quite the same film (with, for me, the biggest difference being in the interpretation of Damon's character) and is excellent.So, that out of the way, The Departed: what a great film! A top, top, top flight cast, with a top director and a top idea  as a cynic, for me it was set up to be a turkey, but luckily they got it right. Scorsese's pacing and control are spot on, Nicholson seethes and explodes as only Jack can, Damon is cold and controlled, Alec Baldwin (world's greatest actor, according to Kim Jong Il) is superbly fat and sweaty, Wahlberg is intense and dislikeable (in a good way) and Di Caprio gives, maybe, his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape? managing to convey the desperation and isolation that Costigan was feeling without resorting to melodrama.It is a long film but never drags and, despite having already seen Infernal Affairs first, still felt fresh and gripped me to the end. This is quality cinema, of a style that you don't get much of these days (that's right kids  no wire work or chicks doing kung-fu) and deserves to be seen and applauded.",9,0,0,2 November 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Powerful stuff.
","What's better than seeing a really good film? Seeing a really good film for free at an advance screening! The point was to get the film notice via word of mouth, and I am more than happy to do my bit. This is an excellent film, and Forest Whitaker totally deserves the Oscar buzz that he's got going  managing to make Idi Amin believably charming is the easy bit, but being terrifyingly monstrous without resorting to Paciono-esquire scenery chewing is a great achievement. The film perfectly strikes a difficult balance between accurately conveying the horror of the situation without using unrealistic Christ like characters, as Hotel Rwanda suffered from. James McAvoy's Nicholas is, essentially, not a pleasant character, but is the one to root for by virtue of being less bad than Amin. By making the characters believably flawed, the whole comes off as more powerful and moving than several similar movies, and is well worth seeing. Top class.",9,1,2,8 January 2007
The Queen," Better than I expected...
","I had no real interest in or desire to see this, despite the good reviews I'd heard. So, my advice would be, if you have no desire to see something that everyone says is good then take a chance  what's the worst that could happen? This is a well crafted, well acted and enjoyable piece, a speculation on recent British history and a remarkably balanced film that manages to steer a course through a contentious and emotive subject to present a mostly clear and unsentimental view. I was impressed. Helen Mirren got a load of plaudits, and rightly so, but Michael Sheen as Tony Blair deserves a lot of credit too. Overall, this is a very good film, and worth a look.",7,2,8,16 September 2007
Saints and Soldiers," Bleak and not really full of God
","This film was very heavily recommended to me, which usually sets you up to be let down. Still, not being a big fan of war films I still wasn't expecting much, but I was very pleased with what I got. Whilst not particularly new or original (war is hell, Germans are people too, other such revelations) this is a satisfyingly grim and bleak look at a grim and bleak time, well mode and beautifully photographed. Apparently some people found the film to be Mormon propaganda and, whilst I did find some of the Christian sentimentality to be a bit 'in your face' I'm not sure what makes it Mormon as opposed to any other faction of that particular delusion. And it didn't detract from the story sowho cares? My biggest gripe was the daftly stereotypical Englishman, a caricature that threatened to unbalance the good work done elsewhere in creating a sense of reality, but overall this was a well shot, well acted and enjoyable film.",7,2,6,23 June 2007
Iron Man," As good as a man of steel!
","When the Iron Man movie was announced, I was unusually ambivalent (unusual as I'm a massive comics nerd with a ton of IM comics amongst my megaton collection). Casting news and rumours still failed to spark in my imagination (possibly as the scars of the execrable Spider-Man 3 had me fearing the comic movie bubble had burst). Then the news that Robert Downey Jnr came through and I thought 'Mmmmminteresting'. Then, well, then came the first trailer  a riot of action, tongue in cheek humour, spectacle, rock n' roll and, in Tony Stark, possibly the best realised alter ego since Christopher Reeve first arrived in Metropolis. Against my usual efforts to not get my hopes up, I began to look forward to Iron Man, and by the time that I saw it, my expectations were huge. And, most shockingly of all, it totally delivered on all counts. This is, for my money, the best superhero film since Superman II. That's all I've got to say. If you haven't seen it, rectify that right now!",9,2,4,31 May 2008
Blade Runner," Genius.
","This was far from the first time that I'd seen Blade Runner, but it was the first time I'd seen the so-called 'final cut'. And it was great! I understand, but don't generally condone, directors wanting to revisit and polish their great works (the obvious example being Lucas' mutilation of Star Wars) but here Ridley Scott has done little more than put his picture in a shiny new frame  it's the same great piece of art, but it's a little better presented. I'll not list all the tweaks  lists of them are easy to come by  but I'll happily confirm the general opinion that the tweaks are seamless, as they should be. A great film, made a smidge more great. It doesn't get much more satisfying than that.",9,0,1,2 February 2008
Casino Royale," Finally...Bond is back.
","The whole debate about this movie seems to have been whether or not Daniel Craig would make a good Bond, without anyone really pointing out the two sides of the coin. I guess those who, like me, think that he was great in the role, have maybe read the books and remember Bond as a cold-hearted predator (whether killing or seducing) with no time for love, Dr Jones! The people who thought he was rubbish are probably devoted to the films which, over the last 21 movies, have pretty much established the wise-cracking, eyebrow-raising, faintly camp ladies man which Daniel Craig quite positively isn't. (There's also the folk moaning about Chris Cornell's opening song, which I also thought was fine.) So, putting that burning issue aside, what of the movie? Well, overall I thought it was great. Not perfect by any means (a few scenes go on too long, and a slightly shorter running time may have made the movie tighter), but thoroughly enjoyable and both a reinvention and return to form of Britain's best special agent. To those moaning that this somehow isn't a Bond film, I ask 'why not?' It has Aston Martin's, death, pretty girls (Eva Green has some rather eye-catching dresses!), casinos, bad buys, M, and some crazy stunts. Sure, there's no Q and no lame jokes, but are they needed? No, not at this point. This is a top notch Bond film, or, indeed, just a top notch film anyway and, once the dust has settled, will most likely be listed up there with Goldfinger as one of Bond's best.",8,0,3,8 January 2007
Beowulf," Beowulf in sheep's clothing?
","Hmmm, an exciting proposition. The director of some of the most enjoyable films of the last three decades in Zemeckis, the writer of some of the most original material in the last three decades in Gaiman, a crop of talented and award-winning actors and a source material so strong that they've been talking about it for a thousand years or so. A winning proposition? You'd think. But, overall, only Gaiman held up his end of the deal for me (neatly covering over the less than cinematic portions of the original text) as this all came together in an oddly flat and somewhat pointless exercise. I think maybe the much vaunted motion-capture performances were what turned me off, as I felt no connection or sympathy with any of the characters. Oh, it was all beautifully rendered and all of that malarkey, but I like my special effects to have a point and I'm not really sure what the point of mo-cap is. It took the heart out of this piece anyway (like tearing the heart from a fabled dragon), leaving a pretty but pointless two hours behind. Oh, quick footnote: Grendel, as portrayed by Crispin Glover, is an absolute show-stealer, and is almost worth the price of admission alone.",6,0,1,25 November 2007
Munich," Mumbled mess
","In the interests of making it appropriate, I should probably make this review go on for ages and include a lot of heavily accented muttering and be really obvious in what I am trying to communicate with little by way of anything novel or new in there. At the same time, I should probably have a strong central effort to it, and make the whole thing look pretty. And that, pretty much, would be a fair summation of this mixed-bag from Spielberg. The subject matter was interesting and could have been substantially more thought provoking than it was. Eric Bana was good throughout, but the surrounding cast seemed a little muddled, and whilst the attempt to show a fluid morality was praiseworthy, the end result was just a bit flat and cold. Additionally, a good 30 minutes could probably have been lost without harming the end product. On reflection, I seem to have given the film a bit of a kicking, but that is probably just mainly down to disappointment, as it promised but did not deliver.",6,2,8,3 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I love this film!
","I suspect, given the billions of words already written on the subject, that there's nothing new for me to say about Star Wars. As a kid I watched this film so often (on our old Betamax video) that, like everyone, I could quote the whole script, word perfect. I have literally seen this film hundreds of times, and still get goosebumps when Luke switches off his targeting computer. I watched it again in honour of the 30th anniversary (the original theatrical cut on DVD, with, importantly, Greedo not getting a shot off!) and it was, as ever, great entertainment. Best film ever? No (for myriad reasons). Favourite film ever? Unquestionably!",9,0,0,3 June 2007
300," The truth is NOT the point
","First things first: this film rocks! And it rocks hard. Visually stunning. Viscerally exciting. Seemingly shot not, as claimed, digitally, but in fact assembled out of pure testosterone, 300 is a hard case and no mistake. One review that I read suggested there was little by way of character development, but that misses the point  this is history as myth, so archetypal characters are painted with broad strokes  there is no need for nuances. The story is this: 300 immensely tough guys fight off 1,000,000 less tough guys for three days. And that's it. What's their motivation. Well, conquest for the million and not being beaten despite ever-so-slightly unfavourable odds for the 300. Who needs backstory? Another criticism I've seen is overuse of slo-mo, but my assumption was that this was in homage to the graphic novel, allowing some scenes to come almost to a standstill, a tribute to Frank Miller's art. Again, I felt it worked well. Another criticism is that it promotes a USA/western European agenda against Iran. Clearly this makes perfect sense as the Persians didn't sweep across Europe conquering everyone in their path and there is no room in art for telling stories from one perspectivehang on, that's stupid! Once again, this is history as myth. It is not an accurate portrayal of facts, and makes no pretence about this. If you see a subtext that involves the Spartans sneakily thieving Persian oilfields you are an imbecile.Whilst primarily I'd say this was a guy film, my girlfriend thought it was great too. Simply, if you liked Sin City and are able to appreciate different forms of storytelling you'll love this. Go see!!!",9,0,5,2 April 2007
The Simpsons Movie," D'oh!
","The last movie I watched was the hysterically funny (for all the right reasons) Transformers, but obviously I expected this to eclipse that. Bluntly, it didn't. At its best, it prompted a smile, maybe even a snigger, but this was nowhere near the best that the Simpsons can be. Whereas the best episodes feel like 40 minutes of material stuffed into 20 minutes of episode, bursting at the seams with content and comedy, this film felt like 40 minutes of material stretched out over 80 minutes of film. There was no pace, no zip, no zing, and, almost, no characters!?! Homer was always going to be the centre of the film (and rightly so) but where on earth was the rest of the town? (Okay, I know, they were under the big dome  it was a rhetorical question). Why no real time for Apu, Mr Burns, Mrs Krabapple and the rest? Basically, this was an average Simpsons episode that went on a bit. Still funny in places, but very disappointing when you think what might have been. Oh, and in case you missed it, there are infrequent, subtle hints about environmental issues",6,3,5,12 August 2007
