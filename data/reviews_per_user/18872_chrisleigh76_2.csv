Hereditary," Disappointing
","I was really looking forward to this film and avoided reading any reviews so as not to be swayed or influenced in any way..... I needn't have bothered! It just isnt scary in any way, shape or form and for the majority of the film, nothing happened. A couple of moments during the film I jumped a little but over all, I could not wait for it to be over. The ending is ridiculous too.",3,1,3,15 June 2018
Aladdin," Great film
",I seem to be one of few who didn't rate the cartoon so don't feel it necessary to compare the two. It's a great film and Will Smith as the genie is funny and camp. Go see it; you don't be disappointed.,9,5,17,23 May 2019
