Vertigo," Eternally haunting movie, with perfect performances.
","I first saw this movie the year it came out; I was 14.  I must have seen it at least a half-dozen times since, and it still intrigues me.  I thought from the beginning that it was a masterpiece; what took the U.S. critics so long to figure it out?  (The Europeans were way ahead of us!)  How strange, also, that Kim Novak's performance was trashed by critics; now she is praised.  Also, what a tribute it is to her performance and Stewart's that they are totally believable as lovers, though he's a good twenty-five- to thirty years her senior. And Bernard Herrmann's music is so dominant a factor, without overpowering the performances or the story.  This, on a scale of 1 to 10, deserves a15.",10,4,5,18 September 1999
