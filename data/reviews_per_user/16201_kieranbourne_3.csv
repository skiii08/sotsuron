Hereditary," I want my wasted hours back
",After seeing this film tonight it's hard to believe that anyone else could have ever enjoyed it. It's not remotely scary and actually has more laughs than frights. I simply don't understand the hype at all.,3,1,4,22 June 2018
Spider-Man 3," Bad Start
","You know when you've done something wrong or really bad as in the case of Sam Raimi and Spiderman 3 and someone says there not angry with you, but just disappointed? This is what the whole cinema felt like last night. It was an exhausting experience which felt like it was never going to end. The film spends so much time on character development but fails because of the vast amount of characters, thus half of the film is wasted. Apparently the cast were recalled earlier this year to add more action scenes, yet there were still few and far between. It's big year of blockbusters this year which relies heavily on third installments, so far Terminator 3 and The Matrix Revolutions spring to mind rather than Return of The King or Revenge of The Sith. Bad start Spidey.",5,1,3,5 May 2007
War of the Worlds," Where's the war?
","The film is more about a man's personal family tragedy and it ignores the considerably larger issue, that being the fact that martians are taking over the world. There is a distinct lack of action in the film, to be honest there isn't really a war at all, the war goes on while Cruise roams from town to town hiding away, perhaps Spielberg was trying to avoid the film turning into independence day so he wanted to cut out a war. Once again Spielberg presents us with a torn up American family, he seems to be on this never ending quest to criticise the American family, sadly the family issues in this film become bigger than what the film really should be about and i was glad that the film came to such an abrupt end because the film wasn't worthy of having a good ending. In a TV appearance on channel 4 Spielberg said he didn't want it to be a Sci-fi movie but socio-logical, psychological, individual struggle in times of turmoil, pity. On a more happier note there is one good thing about the film, that being the King Kong trailer before it.",6,8,17,3 July 2005
