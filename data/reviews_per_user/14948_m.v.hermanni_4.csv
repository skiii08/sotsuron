Minority Report," two flaws that let the movie fail
","The whole idea is pretty interesting but the movie introduces at least two flaws into the story that killed it for me: 1 the prevented murders are not murders, the victims live, period. Society could treat the suspects different to actual murderers and probably would, eg. psychotherapy, counseling, social help/adjustment program etc.That they - without difference and as it seams without trial - put the suspects in an artificial coma is not made plausible, especially as this whole thing happens as an experiment in one state of the united states.2. Another real obvious flaw is to me, that that the trick to cover up a murder by 'blinding' the clairvoyants/the precrime system with some reenactment (or whatever, it does not matter) to actually commit the murder without being caught *before* just leads to: a committed murder. Did this justice system just assumed there are no murders and stopped investigating missing persons? So for me 5 stars for the effort.",5,4,7,17 September 2016
The Godfather: Part II," Much to positive regarding the mafia.
","In my opinion, 'The Godfather 2' is much to positive regarding the mafia, even sympathetic to it.With the two layers of the narrative, the rise of Vito Corleone, caring and with a loving wife, cut against Michael Corleone, struggling and living in disharmony, the movie actually portraits the changes to society that had taken place between the pre-war and post-war society and between Sicily and America as something bad. It follows a 'The Good old times 'clichÃ©, which is in itself already ideology of the mafia.This motive is already present in the first movie, but more subtle: Michael finds his true love in an uneducated, maybe underage Sicilian women, that is pimped by her parents to this mighty man and he only returns to the educated, working girlfriend in America because a) his true love has been killed and b) after 1 year he found no other option in the USA.Especially the portrait of Michael's wife shows a huge anger against women, who are not completely obedient to their husband: This women performs an abortion, because she does not want to give another air to her husband.This is the same kind of stuff the trials against witches of the middle ages are made off: it is pure hatred and an attempt to link independence of a women to wickedness and insanity.So in my opinion, the movie is poisoned by the material it tries to put on screen - and this is a warning to every cinematographer, that the subject of a movie is not to be taken easy, the subject might dominate. If it is about power like with the mafia, it might taint the whole result.",6,3,13,10 October 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Premise of the Terminator Story is flawed
","One Remark about the basic premise of the whole Terminator Series, but particular of this last episode: The last thing that would survive a nuclear war is Machines and Technology. The Authors show no clue if they know what large Infrastructure and Economy is modern day Technology based upon.Where are the Power Supplies, Factories, Mines, where is the transportation System and the Research Facilities to give any power at all to the Skynet System? It would have nuked out its own Requirements to exist by destroying mankind with nuclear weapons. So 'The rise of the machines' would have been the end of any advanced machine and technological progress on earth.Instead, in Reality, the growing Power of Machines over Mankind is exercised through shaping Society according to the needs of Machines and Technology, not by simply destroying human Lives. I would have liked to see that Twist going somewhere into the series Finale (so eg. by preventing the nuclear War, Connor actually helps the Machines to seize Control) - well it did not and the Script stayed true to the Vision of the first and second Terminator Movie.",7,1,3,1 January 2008
300," fantastic visual style in every detail and a questionable ideology
","While 300 delivers beautiful pictures, the story told and the means chosen follow a rather questionable artistic vision: The characters are either warriors, born, beautiful and eager to sacrifice their life or corrupted.The Persian emperor Xerxes is shown as the great tempter to corruption just like the biblical devil. This corruption is reflected in physical degeneration to the point that the army of Xerxes largely consists of beasts, cripples and monstrosities.For example: Some Priests that the Spartan King visits to get a hint what to do by their oracle, are struck by a skin disease and the narrator describes them as old, diseased, inhuman, rotten and finally moral corrupt. One points to the other, from the obvious to the hidden. Of course the priests are in league with Xerxes and deliver deceptive advise.In opposition to that, the Spartan Warrier Elite are male Superheros with perfect looks and superior faith, prepared for any sacrifice.This idea of fitness, that (only) in a perfect male body a perfect soul lives, is something that is attributed to the antique Greece. But this idea stands in strong opposition to modern western ideology.300 is aware of that opposition and this is shown by the struggle of the Spartan Queen at the Heimatfront against the spartan Council. In this Parliament so called politicians are listening to deceptive speeches while the King acts and dies for their freedom. The Queen succeeds only by stabbing her opponent in the Council to death, who has been bribed by Xerxes with gold.While Western democracy traces its roots to antique Greece democracy, 300 suggests the opposite: That the Greece fought and died to defend their honor and freedom of Kings, holy oaths and sacrifice against a weak system of personal interest and debate prone to corruption.Western ideology draws a line between beauty and truth, to the point that what is beautiful is considered to be a lie. For us, awful and truth goes together well. For us, truth is a matter of words, not of action. Antique Greece Ideology considered a connection between physical beauty and truth, but the goal of their thinking has been truth as well and they used words to find it. That is one source of western philosophy and culture.By turning around this relationship between spirit and body, declaring physical beauty and sacrifice a material and therefore only real sign of truth, picturing words as misleading and a means for corruption, 300 cannot convince today. Mankind has 2000 years more experience to know better than that.",7,3,5,12 January 2008
