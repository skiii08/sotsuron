Hereditary," Disappointing ending
",I really enjoyed this film....until the strange and disappointing end.,6,0,1,6 March 2019
Mother!," Very strange film
","I can't really decide if I like this film or hate it. It's very strange and I watched it over two nights, as it's quite heavy. On balance, it's probably average if I've had to give it so much thought.",6,1,4,8 March 2018
