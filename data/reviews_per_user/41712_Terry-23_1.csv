The Ring," Problems, yes. Unanswered questions, no. Spoilers.
","Yes, there were some plot holes in this movie, but a perfect picture is a rare thing.The acting was okay, and the suspense was good at times, but could have been better.  I'm interested to see the original and make comparisons.The horse scence on the ferry was quite well done, but didn't add much to the movie as a whole.  Things are a little fuzzy at times, but that's life. Not everything is clean cut.Every review I've read so far has stated there were unanswered questions, the ending didn't make sense.  Sure it did.  The key is that Samara wanted to be heard.  The tape was a form of chain letter.  Pass it on or die. Everyone hears her and she'll go away.Not a top ten film, but not a waste of money either.  And there are a couple of homages to Hitchcock films as well.",7,0,0,27 October 2002
