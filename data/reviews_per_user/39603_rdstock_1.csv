The Blair Witch Project," Don't Believe the Hype
","This 'movie' is really a student short that was stretched to feature length. Absolutely nothing of interest or even remotely scary happens in the first hour (unless you have an inordinate fear of dying of boredom).  The characters are so annoying (especially Heather) that you begin to wish the witch will come kill them.  At one point (semi-spoiler warning), when one of the characters disappears I actually wondered if perhaps he had left to go find a better movie.  The ending (which is purported to be 'disturbing') is utterly predictable and was foreshadowed about as subtly as Oliver Stone would have done.I'm not exaggerating when I say that no one, not ONE person in the theater I was at ever once gasped or cried out in fear.  When the lights came on, however, I did see many people (like myself) looking rather disappointed and annoyed for having paid $8.50 for this over-hyped, un-scary, boring dreck. A two-star flick at best.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
