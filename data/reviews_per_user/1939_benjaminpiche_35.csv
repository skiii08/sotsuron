The Avengers," Insanely Entertaining
","Every person has a popular movie or franchise from their teen years that they cherish with all their heart. Depending on your age and preferences, yours may vary. For some, it may be Star Wars. Other will claim it's Back to the Future, or the Batman movies. Some might even say Indiana Jones.For me, it's gotta be the Avengers.What Joss Whedon pulled off with this movie is nothing short of extraordinary. He takes all of these larger-than-life characters, each with their own backstory, and makes them share the screen in a cohesive manner. The Avengers is funny, epic and, most importantly, revolutionary. It doesn't quite get five stars, because I believe Marvel has proven that they can do even better since, but this movie is still an absolute blast every time I watch it (and boy do I watch it way too often...).",9,0,0,6 November 2019
Iron Man 3," An enjoyable mixed bag
","Things I like about Iron Man 3 :1. It's the MCU's Christmas movie (duh) ;
2. Tony Stark's Avengers PTSD storyline, and the fact that it's a much more personal movie in terms of character development ;
3. Happy being the forehead of security ;
4. The House Party and Clean Slate protocols.Things I don't like about Iron Man 3 :1. The EXTREMIS storyline and the bad guys on fire ;
2. Guy Pearce's Killian being somewhat forgettable as a villain ;
3. Some annoying side characters (the gum-chewing bad guy and the television van guy, for example) ;
4. The twist. Or do I really? This is what frustrates me about this movie : there is so much stuff that I love about it that I don't know if my mind is making excuses for the Mandarin or not. The fact of the matter is this : Guy Pearce is as generic a villain as they get, and I would have rather had Ben Kingsley as the main antagonist. As a whole, the movie is undeniably flawed ; but I love Robert Downey Jr. in this role so much that this remains one of my most rewatched MCU movies.",7,0,2,18 April 2020
Meet the Parents," 'I have nipples, Greg. Can you milk me?'
","My dad is a tough laugh when it comes to comedies. It's just not his cup of tea, for the most part. So when he told me that Meet the Parents was one of the funniest films he had ever seen, I knew that we had to watch it together.He was right. This movie is a ton of fun, with great dialogue and fantastic gags. Ben Stiller is perfect in this everyday guy type of character to which you can relate, and Robert de Niro does what he always does and gives a very funny, underrated performance. Also, how can you dislike a movie in which Owen Wilson gives us one of his signature wows?If I had to complain about anything in this film, it would be that it leaves its biggest question unanswered by the end of it : can you indeed milk Robert de Niro?",8,1,1,28 March 2020
Iron Man 2," An entertaining sequel
","To me, Iron Man 2 feels like the closest thing to a Michael Bay movie in the Marvel universe. The plot is at times pretty messy, and the action scenes, though filled with glare and explosions, often feel soulless compared to most of the MCU's subsequent work.With that said, I still like this movie simply because RDJ owns the character of Tony Stark, and seeing him in the franchise's earliest films is always an absolute blast. A character arc like his is pretty much unheard of.",6,0,0,5 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," An MCU Comedy... And That's OK
","When I reviewed Guardians of the Galaxy earlier in my Marvel rewatch, I wrote that 'one of its greatest strengths is also the humour : just enough to keep you entertained, not so much that the movie becomes a parody of itself like MCU films further down the line'. I'm going to be honest here : I had Thor : Ragnarok in mind when writing this.The first two times I watched this movie, that is exactly how I felt. I thought that they went way overboard with the humour, and that they sacrificed too much of what made Thor Thor in doing so. I never disliked the film entirely (it still was my favorite of the trilogy) and I had fun with it every time, but something was off. And, with my third watch tonight, I recognize that I was wrong.Why do we watch Marvel films? Is it because they're great pieces of art? Because we want to explore profound themes through the filmmaker's vision? No. We watch Marvel films because a) they are impactful cultural events and b) they provide great sources of entertainment. Thor, the mighty God of Thunder is just 'dumb' fantasy, and Taika Waititi understands that. He crafted a movie that is incredibly fun, occasionally laughing at the genre. No other filmmaker alive could have brought the same level of energy, and thus entertainment value, that he did.My point is that Ragnarok is not to be taken too seriously. Because not all comic book films should. We would live in a very grim world if all we had were Logans and Jokers. The humour goes a bit overboard, sure, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't have an awesome time with this one. And you would too.",9,2,4,27 June 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Endlessly Rewatchable
","Out of the numerous casting calls that Marvel has done since they launched their cinematic universe, two stand out to me : Robert Downey Jr. (obviously) as Tony Stark and Tom Holland as Peter Parker. In my opinion, there is no debate as to who is the best live-action incarnation of the character.This film is just so much fun, I never get bored of watching it. A lot of that is due to the fact that Tom Holland owns his part, succeeding at playing a believable high schooler much better than Maguire or Garfield. Micheal Keaton is equally awesome as the Vulture, and his scenes with Holland are my favorites of the entire movie, especially when they don't have their suits on. Their dynamic is a big part of why I love this film so much.I heard people complain about how Tony Stark's presence in the movie casts a shadow over Spider-Man. I personally don't mind the handling of their relationship at all : in fact, I believe that he is seen just enough for the purpose of driving their relationship forward, but not too much to steal the spotlight. Really, there are few things to complain about when it comes to Spider-Man : Homecoming.",9,0,0,19 June 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," An Action-Packed MCU Thriller
","What's not to like about this movie? It tells a very personal story for Steve Rogers, one that explains where he stands later on in the Civil War. It is much more grounded than the first one, which is also a nice change of pace after watching some of the previous movies in the MCU. I love when the series goes in that direction, which is why this one is right up there with Iron Man in my current ranking.I still have to rank this one slightly below the MCU's first film, simply because I just have more fun when watching Tony Stark's origin story. However, it's my third favorite so far, and I am pretty sure that it will end up in my top ten.",8,1,1,23 April 2020
Doctor Strange," A Pleasant Surprise Every Time
","Doctor Strange is in a weird place when it comes to my preferences in the MCU : every time I watch it, I am reminded of how much I love this movie, but at the same time, it is very rarely the one that I choose to put on over something more light-hearted like Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor : Ragnarok. This makes it very hard to rank this film in my Marvel list.The obvious MVP here is the VFX team, who did a spectacular job making this magical world come to life. The action sequences are honestly some of the best of any MCU movie. Also, the performances are spot-on : Benedict Cumberbatch kills it as Stephen Strange, and the other cast members play their roles to near-perfection. I would complain, however, that the pacing is an element that could have been improved, especially in the first act when they set up Strange's character a little bit too quickly for my personal taste.However, Doctor Strange is another amazing addition to Marvel's stacked lineup, and I can't wait to see what Sam Raimi will do with the sequel in 2022.",8,1,1,28 May 2020
Interstellar," Nolan's ambition is hypnotizing in Interstellar
","From the moment I pressed play on my television remote last night, my eyes were glued to the screen in fascination, stunned by the extraordinary ambition of one of this era's greatest filmmakers. My mind was captivated by his thought-provoking and moving story, and my senses were assaulted by my favorite composer's incredible score and the astoundingly beautiful cinematography of Interstellar.When the screen turned black and the credits rolled, I suddenly felt numb, amazed at the impact movies like this can have on an individual's mind and his point of view on the world.Fifty-something years ago, during the golden age of space exploration, people gazed at the stars with a sense of wonder, thinking about all the secrets that are just beyond our reach, awaiting to be discovered. But as time passed and no more men escaped the pull of Earth's orbit, this idolized view of the cosmos started to fade. For younger generations, like mine, exploring space is more the stuff of textbooks than real-life discovery. While humanity's understanding of the universe is expanding more rapidly than ever, it has become an activity for scientists to sink their teeth into; it is no longer a concern for normal people. As McConaughey puts it, we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.With Interstellar, I think that Nolan wrote an hommage to humanity's sense of discovery, an ode to the great days of space exploration, while also pondering its future, and how it will undoubtedly play a crucial in the survival of mankind. I believe that those who fault the movie for being unrealistic are missing the point; after all, it's still science-fiction.Interstellar is in my opinion one of the most ambitious movies ever made, and it deserves all the praise for that. It's a movie I'm already dying to rewatch, and I think it fully deserves its five-star rating.",10,0,1,30 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An Enjoyable Mess
","Yes, this movie is a gigantic mess. It moves so fast that you don't have time to let the emotional moments sink in. It introduces plot elements that don't make much sense in the grand scheme of things from the second sentence of the title crawl. It tries to 'correct' The Last Jedi a bit too much. At this point, you've heard the criticism for this film, and I have to agree with most of it.But at the same time, this is Star Wars : it's a fun adventure that moves at a frenetic pace, it features great actors giving great performances, and I believe it delivers the closure we needed to cap off this sequel trilogy. It's a movie that's fun to look at if you allow yourself to shut down your brain for some of the WTF moments it contains.What's frustrating with this movie is that it makes it painfully obvious that Disney and Lucasfilm had no idea where they were going from the start and they just made stuff up along the way. In the words of the great Michael Scott : Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going ; I just hope I find it along the way.' This is pretty much the sequel trilogy in a nutshell.There are moments in the movie in which I can almost see JJ Abrams, sitting in his director chair, staring at Rian Johnson with lightning bolts coming out of his eyes. Love or hate The Last Jedi, once it got released, it became part of the Star Wars canon, and Abrams should have tried to build upon it instead of seemingly clearing the slate in the first half-hour of this movie. What follows isn't terrible like some people claim it is, but it's still nowhere near the payoff we expected since The Force Awakens.In the end, this is how I will look back on this sequel trilogy : 1) It was my first time experiencing Star Wars in a theater and feeling the thrill that comes with each new release and 2) It was a highly enjoyable, but incoherent adventure in this amazing world. My only wish for the next trilogy is this : I want George Lucas, Kathleen Kennedy, Taika Waititi, Krysty Wilson-Cairns and heck, even Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni (who did a pretty damn good job with The Mandalorian) to sit down for a while, and map out their plan for the upcoming story they want to tell. That's all.",6,1,9,10 May 2020
"Monsters, Inc."," A Forgotten Childhood Classic
","One of Pixar's most original work that often goes under the radar when discussing the studio's impressive filmography, Monsters Inc. is both funny and heartwarming, and crafts an astounding story about the beasts that hide in our closets.",9,0,0,21 March 2020
Ant-Man," One of the MCU's Funniest
","Man, they could have had Michael Pena narrate the entire thing from beginning to end and it would have been the best thing ever. Just kidding, but he was an absolute scene-stealer.I think I had forgotten how fun and fresh Ant-Man is. Paul Rudd is terrific in the lead role, and almost every single secondary character is great. The humour is on point and never exaggerated, the pacing is formidable and the action scenes are all very fun. If only it had a more developed villain, it would be much higher in my MCU ranking, but it remains one of the most fun entries in the universe.Not going to lie, though, this particular viewing kind of got overshadowed by the spectacular trailer we got for Christopher Nolan's Tenet, my most anticipated movie of the year, this evening...",7,0,0,22 May 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," The star-spangled man with a plan is solid
","The year was 2014 when I watched my first ever Marvel movie in theaters, Guardians of the Galaxy. Before that, I saw some of the phase one movies out of order, renting them at my local video store, but I wasn't really aware that they were part of a bigger universe. Watching all of them in release order for the first time makes me realize how fun it must have been to puzzle the pieces together, film after film, year after year, for day one fans.The star-spangled man with a plan has an pretty good origin story, but his counterpart, the Red Skull, really doesn't, which is probably my main critique of this movie. Otherwise, it's a very fun film, though still the weakest in Cap's trilogy by a margin.The ending, however, is one of the most memorable in the MCU for sure.",7,1,1,14 April 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," A movie to make you smile
","It's been more almost an hour since I finished watching this movie, and I'm still smiling like an idiot.This is exactly what I needed right now, a film that's both funny and heartwarming, that has fantastic, quirky characters (Steve Carell is always awesome) and that will cheer you up like few others ever will. The social commentary is perfectly inserted in the movie, in a subtle way that don't even make you think about it until it's over because it's so entertaining. I mean, this film has it all.",9,0,0,4 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The Harry Potter Spinoff We Wanted
","Fantastic Beasts has a charming cast and succeeds at recapturing the magic of the Wizarding World, while still giving this new franchise a flavour of its own.",7,0,0,5 January 2020
Dirty Dancing," Fun Cult Classic
","With about thirty minutes left in this movie, I had my rating set at two-and-a-half stars, a rating I usually give to the movies that aren't particularly bad, but are also pretty forgettable. And then the final scene happened, and I thought to myself 'You know what? This movie is a lot of fun after all!' and then proceeded to raise my rating to give Dirty Dancing a passing grade.And that last song has been stuck in my head ever since.",6,1,1,24 April 2020
Amadeus," Mozart's Life... According to his Rival
","With its stunning costumes and breathtaking music, Amadeus is extremely pleasing to the senses, but its greatest strength resides in the genius of having one of the greatest composers of all time's story told from his biggest rival's point of view.",8,0,0,26 February 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," My Introduction to the MCU... and a Very Good One!
","Granted, I might be biased towards this particular film when it comes to my MCU ranking because it's the first one I ever saw in theaters and the one that got me invested into this universe. For many years, it held the title of my favorite Marvel movie, and to this day I would place it in my top three.I mean, Guardians has it all : an engaging plot, compelling and quirky characters, one of the best usage of a soundtrack ever and massive implications for the rest of the universe. One of its greatest strengths is also the humour : just enough to keep you entertained, not so much that the movie becomes a parody of itself like MCU films further down the line. Peter Quill's introduction to Redbone's Come and Get Your Love is somehow one of my favorite scenes in the whole franchise, as it establishes the perfect tone for these characters and this world. I have a blast every time I watch this movie, and today was no exception.Oh, and also, Drax the Destroyer is one of the coolest character names I have ever heard. He is pretty funny too.",10,0,0,30 April 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Another Fantastic Avengers Movie
","To me, Age of Ultron is the weakest Avengers film. That doesn't mean it's bad : on the contrary, it's an awesome movie and I always have a blast when watching it, but it doesn't have that special something that the others have.I love the additions Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, the Hawkeye storyline and the fact that this is probably the most character-driven Avengers movie, but at the same time, there are certain things that don't quite stick the landing for me. I feel like Vision's origin story is a little bit rushed, and for that reason I have never felt very attached to him in any of the following movies. Ultron is also a little weak in my opinion (I much preferred Loki in the original Avengers).Anyway, complaints aside, the action is fantastic, the stakes are high and Age of Ultron is another superb addition to Marvel's stacked library.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Toy Story," Revolutionary
","Emotional, funny and clever all at once, Pixar's revolutionary first feature gave audiences no shortage of iconic moments - and set the bar sky high for family entertainment in the years following.",9,2,2,26 January 2020
Toy Story 2," Pixar Did It Again
","A sequel that arguably improves upon its predecessor, Toy Story 2 is more thematically rich than the original as it dives deeper into the origins of Woody and adds compelling new characters, while reaching new heights in terms of animation.",9,1,1,2 February 2020
La La Land," An Inspiring Masterpiece
","Yesterday marked the first time that I sat down and watched La La Land from start to finish without interruption. I had seen bits and pieces before, as my sister has worn out this blu-ray over the past three or so years, but this actually was my first watch. And I have got to say, why did I wait so long?Beyond the absolutely gorgeous cinematography, the fantastic lead performances and the undeniably awesome musical numbers, what earns this movie a place among my very favorite is the message it delivers. It's a film that gets me excited about the future ; I am nineteen years old as of writing this, and I'm getting to a time in life where I have to choose what I'm gonna do with it. La La Land inspires me to go after my dreams, as corny as it may sound, and to create the life I really want for myself.It really is a movie for the fools who dream, and a very good one at that.",10,5,6,26 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," High Expectations... Mostly Met
","The blockbuster entertainment value of this movie is off the charts : it's full of vibrant colors, fun action scenes and great character arcs. The soundtrack might be even better than the first time around, and Baby Groot held the title of cutest thing ever for two years until The Mandalorian happened. It's one of those insanely fun summer movies, you know.With that said, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is certainly more flawed than its predecessor : the gold people serve no purpose other than providing some sort of conflict until we get to the real stuff, Kirk Russell plays the god of exposition and I feel like they took the humour a little bit too far. In the end, however, we watch Marvel movies not because they are great pieces of art, but because we want to be entertained for two hours, and this sequel succeeds in that regard.",8,0,0,3 June 2020
Thor," A pretty solid Marvel movie
","Well, I only wanted to watch Iron Man, but I guess it turns out my mom and I are doing the Marvel marathon in release order (skipped The Incredible Hulk since it's not on Disney+, but who cares really). What else can we do during those days of quarantining?Actually, this one was a lot better than what I remembered. I have always considered the first two Thor movies to be the weakest of the MCU because I just couldn't get behind Thor's arrogance and the over-the-top melodrama. This time, however, I felt like I connected with him a lot more, as I understood the struggles he was going through and appreciated the human side of the character.The dutch angles don't really bother me, in fact I think it gives the movie a distinct style that differentiates it from others in the franchise. It feels refreshing to revisit the MCU's early films that don't have the weight of the entire cinematic universe on its shoulders. Thor works as a story of its own, and that was the best part for me.'This movie, I like it. Another!'",7,0,0,9 April 2020
The Lion King," One of the Most Iconic Movies of All Time
","I have a hard time figuring out how I have managed to spend the first nineteen years of my life without seeing The Lion King. As a kid, I watched mostly Pixar and Dreamworks, which means my culture is lacking in the Disney classics department.Watching this film for the first time as an adult is a special experience : unlike a lot of people my age, it isn't a nostalgia adventure, which allows me to fully appreciate the craft behind this movie, from the leap-of-the-screen colors to the incredible voice acting to the powerful themes. The Lion King is just iconic from beginning to end.",8,1,1,8 May 2020
Inception," Mind-bending to say the least
","Wow. For some odd reason, I had managed to spend the last ten years without seeing this movie (I know, I know), but I finally watched it yesterday night, and I've got to say, oh my god.At first, the amount of exposition and the confusing nature of the whole thing caught me off-guard, but when it got moving, boy did it get moving. By the end, I was left there, staring at my television screen, having no clue what just hit me. This is one of the most complex worlds that I have ever seen put on screen; it is mind-bending, and I believe that with multiple viewings I will pick up on more stuff that will make the movie even better than it already is.The whole cast is undeniably fantastic in this action-packed thriller, and Christopher Nolan clearly knows how to get the best out of them, and how to craft an epic story. Another standout here is Hans Zimmer, whose score is, again, one for the ages.Finally, I believe that the ending is often what makes or breaks a movie. I am a sucker for a good twist ending or a highly emotional ending, but my favorite ones are the endings that are ambiguous, the ones that let you decide what really happened, that make you want to rewatch the movie over and over again to find more clues and solve the mystery.Inception delivers one of the all-time greats in that regard.",10,1,2,13 April 2020
WALL·E," Waaaaaall-Eeeeeee
","Beyond the absolutely adorable story about two robots falling in love, Pixar manages to explore ideas such as how pollution, inactivity and artificial intelligence could affect the future of humanity. Rarely do we see animation movies deliver such an important and timely message.",9,0,0,1 March 2020
Halloween," An Old, but Still Haunting Classic
","I've actually never been a massive fan of horror movies. My parents would never allow me to watch them when I was a kid, and I never felt the urge to dive into the genre during my teenage years. As a matter of fact, I think I can count the horror movies that I saw in my life with the fingers of my two hands.What John Carpenter pulled off with Halloween is incredible : he basically invented a genre, while displaying his great filmmaking talents in a movie that had an incredibly small budget. From a cinephile's point of view, it's an absolute pleasure to watch. The atmosphere of the movie is deeply unsettling, the score is fantastic and Michael Myers' presence proved enough to haunt the nightmares of multiple generations since the film's release in 1978.However, I can nit-pick some elements of the movie : the death scenes that have not aged all that well, the acting that, while not awful, isn't exactly the best, and the fact that the movie ends in a strange way and with a lot of questions still up in air. Nevertheless, Halloween remains a classic for a reason, and I will definitely rewatch it when Halloween season comes around one of these years.",7,0,0,19 May 2020
Black Panther," Wakanda Forever!
","It's strange to think that Black Panther was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Award. Don't get me wrong, the movie is awesome ; but it's not on the level of a The Dark Knight for me, who wasn't nominated.I love how Wakanda came to life in the movie thanks to great visual effects, costume design and a fantastic, original score. Chadwick Boseman plays his part to perfection, just like Michael B. Jordan, a standout amongst MCU villains. The chase scene in Korea is also amazing.My only complaint about the movie is that the final showdown doesn't quite deliver the thrills and emotions that it should. Every time I watch it, the beginning makes me want to rank it in my top 5 MCU films, but the ending leaves me somewhat disappointed. Still a great movie as is.",8,1,1,30 June 2020
Iron Man," Iron Man, or how to lay a solid foundation for a cinematic universe
","'I am Iron Man.'It has been now twelve years since these four words were spoken, and little did we know at the time, they were about to change the movie industry for the foreseeable future. Thank God for this movie being good ; because if it wasn't, we surely wouldn't have Avengers : Endgame right now.",9,0,1,3 April 2020
The Greatest Showman," Fun Spectacle, Lackluster Story
","This is exactly the type of movie that if you stop and think about it for more than fifteen seconds straight, you won't like it all that much. It's pretty much the living embodiment of 'style over substance'.But if you allow yourself to get caught up in the over-the-top spectacle, catchy songs and Hugh Jackman's charisma, you could end up having a pretty good time. I sure had a pretty fun evening, and it's definitely a movie I will choose to rewatch if ever I'm feeling down.Now I have to go to sleep with all those songs in my head... ugh.",6,2,2,24 March 2020
Monsters University," One of Pixar's safest bets, but a decent one
","Was needing something lighthearted and fun after watching Night and Fog earlier tonight. Fortunately, this movie respected both criteria.Listen, I don't have a problem with Monsters University. It's pretty much the definition of a harmless movie, one that keeps me entertained throughout, gets a few genuine laughs out of me and tells a charming coming-of-age story. But this is Pixar, and my expectations for anything that they produce are always very high. This particular film was definitely one of the studio's safest bets, and that makes for a pretty forgettable movie.In the end, this is not by any means a bad film ; it's wonderfully animated, the new characters are a ton of fun and the story holds its own. Still, I'd rather watch the original. Or The Incredibles. Or Wall-E. You get the point.",6,0,0,19 April 2020
Toy Story 3," The Most Emotional Toy Story
","Pixar tells yet again a powerful story that reaches emotional heights rarely seen in animation movies (or any movie for that matter) with Toy Story 3, a film whose themes of growing up and letting go of the past will leave you in tears by the time the credits roll.",10,0,0,8 February 2020
Thor: The Dark World," The MCU's most forgettable movie?
","For me, this movie is one of the MCU's most forgettable entries. Tonight was my third viewing and I still went in with very little memories of the previous two. That surely has to mean something.While I certainly won't go as far as calling it the 'worst comic book movie of all time', a phrase that's been used to describe it, I am still pretty disappointed by the lack of originality and the story that's not all that engaging. The Dark World is somewhat redeemed by its two lead performances delivered by Hemsworth and Hiddleston, whose chemistry is always on point. Other than that, there are very few things that I'm going to remember about this film.",6,0,0,20 April 2020
Back to the Future," A Classic That Still Holds Up
","This a fun movie to watch for the second time, because I noticed all the details that were subtly introduced in the first half-hour that have major implications for the plot going forward.The film's biggest strength is its incredibly fun concept of going back to the time your parents were high schoolers, and it also showcases a memorable soundtrack and absolutely perfect casting decisions. Great Scott, I can't envision anyone but Michael J. Fox playing Marty McFly. This movie is a classic for a reason.",9,3,3,3 May 2020
