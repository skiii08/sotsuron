Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Doesn't meet the expectations of Episodes IV-VI fans.
","I can't say that this was a bad film, but I can't say that it was good either. If I had not seen Episodes IV, V and VI and hadn't expected some connection with that universe I would, perhaps, have liked it more. But it was mainly an excuse for showing off some (I have to admit, very good) special effects. Taken alone, it would have been more enjoyable, but more along the lines of action movies than science-fiction ones. Frankly, I had expected more of this one.Although the actors are good ones (I like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor), they fail to build strong characters. But I think this is the screenplay's writer fault, and not theirs. I cannot refrain from comparing Sir Alec Guiness's character and Liam Neeson's (I think they were supposed to be alike)... I needn't tell you which one I think was best. If someone asked me what kind of man Han Solo, or Luke Skywalker was, I would have pretty much to say... they were complex and convincing characters - although Luke was a (bit) naive. But for the life of me I cannot  say anything even mildly interesting about any of the two main male characters in Episode I.So - too much action and not enough plot. Why did they have to spent a full 15 minutes (maybe a little more, maybe a little less) on that silly race with Anakyn?! What was so fun about that?! Computer games are better, at least you get some action yourself (kind of...)Jar Jar Binks is indeed funny and there is need for such characters. Even the fact that he is clearly a commercial addiction doesn't take that away.And... am I the only one to have realized only halfway through the movie that the princess and her ...servant, or whatever she was, were one and the same? I don't think the director intended to hide it for so long... it was the makeup's fault.Also, there were no conflicts between the characters whatsoever. Remember the duel between Luke and Vader at the end of Episode V? It was more that just a fight. It was a psychological war between two strong personalities, a clash of wills. It really sent shivers down my spine. There was none of this in Episode I.And the ending? Quite sudden. I was still expecting for something else to happen.Well, perhaps they make a better job in Episode II. I am willing to give them one more chance.",5,0,1,2 March 2000
Mulan," Would have been better without Mushu's character
","I love cartoons. I think ever since the first full-length cartoon movies have been made, there was the 'funny' support character which was responsible for the laughs. In later times this character was in general the hero's aide: the Genie in Alladin, Philoctetes in Hercules and so on. The problem is that the funny character tends to get more and more exaggerated every time, borrowing standard and oh-so-predictable lines from poor comedies, spoiling everything. Don't get me wrong: The Genie and Philoctetes were perfect, because they didn't overdo it, but Mushu certainly overdoes it. What need do we have for this kind of silly humor in a children movie? All the lines were heard and reheard, stupid and boring... and not funny at all. A movie CAN be nice without somebody telling the same old jokes over and over again, jokes which sound the same whether they are told in I-don't-know-which-century China (like in Mulan) or in the next century (like in the last semi-science-fiction movie I have seen, The Sixth Day).
A cartoon movie is dedicated first of all to children, and I think that at least for them we should keep the movies nice, like the stories were when I was a kid. Why do kids these days watch mostly cartoons about bigger and bigger robots fighting each other and not Tom and Jerry anymore? We should try to change this mentality...
Other than that the movie was very nice, the musical score was great and did a great job in sustaining the action.",7,1,1,9 January 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Almost cartoons
","Perhaps I should begin by saying that I am NOT a fan of Tim Burton. I went to the movie hoping to see Johnny Depp in a role more along the lines of Edward Scissorhands. I was thoroughly disappointed. His character was cartoon like (though this was not his fault).Except for the really beautiful images, there was nothing about this movie. Those were really stunning and helped created the mood... unfortunately the mood was entirely spoiled by the horror scenes, which were ludicrous.As I have said before and I repeat, everything else is just cartoons. The directing, the acting, everything. I suppose I should have expected this... serves me well not to go see another Tim Burton movie. Anyway, if you like his style, you will probably enjoy it...(Spoilers...)In one of the scenes at the end of the movie, which I suppose was meant to be the most frightening one, where the Rider gets his head back, I could not refrain from laughing!! I didn't laugh as much at a supposedly serious movie since Predator...",3,2,5,9 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Begun, the Clone War has...
","...and now we have to wait for another three years to see its conclusion. WOW. Episode II is definitely MUCH better than Episode I. I would even say it's better that Return of the Jedi. If Lucas keeps up the good work then Episode III will be on a par with A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.You can see the plot elsewhere so I'll just try to summarize what was good about it and what was bad about it.Good:1. The characters. Almost every one of them (with the notable exception of Amidala - I'll get to that below) delivers a superb performance. I was especially pleasantly surprised by Hayden (Anakin). He fits the role perfectly: the impetuous young Jedi padawan, reckless, impulsive, ambitious, overly confident of himself, lacking patience, determined to be the greatest Jedi ever. But we see as well his occasional bursts of fury, his inner torments and demons, which predict his eventual fall to the Dark Side. We see as well all temptations and trials he is subjected to - his forbidden attraction to Amidala, his love for his mother and how what happens to her affects him - and we can understand how his fall to the Dark Side begins. All the others are good as well: Obi-Wan, Yoda, Mace Windu, Count Dooku.
2. The plot. There are actually two epic lines: Obi-Wan discovering the hidden clone army and dealing with the conspiration and Padme vs. Anakin. The first one is VERY good. The enemy (Sidious) is almost unseen, he doesn't have more than a couple of lines in the entire movie, yet you can feel his presence everywhere, see the shadow of his actions begging to take shape. His is a masterful plan to take over the Republic which nobody sees; he fools all with intelligence. This is the kind of bad guy I love. Also great are all the scenes on the planet where Obi-Wan discovers the clones and his confrontations with Jango Fett. Suspense, adrenaline and an eerie feeling of outworldliness.3. The special effects - settings. Each planet has its own distinctive individuality and is created in such detail you cannot believe it is not real. Coruscant: high towers, lights, traffic, agitation. Naboo: beautiful landscapes, waterfalls, pastorality. Clone planet: water, white, rain. Conspiration planet: red, volcanos, machinery, inhabitants which resemble giant flies. Absolutely stunning.4. All the small tidbits which are SW trademark, which give us old-timers a feeling of home coming: movie opens with a ship in space, somebody has a bad feeling, Artoo saves the day, Threepio gets into trouble, Obi-Wan jests to Anakin 'I've got a feeling you're going to be the end of me' - how true...5. Lightsaber duels. They are PERFECT. They are shot continuously (not like in TPM where they were always interrupted by other epic threads) and are suspenseful. They even manage to make Yoda duel without him becoming hilarious - he's great, in fact.Now for the bad parts:1. Except for the race between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett in the asteroid field, there isn't any space battle at all. All battles take place on the ground.2. The love-story between Anakin and Padme is clumsily done, rushed and forced. I kept comparing it to Han/Leia and it doesn't stand a chance. Also, Padme was the greatest disappointment in the movie. She is downgraded from the stately royal presence and aloofness to a good-looking young woman who does nothing but get herself into trouble. There were some plot holes here as well: she keeps telling Anakin how they shouldn't be together but keeps provoking him by wearing the most revealing outfits. She is supposed to be traveling undercover in order to avoid her enemies but keeps wearing the most shining costumes.Oh, but you can skip over the bad parts and enjoy the movie. It is really something.P.S. In case you were wondering: Jar Jar has less than 5 minutes screen time.Rating: 8/10",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
The Usual Suspects," What's all the fuss about?
","I only rented this movie because it was rated so high on IMDB and usually the ratings are pretty accurate.I have to confess that I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes, so perhaps I'm not entitled to post a comment. Although the fact itself that I did not have patience to watch more than 1/4 of the movie should say something...The movie was very, but very stupid. I have read over and over again that it's very good, but I saw nothing good about it. I was expecting an extraordinary psychological movie, but there was nothing of this. I couldn't follow the plot at all, I couldn't identify between the characters, nothing ever happened in the movie... and I don't mean fights or car races, I mean NOTHING AT ALL happened. I didn't understand anything at all.And if I was supposed to wait until the end to get the clue, well that's too bad. I wasn't willing to loose that much time.Well, I guess that given the ratings, lots of people (most of them) will disagree. This is just a warning to those of you who haven't seen it yet: you may not like it at all, just as I didn't.I give it 2/10 just because I didn't see the whole of it and because 1 is reserved for movies which are stupid beyond any logic (like Mars Attacks).",2,10,20,5 February 2001
