10 Cloverfield Lane," Interesting plotline but wtf is the ending??
","There was a slow beginning where I thought the fat guy was kind of weird. But after her attempt to escape, I started to think that he was normal. BUT then after that twist halfway through the movie, I was like what the F**K he's a weirdo again. But kudos to the lady for figuring out what's happening and actually using her knowledge to save herself. One thing I didn't like was the ending cause it was completely different from the rest of the plot. I read other reviews and they also thought the ending ruined the entire movie. What a shame...I would have given it a way higher rating if not for the terrible ending",6,0,0,6 February 2018
