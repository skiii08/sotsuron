Blade Runner 2049," A Visual Masterpiece, but not Perfect
","Blade Runner 2049 is visually the best movie I have seen in theaters, thanks to Roger Deakins, the best cinematographer in the business who may finally get an Oscar after 13 previous nominations, and director Denis Villeneuve, whose movies are always visually at the top of their game. To compliment the visuals is an interesting and thought-provoking story that continues and expands the ideas initially explored in the original Blade Runner about what it means to be human. There are good performances from all the cast, although some are unfortunately wasted and not given too much to do.The only real problem with Blade Runner 2049 is the pacing and plot direction of the story. Blade Runner 2049 has a slow pace and a nearly 3 hour run time, which isn't a problem by itself (and I actually enjoyed the slow pace), but somehow rushes the final act of the movie to a somewhat awkward conclusion. I also felt Ryan Gosling's character's initial motivations were left unclear and made his character's development weaker which was a problem since Gosling is in about 85% of the movie. Another problem is that Ryan Gosling is in about 85% of the movie, leaving little time to establish the characters that are after him and what he knows.",8,0,4,7 October 2017
Knives Out," Good Old Whodunnit
","On the surface Knives Out is a whodunnit murder mystery, but beneath is a subtle examination and critique of wealth acquired through family legacy in the form of the Thrombey family. While neither are necessary reinventing the wheel, both are compelling. The murder mystery is fun, unpredictable and humorous. At the center of it is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private detective hired anonymously under suspicious circumstances and Ana de Armas as the nurse and friend of the deceased Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). This movie isn't just interested in the mystery but in the characters that are caught up in the suspicious death of Mr. Harlan Thrombey, who by chance has just cut off the family from his money, legacy, and inheritance. The one scene that stood out in this film to me was about halfway through, where Michael Shannon's character, one of Harlan's sons, weakly attempts to extort Ana de Armas' character into giving up the inheritance gifted to her. It's a scummy move, but it's given nuance coming from someone who has just lost his father and left out of a substantial inheritance he was expected to receive for a number of years. Rian Johnson, like all good filmmakers (he also wrote the excellent script), realizes that good characters are the centerpiece of a good movie. All together this is an excellent movie, and I should mention again that it is also very funny.",8,1,2,15 December 2019
The Irishman," A Swan Song of Sorts
","Martin Scorsese's movies often examine the lives of those involved in nefarious activity. Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, and The Wolf of Wall Street on first glance may seem like they are glamorizing the lifestyle of the gangster or the wall street banker. The appeal of these lifestyles is only part of the story, and there is always the eventual downfall. The Irishman may seem like a retread of movies such as Goodfellas and Casino initially, but it is a far different story. The Irishman examines Frank Sheeran, who was involved with mob activiy, a friend of Jimmy Hoffa and (allegedly) the man who killed him. The first 2 and a half hours run like any regular Scorsese gangster flick with the first person narration. The rest of the film deals with the inevitable, death. Being forgotten and becoming a relic of a certain era from a long time ago. There's a funny gag throughout the film where when characters shown up it's told how they die (most of the time it involves bullets), but beneath that it's a stark reminder of the frailty of the mafia business and what the inevitable cost of being involved is. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are all great in this film. Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is a larger than life character who is not afraid to go after what he wants, even if it eventually becomes fatal. If Joe Pesci is engraved in your mind as the hot head from both Goodfellas and Casino, then you should be pleased to know that Joe Pesci's character is the exact opposite in this movie. He is a quiet but strong mafia leader who delivers his message not through outbursts but through subtle glances and a calm demeanor.",9,2,4,15 December 2019
The Imitation Game," Just go and watch A Beautiful Mind (or watch it again)
","Consider this the textbook example of Oscar-bait. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Alan Turing, a brilliant and influential mathematician and computer scientist who helped decode the Enigma machine that the Nazis were using to send encrypted messages (this saved countless lives) and was later prosecuted for being gay and forced to be chemically castrated. It's an appalling story that this movie does no justice.The first fatal flaw is its portrayal of Turing. Apparently getting all of its information about genius mathematicians from movies such as Rain Man and A Beautiful Mind, Turing is portrayed as a sort of savant like character who is incapable of social interaction (in real life Turing was not like this). Benedict Cumberbatch is solid, but you can't help feel like he's playing only a slightly altered version of Sherlock (socially inept, eccentric, brilliant). There are other numerous historical inaccuracies as well (it's a movie so full historical accuracy is not needed, but just don't expect to get a good history lesson here).The other main characters in this film are okay to forgettable. Kiera Knightly is fine as Joan Clarke, another brilliant codebreaker who struggles to gain acceptance because she is a woman. We unfortunately don't get enough time with her. Charles Dance is the tough military guy (he's got a good tough guy routine) and Mark Strong is the mysterious spy. Both completely forgettable.The script suffers too, mostly playing it by the book with cliches we have seen a thousand times before. There's a corny inspirational line that gets a call back not once, but twice! And there's a eureka scene in a bar that feels like a direct rip off of A Beautiful Mind. I have no idea how this won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.Overall, just go and watch A Beautiful Mind. Or go and watch it again if you've already seen it.",4,1,2,29 October 2019
The Evil Dead," Good old fashioned spooky cabin movie
","There must be really something inherently creepy about cabins in the middle of the woods. Whether it's the isolation, vulnerability, the proximity to nature or the fact that it's pretty cheap to shoot a movie there (like this one), creepy cabins keep showing up in horror movies. It's basically a trope at this point.While this film series is well-known for incorporating humor and action elements, those are lacking in this film.. In a way, it kind of feels like a band's first album where they are piecing the elements together but still haven't found their sound. Ash Williams (played by Bruce Campbell) in the later films would become more action hero like, but in this movie him and the rest of the characters that venture to the cabin are just regular people.The story premise, which involves evil spirits being summoned through a book of the dead, is a bit silly (which is why Evil Dead 2 works so well as a kind of parody of the first movie), but The Evil Dead is so well made that this can be gladly ignored. Director Sam Raimi uses a lot of inventive camera work to make the horror feel real. Through POV shots, the invisible evil spirits in this film have a real physical presence, and there are plenty of great long takes that build up suspense perfectly. The effects are low-budget but work really well, and nothing is held back because there was no major studio they needed to deal with when making this movie.This movie is kind of the black sheep in the franchise, but it is still a very effective horror movie.",8,0,0,5 April 2020
Deadpool," A movie too conventional for an unconventional anti-hero
","Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action and the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of Deadpool.With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks. Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers.",6,30,57,20 October 2016
