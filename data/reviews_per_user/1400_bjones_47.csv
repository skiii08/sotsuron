The King's Speech," Magnificent film!
","The King's SpeechI nearly passed on this film as I thought it less likely to be entertaining than many of the other offerings out now. In the end I'm very happy I chose to see it. This is clearly the best film I've seen this year, and I've seen all the nominated films.There is a great deal to recommend this film, beginning with impeccable direction by Tom Hooper, a marvelously written story by David Seidler and beautiful cinematography by Danny Cohen all set within the masterful framework of superb art and set direction and beautiful costumes and makeup. In fact, all of the technical aspects of this film are superb, as evidenced by the richly deserved Oscar nominations. But the real triumph may be the contribution of Nina Gold as the Casting Director. Such wonderful casting! Bravo, Nina! This is a wonderful, inspiring, life affirming journey through the tortured recesses of a man's mind as he struggles with his inner demons. It goes a long way toward proving that no station in life can totally exclude one from misery and unhappiness.Leading the way for us on this journey are two of the world's consummate actors; Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Firth plays the tortured soul of the title on a desperate but futile search for help with a seemingly irresolvable problem. His problem is attached with a singular resolve by Rush's character, Lionel Logue, who became the King's teacher and, eventually, more.To our advantage these two fine gentlemen are joined in their efforts by the impeccably talented Helena Bonham Carter, first as the Duchess of York then as Firth's Queen consort, Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother).As the film unfolds, these truly talented actors play off of the selfish decisions made by the equally talented Guy Pearce in the role of Firth's cruel and insensitive older brother Edward, who is the Prince of Wales at the beginning of the film.This wonderful story then reveals some aspects of the inner workings of the British monarchy as we follow what happens when Pierce's character falls in love with the politically and socially unacceptable Wallace Simpson, a divorc√©e, played to a scheming turn by the talented Eve Best. Best, in fact, makes a nice study in how to make the most of a small part.When Pierce's father, Michael Gambon convincingly playing an abusive King George V, dies the crown automatically passes to his oldest son, Pearce, playing the man who became Kind Edward VIII. But King Edward's infatuation with Best's character causes an uproar among the power brokers in London who apply pressure, forcing him to abdicate in favor of his younger brother who then becomes King George VI.But George VI, who had been hoping to spend his life in blissful seclusion away from the public eye, finds himself suddenly thrust onto the limelight during one of the most terrible times in Britain's, and the world's history. George finds the duties expected of him impossible to perform due to his being afflicted with really bad stammering. His problem launches him, and us with him, on this marvelous journey to find himself within his public facade.We suffer and succeed along with Firth as he very painfully recreates George's struggles, trying with every particle of his soul to be a better king, and is, in the end, helped only by Rush's character who was found and hired by Carter's loving Elizabeth.Altogether, this film offers a marvelous ensemble cast throughout, featuring uniformly great performances from all. There's not a sour note in the lot with fine contributions by such marvelous actors as Claire Bloom and Timothy Spall, as Queen Mary and Winston Churchill respectively.I am happily satisfied that Firth and Rush have been nominated for awards along with the film. There's 12 Oscar chances to recognize this brilliant example of the modern film making art. There would be no injustice in both they and the film winning every Oscar they are nominated for.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",10,1,7,6 February 2011
Moneyball," A Home Run
","Well, when purchasing my ticket I expected to see a good movie about 
 baseball. I was rewarded with just that. Overall I thought the film 
 excellent, both as a finely crafted film and as a representative of 
 baseball. To demonstrate that I had no preconceived prejudices, I can 
 say that I'm not really a fan of professional sports any longer. My 
 fond memories of baseball are mostly from playing the game when I was a 
 kid. We lived in a neighborhood with a lot of boys, all of whom were 
 involved in sports and we played baseball a lot. But, that was the 
 1950's and times have changed. No one now days can hold a candle to The 
 Mick.
 
 The film centers around the Oakland A's in the early 2000's and it's 
 controversial General Manager, Billy Beane, skillfully played by Brad 
 Pitt. The premise is the real story of how, with an extremely small 
 budget for a professional sports team, he managed to win a surprising 
 number of games, including setting an all-time major league record of 
 20 consecutive wins. The method used by Beane was not of his invention, 
 having already been around in theory and known as 'sabermetrics'. The 
 crafting of the team into that form is credited to have been begun by 
 Beane's predecessor, Sandy Alderson. Beane himself was thrust to the 
 forefront as the focus of a successful 2003 best-selling book 
 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game'; which ultimately led to 
 this film.
 
 The film was very well done, really succeeding in sucking in the 
 audience to it's ebb and flow. The audience I was in clearly enjoyed 
 the film, there was a lot of laughter in the right places and applause 
 at the end, which is rare enough. The setting had the look and feel of 
 realism and the same with regard to the actors portraying the players. 
 There was a fairly long list of good character actors peppered 
 throughout the film, all of whom added considerably to the film's 
 realism.
 
 But the lion's share of the film, and the credit for it's quality, goes 
 primarily to it's major stars, Brad Pitt, Philip Seymour Hoffman 
 playing Team Manger Art Howe, and Jonah Hill, as the fictional 
 character Peter Brand who is said to have been based on Paul DePodesta 
 who was Beane's assistant during the period covered by the film. 
 Hoffman is great as usual but played his character a bit understated. 
 Jonah Hill nearly ran off with the attention altogether while he was on 
 screen. But Pitt clearly controlled the central attention and did so 
 with ease and excellence. He managed to make the character look smart, 
 fair and quite human.
 
 Pitt's humanity was helped by the presence of tidbits of his family 
 life, mainly focused on his relationship with his 12 year old daughter, 
 well represented on screen by the young Kerris Dorsey as Casey Beane. 
 The interplay between them added a lot of humanity to the film that 
 would have otherwise been lacking. There was a small part played by 
 Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife Sharon. It was the closest anything in 
 the film came to a romantic involvement.
 
 Many of the character actors made important contributions, such as 
 Stephen Bishop as David Justice, Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg and 
 Brent Jennings as Ron Washington. There was even a cameo by Joe 
 Satriani playing his guitar as superbly as usual.
 
 Leaving the theater I thought that one would have to have at least a 
 working knowledge of the game of baseball to get the most out of the 
 film. I wondered how it would play to someone without that knowledge 
 and I think a lot would be lost, but it would still be enjoyable for 
 it's basic story of struggling to overcome long odds to achieve 
 something good and the exploration of the people and personalities 
 involved. That's a pretty good accomplishment for any film to make and 
 this one does it with a lot of fun and class.",Null,81,112,1 October 2011
Walk the Line," Long legged guitar pickin' man...
","... is how the real June Carter refers to her husband, Johnny Cash, in a song covering the film's closing credits. He counters by calling her a 'Big Mouthed Woman' in a famous duet of theirs. That was a very satisfying end to a wonderful film. It seems to have begun some time ago, before the deaths of Johnny Cash and June Carter-Cash, who each personally picked both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to play them in the film before they died only four months apart in 2003.I went to see this film with high expectations fueled by all the pre-release hype and trailers I'd seen for a long while. For a change I was not disappointed. This is truly a wonderful film. Although it definitely deals with unpleasant subjects such as the psychological and emotional abuse Johnny Cash suffered as a child from his abusive, alcoholic father (played with real talent by the versatile Robert Patrick) and his later fall into pills and alcohol as a result, much like his old friend Elvis Presley; who the film illustrates as having started Cash down the same road abusing prescription drugs that led to his own, later death.This was also a bit of a personal memory trip for me, both from a similarity to some of our life's more ugly experiences and for the backdrop his music and the others of that Sun Record's miracle group in the 50's played to my own life. Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Elvis Pressley were all musicians I listened to primarily from about 1957 onward for years, in no small part because their music spoke to me in a very personal way (Johnny, Elvis Presley and Hank Williams are the only performers to have been inducted into both the Country Music and Rock And Roll Halls of Fame). So to see this period of their lives depicted on screen was a personal experience that I am sure has to have colored my opinions of this to at least a small degree. However, I don't think even my beginning prejudice would cause me to like the film were it not extremely good - as a bad film of something so personal would have caused me to dislike it far more. Having said that...I was transfixed by the personal presence of the wonderfully talented and beautiful Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter-Cash in the movie, much to Mrs. Cash's credit. Her performance has to be ranked with some of the finest I've ever seen in a long lifetime of movie going. She was completely convincing in her role and played every emotion to a well rounded 'T'. Even more impressive, she did a stellar, professional job of covering all of June Carter's songs (she also had to learn to play the auto-harp), including her very surprising on screen chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix, who played the film's main character, Johnny Cash. Even with the danger of it sounding like a tired clich√© in today's Hollywood, if she doesn't win, let alone be nominated for an Oscar, there are no gods...For his part, Joaquin Phoenix was tremendous in the primary role. Even knowing Phoenix was the one actually singing the songs in the film going in, it was very hard to not believe it was Cash himself singing as I watched him on screen, he was just that good. He performed all of the songs himself without being dubbed and learned to play guitar from scratch just for this role. In fact, I think the real danger here for Joaquin Phoenix is that his portrayal was so very exactingly just like the real Cash that people won't notice where reality stops and the magic he creates on screen begins. He was truly mesmerizing in this role, so good it's hard to find the right superlatives to heap the praise high enough.Not to be outdone by any means, a huge amount of credit has to go to the screen writing, by Gill Dennis and James Mangold, who also directed. The script was wonderfully done, inviting the audience into the life of Cash in a way that made me, at least, feel more like I was an eyewitness to the real events rather than just watching a film.James Mangold's directing was wonderful, perhaps even brilliant. His concept of having both Phoenix and Witherspoon record Cash and Carter's music was a masterstroke of genius, assisted in no small part by the surprising talent of both stars, who may now have a second career to fall back on. Their music made the film in a way that nothing else could have. That both Cash and Carter lived their lives to bring music to the world could not have been so respectfully portrayed without such convincing delivery of the very object of their life's work. Both stars should be applauded for even having given the effort to trying, let alone succeeding in such a great way.The other actors did a great job of their performances as well. Both Tyler Hilton as Elvis and Waylon Payne (Wallon Jennings' godson) who played Jerry Lee Lewis were standouts. Waylon Jennings son, Shooter Jennings, also made an appearance playing his father.Last but not least, the costumes, set and art direction gave a rich canvas to the talented cinematography of Phedon Papamichael. Sound, sound editing, music in all respects and the perfect, wonderfully understated makeup for Ms. Witherspoon should all get mentions at Oscar time.Sony, Universal, Focus Features, Columbia Pictures, Paramount, and Warner Bros. who are all said to have passed on the project, should be kicking themselves now.",10,5,11,20 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yin AND Yang
","I have been a rabid fan of good sci-fi since the 50's; books for the most part as they delivered so much more in the past. I have been overjoyed at the stunning developments over the years since the days I sat in a darkened old Packard in a drive-in and watched the new releases of 'Forbidden Planet' and '20 Million Miles to Earth'. What is accomplished today is simply stunning by comparison, truly visually brilliant. Too bad better stories couldn't be written.Yes, I was disappointed. A Saturday with an Asimov novel would have been better spent. Still, there was entertainment value here, just don't expect high-art, especially if you are not a sci-fi fan. In fact, if you are not a sci-fi fan you doubtless would feel cheated.As a die hard fan of the genre, I could find things worth watching. Ewan McGregor can be much better than he was allowed here, just as was Neeson and the others. Still, Mr. McGregor could be really good in sequels if better stories were fleshed out. He is very entertaining to watch in other films. A real waste of talent here with these two. Liam may be better off for having been killed off.Natalie Portman is very talented and turning into a lovely young woman, but I hated her in the terribly hideous Queen's garb. She looked more comfortable, and more convincing in the simpler dress she wore on the dusty planet following Ewan and Liam (BTW, can't these people visualize more planets that do not look like the African desert, or better yet, something really original.). The sets and effects created for her home planet were the only ones worth watching of landscapes. And just what is the idea of using an obviously juvenile actress to play the Queen, kiddie appeal? Nothing against Natalie, but I think a more mature actress would have been much better for the story.At first I thought, what could Mr. Lucas have been thinking when he created the Jar Jar Binks character? Then I realized he must have been setting us up for the sequel. Everyone hates this dweeb so much now that great emotion can be generated with a turn around in character or at least a particularly grisly demise. That is right George, isn't it?Film makers have to plow a new field to find ground fertile enough to make me dislike a sci-fi flick, but here they almost succeeded. The fact that I can away convinced that I could make a film ten times better with an antique script didn't help, either. As for the rest, I hope it fades away quickly as I'm about to gag on the merchandising, which isn't deserved, BTW.The bottom line: If you love anything resembling sci-fi, this film will at least entertain. If you aren't a real die hard fan, look for a bargain basement theater with sharp discounts. It's still worth the big screen for the effects.",6,0,1,6 July 1999
Fury," Superb
","The last couple of years have been rough for me. I even asked myself if I should be going to a movie like this at all. But curiosity overwhelmed me. My expectations weren't high, but I had a vague hope that at least the production values looked good from the trailers. I didn't expect more than that. I have to admit that I liked this film far more than I expected to. It was excellent all around with few sour notes and those are too minor for most people to ever notice. To begin, the score, art direction, sets, set decoration, makeup, costuming and cinematography were superb. The cinematography was what, in my opinion, really made the look of the film. It took the most barbaric, brutish of subjects and made it visually glorious. It was really beautifully done; definitely Oscar worthy.The sound and sound effects were excellent throughout; especially difficult in this type of film. Location selection seemed to fit perfectly as well. That brings me direction and acting. David Ayer directed as well as wrote the script. Perhaps that made the direction part of the effort easier; no arguments with the writers! He's known for some fairly good action films; of which this is now the best.The primary actors, Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pe√±a, and Jon Bernthal all had significant screen time. All of them were superb with this material; with Pitt shining the most. His blunt portrayal is spot on to some actual soldiers I've known quite well. Congratulations Mr. Pitt; you deserve some recognition from your peers for this. If you don't get that - which seems unthinkable - you at least have my thanks. I found myself wondering, as I almost never do, where Pitt, LaBeouf and Lerman found within themselves the appropriate and terrific emotions for the job they did. I can't imagine it being easy for them at all; which somewhat adds to the experience of watching them.The rest of the cast were quite good as well, especially Pe√±a; and Bernthal may actually be somewhat hurt by his excellent portrayal, such was the degree of unpleasantness he elicited.Two ladies, Anamaria Marinca as Irma and Alicia Von Rittberg as her cousin Emma; were excellent in the small dialog they were given to work with. Both had to convey a great deal through unspoken action and I could almost taste their discomfort and fear. This was especially true of Marinca for me. I couldn't take my eyes off of her when she was on screen; especially in closeup.For the rest, for me this was so realistic it teetered on the edge of uncomfortable, being too close to some exceedingly unpleasant personal memories; especially with the great sound effects. I especially liked the job they did of bringing the MG42 and Ma Deuce to life. Congratulations for a job well done!For older ladies in the audience, I can hold this film up as an example of why many veterans do not talk about their experiences. They are too inhumanly ghastly to withstand explanation to those without such experience, and trying to find the words to explain things is just too emotionally draining. All of this ads up to a great movie going experience. I hope you can enjoy the film. I may have a few nightmares; but I handle those better than I used to.",9,3,13,19 October 2014
Shakespeare in Love," Rich, wonderful love story

The 13th Warrior," Good Action But Misses The (Book)Mark
","Originally written 19 September 1999; moved accountI went to the film prepared to be disappointed. You see, I read 'Eater's of the Dead' years ago and it remains one of my favorite Crichton books. It is imaginative and masterful. I always wondered why it had never been made into a film as Crichton's other books had. When I saw the production announcement I eagerly awaited news and was disappointed early on with stories that the book had been greatly compromised and they had coped out early with a name change.Hollywood didn't disappoint me. As expected the film was a pale shadow of the book. The entire premise of Neanderthals surviving into the middle ages was completely lost in this silly characterization of some lesser unnamed bad guys.Also conspicuous by its absence was the uninhibited rampant sexuality of the Northmen. The sanitization of this aspect of the book just added to the disappointment.Some of the fight sequences were well done, with some of the better two-handed swordsmanship I have seen on film. Some of the actors portraying the Vikings were surprisingly good too. In that regard I would have to say that the casting was quite good and the single saving grace of the film's effort. They almost made up for some of the other shortfalls, but not quite. This could have been a remarkable film, but Hollywood again chose mediocrity. I would score it a bit above Hollywood's average though for the sets, costumes, swordplay and the great scenery.",7,0,0,22 July 2003
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Very entertaining ... eventually
","This film is a little offbeat as comedies go. It starts on a somber tone and then tries to build something humorous as it meanders along. There are some places where the pace slows to a slow walk and it can almost lose it's interest for fans of the faster pace of a lot of modern film. But I found that I liked that quirkiness and it added some depth that may have otherwise been lacking in the typical comedy. However, I feel it may be too much of a pendulum for some as it swings from serious to comedic. I've noticed that a lot of time, people looking for a comedy can do without the seriousness. But given those mood swings, the directors do manage to make it a comedy, after all.When it comes to comedy the cast here is very entertaining. The central characters are Steve Carell as Cal and Julianne Moore as his dissatisfied wife Emily. She announces that she wants a divorce after a tumble in bed with Kevin Bacon as her boss David. Bacon's character clearly has a solid thing for Moore's character and commences to pursue her, but this angle is just a diversion. The film makers missed chances for funny things that might have supplanted the more serious ones by neglecting to capitalize on this pairing more.A good deal of the movie revolves around a friendship that builds between Carell's character and Ryan Gosling as the smarmy, girl-crazy Jacob. That term is often followed by the descriptor 'hound'. After meeting in a bar, Gosling takes on Carell to fashion him over into his own image. That's when the more fun aspects of the film start as we watch Carell try to crawl out of his shy, suburbanite shell to become more appealing to the opposite sex.One encounter Carell makes is with the stunningly talented Marisa Tomei as Kate; a school teacher. When she's on screen she's a huge lot of fun to watch. I don't think I've ever seen her give as much as a mediocre performance and she won't disappoint here.Another pairing that may surprise some people, but not me, are the encounters between Gosling's character and Emma Stone playing Hannah. Gosling has turned into one of moviedom's more superior actors; who can be expected to always deliver a stellar performance. But the real treat here is Stone. She has become a superb comedienne with a timing and delivery that is as close to perfect as you can get. In fact, Gosling is really playing a straight man here to Stone, ala Abbott and Costello; it's that good.But the one who really illuminates the screen is Emma Stone. Each time I see Stone in a film she is better than the last time and she is nothing less than enchanting. She always comes across as smart and funny. I am especially drawn to the smartness. It is amazingly refreshing to see a female character who actually has brains, beauty and a lot of good old fashioned humor. It's not that 'brainy' parts aren't written for other actresses; it's just that the others almost never quite pull it off (with a few notable exceptions such as Gwyneth Paltrow in Proof, but that was decidedly unfunny). Emma Stone is a real treat to watch and I find I can't take my eyes off of her every time that she's on screen. Her very large, luminous eyes run a thousand expressions a second over an even more expressive face, all of them unerringly faithful to the character while, at the same time, feeling very fresh and original. To top it off, she's a stunning beauty herself in that slightly unusual way that normally makes girls off of the street into supermodels. Stone and Gosling are so good, so entertaining, that I could effortlessly watch an entire film, perhaps several entire films, of just them bouncing one-liners and smoking sexuality off of each other. I found myself actually disappointed when the spotlight left them.But the film doesn't end with just those fine actors, either. There are some surprising, disarming skirmishes between Jonah Bobo as Carell's thirteen-year-old son Robbie Weaver and Analeigh Tipton as his seventeen-year-old babysitter Jessica who, herself, has a thing for Carell. Young Bobo gives a surprisingly good performance as a love-and-thunder-struck young man struggling with some very real, grownup emotions. The height disparity between them made it more enjoyable as we watched and even rooted for Bobo to succeed. I also enjoyed Tipton (could lips be any more sensual), who's face I last saw as a model; but she's a model who can apparently act. She had a hard part to play, straddling a fine line between funny and what could have easily been seen as tragic or even perverse. I hope she feels good about the job she did here and I hope to see more of her in the future.Finally, the very fine actor John Carroll Lynch as Tipton's father Bernie did a fine job with a small part and certainly injected comedy when he was given the chance.The rest of the film was expertly staged and photographed so it's top quality there. I also enjoyed the musical score, skillfully blending old favorites into the story in a way more noticeable than usual.All-in-all, Crazy, Stupid, Love teeters on the brink of sappiness without quite going too far that way and does a good job of appealing to the usual sentimental themes of love stories throughout the ages with some unexpected, modern twists. If you've ever been in love, see it. If you ever want to be in love, see it. Or, if you just like love stories, see it. It makes for a very good night at the movies. Thank you one and all.By Bruce L.

The Notebook," Zing go the strings
","Zing go the stringsFirst I'd like to thank Hollywood for finally telling a story that shows just how much I love my wife, Beverly, of 32 years. This goes as much to explaining the unexplainable as any I've ever seen. I'll skip the story description as many have described it, many without great accuracy. Save to say that it's a love story of young lovers from opposing classes, caught up in world events that help alter their lives. I'll stick to the meat of movie making here and what this has done.It is apparent that audiences definitely get drawn into the story wholesale. As I left the theater the lobby was full of weeping females, some of which could be heard in the darkness throughout the film. What I really liked here was this great performance by the utterly charming Rachel McAdams as Allie. I saw her not long ago in an almost vapid part in 'Mean Girls' but here she shines. The girl clearly has talent and I hope now to see more of her. I really fell into her story and it was great fun to watch her on screen. She stole the screen in every scene she was in with her sheer radiance. Of the younger cast she was most watchable on screen followed closely by Kevin Connolly. Of the more experience cast both James Garner as the older Noah and Gena Rowlands as the ailing Allie were stunning in their very believable portrayal of an older couple. I treasure both performances. Maybe James will finally get an Oscar nod.The screenplay was a bit heavy if one reflected long but it's more pleasurable to buy a little suspension of disbelief and just enjoy it. The locations, scenery, costumes and sets were terrific, I loved it all - with the exception of the hoard of domestic geese foisted off as migratory (there's only so much I can swallow). That scene with them on the lake will be one that lives in my memory for a long time to come. The musical program was good too, not to heavy and just noticeable enough.What I just could not swallow was the presentation of the Noah Calhoun character by Ryan Gosling. His acting was good, maybe even great. But his presentation got in the way of my enjoying it. With all the trouble to make a period piece, how can Hollywood ignore a central character? He looked like someone straight out of 1985, not 1945. He was way to shaggy haired, especially for the staid post-war South, and a beard, a waxed chest... give me a break! James Marsden was far more authentic looking for the time period but even his hair had too long a trim on the sides. I guess it's a move to try and woo the female attendees of today but it just stank authenticity wise to me.I'll just stick to watching the captivating McAdams.",9,0,0,25 July 2004
Elizabeth," Richly produced drama
","Originally written 20 January 1999; account movedIn this offering of the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I the emphases are on early suitors for her hand in marriage and on the struggle between the two factions of the Protestant and Catholic clergy. Although the film was completely a masterpiece of film art, it misses the mark slightly with it's obvious anti-catholic bias and it's habit of ignoring historical fact. Although many films such as this do use a good deal of artistic license, it would be just as interesting - perhaps more so, to portray the events that shaped a future world accurately.If one remembers the makers have played havoc with history, it surpasses mere entertainment. It is a joy to watch.",10,0,2,22 July 2003
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not so much ...
","The pre-release hype seemed to indicate this offering would be yet another of the gee-whiz computer generated special effects extravaganza. It did not disappoint in that area, the quality of the CGI were uniformly excellent.Added to the 'puter stuff were on-screen acrobatics that may have been the best since the old Burt Lancaster vehicle, 'The Crimson Pirate'. The rest of the film I'm not so certain of. There was really nothing new here, at least new enough to burn it indelibly into people's minds. The things I didn't like left me feeling a bad taste in my mouth. First, the good parts: I was surprised that the lead actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, played so well as the adopted Persian Prince; although I'm not so sure one would have found a blue-eyed Dutchman in ancient Persia. I was puzzled by the affected British Accent. Maybe he was trying to be the gentleman to his leading lady. I found myself thinking, 'Why did the producers and director want their Persians to speak with British accents.' I still wonder. The usual formula would be for the actors to affect a bad Middle-Eastern accent while still speaking English. At least Gyllenhaal's effort in that regard didn't sound too bad.The lead actress, Gemma Arterton, did well against Gyllenhaal. Although a real chemistry didn't seem to ignite between them, at least there wasn't a blatantly noticeable fizzle.The masterful Anglo-Spanish actor Alfred Molina added a nice balance as an oddball who seemed not to be able to decide whether he was a bad guy or a good guy. He also supplied the biggest disappointment, which I'll get to later. It wasn't his fault. He was making a great effort around what he was given to do.The great Anglo-Indian actor Sir Ben Kingsley gave an excellent performance. He's always great to watch, although the role didn't have much to offer the viewer.Rounding out the performances were two fine efforts by Richard Coyle and Toby Kebbell, both also British, as the brother-Princes of Gyllenhaal's character. Of the two I liked Coyle the better although I'm not sure why.On the negative side is the story. I've seen a lot of examples of late where computer generated special effects extravaganza came up very short in the story/plot department. It was definitely not inspired, let alone taking itself seriously.The really great thing about all of the old films of this type, like Sinbad the Sailor with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., was that they played it pretty much straight. It was very disappointing to see fumbling attempts at tongue-in-cheek references to modern political issues injected into what might have been a much better story without them. They were not clever at all. They felt disingenuous and stilted. This one fell flat to me because of that and they dumped the majority of that garbage in Molina's lap, poor guy. At least he carried it off smiling.If they are going to make a costume adventure/drama I wish they'd play it to the hilt, and at least let the kids at least enjoy it. In days of yore, kids could buy a solid ticket to a wondrous dream world on a Saturday afternoon. This one wouldn't measure up.For my money, far better stories were written in the tenth century in the famous work, 'The Thousand and One Nights.' They should have stolen more from them and it might have been a lot better story.In the end, there is some entertainment here; the special effects, some of the sets and costuming, Gyllenhaal's acrobatics and Arterton's curves and enchanting smile. But then, the film was based on a video game, most of which are horrible stories anyway, so one shouldn't be surprised at the shortfall.Finally, I mentioned the general nationalities of the principle players as I was at least a little surprised that no one Middle Eastern seemed to be visible on screen.",6,1,3,29 May 2010
Alexander," There are good spots
","Here we have the film version of the life and times of King Alexander III of Macedon, aka 'Alexander the Great'. It might be hard for moviegoers to swallow but the life of the actual king was more violent and betrayal filled than the film. He is known to have been a heavy and excessive drinker who was impulsive and had a bad temper. He also likely had a homosexual lover since boyhood named Hephaestion (the Jared Leto role). His mother Olympias was also likely more evil than the Angelina Jolie character here, once forcing a woman to kill her own child and then forcing her to hang herself. Nice family that Alexander had. Alexander was by reports an excellent general and an exceptionally handsome and athletic man who set a fashion for the clean-shaven, short haired look. He was also fiercely loyal to his friends and men. He enjoyed the arts too. Kind of a well rounded guy for a conquering despot who called himself 'Lord of Asia'. He is thought to have eventually died of either malaria or typhoid fever. In short, a lot of what goes on here is historically based on facts known to have happened. So what went wrong? Why isn't the film more popular with such an interesting character to portray? Lets examine the results on film.The general presentation of the film is more-or-less excellent, terrific costumes and sets (except the costuming of the Persian women have a more middle ages look to me). Overall art direction, editing, sound, music and stunts were all excellent. Cinematography was generally excellent except for a poor choice of infrared film in one battle sequence in India.I have to lay the blame of the story presentation and direction. The battle scenes were well staged but confusing in many places in trying to explain what was going on. And although the star, Colin Farrell, did an excellent job, I can't help but feel he was led a bit astray by Stone's direction. The way the story was told was hard to fathom for people I listened to also. That jumping back and forth just added to the confusion. It was a complex story best told in straight chronology or with more narrative such as that excellently provided by Anthony Hopkins as the elder Ptolemy. Overall I enjoyed most of the individual acting performances. I think a very great film was missed here by botched story telling which I can't fault the actors with.",6,1,2,1 December 2004
The Mummy," Fun adventure film
","Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.Especially tantalizing is the strictly painted-on attire of Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namum; what a stunning visual; but it completely upstages her performance. I have heard people talking about it. Some have mistakenly guessed her top was a mesh costume of some sort; not true, it is entirely - and only - paint.But Velazquez isn't the only thing to turn heads in the film, Rachel Weisz is appropriately attractive, though not as startling; her character is as solid and believable as she is lovely.The newcomer, Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, set quite a few female hearts aflutter; in our party, at least. The internet was lit-up searching for more photos of this guy.At first, I didn't particularly care for Brendan Fraser as the primary character (he's too well kept and cutesy for a rugged guy-type for me), be he grows on you. He seems to be developing into a versatile actor who will be around for a long time. His work here is good too.The special effects were the real star of the film, and they were visually rewarding and complimented the story in the right way in the right places. How Arnold Vosloo dealt with those in his role as the mummy Imhotep should be acknowledged. He must have had to imagine quite a bit of what he was interacting with to pull it off, and he does so with great style and substance for this type of role. He was nothing short of excellent.In fact, most of the remaining characters were well chosen. Jonathan Hyde and Kevin J. O'Connor added to the film in important ways, too. Together, everyone painted an enjoyable film, delivering exactly what it promised; fun, action, and adventure.",9,143,164,6 July 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Brave new cinema...
","After waiting for what seemed like forever for the film to come to our fly-blown sand-speck of a town I finally gave up and made a two hour drive over a mountain ridge in disgust just to see it. Other than the considerable hyperbole and the meager trailers I had nothing to go on. As a result, I had more than a few expectations upon purchasing my ticket. Would a film about gay cowboys be worth the trouble? Overall, I have to comment first that I was most pleased right away by the Cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto. He made a film that was beautiful to watch. Unfortunately, it looked a lot more like Canada than Wyoming - both places I've been to a lot. Still, I love the mountains and some scenes reminded me of places I had been camping or hunting as a boy, so I liked it anyway. In fact, so much of it reminded me of my childhood - absent a long shopping list of abusive, alcoholic cowboys - that it gave me a definite feeling of discomfort in places.The next thing to notice is that most of the screen time seems to be occupied by Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist. So much is demanded of their talents it's hard to imagine the pressure they must have felt to pull it off, even with all the support they had behind them. The sheer weight of the controversy they both must have felt in even taking the roles, and their resultant success or lack thereof, may effect film making for a long time to come. In any event, I would personally thank them both for their obvious courage in stepping forward to take these very difficult and controversial roles. I hope they know that regardless of whether or not they garner future awards for their efforts, millions of people will be touched and their lives enriched by witnessing their performances here.For me, being a westerner who grew up in the shadow of huge, majestic mountain ranges, I oddly felt myself want to be negative about Ledger's performance. After all, why couldn't they find an authentic American to play the part, I asked myself? Well, I have to say that Ledger found a character within him that genuinely reminded me of people I have known. How far this is from his real persona can only be guessed at, but he certainly didn't do any injustice to the real type of person he played. For his part, Gyllenhaal didn't disappoint either (although it was a bit harder to buy both as they 'aged' on-screen). Their portrayal of their happenstance meeting and subsequent attraction that grew over their first summer together into a life-long secret life and even more secret love-affair is the central theme of the film. The lost and lonely gay men they portrayed, trying to make their way in a society that was, and to some extent remains, a highly dangerous one to gays, were both touching and heart-breaking to witness. The pseudo success of Gyllenhaal's character's 'hetero' life gave a stark comparison to the lonely semi-reclusiveness of Ledger's circumstances and, doubtless, both are true enough to reality, but both were equally tragic in that they were denied the full happiness that life could have given them. I enjoyed both performances a lot although their characterizations were quite different. At the end I felt both wonderfully fleshed out their roles and gave honor, dignity and grace to what they brought to the screen and I will long remember them. The end result was a story of two humans who just plainly loved each other and could never find a place to just be alive and truthful to themselves. Neither Romeo and Juliet or Tristan & Isolde have anything on these men, as theirs is a story that ultimately feels much more real, believable and tragic. Even as I write this, there are but very few places in the world that would not shun or condemn them for just being alive.A pivotal element of the film were the scattering of other characters around the central stars, giving a sense of completeness, 'fleshing' out their lives. I especially enjoyed both Michelle Williams as Alma, Ledger's wife, and the wonderful Anne Hathaway as Lureen, Gyllenhaal's wife. This was quite a departure for Hathaway from the sort of usual characters she's played, but her's was a great counterpoint to Gyllenhaal's. Both of these ladies reminded me of women I've known, so I felt they added more reality to the overall presentation. Other's who truly added substance to the film, for me, were Graham Beckel, as Lureen's father; Randy Quaid as Joe Aguirre; Linda Cardellini as Cassie; Kate Mara as Alma Jr. and Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother (her's was a real gem too). In fact, I think I have loved both Cardellini and Hathaway in everything I've seen them in.All-in-all, it was a great movie, extremely well made and very entertaining, well worth the trouble - and long drive - I went through to see it. The remainder of the crew who brought this to the screen should all be commended for a superlative job, but in the final analysis, I think the impact of this film will be one of being remembered more for it's socio-political statement more than it's cinematic quality.On the eve of the announcements for the academy awards, I feel it's a shoe-in to get many nominations and should deservedly win some. I like it better than some of the other possible contenders for Best Picture, Cinematography and certainly enjoyed the performances enough to hope that at least Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams get a nod for acting. Good luck to them.",10,28,33,30 January 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Wonderful rendition of an Old Story
","Originally written 22 November 1999; account moved.I am not a fan or 'horror' movies and seeing this movie was a relief to me because it isn't one. It is much more. This is a brilliantly done retelling of an old tale, masterfully told and beautifully presented.The original Washington Irving story is still there but with some new twists. For example, Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, was a schoolmaster in the original and he's a detective here, but it works.Christopher Walken is appropriately menacing as the Hessian Cavalryman who becomes the horseman and Richardson is tinged with just enough evil to be interesting. Christina Ricci is fetching and mysterious as a young lady interested in Crane. Her portrayal is as outstanding as she is beautiful. The remainder of the characters are excellently cast. The casts performances are tight and true to the story throughout. Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt is surprisingly good as well. Van Dien has a fight scene with the horseman and Crane (Depp) that is a striking and outstanding example of action and how it should be executed for maximum effect. I have to say here that I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed with the special effects after seeing the trailers. I was wrong. This film came alive in this telling and the effects were flawless.My favorite aspect of the film, however, was the sets, lighting and the overall mood Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki, as cinematographer, accomplished here - it really mesmerized me. This is done as a brilliant film noir-esque piece.Even the gore was in context.This is a great film.",8,1,1,22 July 2003
Crash," What's All the Fuss About?
","After more than the usual hype surrounding a film and after wondering what was so good about this film after it won a few awards I finally broke down and rented it the night before the Academy Awards. I had to rent it because it never aired in theaters in the town where I live. That's not surprising in a place that seems to try and show only kiddie movies. In any event I carried it home with the hope of finding a real gem, after all I had the read the hype.I have to say that I was more than a little disappointed. I saw nothing at all new here and nothing that was even all that well done with the exception of the construct of coincidence carried to ridiculous levels. The film is a collection of overlapping vignettes (but lacking the requisite subtlety) that purport to describe the condition of racial injustice in society. Instead it comes across like being assaulted by some crazy person getting too close and mumbling tired old clich√©s at you when you leave a restaurant after a good meal; the delivery is more disturbing than the message. There is nothing here to me that wasn't already old and overwrought in the 1970's.More unsettling may even be the ineptitude and prejudice of the film-makers. They seem to have one theme in mind and don't mind portraying it even if it's wrong or a bad idea. Take for example the piece concerning the Persian shopkeeper. It begins by showing him illegally buying a firearm in a shop but doesn't expand on his illegality or that of the seller in the manner of the sale. Instead, in a trite twist it later reveals that his daughter bought him a box of blanks for ammunition to go with it. That happens when he tries to shoot a man with it but nothing happens when his daughter accidentally gets in the way. This is just plain irresponsible. Any firearm shooting blanks does in fact expel very dangerous substances from the muzzle at short ranges, enough so to cause serious injury and even death. But they depict it as having no effect whatsoever. That is a great way to mislead naive young people in audiences into believing it and maybe reenacting it with serious injury or death as a result. If you don't think that's true try asking Jon-Erik Hexum, who found out the hard way in 1984. This is just irresponsible to show this in this way.The rest of the film eschews a muddle of trite old racist stereotypes and shows us examples of what the film makers think are examples of this. The thing was in all the writing I encountered before seeing the film the only place I saw a reference to 'racist' with regard to the film were references to the Matt Dillon character. As expected, the Matt Dillon character was overtly racist - although it did give some insight to what may have propelled him in that direction. But at least he was openly and unashamedly so. The rest of the characters were more objectionable examples of it. I almost laughed at many of the characters because almost every character in the film was either a ridiculous one-dimensional stereotype or a blatantly one-dimensional racist. For example, the Don Cheadle character was perhaps the worst in the film as he wasn't only racist, but a cop who broke serious laws in accepting bribery from a corrupt city official, who worked for the passively racist Brendan Fraser character - that constituted a conspiracy based on racism; theirs.No, come to think of it, the most vile character in the film was the Asian man who was buying and selling other Asians. That has to be about as bad as it can get. Those were followed closely by racists such as the characters played by Loretta Devine and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. One of the few characters who were close to 'normal' was Cameron, played by Terrence Howard, whose performance was worth the rental price along with that of Dillon. Howard even manages to extract a degree of sympathy in a film overflowing with unsympathetic characters.As for remainder of the film, the overall production quality was better than I expected from a 'low budget' film. In retrospect I think it was worth the rental price but not the Academy Awards it seemed to steal from a group of much better quality films.",6,8,16,6 March 2006
Notting Hill," Definitely worth the admission
","Originally written 14 June 1999; account moved.I expected to see another mediocre romantic comedy like You've Got Mail, but I was surprised that enough was different here to make it interesting. The London neighborhood and the characters entertained (although hearing the starring flat originally went for $500K was a bit much.). Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate 'Spike'. I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being 'in-your-face' - it caressed.The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed 'on' for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good. Most telling was at the end of the film, the audience spontaneously applauded; a real rarity. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. So much so I hated to see it end. Bravo.",8,0,0,22 July 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great Sequel
","I was expecting to be disappointed as so many sequels do. I was wrong. But, please do bring your best ration of disbelief suspension. I really enjoyed this offering. This was creative and loaded with lots of great, well staged action and developed things along the path the 1st 2 set but better. The plot here had more flesh and it set up an easy run at future franchises. The new Terminatrix is awesome, although I could have stood to see a lot more of her sans the dull brown suit. Her best outfit was the one in her opening scene and she carried it with no small amount of dignity. Arnold was his usual self but with even more class. He did a wonderful job here as the original T almost developing an emotion. The real treat was Claire Danes. What a talent she is. I even like to watch her with her clothes on, a different twist for action films where the females' only usual talent is the cloth hitting the floor. She added a lot to this and I do hope to see her in the NEXT sequel. She could even make it. Of course she is well known as a real actiing talent and she doesn't insult her hosts here, giving a real and poignant effort. I was surprised to see her billed inthis sort of film to be honest. I genuinely began to like her character thanks to her talent.",Null,0,0,21 July 2003
U-571," Slightly Off Technically But a Great Action Story
","As a former submarine sailor I had high expectations going in to see this film. I have been aboard all of the types shown here and more, American 'S' Boats, German 'U' boats and I served on the crew of a WWII era boat Gato class boat. So, I thought the technical aspects of the crew and their handling of the US sub were pretty well done. The technical advisor should be highly commended for translating some real submarine feel to this film.The American Navy was not a participant in the early captures of Enigma equipment, although they did capture both a U-Boat and an Enigma machine and books later in the war. That was pure Hollywood, of course, but artistic license prevails. I personally would have liked to see a more modern action yarn of some of the incredible actual exploits of real American subs in WWII. There are many, many stories to choose from. Even a bio-epic of the career of someone like Dick O'Kane would have surpassed this in real action. Imagine a fresh pass at the special effects in something like 'Run Silent, Run Deep' or 'Up Periscope'. But, I suppose the producers were looking for a fresh angle, which this was. I just thought it opened them up for criticism for diverting from historical accuracy. As for the film:Actually, the only areas being a bit 'Hollywood' action-wise were the depth charge attacks (detonations that close in real life would have killed the boat) and the ease with which they assumed the operation of a German U-boat. It would takes weeks to assimilate all of the technical knowledge necessary to operate a strange submarine. A lot of the actual details necessary to plot a firing solution for a torpedo were left out, doubtless for drama's sake. But, other than that it wasn't too bad.One impressive aspect was an attempt to re-create an actual sub vs sub duel. One such incident, nearly identical, actually happened during the Second World War when the US boat U.S.S. Scamp had a close range duel with a Japanese sub. The Japanese boat missed and Scamp sunk her adversary when both boats fired torpedoes at each other simultaneously. In all i know of at least eight other instances where subs sank other subs.The sets and costumes were very well done. As for the action parts of the movie and the plot, it was well done and well acted. Paxton and McCounaghy were great in their roles as was the impeccable Harvey Keitel. In fact, Keitel reminded me a lot - actually exactly - of a real Navy Chief Petty Officer I worked for once. He was a joy to watch perform as Chief Klough. The others should aspire to be so good one day. A young actor named Jack Noseworthy also did a great job with his role as the German speaking sailor, Wentz. Also noteworthy was Erik Palladino, a reluctant hero. I only wish they had done more with the Paxton character's background; the name Dahlgren is close to royalty in the Navy. And a more fitting tribute should have gone to the 'Trigger' character played by Tom Guiry. In real life his deed would have warranted at least a Navy Cross, perhaps a Medal of Honor.But, the real star here were the special effects. It was all very well done and a very enjoyable movie to see, over all. A top quality action film.",9,1,6,25 April 2000
American Beauty," Is That All There Is?
","I waited a long time to see this as nothing I heard about the film seemed interesting. Now, I am glad I waited and went to the less expensive matinee.I am left feeling that America has an awfully short memory. There is nothing in this film that hasn't been done, story-wise, before. A lot of the themes seemed to be left over from an earlier age. Vacuous teens and the pathetic lives of the materialistic middle-class were done to death in the sixties and seventies, with better sex too. I had hoped to see something more original but I guess a lot of very young movie goers will never see all the old films so this is their introduction to some very tired, overworked old themes. That left me wondering out loud what all the hoopla has been about, so I tried to find something redeeming here.The director did a good job with the material he had. Not too hard to stand above that script. (music, costumes and sets were mundane, nothing striking, but well executed for the setting.)The acting was the one saving grace. Spacey and Benning played characters I have known. They gave realism to the pathos. Their portrayals with the material they were handed was excellent. The real standouts (because of their newness) were the younger actors and actresses (ladies, there is nothing wrong with being female).Wes Bently showed real talent in his restrained portrayal of the edgy - otherwise stereotypical - young rebel. He saved what could have been a joke.There has been a lot of talk about Mena Suvari in this film. She was OK, but nothing to live up to all the hype, foul mouth notwithstanding. (Note: I am fully aware that hoards of young girls now talk like this character. It is not cute or funny, it's kind of pathetic, which was the point I suppose.)The real shining talent here was Thora Birch as Jane. She managed to breath what little life there was into this film while managing to look much better than Suvari doing it; no mean feat. She is stunning in both talent and beauty and there is a great future for this fine young talent, as well as the others.Chris Cooper's portrayal was true to the script, I am sure, but it left me with 'Huge Hollywood Stereotype' running through my mind. His acting was excellent, the script wasn't up to what he brought to it. The character was disappointing, in the least. Allison Janney as his very disturbed wife was a little over the top too. It left me thinking the screenwriter and director were both really straining to paint villainy with these two characters. It smelled. Has no one heard of originality? Nicholson did the last credible evil Marine Colonel. There may never be another.That about does it for me. I know I sat near the rear of the theater and saw four couples leave shortly after the garbage mouth scene from Suvari. I think she did it well, though. Too bad this is what we have degenerated to. She doesn't represent some far-out rebel, but a main-stream young woman. How sad.As for the film's theme, decadent America has been done to death, so forget it and look for something new, will ya? I would have even liked to see Benning naked more than Suvari, at least that might have been more real and seemed less crude, crass, exploitative and pedophiliac. Besides, she's every bit as beautiful as the younger girls in this film.",5,0,0,22 July 2003
Warrior," Brutality with a heart?
","Since I lived my life in the midst of very real, extreme violence most of my life I'm, generally, not really one to rush to an 'Action Movie' featuring large servings of violence. I've experienced enough to last several lifetimes. Generally. Warrior was the only film in my local theater I hadn't seen, so I bought the ticket. The experience turned out better than I expected.The film revolves around the two grown sons of a family headed by an abusive-alcoholic, Marine war-veteran father with frustrated delusions of an athletic youth. So, he tortured his boys to grow up to be tough, honorable men with leanings toward violence against others by training them and pushing them to compete in amateur wrestling. As that story began to unfold I was thinking, do I really want to stay? This is my life story for cryin' out loud. In the end, I opted to watch more as after all, there was that exorbitant ticket expenditure.The focus of the film is the life struggle of the brothers; Brendan Conlon very ably played by Australian Joel Edgerton and British actor Tom Hardy as his Marine Corps brother Tommy Conlon. The unenviable role of the father is masterfully enacted by veteran actor Nick Nolte as Paddy Conlon. The film belongs almost entirely to this trio; the rest of the actors being mere counterpoint; albeit excellent counterpoint. Sadly, Nolte's character is a sad example of the breed. He drank, abused and bullied his way through life and now he clearly wants to finally make a relationship with his two sons; but complications ensue. Neither of his sons want anything to do with him on a personal level. * In their teens, their mother leaves their father, taking her younger son, Hardy, with her. The older boy, Edgerton, stays with his father. Hardy's character remains sullen and brooding as he ages and joins the Marines. He deserts the Marines in the desert and flees back to the states to become an MMA fighter, brilliantly hiding from authorities by going by his mothers maiden name while his face is spread all over worldwide media. Hardy plays the character so Brutish and mean that it's impossible to have any feeling for him but revulsion. The performance is nearly over-the-top and the realism they may have been looking for falls short as a result. In making that choice of characterization I feel the director made the mistake of letting it happen. A little more of a balanced character would be more realistic and play better. Edgerton's character gets an education, marries, has children and becomes a physics teacher. Not surprisingly, both of the sons grow up to hate their father for the decades of abuse they, and their beloved martyr of a mother, suffered under his roof. They also harbor bad feelings and overall resentment towards each other, designed to heighten the film's tension. Nolte is, doubtless, superb in his performance of the lifelong booze sponge trying to finally clean up his act, while at the same time, he feels himself teetering on the rim of hell, contemplatively staring into the abyss he's soon to join. He expects to find forgiveness from his sons and a chance to know his two little granddaughters, whom he doesn't know. Of course his sons reject him, appropriately. But, Hardy wants him as a trainer so he can go beat up more people with greater efficiency (he reportedly gained 30 pounds of muscle for the role) so he enlists his hated but efficient father to help him achieve his goal.The sympathetically Edgerton, finds himself in a financial bind over the catastrophic medical expenses of one of his daughters. I can't help but feel that they're trying really hard to make me like this guy. Predictably, he decides to get himself right, financially, by returning to the underbelly of MMA for quick paydays. That sets up the world of MAA as a reuniting force that finally slams, quite literally, the two brothers back together. Right there should be a winner, because, after all, what guy has not wanted to pound his brother into a bloody pulp at some point, and here is the vicarious opportunity!The separate roads they take before reaching the cage is splattered with a large amount of gratuitous violence. The 'fighting' is barely removed from street brawling and the 'fighters' were beaten relentlessly. It's also peopled, as it was pointed out to me, with a generous serving of male bodybuilder-type meat for the enjoyment of the distaff attendees. I found it odd that the film makers didn't take advantage of the rating to include at least some gratuitous female nudity. Such an addition would, at least, be non-violent.I have seen bloodier and more violent films, but this one is solidly ensconced in that genre. Brutal might be a better word. Still, given that vehicle, I have to admit that the filmmakers have managed to inject some humanity in the subtext. The boys, although explicitly unforgiving of their father, are also torn over that position by their own humanity. Edgerton has what appears to be a great relationship with his wife, well played by Jennifer Morrison. He is also loved by his kids, his students and at least one colleague, played by Kevin Dunn as Edgerton's boss. He also appears to have a friendship of mutual respect with Frank Grillo as his friend and trainer. The best thing that can be said of the remainder of the cast is that they seamlessly create the authentic feeling atmosphere, which is the be all and end all of MMA; and it is brutal, bloody and at times sickeningly violent.By Bruce L.

The Patriot," With Great Expectations
","As an ardent film and history buff and a descendant of at least three Revolutionary War Soldiers, I was waiting for this film since I first saw the trailers. I had unreasonably high expectations and hoped for the kind of historical film that is capable of being made - some day. Still, I think this offering will become a classic. I think - for American citizens - this film will be very well received and enjoyed by many for years to come.Though not a historical piece, this film could be very useful to generate interest in students not otherwise inclined to enjoy history. However, I expect a good number of British citizens may not care for it at all, as it's too close to truth. As much as they wish to predictably deny it, the British Army/Navy/Government has a long history of brutal treatment of fringe citizens in times past (India and Ireland, for example). Even the treatment we later regrettably subjected the Native Americans to was only a copy of the earlier British treatment of the Irish & Scots. Thus, I feel that from all the histories I have read, there is a common thread of truth concerning the 'old' 'British Empire' reflected in this film. Yes, the British did commit many objectionable acts (though not burning a church full of parishioners as far as I know - though the Scots did it at least once), but there were villains to be sure. Many of these kinds of things did happen to Revolutionary War figures: they fled persecution, had their homes and possessions seized, and they and their families were killed. There were also figures such as the Gibson character who used stealth and guerilla tactics, so one could say the film was created from a host of historical fact.What I did appreciate in this offering is the way Cornwallis was portrayed as a bit more human, and complimented on his genuine skill. I also liked all of the references to the early ineptitude of American forces, which was true, though not much was given for how they improved and eventually triumphed.All-in-all, the film was a work of visual joy. Rich scenery and special effects, though falling short - as usual - of the 'real' reality of war. (I also wonder how they managed to elude capturing the awful humidity in South Carolina.) The acting was solid and enjoyable (given the shortcomings of the script), the score wonderful and the factually represented military equipment, sets and costumes are worth the admission alone. But I do wish Hollywood would learn to write a less predictable story; the overall plot was the most disappointing feature.What I - and I think many others would enjoy more - is a factual story of real Revolutionary War figures done with this kind of production quality; something akin to 'Gettysburg', which sang of realism throughout.I would recommend this film to all Americans, especially history deprived students who could use it as an excellent springboard for interest as many did with 'Braveheart'. I'm buying the DVD when it comes out. After all, it is a MOVIE, and this one is great entertainment. Bravo.",10,0,4,5 July 2000
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A powerfully done story
","I won't add any spoilers as this is too good a movie to spoil. So how do I review it? We'll give it a shot. This is primarily about the American film.First, if you have not read the book OR seen the original Swedish film, do not do either. We take it for granted that the book is always better than the film - and that is certainly true in this case. But if you read the book first it will spoil the film, so by all means read the book, but read it after you see the film; both films. The original Swedish film is outstanding in all respects.I have a great suggestion for the world of filmmaking: The next time you find yourself with such a stunning book to make into a film, get together the American and Foreign interests and make the films side-by-side. It would drastically reduce the overall costs and just as drastically shorten the production schedule. Then you release the finished films; the US version to the US and the other version to the rest of the world.First, the story is not for the feint hearted, it's brutal at times and portrays the seamier side of humanity very graphically. The story hit most of the important stuff so there's no shortage of material. The film runs three hours, but it doesn't seem like it. The pacing and energy in it is sufficient to keep your attention. That means the writing was very good too, as was the directing. The overall film struck me unmistakably as a modern film noir. The cinematography reflects great skill and is responsible for making the film even better. The camera had great scenery to chew up and it was given delicious sets and beautiful weather to set the mood. It won't disappoint.The actors chosen to work on this project were well cast and all were excellent in their portrayals. Daniel Craig gave the character believability and a sympathetic demeanor. The young woman chosen to portray Lisbeth Salander was Rooney Mara. Mara was excellent in a very demanding role. She had to subject herself to depictions of violent victimization of the worst kind and managed to make it feel very real. I think Ms. Rooney has a great future in film if someone can find her the right parts. This part was a perfect fit for it. She really makes the movie, but as the title character she should. My only complaint at all was that the sound people didn't quite manage to make all of her spoken dialog clear in spite of the accent she adopted. The accent and her manner of delivering it were quite remarkable.All in all it's an excellent film of this genre and I was glad to have seen it.By Bruce L.

Spider-Man," Amazin' Fun
","Having read the first issue of Spider Man when it first came out, when I was a kid, I was more than a little interested in seeing how modern movie making would treat this hero from long ago. For the most part, it wasn't disappointing. First the good:Tobey Maguire was an inspiration to cast in the part, he seemed absolutely perfect. He gave the character just the right blend of believability in the two faceted hero, the public nerd and his secret alter hero. I loved the scenes of his early discovery of his newfound prowess and his experimentations with them and his attire.Kirsten Dunst was lovely and similarly well cast as Peter Parker's heartthrob, maybe too good. It was very hard to swallow Spidy's response to her at the end. I found myself wanting to slap him back to his senses, 'It's Kirsten Dunst you dork ...'.Other actors did superb jobs in their parts, especially the veteran Cliff Robertson. The big disappointment and semi-pleasure all rolled into one was Willem Dafoe. The best part was the quality and execution he brought to a difficult role. It was probably the best performance of that type of character I've ever seen. That leads to the not so good stuff: His character should have been canned entirely. Not that Dafoe wasn't good, he certainly was. I just hated the character in that movie. I felt like it nearly ruined what is probably the best comic book brought to the screen I've ever seen. I get the unmistakable impression form this and many other films that movie folks feel that ordinary evil is somehow mundane. It's not. I could not invest any degree of personal fear in this kind of character. The real bad guys, yes, we all have some degree of fear of real bad guys, the robbers, murderers, rapists and the like seen earlier in the movie. Those villains I can appreciate being saved from. The 'Green Goblin' just left me shrugging a 'so what'.But, even with the burden of the goblin, I'd still recommend this to fantasy lovers everywhere.",Null,0,0,5 May 2002
Jarhead," A Farcical Lie
","I went to see this film hoping to see something accurate if nothing else concerning modern day Marines. I spent 31 years serving the modern military, including eight with the Marines so I was looking forward to seeing it. What I saw instead is a dreadful anti-military propaganda piece depicting every type of psychotic malcontent and law breaker who ever was mistaken let into the military. This film is an open disgrace to decent men and women wearing the uniform of the United States. It is so bad it's hard to begin where to criticize without spoiling it for anyone misinformed enough to buy a ticket as I was (and I felt as though I was robbed at that). Current military people and veterans could watch this and know where to separate the childish fantasy from the minuscule bits of fact but civilians won't and that's the harm. This drivel will leave many viewers thinking this is an actual reflection of reality and it's not. It may have been marginally forgivable as a left-wing-anti-military hate piece if it had been billed as a complete work of fiction, but it isn't. It claims to be 'factual'.This film bears no resemblance to any real Marines I've ever known, with the possible exception of the character played by Peter Sarsgaard as 'Troy'. Not too surprisingly he is a dedicated, calm sea of professionalism compared to the rest. Also not surprising is that Hollywood made his character an ex-con to discredit any positiveness he could have brought to an otherwise dismal film. The one light of accuracy, if any, are depictions of the Marines in 'calmer' circumstances, training and interacting with each other. Those are remarkably realistic but they are also boring. I think that's likely where the author went astray, he tried to inject something not boring into a real story and had to resort to making it up.Since seeing the film I went to the trouble of doing some research. It turns out that the author has been repeatedly exposed as having plagiarized some of the book, made up other parts that he claimed were real (he never saw anything close to combat, casualties or other things depicted) and stole a number of tired old barracks/urban legends and tried to foist them off as not only having been real but ones he witnessed or participated in (like the video of the one Marines wife with their neighbor - never happened). In short, a number of sources on the internet hold that he's a liar, thief and plagiarist. To top that off, some of the things he claims to have done in the book/film are actual crimes - felonies to be exact, that would earn him time in Portsmouth Naval Prison if they were true.I think I am left feeling stunned that any organization would stoop so low as to produce such an openly inaccurate and untruthful collection of garbage as this. All of the participants in this should be ashamed of themselves.",Null,3,6,14 November 2005
Pearl Harbor," Tora Tora Tora meets 30 Seconds Over Tokyo
","I have seen and appreciated more films than anyone else I've ever met. I generally have a preconceived notion of what a movie is going to be about before I go and I am rarely wrong. I had decided I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw a trailer for it many months ago. It looked like a well-done epic and I wasn't disappointed, even though I grew weary of the more than usual hype that preceded it. I was hoping to have a ticket price worth of entertainment, not a soul enriching experience of nirvanic proportions, as some viewers seem to expect based on other comments I've read. Get over it people, it's a film. The criteria should be, 'Does it entertain 'me''. Well, this movie far surpassed my deliberately lowered expectations.I think I have seen every action and 'effects' movie ever made, having been a fan of such entertainment since the 1950's. I own copies of everything worth watching more than once. I went into this movie hoping it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment as Saving Private Ryan. It was far far better. The improvement to me was the much-increased plausibility of the character's stories. While Ryan was a contrived and twisted premise from a single bare thread of a real example, this movie was rich with the examples from many real life people and very real events. For example, it has surprised every young person I have talked with for them to learn there really were two young pilots who tore to a remote airfield and flew alone into the sky to challenge the collective assemblage of the Japanese naval air forces during the attack (so little real history is taught in schools now days) and I am still rankled to know the one instigator as portrayed by Affleck was denied the Medal of Honor because of his commander's mean spirited rejection because he had not been ordered into the air (a very real life travesty to fail to recognize amazing courage). How's that for a missed story line?I can also easily forgive the filmmakers in trying to present many stories in the form of the two main characters, Affleck and Hartnett, to tell a broader story of America. It saved time in trying to get the audience to buy into them emotionally. Sure some of the film wasn't historically accurate, so what, it's supposed to entertainment first and foremost. No historically based film I have ever seen has been completely accurate and those that have come close to that kind of reality have been roundly criticized for lacking 'action', as laughable as that irony is. Sure, an excellent film could have been made in two hours of footage, but instead we are treated with a lot more visually rich entertainment for our money - a real bargain. I also got the unmistakable impression that this was an attempt at much more than just a film about the attack on Pearl. It was an 'hommage' to America's efforts in the war - all of America.The love story was actually an extra bit of realism many people are enjoying. It may have been added to attract more female viewers, but so what, aren't they deserving of some consideration by Hollywood too? I cannot begin to count the number of people of my father's generation whom I have heard while I was growing up tell how they met and fell in love during the incredible turmoil of that war. This is the telling of another story in it's own right, of the love and loss of the American women who endured it on the home front. The dull heartache of that kind of empty fear was the reality of their war as they loved and waited for their men to return home - if they did. Sure, a magnificent war story could have been told without the love interest entirely, but it would have been a different movie and far less of a moneymaker, so it may never have been made (this is called economic reality). The truth is one must attract a broader audience to turn a profit these days. I can say I was very surprised to see quite a number of unaccompanied females in the audience - almost unheard of for an action movie. Two teenage girls who came alone sat next to me in the theater and they were absolutely transfixed by the action and moved by the romance. I have NEVER seen another war film attract young female moviegoers this way. There were dozens of them in the theater.This is one of the few films to ever impress me with it's combat special effects. Not the newness or originality of them, or of raising the gee-whiz level of what Hollywood could do (who really cares about that anyway except overactive immature males), but the accomplishment of something far more difficult; stunning realism. To achieve realism, sometimes, less is more. I worked within the Department of Defense for over 31 years. I saw and participated in 4 wars in the military and as a civilian. This film is the closest to the actual experience of the reality of combat I have seen to date, including the vaunted 'Ryan', which was more of a presentation of the grit realism of war. Some detractions I have read clearly weren't paying attention or perhaps the closest they've been to this kind of real war is whichever film they last saw. This film achieved the mechanical realism of the machinery of war. It also contained, hands down, the best aerial combat photography I have ever seen (though much was special effects). The feel of reality was almost startling. Not all of it was completely real as it still disappointingly had some of the usual overdone Hollywood pyrotechnic explosions with tons of gasoline to awe the naive audience, but the most real thus far. Add together sequences from this film, Ryan and a few very chosen sequences from the Thin Red Line and you have quite a stunning collection. I can't include the Viet Nam era war epics as they are too close to home; all of those attempts miss the mark with far too much overdone Hollywoodistic pyrotechnic depictions of action.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. All of the younger cast members gave me my money's worth, but I felt Affleck did quite an exceptional job with the heavy task he was given: to make such an over-the-top character believable - he was. Beckinsale's character was absolutely charming and I could easily see several young men fighting over such a beautiful actress. She did a very good job with the American accent too. Cuba Gooding's character seemed almost gratuitous and difficult to dovetail into an already packed story line but I'm glad he was there as he always gives a great performance and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this outing. Also surprisingly entertaining was James King as Betty. She really came across well on the big screen and I'd like to see more of her in the future. I was suitably impressed by Voight as Roosevelt and by Baldwin as Doolittle. Likewise, Mako as Yamamoto and Colm Feore as Kimmel were a valued addition, worthy of praise for their craft. They were fun to watch work. All gave great praise to the historical character's they portrayed with an integrity of realism not easily achievable. The overall quality of the rest of the cast was near impeccable with the only character I felt obviously underutilized being Tom Sizemore. I'd like to see him in more films with meatier roles. I also realize this film was already getting long - approaching The Longest Day in its scope and the length of its cast. Come to think of it, with a little more work and with Disney coughing up some more bucks this could have surpassed even that epic in actual run-time. It sure outdoes it in quality of product. I am going to supremely disappointed if this does not get an Oscar for effects and cinematography. The camera work was a real joy to watch with the only exception being the strangely blurry-lens effects thrown in the hospital scenes when it was under attack.Finally, in these types of films I always wonder how they are able to find enough Japanese actors to fill the cast. But those actors used here were quite excellent and gave heroic dignity to a very difficult task - to portray their historical countrymen without raising concerns of racism and engendering new nationalistic rancor against the Japanese. I would have liked to have seen more of Mako or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who played Genda, but I guess that film was Tora Tora Tora, which should be seen for historic comparison.",10,0,3,27 May 2001
Mamma Mia!," Take a Chance on This Film... [; )
","Of the choices available this weekend I desperately wanted to see something that would be fun. I cast my vote for this with hopeful expectations based mainly on my impressions from the trailers.I have to say that the result was I loved this film. I found myself smiling a lot and was very pleasantly serenaded by a number of nearby female voices in the theater singing along with the film; in itself a completely unique experience for me. Of the tens of thousands of films I've seen this spontaneously expressed joy was a first.I liked the sets and scenery, not spectacular by any means but pleasant. There was one scene that was very beautiful shot in Skopelos, Greece having to do with ... well, you'll just have to see for yourselves. The costumes and makeup were also very complimentary to the film, the makeup being surprisingly sparse but effective. The young female lead, Amanda Seyfried, was stunningly effective in the role of Sophie and seemed to radiate youthful beauty and exuberance at every turn. It was a real pleasure to watch her on screen. The other leads were perhaps the oddest collection of casting I've seen for a musical since Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin in Paint Your Wagon. Pierce Brosnan had the furthest to reach but acquitted himself admirably, giving the right note to the character still pining for Meryl Streep. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, usually in a far more macho environ, was a surprisingly good addition and so was the splendid Julie Walters who stole a lot of scenery when she was in front of the camera. She was fabulous. Colin Firth gave a surprisingly good turn as one of the fathers-elect but he's usually great in whatever he does. Streep was wonderful as usual, making me like the character with ease. But the memorable standout was still Seyfried. Whether she was singing, dancing or just radiating wholesome beauty, she was worth the price of admission alone.I suppose one should mention the music but that is anti-climactic considering it's all derived from the incredibly popular work from ABBA. It gave few unreachable challenges to the cast but that was perhaps what enabled such unique casting for a musical.I can recommend this film unreservedly. It was a lot of fun.",9,1,3,21 July 2008
The Fault in Our Stars," Great overall
","I'd hardly know where to start without giving away spoilers. Even after this long there are those who have not seen the movie ... or read the book. The film does a marvelous job of bringing the book to the screen with its themes and viewpoint intact. For that the filmmakers deserve much praise. The production values were high, the direction tight and on target and the locations, sets and music complimented rather than distracted. It goes without saying that the acting was talented and spot on. To begin, I especially liked Laura Dern. She's always good but I especially enjoyed her here. She reminded me exactly of some of the cancer mothers I've known and she did it with dignity and grace. Thank you Ms. Dern. I can't comment on the part played by Sam Trammel. I can't because his character is me. I should mention that unfortunately, for me, this subject matter was a bit too close to home. Once you've been down this road the world can never look the same again. That has to bring me to Hazel Grace; and the young talent who played her: Shailene Woodely. Ms. Woodley gave beauty, sensitivity, dignity and grace to the most difficult of characters. I could give in to my ceaseless grief and anxiety and say something mean-spirited about her performance because; after all, she's actually healthy and strong and is likely destined for a long, happy and successful life. How could she possibly begin to grasp the gravity of her character and the all-to-real physical pain and mental anguish that her character had to live with every second of her life? But, to her great credit, she pulled it off. At least she did for this film-goer and that's enough of an accomplishment for her young life. I'm glad I didn't have to cut her any slack; she had that line as taunt as it could be. The real question left for this film then, is if they did right by all of the very real Hazel's and Gus' out there. In the final analysis they did as much as could be covered in the short flash of time that is a film. It's perhaps all most audiences could take as well. It was very hard for me to sit through as it was. Had they struck a mark any closer to the source I don't think I could have lasted the film. My own family's experience was far worse than this. My oldest daughter had a brain tumor, the same kind as John Travolta's character in 'Phenomenon'. I guess that's ironic in some way. The only good thing I can say about that is that she very quickly lost the ability to understand what was happening to her. Another irony is that patients like her were mentioned in the book this film was adapted from. It said, '... Her brain cancer was of the variety that makes you not you before it makes you not alive.' That was the sole blessing in it; a perverse kind of mercy. But enough about me. See the movie. It's bound to give something to each one who sees it. If it does, do yourself a favor and read the book. It is better than the film ... all books are.",8,0,1,4 October 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Claimed Reality Is Flawed But Film Is Still Worth It
","As I am a thirty year military professional many people have asked my opinion of the film. This is it in a nutshell:The Weapons:The thing I noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used. It was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear. Especially noticeable were the Garands. Very old, aged, wood for instance. For as much money as they spent on the film, they could have done better.The Sniper:The sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations. The scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didn't make it. Most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character. Shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts. I have never seen any trained shooter operate like this.The Uniforms:The field jackets were a more faded color of OD than the originals. I know this is nit picking, but I had one of these when I was a kid - 82nd Airborne too - and the color was noticeably brighter. Also, everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insignia.The Battle Scenes:Every one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked. One guy did say there was not that much blood in real life (the sand absorbed it). Some others I have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far. But comparing it with the real stuff I have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle; and photos and film done at the time, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less 'gory' than real life. For me, the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nest.The scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving Germans who were then hosed down by two GI's with Thompson's was over the top, credibility wise. Gimme a break. This film is still Hollywood enough that the valiant American soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive; the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity. All of the Germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance; all fall to one-shot stops and there are no heroes, no gritty determination on the part of any of the Germans except for the guy with the bayonet. There were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladder/bowel emptying phenomenon ... I guess Hollywood wasn't quite ready for (oops) that. How many movies have you seen *that* in... one that I can recall ... perhaps no more ... they did so good with the sound, too bad they couldn't recreate the stench.The Characters:This is what bugged me the most. I grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of WWII combat vets. My dad, a disabled Navy vet, moved the family to one of those giant new GI housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area. I knew these men; Army, Air Corps, Navy, Marines. What they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended. VFW and DOD union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the 'war'. These men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why. They harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies. In this regard, this film did these men a great disservice; it made them look weak and cloying by comparison. The real men were the genuine article. Not fearless or supermen either, but their attitude was entirely different, their vocabulary was different, their demeanor was different. The guys in the hastily contrived unit the Hanks character took into the field were all supposed to be experienced Rangers. These were the real meat-eaters of the Army in WWII - the fore-runners of the Green Berets and, as such, were even less likely to act in the way the film showed. These groups were some real tough S.O.B.'s. To top it off, everyone's haircuts were not period. If you want to see something closer to the real deal, catch 'They Were Expendable'. To these performances, add lots of very creative profanity.The Plot:I could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission. Then, the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic (more Hollywood). I could have done a better plot in my sleep. The disobedience Ryan showed to the stated orders would not have happened. In real life he would have been ordered by the Cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been that.What I did like:The cinematography was superb. The sound was great. It was the most realistic depiction of the receiving end of gunfire I have heard on film to date. Still, this wasn't consistent throughout. The reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was better than what has probably been done to date. I think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it actually does to people. Real war is much worse than Spielberg shows. I like the fact that in spite of what Spielberg's political agenda may have been, people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free. That is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing.",9,1,2,22 July 2003
Seabiscuit," The Little Horse That Could
","This is the condensed true story of the legendary racehorse, Seabiscuit. As most films based on real events things are left out for reasons of length and to make a smoother flow. This is no exception. However, the things left out here are not crucial to understanding the story. The vents and people depicted were real enough. The makers of this film did a wonderful job of bringing this story to the screen. The small town audience I watched the film with applauded at the end. That's rare enough.The first thing that struck me watching the film as the story built was the wonderful period look of the film. High praise to the art/set designers/directors, costume designer and cinematographer. It is a wonderful film just to watch. I even liked the locations. I would love to know which of the locations listed had such beautiful fall colors that Pollard and the Biscuit rode through in the country-side. That was wonderfully beautiful.The actors were all in great form too. Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard gave a great standout performance as the often beaten, broken and tormented man who rode Seabiscuit to stunning victory so many times. A fun part went to real jockey Gary Stevens who has won the Kentucky Derby several times and is one of America's great living jockeys; a hall of famer. Who knew he could act? He did a great job playing George Woolf, Pollard's friend and mentor. 3 cheers for casting for getting him for this. Jeff Bridges did a wonderful job as the horse's owner Charles Howard. He was near-perfect here. I think this is the best performance I've seen him in. Michael Angarano did a wonderful but short turn as the young Pollard, I hope we see more of this fine young actor in the future. He's done a fair amount of television but this clearly showed him in a much more favorable light. Elizabeth Banks was very enjoyable as the 2nd, and more important Mrs. Howard. She has talent and should be one new actress we see more of too. Finally we have the wonderful talent of Chris Cooper as the trainer Tom Smith. His was a masterful performance; bringing warmth and humanity to a character of few words; no small achievement. It was teriffic to see him on screen as he molded the emotions of this complex man. He seems to get better with each new movie. His is clearly the standout dramatic performance here, with Maguire and Bridges tied for a close second. The movie was nearly stolen by the outrageous and comical character played by Bill Macy; 'Tick Tock McGlaughlin'. He was more than teriffic, maybe an Oscar nominee for this one. Drama it wasn't, but brother, was it ever great.I could list some faults with the film; like things it left out, or which parts of the story they dwelt on, or the things missing such as facts that the real Howard raced more than one horse and employed more than one jockey, but none of that would really add anything if they had been included. This was story telling pared down to it's most basic element and masterfully done. Bravo to all involved and thanks from me for making it worth the price of admission. I'll remember this film for a long, long time.",10,0,0,28 July 2003
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Humans are an afterthought
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes Put on your suspension of disbelief cloak and enter in ...Entering the theater I thought, do I really want to see yet another entry in the ape versus human saga? The truth is that I was primarily drawn by a curiosity to see what the more modern special effects could do to improve the look of this decrepit franchise. In a word, the effects are stunning as expected. So, in that way, the effects were no surprise. I don't know if just meeting expectations is what they were going for.The other curiosity was the story as it seemed a departure from the originals. Other than a few obvious nods to the original which felt strained, it was. When the original was released in 1968 the country, indeed the world, was living under the threat of immanent nuclear annihilation and the main focus of the evening news everywhere was the war in Vietnam. So, the story line of the original blamed the excesses of nuclear weapons for the downfall of humanity and the elevation of the simians to preeminent status. That theme carried through the sequels along with it's strong anti-war subtext. A lot of people were discussing the moral and ethical theme of the original film when it came out. That won't happen here.The new version has thrown out all of the basis for the original film and replaced it, ironically, with a strong, albeit possibly inadvertent, pro-war subtext. The other themes seem to be anti-animal research, anti-genetic research and the usual anti-authority figure. The majority of the plot is telegraphed far in advance so there are no surprises. In fact, if you've seen the trailers you've seen most of the plot.Like most movies, if you try to make sense of what's on screen you quickly begin to see the underpinnings of the whole story disappear. So do not try to rationalize it, it'll just spoil it. Instead just sit back and enjoy the effects. The lions share of the movie is the effects. While credit certainly goes to the creators of those effects, in this case, because of the method of animating them, a large part of the effort has to go to the ones upon whom those effects are applied. In this case that is first and foremost in the person of Andy Serkis. So, exactly how much of it is Serkis and how much the effects remains to be revealed. For now they form an inseparable nexus. That also applies to the rest of the ape-actors such as Richard Ridings as Buck.That brings us to the humans in the film. The clear standout here is John Lithgow. His performance as Franco's dad, who suffers from Alzheimer's is touching and in all ways superb performance. The other humans here are almost props or clich√©s. The actors are props in that the story revolves around them but is barely about them. They add color, like the natives in a Tarzan movie. James Franco is OK, but not great, as Lithgow's scientist/son but then again, he's given very little real material to work with so it may not be entirely his fault he comes across as kind of bland.His 'female lead' is Freida Pinto, of Slumdog Millionaire fame. She is pretty set dressing and doesn't do a bad job of acting. But there is something lacking from her performance, or maybe she just lacks much screen presence beyond being a kind, pretty face. Also, for a modern Hollywood film set in California, she seems rather overdressed. Again, considering it is California, perhaps an actress more like Jessica Alba might have been more appealing. In any event, her performance is forgettable. The good news is it doesn't detract any from the film.The rest of the actors are walking/talking props representing most of the modern day movie bad guys, like the cruel animal keeper, the greed driven boss, violent cops and the cretinish neighbor prone to outbursts of stupidity and violence, etc.That brings us back to the effects. It's entertaining enough to buy a ticket just for that and to see the way the film is boxed, as it is a great visual film. Besides, the filmmakers need to make enough to pay for all those CGI effects.By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",Null,0,1,21 August 2011
K-19: The Widowmaker," Surprisingly good ...
","I went to see this because I already had seen almost everything else playing and it looked as though it might be interesting. I wasn't so sure I wanted to see a movie about Soviet submariners. I served aboard American submarines in the 1960's and 1970's and I still have trouble not thinking of them as an enemy. On top of that I knew the entire real story of K19. I was a design engineer for the Department of Defense for many years and ended my career in a department for US submarine design. I felt, what more could I learn enough to make it worth the price of a ticket? I was pleasantly surprised.Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson did admirably well, even if their accents weren't always perfect (why bother with accents anyway in situations when real characters would not have been speaking English?). But I was far more impressed - and entertained - by the phalanx of unknown actors making up the remainder of the cast. They were marvelous and gave a heightened sense of realism just because their faces weren't familiar. Sam Spruell was especially touching as Dimitri. That it is his first work is a real treat to see. But the rest, Peter Stebbins, Christian Camargo, Roman Podhora, Ravil Issyanov and Dmitry Chepovetsky; where did they find these wonderful actors? Great casting overall ...The submarine environment was recreated with a nice feel for a foreign boat and the methods and problems those men faced were compelling, even to this very experienced high-tech expert. I loved the sets and costumes, it was very well staged, even down to the correct color handles on the Makarov's. I appreciated that the film makers cared enough to create this much realism for my enjoyment. I was kind of surprised, too, that the director was a woman. Usually this much action - especially military - is the sole province of men. But Kathryn Bigelow did a wonderful job, perhaps because there was more emotional tension and suspense than in the usual action offering.The other stellar ingredient for me was the wonderful selection of locations. Most were in Canada, but some was done in Russia, I see. It all looked so great.I will not discuss the actual subject of the movie. I wouldn't want to spoil it. One can find a documentary or two on the subject for more information. This is a more passionate telling of it though. It is a well thought out version of the actual events and does much to make my former enemy look human. I appreciate the effect. The story's largest lesson is that heroism can be found anywhere and the effect on those around it are universal.",9,0,0,21 July 2002
Brave," A Celtic Tale to the Core
","I was lucky enough to see this film in a movie with other paying customers. There was a liberal dose of children in the audience who, from the sounds of happiness during the showing, was proof that it should be a solid hit. Add to that a dreamy-eyed little boy of about 8 who said to me after the film, 'I gotta get me a bow and arrow!' That's about as good a testimony as you could get.I had heard a mention from a source or two - who should remain nameless - that they had trouble with the direction the story went or that it may have been too simplistic. First, I vividly recall people complaining that the story for UP! Was too com0plex, too adult, for a kids movie. But kids liked it anyway. So, they made the story simpler this time and there are complaints from other people. You can't have it both ways. Some people would even complain if they were hanged with a new rope.What this story does try to do is present a flavor of the Highland Scots in the middle ages. Hollywood being what it is, it's certainly not historically accurate in every detail, but my word, was the animation superb! It was simply magnificent in the depth and complexity. The star, Merida's, hair certainly had center stage a lot. I loved it! Such a riotous bouquet of autumn beauty is hard to find in real life, although I have to say I have a friend of long acquaintance who's hair is EXACTLY like Merida's. My only complaint about that character is with that coloring she screamed with the need for freckles! That would have made her visually perfect to type and character and the absence really disappointed me.Second, as to the story elements; I feel certain that there are few places on earth with a rich a history of mythical and magical creatures; all of which were taken quite seriously and believed without doubt. The old stories are replete with such tales containing Druids, witches, soothsayers, faeries, brownies, √πruisg, gruagach, little people, silkies, water horses, banshees, Bean-sh√¨dh, kelpies, Blue Kelpies, Seonaidh's, Changelings, Wulvers (a sort of kindly werewolves), Will-o'-the-wisps, Nuckelavees (a quite monstrous elf) and on and on. All of which goes to say that this animated film rests smack in the center of an ancient and rich culture and does it some justice, not in overreaching accuracy, but certainly in underlining the look and feel of the land and the people.I loved it, my daughter loved it and my grandkids loved it (it didn't hurt that this grouping contains several people with red hair). We loved the look of the people, the costumes, the sets - especially the forested ones and the wonderful voices! Billy Connolly, Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson all did a wonderful job.Oh, yeah, my 5 year-old grandson wants the girl ... ;) By Bruce L.

Jurassic World," Great film!
","I saw this film this evening (Thurs 6-11-15). I had to go to a later showing than I normally would because earlier times were sold out. There's a lot of great word-of-mouth. I think it deserves it! For me, it's the best since the original JP film. It is an excellent addition to the series. As things have evolved in the movie world, CGI makes just about anything that can be dreamt of visually possible. The only barrier left is the imagination of the filmmakers. So there's not much of anything new that can be added (I also saw it in 3-D. What's left to improve the movie going experience are the human creations: acting, story, sets, costumes, etc. I like what they did here. I especially liked the acting. Chris Pratt is the best actor yet to appear in these films - completely believable as an action star. He'd be a terrific Indiana Jones (as has been rumored) or even Han Solo; not to mention any number of new movie heroes yet invented. I like everything about him. I'd even go so far as to say he made the film.His co-star; Bryce Dallas Howard, was excellent opposite him. Although there was little chance to show it in this type of film, they had great chemistry. I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone; but the physical side of their relationship would have made a great film on its own (and considerably easier to make!). I loved her look in the film; almost China-doll-like at the beginning, although more of her natural freckles would have been wonderful. She is a stunning beauty and a great actress in the bargain. The rest of the cast did a standout job as well. Vincent D'Onofrio made a great guy to dislike. I also liked Jake Johnson, Irrfan Khan, BD Wong (the only cast member from the original Jurassic Park I think) and Judy Greer. Bravo to all!Onthe final analysis, very worth seeing.",8,8,20,12 June 2015
Avatar," New Sci Fi CGI Masterpiece
","There were disappointments, but I'll save those for last ...I went to this screening with higher expectations than I had for any film in quite a long time. I opted for the 3-D version to see how 3-D has progressed and was not disappointed. In fact, I was very pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the 3-D presentation. The technique was better integrated into this film than any other example I've seen; creating a nice standard text on things to do right if you want to make a good quality 3-D movie. Most films seem to add 3-D as an afterthought, barely making any impact on the presentation and sadly lacking imagination and creativity. That was not true with this offering, it was very creative and superbly imaginative. Avatar is a stunningly creative integration of the 3-D effect into the entire scope of the film to sometimes breathtaking result.That being said, lets explore the rest of the film: I did love the rest of the CGI effects, the best I've seen to date in any film. The look of the planet imagined here is the best I've seen - I wonder what Ray Harryhausen thinks of the current state of the art as seen here? The sets, in fact, the whole visual presentation apart from the 3-D were equally outstanding. Saying it is a visually stunning, superb film would not be too effusive in praise.The cast was excellent throughout, creating a wonderful film that will doubtless become a classic. Stephen Lang did a masterful job with the Colonel Miles Quaritch character, injecting just enough sinister personality to make a worthy antagonist to the bluish aliens; the Na'vi on the planet Pandora. Hardest to judge were the characters of Jake Sully, portrayed by Sam Worthington, and Neytiri, played with great gusto by the exotic and erotic Zoe Saldana. My problem with these characters is I don't know where their craft as actors departed from the CGI. The end results, however, were wonderful characters with more depth than one usually finds in science fiction films; especially Saldana's contribution. Zoe Saldana managed to make her character charmingly feminine and sexy as well as fiercely brave and courageous; something most actresses have trouble doing credibly in action movies. Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacon, and Giovanni Ribisi as the patently evil Parker Selfridge were all outstanding; adding a lot to the film's realism and credibility.I couldn't help but notice how scrupulously careful the makers were to avoid showing even a glimpse of an alien breast - I suppose there are Christian censors on Pandora too. I imagine many will think the Na'vi were styled after African and Native American culture. Perhaps they'd be right. I think it must have been difficult to concoct too exotic of an alien culture or it may have been too time consuming to present. It is at least solidly done and well constructed.One thing that must be applauded is the richness of the flora and fauna created for the planet Pandora. The film makers outdid themselves in that department; doing so well that at times the abundance and richness they injected into the film nearly overshadow the rest of what was going on in the film. Great touches in that regard was how small objects, insects, floating leaves, etc., were used to enhance the 3-D effects to stunning success.I'm likely in a very small minority of film goers who are disappointed with anything in this film. It undeniably outshines even the classics like Star Wars. Still, it missed the mark for me in a couple of areas. The elements that really let me down (more disappointing than I can describe) were the overall technology depictions of the earth people - referred to by the Na'vi as 'sky people'. Considering that the time-frame when this story was supposed to take place is 2154, 145 years from now, some of what the film makers chose to depict as examples of the preeminent technology of that time were terribly late-twentieth century-ish.I may be prejudiced by having spent decades working with the military's most technologically advanced weapon systems, but it didn't seem to me that it should be so much of a stretch to do better considering the effort that went into every other element of the film. For example, I know how to creatively solve the problem of interstellar travel in a much more entertaining way and hoped someone in the film's production end would catch on, but it wasn't to be.Also disappointing were the rather contemporary - to our time - communications, weapons and aircraft; there won't be anything like what they chose 145 years from now. And the oxygen masks; not very creative there either.Last, but certainly not least, were the disappointingly 20th century clothing. I certainly would have liked more imagination there. Perhaps the most noticeable example being the strategically snipped wife-beater that Michelle Rodriguez wore.I did like the visuals for what they did with the computer depictions but I think even those could have been done better.Well, maybe next time . . .The disappointments were easily forgivable (even the uncomfortable 3-D glasses were forgotten shortly into the film) considering the tremendous overall visual quality of every single thing they put on screen. There are not enough words of praise to adequately recommend this film as great entertainment with the caveat that in spite of the PG-13 rating and the exclusion of bluish alien breasts, it is very violent; so some parents may wish to consider that before toddling their offspring off to a Saturday afternoon at the movies.",9,6,13,19 December 2009
National Treasure," Pleasant Surprise
","I have to be honest and confess that I went to see this movie because I had already seen everything else I was interested in. There was nothing in the trailers that really made me want to see it. My reaction to them was 'rip-off of the Indiana Jones Series, it might stink'. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Well, semi wrong. It was in the Indy Jones genre of action-mystery swathed in a liberal dose of historic background. I think filmmakers hit a chord with audiences when they use a historical base because it makes it easier for the moviegoer to buy into the film's concept because they can relate to it from outside the world of Hollywood. In this case, the film is liberally sprinkled with historic factoids, some of which are even true (Well, it's still Hollywood after all.). All-in-all this is a movie made just for fun with the same sort of 1940's-50's Saturday afternoon moviehouse serial kind of thrills to it. So I guess Jon Turteltaub gets a big thank you from me for giving me this fun and entertaining film to pass away a snowy Sunday afternoon. But my highest praise goes to some possibly accidental additions, the actual presentation of an education as a good and desirable thing and for making the subject of history something other than the dry, boring exercise so many school kids think it is. For those, bless you guys one and all.Let's continue with the cast. I have to say I haven't enjoyed Nicholas Cage as much in a movie since Moonstruck. He fit the part here for me. I don't think I could buy him as a serious academic, but as this screw up version of one he seems perfect.... sorry Mr. Cage. His nemesis here is his former partner played by Sean Bean, who made an excellent bad guy with just the right emphasis and not too much. I hate over-the-top characters usually (The one possible exception being Alan Rickman in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). The striking and enjoyable Diane Kruger played the late entry love-interest for Cage. I liked her even if her character is entirely too beautiful for the dull administrator part. I hope to see more of her in films too. Hollywood again. But the real pleasant treasure in this film for me was the performance of Justin Bartha. I think this is the first thing I've seen him in and he made the overall cast far more enjoyable to me for the counterpoint he made with just the right touch of wit. He was so good I will now look for his name in film credits again hoping to see more of the very good things he seems to be very capable of. Bravo to casting for his selection here. The rest of the supporting cast was quite excellent too and doubtless responsible for the consistently overall excellence of the film. Jon Voight as Cage's Dad, Harvey Keitel as the G-Man and Christopher Plummer as the elder Gates were all very enjoyable to watch here.The rest of the film was up to the standards set for it with the ambitious and excellent script. Costumes, music, art direction, sets, second unit work, everything was great and blended seamlessly into great, old-fashioned entertainment. I'd recommend this for the whole family.",9,3,4,1 December 2004
The Red Violin," Absolutely wonderful
","I thought this might be one of those films that would be 'good for me' to see. I was mildly intrigued by descriptions of the story I had read and with the trailer, so I thought to take a chance. I took someone very close to me, an actual violin prodigy. Coincidently, her and I have recently been searching for a decent violin for her that is affordable by actual humans, so we could relate to parts of the plot first-hand. We arrived to a very thin theater in one of those mega-complex theaters, and while everyone was queuing up next-door to see the latest blockbuster from Hollywood I settled into an amazingly comfortable seat with an excellent view and prepared for whatever might come.I was shocked. This film turned out to be clearly one of the best movie going experiences I have had in ages. We see this as the story unfolds and is creatively told through the reading of the violin makers wife's fortune with a deck of Tarot cards. It is the story of a part of the life of a violin; of the humans who would dare to possess her beauty. A masterpiece of a craftsman's art, it is desired by many for it's acoustic perfection. But, as Tolstoy said, 'how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.' Or more interestingly, from Saint Augustine: 'Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.' There seems to be a curse on this instrument as it brings ill to those who manage to possess it. This makes the ending especially eerie.An original, imaginative and thought provoking story that engaged one's mind as American films almost never do. I will not describe more of the plot, it's far too good to ruin. The memory of this film will be one long treasured.Oh, as for my guest, the honest-to-God prodigy: she said the music was magnificent (it was) even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing, it was well done.",10,90,104,6 July 1999
Les Mis√©rables," Surprisingly Powerful
","I had not originally planned on reviewing this film, or seeing it for that matter, it was just a routine night out with friends and I had little input as to the final destination. Sometimes it's just more fun to take a back-seat and enjoy the company of others. It ended with the kind woman sitting next to me trying to unobtrusively stuff tissues into my coat pocket. Saying that much, post movie, I just had to say something about it to someone who wasn't there. It's said that happiness shared is happiness multiplied; but, it's just as true that it's happier still to broadcast your joy to the heights. Having said that much : The total production of the film was bleak and depressing, to say the least, perfectly in keeping with the film's theme. The sets, costumes, makeup, art everything were all top-notch. It also helps to have actually read the novel. If you do you'll have a deeper understanding of the characters, motivations and the significance of the historical setting. Hugo was brutal.What's left is to find performances by the cast you like. Wow, to start, it's undeniable that Anne Hathaway as Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Russel Crow as Javert, and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were all tremendous. I have to mention Hathaway's performance was very moving. She gave real life and form to one of literature's most wretched characters. Crowe was exceptional as a classic villain cast into that position by life's uglier circumstances. Amanda Seyfried was breathtakingly beautiful as the story's corner post, being - at the same time - Fantine's downfall and Valjean's salvation.As for the rest ... well ... ... it's hard to put into words really, but Hugh Jackman was nothing short of stunning in the lead; and stunning is too little praise for what I experienced. I had no idea he was such an incredibly talented singer. The film is not really a musical (does anyone else know the difference anymore?), it's a grand opera and Jackman, I think, could hold his own in most operas in the world he's that good. Wow. Amazing. The music had such power and passion it was impossible not to be moved. Now, I have to admit that I might be a touch biased, being a father of a grown, married daughter myself I can totally identify with his performance ... and ... a professional who should know once told me that I reminded her of Valjean in the book. But even with those biases it was still nothing less than a completely magnificent performance. At this point I am left drained and convinced that it was the most powerfully convincing performance I've ever witnessed by a man on film; or any other media for that matter. It even washed away the smarmy, slimy aftertaste from being subjected to Django Unchained the day before.So, by all means, see Les Miserables. It is an uplifting paean to the soul of humanity and reflects that good can be found anywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. Thanks Hugh.By Bruce L.

Thor," Entertaining, BUT ...
","Thor is the Norse god of thunder, among other things, and is still revered as such in some places. But this is not about religion although most of the story's framework is drawn from it.I first learned about the God Thor reading about him in the pages of my parent's encyclopedia late at night by flashlight. I think I was about 10. To me, Norse mythology was just more interesting than the Greek or Roman. Among the things I learned, Thor also represented fertility and was the protector of mankind. Not altogether bad things for a movie hero. So, I was hoping this film would turn into one of those guilty pleasures, not in least part because I can also remember reading the comic book when I was a kid.The title character is played by Chris Hemsworth, who has a modern day comic book physique to fit the part. He's actually best when he's more serious. He doesn't do the comedic parts of the film nearly as convincingly. Writing him in as completely clueless about human culture on Earth doesn't fit well for the part of a God.Thor's love interest is amply provided by the stunning Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Portman, for her part, adds a lot to the film both with her excellent characterization and just by beautifying the screen. She is just one of those people you have a hard time taking your eyes off of. I liked the comic elements she was in, her's is the kind of face you like to see happy.The supporting players, Anthony Hopkins (as Odin), Rene Russo (subtly underplaying Frigga, wife of Odin and Queen of Asgard), Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Tom Hiddleston are all terrific. I am struck at the range I've seen in the performances of Stellan Skarsg√•rd. Is this the same guy who played the palpably evil Cerdic in 'King Arthur'? Of course it is. It's also the same guy who sang and danced in Moma Mia as Bill. That's some wide range of talent. I think he's one of my favorite people to see on screen. He's always doing something interesting and he ads subtle touches here that provide some connectivity and explanation. Tom Hiddleston added something great as one of the film's villains. He didn't over do it either. Thank you for that.But one of the best new actresses around, Kat Denning added marvelous relief as Portman's quirky and funny assistant. I am looking forward to seeing her do a lot of great things in the future. I hope the filmmakers also see that she's not just funny, but can be really sexy too.Overall, however, the film left me wanting more. I tried to understand why I felt that way. I think the most disappointing element was the story. It wasn't bad, really it wasn't, just disappointing. I was hoping against hope that it would more closely follow the original Marvel comic I remember so well. In those, Thor was sent on a mission to Earth by his father, Odin. He lived life on Earth as a disabled doctor, Dr. Donald Blake, who then became the superhero when he was needed by tapping his cane on the ground. Then his cane became the magic hammer Mjolnir and he was magically transformed into Thor to do battle against evil.Well, that's not the plot of the movie. The plot of the movie is considerably weaker and it seems the lighter, comedic elements were an afterthought to prop it up. The comedy, perhaps, saved the story from becoming trite. There's nothing wrong with some comic relief, but it shouldn't feel like it was NEEDED.In the film, Thor is cast out of Asgard, presumably to learn a lesson. He must become worthy to return, but the film's Asgard is overwrought, hardly seeming like the kind of place a playful young pagan God would care to go back to (How much more entertaining would have been the participation there of Freya, goddess of love, beauty, fertility and war).The makers of the film (including the director Kenneth Branagh) might have taken some council from the old movie, The Vikings (1958) and the celebratory banquet hall in it, presided over by the obviously hedonistic Earnest Borgnine. That setting seemed a far more desirable candidate for a Viking Asgard than the stark sterility of this film's sets. Borgnine's version seems like more the place a warrior would like to be swept into Valhalla by scantily clad Valkyries. The injection of the other kind of reality would have been far more entertaining than all the CGI nonsense here. It just wasn't interesting at all.While we're there, the use of 3D in this film was my second big 3D disappointment recently. It would have been nice to see it well used but it goes by without hardly any notice. It made me feel cheated out of the extra admission price.Some of the other CGI effects were very good and much more original than some other recent offerings. The film's use of color and space was fairly stunning. But I'd like to send a note here to the film makers, Gods should not need any kind of mechanical apparatus to wield their power. That would be more impressive than what was done here.In the final analysis, it's worth the trip to the theater, you'd definitely benefit from seeing this on a really big screen. However, you won't really miss anything if you opt for the digital version and skip the 3D.By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",7,0,1,14 May 2011
War of the Worlds," Tom can run
","War of the Worlds I debated whether skipping this for a time just because it was a remake of an old classic I had seen and remakes rarely live up to, let alone surpass the originals. For those others not old enough to recall, the original was made in 1953 and starred Gene Barry, later to go on to greater fame as the star of TV's western series 'Bat Masterson (1958)' and 'Burke's Law (1963)'. But boredom and a night wanting to escape reality won out, so I went on opening night, something I almost never do because of the crowds. As it was the theater was sold out all but the last showing, so guess how late I stayed up on a work night? Anyway... I digress... I was prepared to be disappointed.Let's address the obvious first. Well, the script didn't exactly follow the book (which I read as a young boy along with the rest of Well's works) but it's likely better given the medium here. The screenplay did a rather great job of updating the old classic's story line to something that at least seemed plausible, given the theme. For that bit of slight-of-keyboard one must give thanks to Josh Friedman, who 'consulted on the recently enjoyable 'Sahara' but seems to have few other credits to boast of. His list should rightfully grow after this effort, all masterfully photographed by the stunningly talented cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (another Oscar for him perhaps?).After the story, to build a good, never mind great, Sci Fi piece, we must have adequate sets, art direction and costuming. These were all top notch and also fit the film quite well. Some of the 'looks' of the sets here are Oscar worthy in scale, scope and ambition so we should hear more in the future about this effort.Next, one must mention the efforts of the director, the legendary Steven Spielberg. I think he elicited perhaps the best performance to date from Tom Cruise and excellent performances from Tim Robbins and the young Ms. Dakota Fanning. Their performances are somewhat limited by the type of story it is, but they all do extremely well in making it a great movie. Watch for Gene Barry, the star of the original film, making a cameo appearance near the end of the film (apparently Tom Cruise's character's ex-father-in-law). The one thing that is hard to do is introduce anything in this kind of a story, where all of humanity is so completely devastated by the invaders. The character Cruise plays would be very difficult for any actor as they made him a pretty unsympathetic blue collar/red-neck type of a shiftless ruffian; a failed ex-husband and what appears a joke as a father. Still, with all of that going against him, Cruise manages to make us root for his character. In the end I think they went a bit overboard in trying to make him look like just an ordinary guy who still manages to somehow survive the unthinkable against all the odds. The nuances in his performance will likely be missed or misunderstood by many, especially by his leagues of fluttering femme fans.Last, but certainly not least in this genre, are the special effects. Here, all the stops are pulled and there are some great effects that contribute to the finished product in the best possible way. Sitting in the audience of a packed theater I could feel the audience react en-mass to many of them.All-in-all, the producers delivered what is likely better than the original, thoroughly entertaining and definitely worth the price of admission. It is classic Science Fiction in it's rawest manifestation so it may not be favorite of general movie goers, but as I filed out of the theater with the pressing throng (I seemed to be one of the VERY few people in the theater OVER the age of 20) I heard many patrons speak positively of it. I can recommend it, especially to Sci Fi fans.",9,5,10,30 June 2005
Burlesque," Entertaining
","I waited a long time to write this review. I liked the film a great deal but I'm not so sure everyone will. It is entertaining in the way of old fashioned entertainment. Other people in the theater I attended liked it a lot also. That was easy to ascertain by the loud comments both during and after the film.The story, itself, is a little shallow, mainly it's there as a means to fill in the space in between the elaborate musical numbers. However, the story is enough for the vehicle it carries, happy ending and all.Cher, as the club owner Tess, has top billing but the entire show is undoubtedly Christina Aguilera as country-girl turned burlesque performer Ali. I'm old enough to say that in my life I've seen most of the premiere singing performers of modern times, many in live concert. Little Christina Aguilera is not just in a class by herself. Ms. Aguilera is in another universe, perhaps even another dimension. Her voice has a tonal quality, a power and a range that is nothing short of staggering. But the best part is that she knows how to make fullest use of that magnificent instrument.Every second that Christina Aguilera is on screen she is absolutely riveting. You can't take your eyes off of her; and not just because she's remarkably beautiful. Here she is in this film, surrounded by a good number of extremely beautiful and talented women, yet they all seem to fade into the background fog when she is on. She has something more than beauty. She radiates raw animal magnetism and positively smolders in some kind of unidentifiable sexual power that just plain overshadows everything around her. In short, this film is well worth watching just for Aguilara's screen time.If you can tear yourself away from watching Christina, there is more here to see. All the participants turn in great performances. All the dancers surrounding her are talented and wonderful to watch. All together they create very memorable entertainment. Kristen Bell as Nikki and Julianne Hough as Georgia are great but it's Bell who is the surprise. Being so used to seeing her as the usual blonde adornment in romantic comedies she surprised me with her dancing talent. She's really good. And, Hough is a given in a dancing costume; as flawlessly great as she is beautiful.For me, the performance I enjoyed the most other than Christina's was Stanley Tucci as Sean. Mr. Tucci is a great talent who adds character and charm to everything he does and he won't disappoint anyone here.I saved any negatives for last and none have anything to do with the cast. I found I didn't like the sound the way it was presented. The techniques they used tended to make the performances almost look like they were all canned/lip synced. I'm sure they thought the vocals had more power the way they did them but it truthfully detracted from the overall presentation.The decision to make a PG-13 rated film was, no doubt, made to try and capture the kiddie ticket buyers. I honestly feel that if they actually pulled out the stops and made an honest R rated film with a more adult slant it would have been better and more profitable in the long run. To me, trying to make anything called 'BURLESQUE' anything other than an adult film just seems ludicrous on the face of it.In spite of the negatives it's still entertaining. I'll take friends to see it with a clear conscience.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",7,13,14,17 February 2011
Rango," Hit that's amiss
","I began to like the film right away. I was expecting to be delighted with all the amazing animation greatly enhanced by the stellar cast and a funny and heartwarming story. The opening scene with the adorable owls promised something good to come. I settled down in my seat and cracked open my large bag of Corn Nuts. The introduction of the title character, Rango the Camelion, followed suit. The poor little guy was suddenly ripped from his imaginary idyllic environment with the humans and thrust into the grave dangers of the real world. Then something happened. Thump. The film that had started out like Bullet Bob Hayes running a down and out then, unfortunately, slowed down like an old man out for a 50 foot jog in the park.As the film meandered along it became increasingly hard for me to maintain interest. That surprised me coming as it did from the same people responsible for a number of great action films. Maybe story boarding may have helped. Maybe having a bit of assistance from someone ‚Äì anyone ‚Äì more experienced in creating animated films may have helped. Perhaps they felt Pete Docter was too pricey. Having no one was more costly yet.Speaking as a trained artist, the animation itself is a masterpiece of the genre. At times, it's hard to believe some of the things you are seeing on screen are animation; it's that realistic. That was the best saving grace of the film, it gave me something of considerable interest to study during the too frequent sluggish stretches.I expected some visually stunning characters coming from the genius of Industrial Light and Magic. I was to be disappointed. I got the feeling that no one was in charge of the store, so the employees were skateboarding down the aisles.The 'star' of the trailers and the film is a quirky chameleon. That would make one expect some similarly adorable co-stars. Not so much. Whoever was responsible for character design seems to have come from a dark place they shouldn't have left.Virtually none of the films characters, except for perhaps the mariachi owl quartet, are what one could call endearing enough to make action figures from. I get the feeling the designers thought they were creating characters who would be offbeat in a quirky, oddly funny sort of way. Instead, they created an ensemble for a theater of the bizarre, unsightly bordering on the grotesque. A film peopled with a few such characters can be interesting for the counter-point they often times offer. But having all the characters like that is just uncomfortably unsightly. Compounding the felony, they chose for the film's setting one of the more unappealing areas of the world; the sparsest parts of the Southwestern American desert. I understand that they felt it gave some degree of credence to the single plot element. In retrospect, they may have been better served, and in so doing better serve the filmgoing public, by having a look at how-to-write-a-book-now.com and then develop a plot set in a more appealing area of the world.Some of the character's disquieting appearance might have been counter-balanced by other endearing qualities but, alas, such was not to be.Beyond their appearance, the Western accents the actors tried to emulate with most of the dialog fell short of actually being intelligible in places. One might tend to blame that sort of studied mumbling on the actors going a smidgen too far in trying to satirize those sorts of characters; but I'd lay the blame on the director's doorstep as it's his responsibility for that sort of thing appearing in the film. In any event, it fell flat. Perhaps it'd be better with subtitles.The actors, without exception, turned in solid performances. Johnny Depp was in fine form as the title character's voice and complimented by Isla Fisher as the the strange lizard girl afflicted with petit mal seizures. Ned Beatty, Abigale Breslin, Timothy Olyphant, Alfred Molina and Harry Dean Stanton contribute their usual quality work. And, lets not forget Bill Nighy as the nasty snake. But for all their effort one cannot get past the meager material they're given to work with. Listening to them deliver the material is better than the overall film.I had the nagging feeling that this film developed with a few well-meaning guys over a couple of beers who had worked together before and thought their little joke was hilarious and then muscled the funding for this as some sort of requite for previous successes. That thought congealed with recognition of scenes that appeared to have been designed for 3D. The fact that the film is not in 3D may be a tacit admission from the makers that they are aware they missed the mark with this one.Lastly, there's a sparsity of elements to hold the attention of children; who are usually the target demographic for animated films. There were children in the theater and I could tell they weren't entertained by all the noise they were making.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",6,1,4,9 March 2011
Shall We Dance," Great Fun
","I went to this today at a Sneak Preview with my daughter. I was hoping to not be bored. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find this a greatly entertaining film, kudos to the screenwriter Audrey Wells who crafted an excellent presentation from a work originally by Masayuki Suo, who wrote the Japanese film from which this is a remake. There was so much I liked it's hard to decide where to begin. At times infectious with fun and genuinely funny this is a great look at several aspects of enhancing one's life. The story was much better than most dance movies as it was less about dance and more about what it means to be human. For that we should thank Director Peter Chelsom whose only other notable work seems to be the film 'Serendipity'. In this outing, the experienced Richard Gere (who, BTW, is only a year older than me) plays a highly successful attorney bored with his life in spite of being married to a stunning and still very sexy Susan Sarandon. He seems to have everything on the surface (how could you not with Ms. Sarandon as a wife?), everything that is, except fun in his life. He longingly spies a brooding Jennifer Lopez staring out the window of an old dance studio in decline as he passes by on the L train each day as he goes home from work. She raises his curiosity enough that he thinks he wants to meet her. It's a dance studio with a sign that says that watching is welcome. Lopez immediately scoops him up for a dance class for beginners in ballroom dancing and there it takes off. His initial interest in the famously callipygous Ms. J is finally supplanted with a genuine love of dancing. He is hooked and it changes his life for the better and we have a great time sharing his new found joy. I was pleased beyond words that this did not fall headlong into what could have been a film of nothing but infidelities. That it didn't follow that path is a laudable tribute to scores of real people who do the same every day; turn away from temptation. I think this is just about my favorite role I've ever seen Gere in. He played the part with great skill and brought out just the right emotions from the audience who applauded at the end. Even the great Ms. Sarandon adds an unexpected turn as philosopher with a comment on the realities of marriage that ring fully true. She made the perfect counterpoint as the amazing superwife who made us all wonder if Gere was nuts for being so unhappy at the start.As for the rest of the cast, Anita Gillette was wonderfully cast as the studio owner Miss Mitzi. Her portrayal of the older woman who has her best days behind her is both touching and sweet without making us feel sorry for her. She seems in her element here. She did a wonderful job. Bobby Cannavale as 'Chick', whom I last saw playing a ruggedly handsome paramedic in the TV series Third Watch, did a terrific job as one of Gere's fellow beginners. He also gave one of the biggest laughs of the film just at the end. We should be treated to more of him on the big screen, he graces it well. The previously unseen Omar Benson Miller as 'Vern' and Mya who plays his girlfriend both added some warm moments of their own, his in a more literal sense. The very good Lisa Ann Walter plays Bobbie, a very funny character role she wore so well she nearly owned every scene she was in. Just about the best in the film was Stanley Tucci, who did an absolutely brilliant turn as - and I paraphrase - 'Just about the only hetero guy on earth who like parading around dancing in sequins.' He was great, so great in fact, that if he doesn't get a nomination for a Best Supporting Actor award he'd be robbed. He did steal a lot of scenes with no apologies needed. He deserved every one.The rest of the elements in the film worked very well to paint just the right mood. The sets were realistic and not overly noticeable, leaving the attention to the actors where it belonged. The costuming was great and added some great moments of their own, from Sarandon in a T Shirt to Lopez in an amazing gown near the end to even Gere's tuxedos and natty business suits. But it's the costumes of Tucci and Walter that are the most entertaining. The musical score was great too, just right for the dancing and mood of the film. The sound editing was outstanding, very enjoyable.We all left the theater with smiles on our faces talking about bringing friends back to see it when it comes out. It is a film well worth the price of admission.",9,26,32,2 October 2004
Footloose," An entertaining film
","This modern remake of a cultish classic is at least as palatable as the original. The updates work well for this kind of film, which is, admittedly, a semi-musical. So I was pleasantly surprised that it was worth the price of admission, with some change back to boot.To make it enjoyable the film at least had to do the music and dancing well, which it did. The two young stars, Julianne Hough as Ariel Moore (a preacher's daughter) and an unknown for me; Kenny Wormald as Ren MacCormack, did deliver on the dance floor. Both of them are superb dancers and Hough, especially, looked great in the saloon, line dancing scene. I think part of the reason she's amazing to watch is because she looks like she's having the time of her life.But music and dancing can't be the whole movie, we hope, so there has to be dabs of acting to weld the disparate pieces together. The sparks to accomplish the welds are some fine moments by all the supporting actors. It leads off with Dennis Quaid, playing Hough's ministerial father. He's turned into an excellent actor over the years and is believable in the role. There is also Ray McKinnon as Wormald's uncle. He's an asset to the film, one of the best actors on screen that night. Miles Teller as Willard, Wormald's side-kick was surprisingly good, an engaging personality that gave some comedic relief to the rest of the proceedings. The rest of the supporting cast were assets as well; Andie MacDowell as Hough's mother. Then there was Patrick John Flueger as Chuck Cranston, the resident bad guy along with the town meanie played by Brett Rice as Roger Dunbar. Also, worth note was Ziah Colon as Rusty; Hough's friend.But the real acting surprise, and treat, was Ms. Hough. She was not only believable in just the right degree at the serious, crucial, points but solid throughout. The character she played called for a fair range of emotions and it was a genuine pleasure to watch her deliver every time. Even in the films early scenes, she looked radiant sans makeup. I appreciated the addition of those glimpses of her natural state, because as a trained artist I saw them as a great study in the structure of a classic beauty. I think she's the rare girl who looks just as beautiful without the makeup. And on top of that she can act. In this instance, she clearly outshines the female lead in the original. Hough's stunning looks are soon overshadowed in the film by the sheer talent she so effortlessly gives the audience.By Bruce L.

Sin City," Comic Noir
","To begin I feel compelled to say that I have been a die-hard movie fan for over 40 years. There isn't much I haven't seen - much of quality at least. This film is one of the few that drew me in almost entirely on the strength of the trailers. It looked to be innovative if nothing else, and since I am also an alpha-nerd deeply enmeshed in the world of advanced technology I found that allure irresistible. Almost every frame looked CG enhanced in one manner or another. Another draw was the casting. The lineup of talent promised here was another irresistible charm.As for the story, well, let's just say that the 'R' rating is appropriate for the violence alone, which is pervasive and often barbaric. The dialog isn't very 'rough', being more reminiscent of a 1950's Mickey Spillane detective novel than more modern offerings, almost bordering on a sophomoric satirization of something like Spillane. It is forgivable in this example of the genre. Also glaring is the heavy-handed socio-political cynicism of the no-good-deed-goes-unpunished variety in the writing. There is also bound to be some negative views of the film for its uniform portrayal of women as almost nothing other than sex objects, but no one's intellect is overly challenged here so it can be chalked off to the general area of suspension-of-disbelief one must often undertake to approach viewing many films.So, needless to say, I entered the theater with more than a small bit of expectation. I think I can say I wasn't too disappointed. The film faithfully followed the 'Graphic Novel' in most details, save for a few transgressions such as the decidedly overdressed characterization of the Nancy Callahan exotic dancer character by the apparently overly-modest Jessica Alba. By contrast, the appearance of Carla Gugino on screen in the part of Lucille was so charged with raw feminine sexual energy it will burnt a hole in the screen and straight through your retinas. She is the real poster girl for this film, at least the one best representative of the material in the original 'novels'.Some of the other characters were nothing short of outstanding. Notable standouts were Bruce Willis as the hard luck cop Hartigan and his nemesis Senator Roark, played to a turn by Powers Boothe. Clive Owen, who has been working a lot of late, did a powerful job as Dwight against the amazing presence of Rosario Dawson as the dominant Gail. Mickey Rourke, whose career hasn't exactly been on fire of late, gave a powerful portrayal of the obsessed Marv, out to avenge his Goldie, played to stunning perfection by the beautiful Jaime King (who also played the twin sister Wendy). Other standouts were Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Alexis Bledel (what photographic genius to highlight those amazingly unreal blue eyes), Michael Madsen, and Brittany Murphy, whom I could have taken more of on screen. Not to be left out, Elijah Wood gave a chilling performance as the very demented Kevin, followed close behind by Rutger Hauer as the twisted Cardinal Roark and the unrecognizable Nick Stahl as the Yellow Bastard. All are to be congratulated on outstanding performances giving life to this gritty if somewhat left-of-sane set of stories.The rest of the film presentation was wonderfully done with a deep, dark, noir-type atmosphere that I loved. It was another of the draws for me, personally. It's hard to heap much praise on the rest as it's difficult to tell where things like set decoration end and computer generated graphics begin. The blend is seamless, however, and of the best quality. The art direction, costumes and makeup were wonderful as well. The musical score was appropriate but mostly unmemorable, too overshadowed by the powerful visual presentation on screen.All-in-all this is an excellent film if you can stomach the violence and the negative social commentary.",8,0,0,11 April 2005
Windtalkers," Little Nickie Cage vs the whole Japanese Army
","I had waited quite a long time to see this film since it's postponement from last fall. During my 31 years in the military I had learned of the story of the code talkers long ago and wanted to see some honest portrayal of their brave history. Instead, we get a run-of-the-mill action picture with little to redeem it. Let's comment on the small good I found, first:The best part of the film, hands down, was the very likable, dignified and honest performance of Adam Beach as . I could have done without everything containing Cage and filled the time instead with his great interpretation of his character. The second best part of the film was Roger Willie's performance as Pvt. Whitehorse. I loved this guy. He reminded me of real friends I had in the military. He very honestly portrayed a real man. He was far more entertaining to watch than most of the rest of the film. Mindy Marin should be thanked for finding him and Beach. The earnestly real portrayal of Sgt. Ox Henderson by Christian Slater was also more rewarding to watch than much of the rest of the film. This is not his usual type of role and I have to say I enjoyed the change. I hope we see more such versatility from him in the future. The man can apparently do more than pretend to act. Still, the standout was clearly Beach and I sincerely hope it at least gets him an Oscar nod. I would have enjoyed Frances O'Connor's role as the WAVE Navy Corpsman who befriended Cage if she had a more reasonable reason to be in the film other than a gratuitous attempt at romance - which miserably failed at that. She looked and felt real in her crisp whites and was certainly lovely to behold. Considering the gratuitousness of her character it's a wonder there wasn't a nude love scene or two between her and Cage. Her role wasn't broad enough to enjoy her much or harshly judge her but I've seen her talent before so I wasn't disappointed at least. I hope to see more of her in the future where she has more of a role.The costuming was solidly done and authentic for the most part as were props (with the sole exception of the world's most powerful bazooka). I liked the locations chosen and the feel of the weather was a nice touch. I even liked the choice, though probably accidental, of the Navy M1928A1 Thompson for Cage rather than a later Army model M1 Thompson. Nice Marine authenticity.There's the cue for my general criticisms. The director, like many of his colleagues in Hollywood, has a freakish fetish for fake gasoline fueled explosions (like with the bazooka). Real explosions rarely generate a bright orange fireball and there were scores of them in this film. Hollywood seems to feel that reality is boring. Too bad that attitude robs the public of a more realistic experience. Also lacking in acceptable realism were the sound effects. One would assume that with 20+ people working on sound, one of them would trouble themselves with what the authentic weapons actually sounded like.One should mention Nicolas Cage's performance. Perhaps it's not his fault for being asked to carry a film with no plot and no depth. If one considers that, he did his part in providing an action hero quite well. Some critics have called his performance overwrought'. I disagree. I have known real warriors with just as much intensity and introspection as the character he portrayed. Good for him. It's just that it was so unnecessary.Perhaps some other, more reality based director may have found the incredible story that is buried here. Perhaps its not his fault and he was just doing the best he could with what he was handed. I doubt it, but one can dream. At least he didn't do anything to spoil the good parts and, let's face it, he may have even had a hand in Beach's and Willie's performances. That would be laudable and worthy of praise. However, other than my negative comments above, the vast majority of the film seemed to be Woo's portfolio of explosions and flying bodies, compliment's of Cage for the most part, and completely devoid of any plot save the gratuitousness of the carnage. Never mind the gratingly obvious errors such as Cage firing 8 rounds from a 7 round pistol, it's just had to swallow one Marine that's so gung-ho he could kill most of the enemy army single-handedly. Furthermore, 10% of what was put on screen would have been sufficient to demonstrate for the 100th time that war is hell. Their money would have been better spent hiring a writer who could actually find the plot and buy less gasoline. These two who call themselves writers have actually written damn little save, I'm not surprised, 'Blown Away' and the silly but cute 'Chasers'. John Rice and Joe Batteer seem to be names to avoid if one is searching for quality. They are certainly not Steven Ambrose (recent controversies notwithstanding).What very tiny bits of the film that were actually devoted to the code talkers was interesting and left me wanting a great deal more. I really did buy the ticket hoping to learn more of them and their historic role contributing to the American victory in the Pacific. I was sadly disappointed. I give it a C+, mostly thanks to Beach and Willie.",Null,0,0,15 June 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Will give you a headache
","I sometimes have the pleasure of babysitting my Grandkids, and my 4 year old grandson absolutely delights in throwing his toy cars and trucks off of the second floor landing and seeing them burst apart. He then collects and plays with the pieces, sometimes breaking them even more. This movie is like that. It's like the little boys who used to play with the transformer cars when they were little got older and now they're still playing with them through the manipulations of cameras and computers.This film does exhibit all of the usual modern computer generated effects. The locations are widely separated with nothing being too spectacular in that regard. The costuming is simple as are the props (except the computer stuff of course). The sets are, well, hard to judge because you can't really believe they're not primarily computer generated effects. I think the problem is they keep trying to do bigger and bigger special effects and at some point it almost gets boring from being so uniformly explosive and overwhelmingly unreal. I'll invent yet another new term here to cover it: 'Action Movie Desensitization'. One can't believe that these types of films are not solely aimed at the average 12 year old out of school for the summer. There's little else in the theaters.The film also requires an immense degree of the ability to suspend one's disbelief to begin to watch it. The plot is as thin and makes about as much logical sense as a 1930's comic book plot, but it's there if you want to try to follow it. If you saw any of the preceding 'Transformer'-type films you could likely write a better plot yourself; so just substitute your own plot in your head as the explosions unfold (NOTE to writers; a college graduate usually isn't a 'teenager').That leaves the acting. The principle characters do yeoman service for their paychecks. Several previous denizens of Transformerville return to reprise their former roles with Shia La Beouf straining his best to out-panic and out-sweat his previous filmic efforts. He does so well, along with John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Patrick Dempsey and Alan Tudyk. The always watchable Frances McDormand comes on strong as a bad-womanesque government wienie. She was cool being bad. John Malkovich provided a great characterization as La Beouf's mildly-insane, oddball boss. He and McDormand are likely the best things in the film, BUT, there was a truly kinetic, unhinged, off-the wall performance by the increasingly popular Ken Jeong. Watch for him, he's a riot.The odd addition is 'the girl'- there's always a girl. In this case the very publicized Megan Fox from the former films was unceremoniously replaced for little understood insults to the hands that fed her. Such is life. But, Fox's bad luck provided all the excuse necessary to replace her with a younger model, literally. In this instance 'the girl' is 'unconventionally beautiful' 24 year-old British farm girl/model named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whitely's previous claim to fame, it seems, is the talent to look decent while walking around in public places in her underwear, which, of course, brought her to the attention of these film makers, so, at this point in her career I imagine her strategy has worked out rather well. She's not terrible in the film so at least she doesn't embarrass herself. However, skimpier costuming may have brought in a few dozen more teenage boys.I couldn't help but note that every time Whitely appeared on camera, or in some cases even close-by off-camera, the script became peppered with some rather obvious and sophomoric sexual innuendos and double-entendres accompanied by some rather epic leering. The most blatant one early on coming from someone commenting on the container La Beouf's medal came in. And, please, no one spoil it for me by claiming it was unintentional. I, at least, wanted to give the writer credit for getting away with some originality.Another thing one can't help but notice the height disparity between the two leads, La Beouf and Whitely. I checked and he lists his height in his bio as an entire quarter of an inch taller than her's states. There seems to be different people playing La Beouf as his height seems to change up and down by four inches or more throughout the film. Some of that can be explained by her footwear, but not all of it. One may wonder why I mention that? I mention it because I was so disinterested in the 'action' on screen that I was looking for other things to find interest in on screen. Still, I have to give credit for any shorter guy willing to undertake scaling mount Whitely. It must have been very fun for him.In the long run, I would have much preferred it had they cast a 'real' young actress in the role instead of a model. There are a number of good ones to choose from. For example, Blake Lively (barely shorter), pixieish Ellen Page, Hilary Duff (Oooo, she can even resemble a tough girl), Kay or DaniellePanabaker (or maybe both of them, they're small), Hayden Panettiere, Mia Wasikowska (shorter than whazziz name), Aly Michalka (barely shorter), Emma Roberts (who is charmingly shorter than that Witwicky guy), Amanda Michalka (also shorter) and, my personal favorite nominee, Emma Stone (also shorter). See how easy it is? In conclusion, I will posit that the theater was uncommonly packed, the most I'd ever seen on a weekday performance, and the audience uniformly seemed to like the film a lot. So, I guess that means that they will make a lot of money which, in turn, will likely generate yet another sequel.",6,0,2,1 July 2011
