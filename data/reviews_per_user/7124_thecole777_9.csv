Casablanca," Little bit of everything.
","I can see why everyone makes such a big deal about this movie because it has a little bit of everything and it has the predictable happy ending. The acting wasn't bad but I found it to be average of the time. The story wasn't bad either but was more extravagant than realistic. I'm bias against movies that take place in a foreign country though; for some reason I don't like them. Maybe I just don't understand different countries and different governments so I can't follow what goes on when I watch it in movies. But either way, I found it hard to relate to and just didn't enjoy watching it that much. I don't see it as one of the greatest movies of all time.",5,2,6,15 December 2011
Citizen Kane," Good.
","First off, it was spoiled to me what 'rosebud' was and meant so that part of the movie got ruined for me but I still appreciated it. I thought Orson Welles was a really good actor in it and I like how he produced and directed it as well, making it as much like his vision as he could. I liked how it showed the whole life span of his character's life. I'm not sure if the whole thing after his death was necessary, though. I think it would've been just as good if they had left that part out and only made a biographical movie. I also liked the ending for what it was. Overall I liked it and thought it was good. I wish more directors could do what he did.",7,0,3,16 December 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," No comment.
","This movie wasn't bad. The best part were the robberies because that's what kept it interesting. The dynamic between characters wasn't bad either. This was my first Paul Newman movie and he was pretty good in it. It reminded be a lot of Bonnie and Clyde which was only two years earlier. Maybe it sparked a bunch of robbery movies just like it like this one. The ending was similar too in a way, even. But one thing that was different was the setting, which I liked just as much. I like the atmosphere of it in this movie and it kind of made it interesting to watch. This was my first Robert Redford movie too and I enjoyed his performance just as much.",7,0,0,16 December 2011
Taxi Driver," Go Robert De Niro.
","I really enjoyed this movie. This was the youngest role I had ever seen Robert De Niro in and I had no idea he was ever this young, hehe. He did great in it and it was a convincing role. His mohawk haircut made him more convincing too. I really liked the atmosphere of the movie too. It was a good, grimy Manhattan. This was a great watch and I'll probably be watching it again. I might even buy it. The ending was good too and didn't go over the top like I was afraid it would and like so many movies do nowadays. Some of the shots were cool too so I think Michael Chapman and Martin Scorsese did a good job with it. Like I said, overall good movie.",8,0,0,16 December 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Hard to watch.
","I did not enjoy this movie. Like I said, it was hard for me to watch. Stuff happened in it but it just seemed so boring. And I don't know if the version I watched was remastered or not but the shadows and picture kept shaking. I recognized the main character's 'I'll be there' speech from some place, and a lot of it reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine except much darker and stuff. The ending was OK but unsatisfying. I was hoping for more to make watching it worth it but I was disappointed. I wasn't that interested in the whole context of them movie anyway so I didn't like it to begin with. I know it was more appropriate for that time period but I'm in a different one so I find it hard to like it.",4,1,5,15 December 2011
The Exorcist," Cool.
","I'm a big fan of horror and had waited too long to see this movie. I really liked it and can't wait to watch the rest even though they probably won't measure up because most sequels are terrible compared to the original. The effects were really good and for some reason they looked more real than they do nowadays. Probably because nowadays it's all CGI and obviously fake. And I didn't expect half the things I saw; I didn't expect it to be as gruesome as it was. A lot of the scenes were much more disturbing than I expected too. The demon voice was sick, too. Overall, a great movie and if you're a horror fan you should see it right away.",9,0,1,16 December 2011
The Graduate," Nice.
","I liked Dustin Hoffman's performance a lot and hadn't seen him in anything else besides Rain Man so it was cool to see him in a different role. It was funny to see his character's nerves all the time and he portrayed them well. I thought his character was very relatable in how he handles the predicament he gets himself into. I didn't like how we never got a straight answer as to why the mother didn't want him to date her daughter, though. I'm glad he told her himself that he was sleeping with her mom. I don't understand though how she can just forget about him raping her mom and marry him. Because even though he didn't raper her, he never gets the chance to explain what really happened so the whole time she thinks he raped her? The ending was very unbelievable.",8,1,1,6 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Silly.
",This movie was too silly for me. Especially how they were dancing in the beginning with the rain coats. But I should expect stuff like that for watching a musical. But it was still a silly musical. Some parts were funny and the story was good and different from what I expected; I had no idea what the movie was actually about besides having a scene where some guy sings in the rain. I like how they referenced the Jazz Singer. I didn't like the main guy's singing and how he was super tan. I didn't realize so many songs I had heard had came from this movie so that was a surprise. Maybe this movie deserves more credit than I'm giving it. The choreography for all the dances was good though.,5,3,8,6 December 2011
Psycho," What I expected.
",I've always wanted to see this film because I'm a fan of the horror genre so I was happy to finally watch it. It was just as I had expected in that it was great. The music really made the movie and was really well done. It made the scenes more frightening and more intense. I can see why this is a classic. I loved every scene with Norman dressed up as his mother because of the cinematography and music and how scary it was. But I don't know if I agree with Norman living at the end. I don't see the harm in it and I wouldn't have minded seeing him perish at the end either. The character of Norman was well done by Anthony Perkins. He brought a richness to the character.,8,0,0,16 December 2011
