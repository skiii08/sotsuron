Vertigo," James Stewart
","Brilliant, captivating movie. I had to see it in the theater to appreciate how truly haunting Vertigo is.By the way, anyone who says James Stewart is wrong for the role of Scotty or that it's a change of character for him, should not be judging him by his Frank Capra movies alone, he made just three of them. His range of emotion and his ability to convey so much through facial expression (so important in Vertigo and Rear Window) are really evident in his Anthony Mann westerns. He was perfect for this movie.",10,4,4,17 August 1999
