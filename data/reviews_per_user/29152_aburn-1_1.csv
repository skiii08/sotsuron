Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," HILARIOUS movie....for the right audience
","Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius. He presents a new form of comedy hardly seen by anyone in the western hemisphere. This movie is, in a sense, improv comedy filmed on location where only Borat knows what is going on. Borat, played by Cohen, is a fictional character from the country of Kazakhstan who makes fun of and makes up everything about the country and its culture. The whole movie is one giant skit.In a way, this is similar to all those Bloopers shows where the camera crew plays a gag on unsuspecting victims. The difference here is that this movie plays out along a plot, takes the gags about 10 notches up in some scenes, and the unsuspecting victims are never let in on the gag. Cohen's ability to improvise and adapt his performance to each situation is part of what makes this movie so darn hilarious.Target age for this audience should be around 15-40, and mostly male. Beware that this movie contains vast amounts of crude humor and makes many jokes that would ordinarily be considered offensive. So if you are easily offended by jokes made in comedies, please steer away. Otherwise, viewers of such comedy shows as SNL, MadTV, Family Guy, Simpsons, Adult Swim, etc. this movie is for you!! (though it's a 99% chance these viewers have already seen this movie)",8,2,4,20 October 2007
