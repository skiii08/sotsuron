Scarface," Pacino's Best
","Though violent, vulgar and a bit over the top, 'Scarface' shows us Al Pacino's best peformance.  The story centers around a Cuban immigrant who comes from nothing to rise to the top of the drug world.  The road to top is paved with treachery and corpses.  Definitely not for the kiddies or the squeamish, Scarface gives us a dark, if not exaggerated look into the cocaine world.  The ever stylish Michelle Pfeiffer teams up with Pacino as his lady, but who finally sees the writing on the wall.  Good for her.  If you don't mind some heavy duty language and bloodletting, Scarface is a real find.",9,0,1,9 September 2003
Ben-Hur," A Cinematic Beauty
","There's a reason Ben-Hur captured more academy awards than any other film (until Titanic).  A close to perfect production which exceeds expectations for a film of religious nature.  The only way to watch Ben-Hur is via the widescreen DVD - presented in 2:7.1 scope - most probably the widest movie filmed.   The only reason I didn't give it a '10' is because of Charlton Heston.  A much overrated actor who overacts at every opportunity and becomes quite tiresome.  Fortunately, there was so much more in Ben-Hur, that his overacting goes unnoticed.   The chariot race is still THE most exciting sequence I've ever seen in a film.  Get over the religious issue and give Ben-Hur its due.",9,4,6,9 September 2003
Donnie Darko," Not Like Anything Else...
","Donnie Darko is one of those films where you don't really know what to expect, but after the first viewing, you are hooked.  Very original, well acted and photographed.  A look at life from within a troubled teen; you are transported between real and unreal; fact and fantasy.  An outstanding achievement on all levels.  A sadly underrated film in my opinion.  I recently saw it and am ready for another viewing already.  Check it out - you'll probably buy it as a keeper.",8,0,0,10 September 2003
