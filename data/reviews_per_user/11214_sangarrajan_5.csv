Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Part 1 Was Better
","If Part 1 Is For Action Movie Lovers ! This Is For Drama Lovers ! Acting Of Uma Thurman Is GOOD ! The Character Bill Shows Evil At Its Peak ! His Dead Was A Bit Dissapointing ! Not Only Him , Everyone Who Died In This Film ! Scenes Of Pai Mei Is Really Good ! I Expected More Blood But It Was Less ! The Bride's Daughter Is One Of My Favourite Twist In The Screenplay ! Everyone's Acting Was Good There ! An Average Tarrantino Film",6,2,2,18 October 2019
American Psycho," Not My Kind Of Film
",I Personally Didn't Like This Films Because Maybe I Don't Understand The Film Or Didn't Read The Book ! Many Scenes Was Not That Important ! Only The Climax Scene Attracted Me ! Christian Bale And His Versatility Is A Non Human Thing For Sure ! They Should Show The Deaths More Than Bateman When He Kills ! Although I Didn't Like The Screenplay But The Story Was Good,4,0,3,10 October 2019

Her," A Feel Good Film With Technology
","Her Is A Movie We Can Watch Again And Again Even If We're Depressed. This Film Shows The Future Generation For A New Living Lifestyle Although We Will Be Alone!
