Resident Evil: Afterlife," I game for another resident evil movie
","I actually went to see this movie alone bc no one wanted to go with me to see it. This movie was pretty decent, except for the plot holes...I definitely liked this movie compared to the 2nd and 3rd ones. I can tell a difference between some other director directing and Paul Anderson...Paul is the man when it comes down to directing low budget movies. If you want straight on straight action, this movie is for you. But if you want a plot and haven't seen the other movies, then you might as well skip out on this one. I loved how this movie incorporated some RE5 monsters like Wesker and the hammer guy. This movie was definitely made for 3D so make sure you go see it in that...well worth the extra 3 dollars (just skip out on the popcorn, it will save you calories and money from having to buy a drink with it)...(I did want the movie to be longer though...it seemed short bc of all the action going on)",9,4,14,11 September 2010
