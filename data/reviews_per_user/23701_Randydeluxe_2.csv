Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Crisply written, fast paced, excellent!
","What do you expect from a bunch of people who build something up in their minds so much that they're willing to camp out in silly costumes for days, just to be among the first to see it?  Of course they don't like it.  It couldn't even come close to surpassing their expectations.  They cheered when it started and the 'STAR WARS' title hit the screen with full brass. They were too excited and want too much.Nonetheless, this is a great film.  It is highly entertaining, and a very nice example of how the best writers and directors and musicians and actors and supporters in the world can turn a large budget into a large film. It's huge.  The story is much bigger than most films, a delight for those viewers who like to unravel complex story lines.  The effects are magnificent, and as of this writing 3 years after the movie was made, I have still yet to see any film that approaches this one's visual effects (there are almost zero special effects, but that just underlines how good the visual effects must be).  It was *very* well cast... I enjoyed Ewan McGregor's take on his role as young Obi-Wan Kenobi especially.A must see.",10,29,46,27 November 2001
The Matrix," Deserves the high marks
","This is one of the greatest movies of all time, and not due to the fact that it's got a really wide range of appeal, because it doesn't.  People who live for the next little dud that only shows in two cities in the U.S. and will never be seen by more than a hundred pompous people should stay away.The Matrix is great due to the fact that among action films, it is so much better than anything else in the genre.  Perfect!",10,0,1,27 November 2001
