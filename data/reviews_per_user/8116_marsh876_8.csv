Skyfall," Skyfall Sucked
","I wish there was a 0 rating. Confusing, meaningless plot. Are all Brits terse and sarcastic all the time? Judy Dench is always good, but she can't save this shipwreck. Good thing I saw it on Amazon Prime. I'd have walked out of the theater after paying $10. The coloring is inconsistent, making it irritating. There is no wit and charm. Just drivel dialogue until the next shoot out. Save your viewing time and watch an old Lassie. You'll get something out of that, at least. I did like the use of the old Astin Martin. And they played some of the old Bond music themes. Be thankful for small mercies! Too many scenes where there is no movement on the screen and silence.",1,5,10,16 February 2015
The Hunger Games," Dreck
","Does everybody know what the Yiddish work 'dreck' means? Maybe it's spelled 'drek'. We see it here often in these reviews. It's the stuff that comes out of the south end of a horse going north. It's stuff that's most often flushed away. This movie is dreck. It should be flushed away. Yet another case of a director taking a great work by a great author and thinking s(he) is even greater, so the work has to be distorted somehow, so the director's ego's stamp is on it, so everyone will say 'this director is a genius in his own right. (NOT). I guess it's tough to be a mediocre director faced with putting on a work of greatness. Where is the director's input? Sorta like opera, where they intentionally sing out of tune and harshly, and those egoists call that art. Opera has been around for hundreds of years, yet this horrible rendering of it is only 50 years or so old. Movies have been around less time, but they're already mucking it up so they can say, 'look at me, I can f*ck it up, and I did, so go blow', like children in a playground. It's really amazing how many shills the producer got to vote high ratings and give good reviews. Actually, I have to commend the producer and director for the con they perpetrated. Obviously, they put in the least amount of cost and work, and they got mega-millions back for their paltry effort. The bottom line, thats the reality of our world. I'm sure one could write a high school English essay about the role of 'bottom line' in the 'Hunger Games' book. That might have more value then this movie dreck. Remember what that means?",1,23,35,31 March 2012
Hot Fuzz," A total piece of crap!
","Everyone compares this total piece of crap to Shawn of the Dead. Who cares? A movie should stand on it's own. I didn't see Shawn, and won't. Fuzz is boring, long, stupid, not funny. There is no character development. Just an excuse for car chases, explosions and shoot outs. The fast editing and sound effects were distracting and more for the ego of the director than the viewing pleasure of the audience. How bad was it? A recurring theme is the main character's house plant! The film is full of stupid, gratuitous violence. I agree with people who say that the rating is fixed. Are the British so desperate for foreign exchange that they all got together to praise and highly rate this film, so the rest of the suckers around the world would buy or rent it?",1,33,104,9 August 2007
"I, Robot"," OK if you're stoned
","This movie is not bad to watch if you are stoned while you're watching it. Maybe it could be shown at a party where everybody is feeling pretty good, and they are mostly ignoring it, it's playing in the background. There is one meaningless flashy scene after another, lots of eye candy. I saw it while messing around on the computer, and it provided a nice background. When I focused attention on the movie, it didn't make any sense. The CGI seemed poor quality. Fuzzy and cartoony. I'm not gay, so skin shots of Will Smith and his butt and pecs didn't do it for me. I did like his leather outfit, though, just the right amount of wear. I guess the silliest thing about this movie is that, at times, it seems to be taking itself seriously. Other reviewers saw lots of other movies in this one. I saw Columbo. Nobody believes the cop until the end, when he's proved right. Actually, the movie was kinda boring. They used the same special effects over and over. That's why I say it's best if your mind if fried or it's just background. Maybe it would have been better on the big screen, where all the guy flick stuff (shoot outs, explosions, homo-erotic scenes, sexless women, car chases, extended hand to hand, adolescent attitude ends in success, etc, etc, etc) could have been better appreciated. Oh, well. Will Smith probably made a load of money on this. Does anything else matter?",2,1,1,20 August 2007
No Country for Old Men," Self-indulgent Garbage.
","This movie is pretty much self-indulgent garbage. The story is very contrived and silly. Why would the guy who found the money go back to the scene of the crime, knowing that all hell would be breaking loose by the bad guys and cops? Yet this folly is the crux of the plot, because his return enables the bad guy to get on the chase. The bad guy, Chigurh, is a bad remake of many nut-killers of the past. Indestructible no matter what, with a stupid grin on his face all the time, and omniscient in knowing all, seeing all. A cartoon villain. A lot of Llewelyn's decisions and actions can be seen as stupid, but these were necessary to keep it going. So, in the end, who cares? They say there are 5 basic movie plots, and this one, the chase, is very common. So common, in fact, that NCFOM turns out empty and shallow. I guess the makers feel that, since this is an art film, they can just throw anything on the screen, and we're supposed to appreciate it like it was a piece of modern art hanging on a wall. That's OK, but who stares at a piece of meaningless shapes and colors for the time this movie ran? What are the Coens going to do next time? A five hour flick shot at a slaughterhouse, with lots of close ups and details?",1,12,24,14 March 2008
Love & Mercy," Long & Boring
","I really wanted to like this movie because I love Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. Their music is fantastic and will live forever. Unfortunately, I didn't like this movie and I recommend that people not see it.I will admit that the acting was good, in all parts. The cinematography and costumes were very good, also. It's the story, direction and editing that, in my opinion, are terrible. The constant back and forth in time is hard to follow. It's hard to tell the time line of events. Wilson's mental illness is depicted with long, slow, boring, no action scenes, with discordant sound effects in the background.And it's hard to believe they would try and sell a biopic about a musician and play virtually none of his music. What's the matter? The Beach Boys music wasn't good enough for Pohlad's artistic sentiments? Pohlad's background noise is the 'real' music? So this movie is just an ego trip of Pohlad, shamed by the great achievement of Wilson compared to his own, and putting up any garbage as better? Pleeeeze!And the 2001 homage at the end? Wasn't this movie too long already. We had to sit through that stupidity?In conclusion, this movie sucked. Go see Mickey Mouse cartoons instead. Will do more for you.",1,6,11,14 August 2016
War of the Worlds," Terrible movie
","The special effects were few and repetitive. It was the same alien spider machines over and over. We did get to see the alien critters for a few seconds, but it was too little. There were too many close ups. Seeing a close up of a peanut butter sandwich, for instance, doesn't do much for me. There were too many dark, murky scenes. Maybe this is supposed to have something to do with fear. I though it had to do with minimal sets. In short, it was the least movie playing for the most money. Too much of the time Cruise and his kids were screaming at each other, or just screaming. It's as though the kids were completely unawares of the situation, and could only scream or fight Cruise at every turn. That doesn't say much for kids. To me, this movie had no socially redeeming value. Is it then pornography? *********SPOILERS**************** The inclusion of the potential pedophile and his murder by Cruise was gratuitous and unnecessary.",1,6,11,30 July 2005
Munich," too bad
","too long, too boring, too gory, too slow, too little character development, too self serving, too ugly sex, too stupid dialog, too many locations unknown to the audience, too much fiction posing as history, too false as to Intifada vs 9/11 terrorists, too little of the reason for the Olympic assassinations, too bad Spielberg is washed up.I thought the remake of 'War of the Worlds' was bad, but this took the cake. Why fill in the details of a historical event with a lot of dumb fiction? Just because someone has made tons of money catering to the elementary school mentality, they think they know something about philosophy, religion, morals, ethics, etc. They just show themselves to not have grown any more depth than the puppet shark in 'Jaws.'",1,25,40,12 January 2006
