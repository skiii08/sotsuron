The Ring," Great Idea, B Movie Execution
","Figures that this is a remake of a movie with a great premise. Unfortunately it is butchered into a B-movie execution. The acting is weak, the editing is weaker, and the plot holes, some ridiculous dialogue and unrealistic events keep it well within B-movie status. It is entertaining but you'll be left unsatisfied at the end of the movie, feeling like too much was left out and that the whole script and movie was a sloppy effort.The premise in this movie is enough to radiate fear. But from there everything goes downhill although there are one or two nicely done scares. But this is a not great movie, nor even a very good one. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining but it is instantly forgettable. The audience had a few shriekers and a lot of laughers because of some silliness in the film. I'm looking forward to seeing the Japanese version.The biggest crime in the creation of this movie is the total lack of depth to the script or reasons behind what goes on. Things happen just 'because.' It's so silly that at the end you say 'well why did that happen? Most good horror movies give you the reasons and answers but this one leaves you with questions, namely, how in the world did this movie get made with such open holes? I can answer the high ratings here -- major ballot box stuffing must have gone on at the IMDB. This movie is nothing more than a 6 at best. Great idea. Truly. Poor execution. See the Japanese version first...",4,0,0,26 October 2002
Se7en," Suspense, Great Acting, Intriguing Story
","If you are disturbed by dark films then this film isn't for you (apparently the previous reviewer needs Hollywood candy.) But if you like your suspense gripping, cold, with great character development, then this is a film you won't forget for both the story and its all around excellence.While not as easily palatable as 'The Usual Suspects', 'Seven' is a film about a psychotic man trying to make a point about the downward spiral of our world. He's Hannibal Lector but with a purpose for killing besides mere glee. The production is astonishing, sound is fantastic (you wouldn't believe it would be in a 'cop' film), the acting is first notch, and most of all, it made me really appreciate character development. The film delves into what basically makes two men tick and how they view the same world with completely different perspectives. Is either right?Great care was take to make sure that the dialogue flowed as well as the pacing of the film, which picks up just as soon as you think there is a lag. Incredibly, the film is nowhere near as gruesome on screen as most other gruesome flicks ('Gladiator' comes to mind) and it is mostly the disturbing thought that there are people like this and perhaps the world isn't a rosy place with a few freaks... or perhaps it is. The film gets better with repeated viewings and I think that this is one film where Morgan Freeman just shines as an actor. Brad Pitt actually is remarkably good as a typical American who seems to have been educated through pop culture and is quick to the hip rather than to the brain as is Somerset, Freeman's character.If you can enjoy a movie like 'Silence of the Lambs' then this flick will take you for a ride. If you are simply disturbed by disturbing things in this world then you might not give this movie a chance. The DVD is remarkable and perhaps the most worthwhile DVD you can get with all the interesting commentary tracks. The previous reviewer probably also thought that 'Fight Club' -- another Fincher film -- was just a social commentary applauding violence. Like that film.... there is so much to see and appreciate in this very dark film.... Fantastic, intriguing, and replayable...",10,0,0,22 October 2002
Oblivion," Totally oblivious to the audience
","Did you see great visuals on TV? That's why this film gets the 3 stars I'm giving it. When it comes to story line, you've seen this before 1,000 times but much smarter in other films. I had no idea that this was based on a graphic novel, more like a bad comic book. By the end, it was clear that this film was made for idiots who can check their brain in at the entrance and worship the man name Cruise who was on Cruise Control.For some reason I allowed myself to pay to watch Cruise try to play 6 foot 6 inch Jack Reacher a few months ago. Bad idea. Gave him one last chance and came in with an open mind. The opening scene is a little murky. You're not quite sure what to make of it. Great visuals, the explanation given by Cruise is hokey, something is off but you just go with it. In short, he and his female companion are supposedly the last remaining people on earth with a job to do before they are ready to join the rest of the others in 2 weeks on Saturn. They are a clean up crew, maintaining drones that kill the alien 'scavengers' on the planet and extracting water/minerals.Gratuitous CGI, which is done pretty effectively, leads us to the first immediate problem. When Cruise pulls out a New York Yankee hat while reminiscing about a football game, you can't help but think 'perhaps the worst and conspicuous choice of product placement I've ever seen.' From that point on, while you want to figure out some of the mystery, you're loath to admit that this script has silly holes in it the size of Saturn.Now I've seen worse but the middle and ending are very disappointing because the twists are not only predictable but so many remind you of other films. And they are also very awkwardly managed. With each twist you keep begging the film to come up with a better answer for these oddities. And as the film plods along, they are unsatisfactory.This is a good free on cable movie, not worth spending money in the theater. As a rental, be prepared for disappointment. It's Cruise doing Cruise, marching on without brains to pick up a big check.",3,11,20,21 April 2013
Jack Reacher," Horrendous Cruise Ego Fest
","Awkward Tom Cruise egofest. Has a decent opening up until Cruise appears. he's cooler than cool. He's tougher than tough. And he always walks out of the room so that everyone can run after the cool, angry tough guy and beg him to come back. This is the visualization of very bad pulp fiction. Clich√©s gone amock. The cops and DA are brain dead. The obvious issue that a trained killer wouldn't do something as silly is simply missed by everyone but the brilliant Reacher. After a brief introduction, tough guy names are used. 'Hey Army! You didn't take any notes.' This is really the stuff of bad television.Add in women throwing themselves at Cruise everywhere. So Cruise obviously has to insult everyone to show what a god he is when fighting. Wow... he is just the coolest, strongest superman. Let us bow to this demigod.It's a very tough film to watch. Awkward and stilted dialogue that destroys whatever murder mystery this film is supposed to be. It's like a terrible 70s detective film and you wonder whether it's mean't to be so bad that it's amusing. The problem is that it's meant to be taken seriously. The worst part about this film is that Cruise is obviously so miscast that its painful from the outset. Don't be deceived by the ratings. It is ridiculously high.",1,239,467,17 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The Kiddies Stuff the Ballot Boxes
","Inferior to the first film in many respects except for action. Unfortunately there is very little character development and the film focuses itself on a tortured, twisted plot. Puberty has not been kind to the actors, especially Harry, who now speaks in a very deep voice. No question that the character development is the enjoyable element of the first movie that is so sorely lacking here. Yes, great CGI but nothing beyond it. The huge number that rated this a perfect 10 here are either kiddies or ballot stuffers. You will be disappointed. The movie is entertaining but drags on for over 2 and a half hours. Harry wonders why Hagrid mentions to go somewhere and then after they do, you'll begin to wonder the same. Bad pacing, bad flow.Worth seeing? Perhaps as there is a lot of shlock playing now. But don't expect a great film -- this isn't one. While it no longer is an 'intro' to the Harry Potter series, this one suffers from the focus on CGI rather than good moviemaking. Good video rental and a film if there isn't anything else playing, but not a must see.",2,3,6,17 November 2002
