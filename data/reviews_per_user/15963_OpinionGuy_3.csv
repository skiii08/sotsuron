Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," 2+hours haul of Disney goodness..
","this is the fourth movie in the series, and the fifth are rumored it is on the way, do we see a sixth??... anyway this epic tale just drags on as usually. seems like they just made up the movie, as they went along. filling in the plot with silly theatrics and side-tracking subplots(that we love of course!) so it ridiculous dragged out to 2+hours. but at least i didn't fell a sleep half way through, like i did on the two other movies before this one... must have been because of penelope, the sexiest woman to roam the TV screen. so is it worth watching 'yes'... because of sexy penelope and keith richards as the coolest pirate ever(again!). but first bottle up with coke and popcorn, trust me you will need it.... if it rains outside it will be good to, and if you have one of those living room chair that have a toilet included, it will be a big plus. after all your in for a 2+hours haul of Disney goodness, you definitely don't want to miss a second of it..",7,0,1,21 August 2011
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Worst Spidey to Date
","I have seen all the Spiderman movies up to date, and let me tell you, this one was the worst of them all. Disney's marvel send us straight back to those bad cringeworthy kids 90's TV shows. That was full of cheese and unfunny forced jokes with a very thin story line. The only positive thing about the new Spiderman movie is Michael Keaton and Tom Holland. they do a good job in this mess of a movie. But that dont save the movie when over 60 years of what made Spiderman great, gets tossed out. Everything can be summed up in one word: incompetence. If you are a fan of Spiderman do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.",1,80,135,30 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Space Balls had more respect for Star Wars than Disney
","This new Star Wars trilogy is a tragedy, and the plot makes no sense in TROS, it just wasn't built up at all from the previous movies and is completely disconnected. And this new trilogy (specially TLJ and TROS) totally nullify everything story wise before it. To put it short Space Balls had more respect for Star Wars than Disney, and JJ makes Michael Bay look like Steven Spielberg. So as a long time Star Wars fan i will just pretend the new trilogy never existed and stick with the first 1-6 movies and Rouge One.",1,799,1259,22 December 2019
