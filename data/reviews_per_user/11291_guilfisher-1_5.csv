Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," among the losers
","I guess I'm the only one who disliked this movie. I found it boring in the beginning and while in US of A a mess. I thought Sacha whatever his name is, was terrible. Not even funny. I did like the scene of manners when he was a guest in the home of those wealthy upper class people. The gay stuff was also funny. The Jewish theme sucked. When he was sitting by the fire and took out his pet chicken about to kill it, I turned the movie off and never saw the ending. Killing a chicken for the movies is not my idea of entertainment. His nude scenes were interesting as the fat guy was totally naked and yet Borat had censorship on his penis. What was that all about? Or was that just Netflix? Sorry Borat fans, it didn't impress me one bit.",Null,2,5,3 April 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Dirty rotten shame
","Having just witnessed this year's Academy Awards, I almost threw up over the choice of CRASH over BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as Best Picture of the year. It shows that money in big studios make winners for Oscar. What didn't make sense is giving the Best Director to Ang Lee for his masterful and courageous undertaking of bringing this story to the screen. But, of course, it was a small budget film. The big films have to get their money back.CRASH is a sordid, manipulating film with just about the ugliest characters ever put into one film. So, what's their message? Be an evil bigoted person, kill those who disagree and continue to take this country further into the abyss of hatred. I hated CRASH and everything it stood for. I couldn't watch too much of it.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN brought back belief in oneself. It brought into the main stream public a love story. Not just about two guys, but about the right to love who you choose. Not murder who you choose as CRASH demonstrates. Unfortunately, Hollywood has gone back into the closet if we're to judge the academy voters. My hat's off to Lee and his amazing and trusting cast, cameraman, sound engineer, costumers, music composers and screenwriters. They have stepped up to bat with this movie, even though obviously by the voters choice the rest of Tinseltown remains in the closet.I won't relate the story. Go see this film. Don't wait for the DVD. See it on the big screen. It's well worth the time and effort. Support these film makers who dare to take chances and tell their stories with out violence and hatred. So be it. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were terrific together. Believable in their roles and you could see their trust in each other as actors to be able to play the intimate scenes. Bravo!Here's a bit of nonsense. Randy Quaid, who appears in less than 10 minutes of this movie as the stupid jock boss man, is now suing the producers for 10 million for his appearance. That's 1 million a minute, folks.Is anybody worth that? Please. With theaters suffering and actors begging for work, this sort of thing not only cheapens the business we're in but shows the greedy little so and sos that are taking all the money to the bank. It's out of balance, this movie business. And to me there's no one, no one, worth the price they are paid to schlep through any film. Mr. Quaid should kiss the ground he's working at all. And if a producer makes some money, that money will go into another film and more work for more actors. Move over Quaid, you ain't the only one in this business. I root for the producers and Mr. Lee for the vision and the guts to bring this to the screen. Not one measly actor who's out for himself. Who cares!",10,38,47,5 March 2006
Crash," Undeserving of Best Picture Oscar
","This is a terrible film. For shock value, it didn't work. For any racial message, it's been done before and in a better way. For plot, it was confusing and often lengthy and boring. I cannot believe that this film was voted over BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which was so much more of a statement. And that Hoffman was Best Actor over Heath Ledger's underplayed beautiful performance. Makes you doubt the Academy thinking process and you wonder if the entire awards thing is a put up job.Back to this sordid and much too long film. Paul Haggis is at the helm with writing, producing and directing this piece. I read all the other comments and it's scary to think they love this film. It's also great to see there are others that weren't bulldozed with it like myself. You can put all the talent you have into a film and that doesn't make it a hit. Sandra Bullock going around being angry, Don Cheadle (an actor I don't get) walking around with one look on his face 'Duh', Matt Dillon maybe the best performance of the lot, Terrence Howard another overrated actor, Ryan Phillippe, not too bad in this as the rookie cop, Thandie Newton, who was excellent (scene with her and Dillon best in film) and Shaun Toub going around being miserable. There are others I won't go into. Believe me, they were not that imposing in their performances.I shall always remember this picture not for it's value as a film but as the film that beat out BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and shouldn't have. But, you know, history will tell. Like CITIZEN KANE, which was thumbed down all those years ago, now remains one of the finest. Who remembers HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY? The same will happen with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. CRASH will disappear and the Academy Awards will go down as a big fiasco.",3,6,12,4 April 2006
The Dark Knight," Tribute to Heath Ledger
","I have anticipated this film for sometime now as a Ledger fan since I found him with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, a role he certainly deserved the Oscar for. Not the sad imitation of Truman Capote by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I still doubt the Academy's choices for awards and think the size of the studio has a lot to do with the number of votes, etc. So, although Heath earned, to me, another Oscar for THE DARK KNIGHT, the studio system will probably give it to the likes of Robert Downey Jor for playing a black man. Ledger's Joker was original, dark, twisted with that evil sense of humor that makes it a distinguished performance. I couldn't take my eyes off him. In every scene he held the reins in his hands. You could see the tension between he and Christian Bale, also a terrific actor, and the joy they had in working together. I should also like to thank director, Christopher Nolan, for his inspired casting. Unlike BATMAN BEGINS, which I thoroughly enjoyed and turned me on to the Batman series, this one had depth and incredible genius connected with it. Now you take these two powerhouse actors, Heath and Bale, and you spice them up with some of the most distinguished supporting actors you can dream up. With the likes of Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart, veteran Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, (terrific), Morgan Freeman, Anthony Michal Hall (far from those teeny boppers), Eric Roberts, Nestor Cabonell, from Brooke Shields TV sitcom, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, so much better than one level acting of Kate Holmes. When you look at Heath's work of the past, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, the gay man caught up in the guilt of his feelings, KNIGHT'S TALE, beautifully played as a simple man with dreams of glory, MONSTERS BALL, as the young rookie idealistic cop, TWO HANDS, a young man who attempts to find a better life yet falls into bad hands, CANDY, a disturbing look at the world of drugs and a guy who is fighting to survive, NED KELLY, a young rebel who is only fighting for his existence and defending his home against a corrupt militia, THE ORDER, a modern day priest who must find truth in a dark world of terror in the clergy, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, a gem of a sweet movie about love and giving Heath a chance to sing and dance which he loves. When you look at all this work in the short number of years he has been on earth, you think how much more we have missed by his early death. I can only imagine what heights he could have gone to. For he certainly was on his way. Life sometimes is cruel and unthinkable at times. I only hope they will honor this young actor this year with the Oscar he certainly deserves and for those roles we all will never see him play. Heath Ledger, you are a star in Heaven now.",10,3,8,24 December 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Liked him, hated her!
","This film had some terrific fight scenes which I felt were the highlights of what was offered. So, okay, let's get it out in the open. We all know the scandal and press overdone gossip about the two leads. Sort of reminded me of the Eddie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor breakup. However, Jolie is no Taylor, believe me. Her looks elude me. Don't quite see it. For certainly Pitt is the looker in this. And I don't like her treatment of her Dad, Jon Voight, who IS a good actor and DOES have a body of work to be proud of. What has Angelina Jolie done on film that is that groundbreaking? I don't find her that pretty. Her lips are compared to a blow fish. Although she does have that evil look to her that makes you want to hiss at her. Brad is a strapping young man and a not bad actor. Some of his work deserves good credits. Namely, THELMA AND LOUISE, VAMPRIES, JOE BLACK and LEGENDS OF THE FALL. In this he plays the part well. You know, I don't see the electricity between he and Jolie at all. In fact their love scenes, and thank heavens there weren't that many, were flat. The women that Jolie had surrounding her, were like a troupe of lesbian agents. I just laughed at that. Anyway, I didn't like this film too much. Brad is good to look at and Angelina should stay in Africa.",4,0,1,26 January 2007
