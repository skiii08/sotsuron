Come and See," War and It's truths
","Come and See is a film that shows a side of how civilians feel during war. The arc of the film would be that young Florya was clueless, joyful, and excited at the beginning but by the end of the movie he knows what war really is about but still chooses to be part of it, and goes willingly with the other soldiers. This film had many close ups but rather than feeling that the characters are looking at us, it feels like they are looking through us. War is very brutal, and that is seen in the movie, there were times when I had to turn away. A very strong film it causes one to rethink about what war really is and its effects on Civilians.",Null,0,0,10 February 2012
