Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What Force, I Don't See Any Force In This Movie?!
","OK, OK, Lucas is happy because his movie has made something around 400 million dollars, so what, but this movie isn't good as I thought. Why? Because it wasn't fun like it was when I've watched Episode 4, Episode 5 and Episode 6. He had to made a character such is Han Solo, we don't want Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yes, and also Ewan McGregor is awful, even he is one of my favorite actors, he was very bad in this movie. Only who was great was Natalie Portman. So, I suggest to Lucas, when he is going to do Episode 2, to think about McGregor and Jake Lloyd, because they could destroy STAR WARS.",8,0,0,26 September 1999
Spider-Man," Excellent movie
","This movie is really something amazing. I really didn't expect something like this, but I was amazed. I thought that this is going to be boring, something like 'Batman & Robin', but I was in wrong. The visual effects are excellent, Tobey Maguire is great choice for the role of Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and Willem Dafoe... Ohhhhh, he is great, he is something wonderful. He is one of the greatest actors of our time, and that is the fact. About the movie, well, when I think a little bit, it is maybe childish, but who cares. Maybe director Raimi had to delete scenes with building in fire (when Spider-Man saves the little children from the building in fire) and perhaps, he had to find more 'interesting' answers on love story between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, but these are only little problems. End is very powerful (scene on the bridge when Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst and children) and the final ulitimate fight with Green Goblin in old house. In the end, I can only say: 'From MARVEL something MARVELous.'",9,0,1,3 May 2002
