Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The critics were right...this film disappoints
","Having been a Star Wars fan since I was six years old, I did not want to believe that Lucas would actually put a product out that would be so widely criticized.  But after seeing the movie, I have to agree with the critics. While the special effects truly are amazing and will set the standard for upcoming films, this particular film moves slowly and seems as though it is merely a vehicle for Lucas to demonstrate his innovative effects.One aspect that really drew me into the original and Empire was his ability to develop a storyline around main characters while using his creatures as more of a backdrop.  As most people agree, ROTJ suffered because of the addition of the Ewoks as main characters.  With Phantom, Lucas uses the Gungans in this same way.  While the Gungans are fine as a backdrop, I don't care to watch them in battle scenes or hear them speak in that awful language.Lucas would have done a better job, and been more received, had he developed the storyline more and spent less time on the effects.  I would have enjoyed the movie with special effects circa 1977 had the story moved quicker.  It pained me to sit there and fidget through the movie.  I can only imagine how non Star Wars fans will react.  Hopefully, Lucas will take some of the critics suggestions as he begins Episode II and III.  He is only getting $7.00 out of me for this film.  Although I had planned on seeing it four or five times, I can't bear to sit through it again.  This film will not break Titanic's record simply because  there will be very little repeat viewing.",10,0,1,24 May 1999
