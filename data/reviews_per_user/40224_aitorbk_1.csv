Blade Runner 2049," Amazing film from a technical perspective
","Would you like a sci-fi film with amazing photography and special effects? Great, you would like this movie.These are the good parts, and to be fair, the film looks amazing, and the tempo is ok (not great, but this is just my taste)I have rated it with 7/10 because the science part of it is terrible, and the script just makes no sense at all, it is full with holes and it greatly diminishes from what could have been an amazing movie, breaking the suspension of disbelief into 'wtf' moments.It is sad that so many newer movies are amazing from the technical point of view (filming itself, and also good in the acting department) and are just let down by the script.",7,0,3,27 October 2019
