Vertigo," Beautiful
","Once you've seen 'Vertigo' you can almost see the whole thing again in your head. Its haunting images stay with you. Whatever else you might say about 'Vertigo,' (and there are those who don't like it), it's unquestionably a visually beautiful film. It formed my impressions of San Francisco, and when I finally visited that city, it all seemed so familiar. In fact, many of the locations remain unchanged after more than fifty years - Mission Dolores, The Brocklebank Apartments, The Legion of Honor, The Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point. You can even stay in the same Sutter Street hotel where 'Judy' lived (The Empire Hotel is now the Hotel Vertigo). If I can find fault at all with this film, I point to James Stewart who, despite a great performance, looks too old for the part and his chemistry with Kim Novak is dubious (Much better in their other 1958 outing, 'Bell, Book and Candle'). When 'Vertigo' failed at the box office on its initial release, Hitchcock is said to have blamed it on Stewart, and I tend to believe it. After four films together, he never used him again. Nevertheless, 'Vertigo' entertains on many levels. I don't even mind the unexplained and illogical sequences (Madeleine waking up nude in Scottie's bed and neither one of them making an issue of it; her disappearance from The McKittrick Hotel). And I'm impressed by the downbeat and abrupt ending, which surely was unusual for a Hollywood film at that time. 'Vertigo' is in a class by itself.",10,9,11,10 December 2014
The Hangover," My Grandmother's Holocaust Ring
","I expect a moronic film like this to poke fun at easy targets, but I cringed when they tossed off a few casual references to the Holocaust. Aside from being unfunny, reducing the suffering of countless millions of people to a punch line amounts to cruelty. It's just unacceptable and has no place here. If these clueless idiots knew anything at all about history and how fortunate they are to live in a society that allows them the freedom to act so immature they might behave differently. But that's beside the point of this film, which is to entertain on the lowest level possible. I found it a rather sad experience on all counts.",1,6,13,7 March 2010
Chinatown," Let's talk about Dunaway
","By now it's only redundant to heap more praise on this film. The writing, acting, cinematography, direction, editing, etc. seamlessly come together as if predestined. And yes, I think Polanski's decision to go with a downbeat ending was the correct choice - that final scene is unforgettable. What I'd like to focus on is Faye Dunaway's remarkable contribution to the film. She reportedly did not get along with Polanski, in fact, was labeled 'difficult' on several of her movies. Yet she turned in an incomparable, complex performance. Starting with her look. Hitchcock placed great emphasis on each character's outward appearance, which told us just about all we needed to know. Here Dunaway takes a page from his book and immerses herself in the trappings of a wealthy woman of the 1930s. Compare the way she looked in 'Bonnie and Clyde,' also set in the 1930s. The eyes and hair are straight out of 1967. Keep in mind that she was 33 when she made 'Chinatown.' That's a knowing performance from someone so young. Her cool demeanor when we first meet her turns out to be misleading. She embodies the classic femme fatale until just toward the end, in her famous 'She's my sister. She's my daughter' scene, when we suddenly understand she's the only character with an ounce of integrity. There's been quite a lot going on beneath the surface. Next time you watch this film, pay close attention to Dunaway. You won't find a better female performance anywhere.",10,12,17,23 May 2017
Match Point," Luck Would Have It
","Woody Allen here provides a first-rate morality tale. This film belongs near the top of his filmography, alongside other serious outings as 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Cassandra's Dream.' Though the plot borrows heavily from George Stevens' 'A Place In The Sun,' the endings go in completely different directions. Allen sets the action against superb upper-class locations including the distinctive Gherkin building, adding to the film's visual appeal. Cast is outstanding, from the headliners down to the smallest bit parts. Pacing is deliberate and suspenseful. 'Match Point' is a thought-provoking experience you'll ponder long after it's over.",10,1,1,9 August 2019
Midnight in Paris," C'est Si Bon
","This movie gets better with each repeat viewing. Clever concept of romanticizing the past and finding happiness in the present. Owen Wilson is not prime leading man material, but he does an excellent job as the Woody Allen stand-in (You can picture Woody in the part fifty years ago). Even better is Rachel McAdams as the fiancee from Hell. She's simply hilarious constantly cutting down Gil (Wilson). Key to the success of all Woody Allen films is the casting, and here he nails every last one, including the amusing celebrity lookalikes. The young Picasso is particularly on target, as is Adrien Brody as Dali. The gag about Luis Bunuel's 'The Exterminating Angel' is a sublime 'in' joke. Great location photography of beautiful Paris. Still can't figure out how they filmed Versailles without the mobs of tourists who swarm the place daily. Definitely one of Woody Allen's best efforts.",9,1,2,21 May 2019
North by Northwest," A towering achievement.
","This is Hitchcock's best film  quite an accomplishment, considering how many great films he created. And after half a century, 'North By Northwest' holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains? And Eva Marie Saint's allure is multi-faceted. Movies just don't get better than this.",10,11,14,23 April 2008
Disturbia," 'Rear Window' for a new generation.
","As pointed out many times in other reviews, this is a teenage remake of 'Rear Window.' 'Juvenile' might indeed be an apt description for it. Hitchcock's masterpiece succeeds in implicating the audience in the dire consequences of voyeurism. It also leaves doubt about whether a murder occurred until the end. That complex psychology is missing from 'Disturbia,' replaced with teenage angst and slasher-movie violence. In a simplistic coda and a tip of the hat to the original, 'Disturbia' leaves us by resolving another neighbor's dilemma  in this case, reporting the children across the street for watching pornography. Sad, how society, movies and movie audiences have changed.",3,1,5,21 September 2008
To Rome With Love," Arrivederci Roma
","'To Rome With Love' fails, but not for lack of trying. It has its moments, but they're few and far between. Most of the running time is spent belaboring ideas that Allen has previously handled a lot better. And unlike many of Allen's films, there are several glaring examples of miscasting (Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenberg). On the plus side, viewers are treated to great location photography, a beautifully staged opera sequence, a ravishing Penelope Cruz ostensibly spewing fluent Italian, and a recurrent use of 'Amada mia, amore mio' on the soundtrack.",5,1,1,10 April 2020
Across the Universe," Aims High, Falls Short.
","This heartfelt homage to the music and turbulent era of The Beatles certainly doesn't lack ambition, but it probably wasn't such a great idea to begin with. Knitting together a cohesive narrative from a random song selection is overreaching, and it shows. Unfortunately, the creators got carried away with themselves and let this thing go on far too long. Would have been better as a string of lively musical numbers without any of the boring dialog, which failed to tie it all together anyway. And ditch those pseudo-soul-searching renditions of the ballads  The Beatles never let themselves become so maudlin. The cast is good, except for Evan Rachel Wood, who is one-dimensional. Enjoyed the Maurice Binder/James Bond-style closing credits best, but like the songs themselves, I would have preferred seeing the original James Bond title sequences instead.",6,1,2,6 May 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Bride Wore Black (and Blue)
","Take out all that endless sword fighting and what you have is a remake of Francois Truffaut's 1968 Hitchcock homage, 'The Bride Wore Black.' And just in case you didn't quite get it, Tarantino throws in composer Bernard Herrmann's whistling theme from his score for Roy Boulting's 1968 British thriller 'Twisted Nerve.' You have to hand it to Tarantino, he knows what he's after and how to get it. He simply steals from the best. To his credit, the direction is always smooth, inventive and sure-handed. Whether his films are good or bad, they always look great. No expense is spared and no detail is too small to fill the screen with eye-popping visuals. Now, if only he could refrain from all that blood and guts, he might make a good movie someday.",3,2,6,22 January 2016
The Graduate," Astonishing - on many levels.
","It's interesting how a film that was very much 'of its time' holds up so well more than forty years later without feeling dated. I think the 1960s got it right when it came to defining modern sensibilities. This film can be enjoyed on so many levels: for its razor sharp humor, its incisive social commentary, its innovative film techniques, its soundtrack, etc. When I first saw the film in its initial release, I naturally identified with the title character. Now when I watch it, I relate to the parents' generation. I understand how these people got that way. It adds another dimension to the appreciation of this fine film. The cast is perfect, from the unlikely choice of Dustin Hoffman as the protagonist, Anne Bancroft as the unsmiling predator (complete with animal-print wardrobe), Katherine Ross, the most appealing and desirable coed, down through the smallest roles. I like to speculate how the movie would have turned out if the role of Mrs. Robinson had been played by Doris Day (who turned down the part). Doris Day never gave a bad performance, and her sunny disposition masked a darker side. I think she would have been great. As it stands, Anne Bancroft steals the show with her wise and knowing interpretation. I never tire of this intelligent, sophisticated, one-of-a-kind entertainment. As a side note for those who appreciate such minutiae: Eddra Gale, the blond woman seated next to Katherine Ross on the bus in Berkeley, had a small part as a party guest in Katherine Ross' other 1967 film, 'Games.'",10,0,1,24 April 2008
A Clockwork Orange," Not Impressed in 1971, Less So Today
","Viewing this film nearly half a century after the fact, it looks extremely dated and, dare I say, amateurish. About the only thing Kubrick got right was his depiction of an increasingly violent society. His mind-numbing emphasis on sexual iconography comes across as schoolboy prurience. Surprising, in light of the finesse with which he handled the subject of sex in 'Lolita.' It's clear 'A Clockwork Orange' was intended to shock and break boundaries in mainstream movies. Mike Nichols did a much better job of it in 1971 with 'Carnal Knowledge' which holds up beautifully today and has a lot more depth to it.",2,3,6,28 August 2019
The Da Vinci Code," What a bunch of hogwash!
","I can't believe all the rave reviews on this website for this movie. I read the book first (which I thought was a typical potboiler wrapped up in religious mumbo jumbo), and still had difficulty following this far-fetched nonsense. As a film, it's too disjointed, too darkly lit, and way too long. After all the hoopla surrounding the book, this film seems to have thrown a wet blanket over the whole thing  we (thankfully) hear nothing about it anymore. Tom Hanks had a similar effect on a big bestseller when his film of 'Bonfire of the Vanities' also landed with a thud. I think the main problem here is the script. It's just not cohesive or convincing in any way. Even the shots of the Louvre and St. Sulpice were wasted. Overall, not my idea of entertainment.",1,2,6,14 October 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," Not A Fan
","Sorry, this film just doesn't move me (and I cry a lot at movies). I find it long-winded, heavy-handed and rather preachy. It takes an awfully long time and a sledgehammer to get its message across. And I have little patience with the old conceit of an angel coming down from heaven to show us the way ('Here Comes Mr. Jordan,' 'Heaven Can Wait,' 'Stairway To Heaven,' 'The Bishop's Wife,' 'Forever, Darling,' the list goes on). For a more touching look at the meaning of Christmas, and certainly a more concise one, see Twentieth Century Fox's 1952 anthology film, 'O'Henry's Full House.' Henry King's episode, 'The Gift of the Magi,' has Jeanne Crain and Farley Granger portraying newlyweds whose well-intentioned sacrifices backfire, but teach them (and us) an important lesson.",5,3,7,17 December 2017
Rosemary's Baby," Timeless Entertainment
","One of the most remarkable things about this fine film is how little it has dated in almost half a century. Despite the lack of cell phones, computers and other current technology there is little to distract modern audiences from the plot. It's not like watching an old movie at all. Another phenomenal aspect is how well Polanski (a newcomer to the US at the time) conveyed such a trenchant feel for New York City. The direction is sure-handed and the action is well- paced. There are just the right amounts of humor thrown in to relieve the tension. 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Chinatown' are unquestionably rivals for Polanski's best film. I think this one has the edge, as I defy anyone to not identify with the main character early on through to the end. The dream sequence is pure Polanski. In 'Repulsion' he tried to make a whole film out of essentially a dream sequence, and it's rather contrived. Here, the surreal touches don't drive the action off course. Mia Farrow is perfect for the part and at age 23 holds her own against seasoned actors a generation or two older. John Cassavetes, who is very good as the husband, always struck me as a bit too old for the part of a struggling actor just starting out (he was 38). The supporting cast is superb, with Ruth Gordon stealing the show (and an Oscar in the process) and Patsy Kelly running a close second. 'Rosemary's Baby' holds up well to repeated viewings and continues to entertain even after you know where all this is going. It has all the hallmarks of a classic.",10,1,2,1 November 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," I May Never Go To The Movies Again
","Have we really sunk this low? This is what's considered entertainment? Poor Tippi has to see her granddaughter splayed all over the screen! This nonsensical tale is so tasteless, not to mention un-erotic, it makes you wonder whether the entire human race has lost their brains. It'll put you into a 2-hour coma. Poorly acted. Inane dialog. Hey, nice scenery. Did they have to steal the giddy glider rendezvous from the remake of 'The Thomas Crown Affair?' Have they no imagination of their own? Can't think of any redeeming qualities here. Someone please clue me in. No, wait! Better off spending your time reading D. H. Lawrence if you're looking for a wee bit of titillation. At least you'll get some exposure to good writing. And get this - 'Fifty Shades' was such a sensation it merited a sequel! I give up. I'm going into hibernation. See ya!",1,0,1,16 March 2017
The Birds," Let's Talk About Tippi
","From the day 'The Birds' opened in 1963, Tippi Hedren has been subjected to some very harsh judgment for her acting. Critics were unimpressed. Perhaps they resented an unknown with no acting experience following in the footsteps of stars like Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly. Viewers to this day still insist her performance is 'wooden.' I think they're wrong.Tippi Hedren for me is the ultimate Hitchcock heroine, created from the ground up by the Master who took all the best elements of his former leading ladies and produced his ideal blonde beauty. Just what James Stewart attempted with Kim Novak in 'Vertigo.'Watch 'The Birds' again, solely for her performance (And to a somewhat lesser degree, 'Marnie'). You can see Hitchcock directing every flicker of the eyelid, every purse of the lips. Lovingly made up, clothed and photographed, she is, as aptly described by Camille Paglia, a 'walking work of art.'",10,1,2,24 January 2016
