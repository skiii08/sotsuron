Ghost," This is a keeper.
","I have an 800+ movie collection.  I do loan to my friends. This is one movie that I have an extra copy so that if something happens to my loaner, I still have my copy.  Though I am not a regular critic except for my own viewing, I feel that this should be a keeper in any collection.  The scenes where demons come to get the bad guy and where Patrick Swayze finally goes to the after-life are fantastic.  It has it all; comedy, romance, and action.",Null,37,69,20 September 1998
