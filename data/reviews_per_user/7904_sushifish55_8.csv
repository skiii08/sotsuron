Casablanca," So that's why everyone loves this movie!
","Until recently I've never seen 'Casablanca'(1942). The only thing I could tell you about it was that Humphrey Bogart was in it and there was a scene on a foggy airfield somewhere. Other than that I just thought it was some good classic film that simply got over hyped like so many others. Within 30 minutes of the movie I could clearly see I was mistaken. The story, acting, and sets were all fantastic but what really won me over was the amazing cinematography work by Arthur Edeson. Especially the scenes shot in 'Rick's Café Américain'. The use of lighting and shadows was fantastic and gave this film a sort of film noir precursor feel. This film knows exactly when to let information go at exactly the right time and when to add a little comic relief when things start to get tense; whither it be the delight wit and charm of Bogart or the antics of Szőke Szakáll. 'Casablanca'(1942) will keep you guessing with whats going to happen with the characters facing many moral dilemmas and you not knowing if their going to take the high or low road. This was one amazing film that lived up to its hype and for that I give it a 10-10",10,2,3,11 May 2011
Citizen Kane," Probably the Greatest Film Ever Made
","When I first saw this film I blown away. It was the first older film I ever saw and thought, 'simply amazing!' It really turned me on to the classics and opened my mind to the concept that in terms of how great a movie is it doesn't matter when the film was made. Orson Welles was only twenty six when he made 'Citizen Kane'(1941)! Some men will spend there wholes lives trying to create a movie as amazing as this and most will fail yet Welles hit this one out of the park at such a young age! On top of that it was Welles first film ever made! The success might be credited to that Welles was given full creative control of the film by RKO Pictures. The use of sound in this film is unreal, and it seems like every scene can be deconstructed to find 100 different meanings behind every characters action and the objects/places that surround them. This Film à clef uses exceptionally peculiar narrative and direction to tell you the story of Charles Foster Kane. Starting from Kane's last words, going to a news real, then jumping between the interviews of reporter Jerry Thompson to the flashbacks of the ones he questioned. All this accompanied by daring and creative cinematography and amazing acting by Orson Welles and his crew solidify this piece as cinema gold. Don't get me wrong this is in no way my favorite film but I'd think even a person who despised this film would have a hard time saying it wasn't the greatest film known to man. For this I give it 10/10.",10,1,2,18 May 2011
The Birth of a Nation," Well that was... interesting.
","OK personally I'm not one that enjoys silent films. I enjoy them even less when the whole second half of the film tries to glorify racism through a backwards telling of post Civil War reconstruction. I fully recognize that this film has historical significance; not in the sense of the historical content of the film but the impact it had on society. I mean a whole nation watched as the Klu Klux Clan were made to seem like heroes while the newly freed African Americans were viewed as a ravenous bunch that have gone mad with their newly found freedom! Am I seriously supposed to sit here and watch as white men in black face make idiots out of the selves and think 'Oh my god, who will stop these horrible brutes! If only racist ghosts would come in on white steeds and save these poor people!' I mean who in their right mind would believe this non-sense of blacks stuffing ballot ballot boxes as the poor whites watched helplessly as their whole way of life was taken over! Oh that's right most of America in the early 1900's.(sigh) Wow have we come a long way!",3,3,6,23 February 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Great film that does justice to the novel
","When I say this I don't mean in the sense of how accurately the film follows Steinbeck's novel; the film starts to stray from the books story around halfway through the movie. What I mean is the film is great on it's own and ,unlike most film adaptations of books, this movie kept most of the others message intact. The key difference I found was that the book was much sadder. I know it's hard to believe seeing how depressing this movie was but their were many things the director chose not to show. The biggest difference was in the endings. The film leaves you with some since of optimism for these people, the novel does no such thing. The book leaves you with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn and offering her breast milk to a man dying of starvation. This obviously could have never been shown in theaters during the 1940's and I'm glad for it. I believe it would have been one powerful scene but the book was way to sad to begin with and the film was pretty depressing as well. Currently we could have handled a film like that just fine but back in the 1940's this was some amazingly heavy stuff. I just think keeping to Steinbeck's original ending would have instilled to much ill feelings in Americans in a time where we needed some optimism. So great film, don't watch it though if you can't handle a little despair though.",9,0,0,6 April 2011
The Exorcist," Well that was terrifying!
","Honestly this movie puts all the modern Horror movies to shame. This movie was so original (even though it was based of a novel) and in my opinion still the scariest movie of all time. With amazing writers, actors, director, and cinematography this showed people the potential horror movies have! Now a days the best people come up with is 'SAW 5' or 'Scream 4'. Why do people insist on making shitty remakes when 'Paranormal Activity' has shown people you can still make an original horror movie in modern times and have it be a big success. Now 'Paranormal Activity' doesn't really stack up to the 'The Exorcist' (1973) but still fits in the category of amazing horror movies. The key recipe I believe this movie figured out is to slowly disturb people. I mean at first Regan MacNeil simply wireds you out by pissing on the floor at a dinner party then saying some nasty things to the guests but before you know it shes crab walking backwards down the stairs, her head is spinning around 360, and I've soiled my pants! I guess It matters that I was 10 when I first saw this movie but even though I may not show it, it scares me just as much today as it did back then. For going up and beyond what the horror genre was thought to be I give 'The Exorcist' a 10/10.",10,2,4,18 May 2011
The Graduate," Amazing!
",This movie just helped solidify my love of the wave of New Hollywood films even more. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as the newly graduated Benjamin Braddock and Anne Bancroft role as the first seductive and then vengeful Mrs.Robinson is fantastic. While it is just my opinion I feel like Cinema really came alive after the death of the Hayes Code. Now I know along with this came the creation of plenty of films whose only goal is to entertain with shock value but pre-code movies just don't have the raw freedom post code movies have. While I know this isn't the main message of the film I feel like it does a pretty good job of showing it. First of all a man and woman even if married couldn't sleep in the same bed together and here you have a 40 something year old married Anne Bancroft seducing an almost 21 year old Dustin Hoffman; then latter Dustin Hoffman going after Katharine Ross who plays Elaine Robinson Bancroft's fictional daughter. It really showed off the new freedom Hollywood now had and in my opinion opened up cinema as an art form even more. Amazing performances accompanied by an amazing soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel and amazing cinematography by Robert Surtees make this one of my favorite movies and in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time.,10,0,0,18 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Hooray a musical about a Musical =/
","In my own opinion if you want to make a musical about a musical you better be Mel Brooks. 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952) is by no means a bad movie and the dancing and comedic feats of Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown are sure to delight anyone, but the this musical movie is about the making of musical movies and at times seems to trade of substance to add an extra dance number. If you love Musicals by all means this is the film for you, but if your like me and your indifferent about them I'd steer clear of this one. To me a good musical will incorporate the song/dance number into the actually plot, 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952) often fails to do this. Now the scene where Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden finally meet up again and have a romantic duet in a studio on a Hollywood lot the film does a great job of incorporating the song into the plot. An example of where the movie fails to do this is during the number 'Moses Supposes' where Don and Cosmo are at a professor of linguistics office and break out into this goofy little number for pure entertainment. Now I don't mind a funny goofy musical scene but at least make it matter!!! If you love musicals and have some time to waste then by all means enjoy the film; if not please look elsewhere because 'Singin' in the Rain' is not for you.",6,1,3,18 May 2011
The Wizard of Oz," Wait a minute!
","So they all make it back to the wizard having defeated the Wicked Witch of the West. Thanks to Toto they find out the Wizard's just an ordinary man. He bestows open the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Cowardly Lion their respective trophies to show them they had what they were searching for all along and offers to bring Dorthy home in his hot air balloon. As they are taking off Toto jumps out and Dorthy cases after him so they miss the ride but the good which appears and said she could go home all along by clicking her heels together and wishing to go home. I don't know why the bitch, excuse me witch didn't tell her sooner. I mean it's like she's having Dorthy be her hit-man, killing all the other witches so she can rule Oz with a cotton-candy fist. Anyways Dorthy awakes at home in her bed and realizes that the only place she ever wants to be is with her family at home. What a happy ending... wait a minute I feel like we're forgetting something... that's right Toto is still going to die! Everything that happened here is because Toto bit Miss Gulch and she's going to have the sheriff put him down! To me this is just to big of a plot hole to have. Did they think no one would really notice so they just left the issue unresolved? It seems like Miss Gulch isn't the type of person who'd let this go either. So for me this happy ending was soured by the fact that relatively soon Toto's going to be brought out back and shot. The last thought I had during the film was, 'I hope you've had a fun last day in Oz Toto because your about to take one final trip to the great beyond.'",7,2,5,10 March 2011
