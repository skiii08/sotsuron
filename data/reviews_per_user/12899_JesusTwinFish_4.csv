3:10 to Yuma," Most heart I have ever seen on screen...
","Obviously, redemption to some people is redeeming yourself in the eyes of people you loved - your loved ones, or redeem yourself for some bad things you have done. This is not true. People redeem themselves for themselves. They are in a battle with the other person inside of themselves and don't know how to change it, but they know they want to change it. This was the case for the two leads in this movie. Crowe's character, Ben Wade. And Christian Bale's character Dan Evans. Crowe's character was trying to just escape himself in the beginning. He wanted to get away and try something new. Dan wanted to just be something that, in his heart, he knew he wanted to be and what he SHOULD be. When these two characters finally meet they take themselves through a roller-coaster of change and redemption...atonement...as the plot unfolds. That is what this movie is about, self redemption. It's about growing into who we feel we should be and what we consider important in our lives. This movie has the most heart I have ever seen. If you appreciate great movies; see 3:10 to Yuma",10,3,7,4 October 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's love for the Nazi's?
","What can I say here? Is this another Tarantino film? Yes. Does this movie primarily deal in gore and bloodshed? Yes. Is this another Tarantino film that has over dramatic scenes that over use their stay? Yes. Is this another Taratino film that has no point? No. Why do I say this? Well, because this movie does EXACTLY what you don't want it to do. It makes you WANT to kill. By the end of this movie I'm sure you'll be aching to want someone to die, the only problem is, you don't know who. And the real clever part about it is that it makes you thirst for blood against the people you wouldn't be ashamed in killing...the nazi's. But where this movie goes sour is that it portray's the Nazi's in a - I don't wish to sound out of line - 'lovable' fashion. Especially regarding Christopher Woltz's character (Hans Landa). You can't help but wishing you were everything those characters were (except for being part of a totalitarian, psychotic, mass-murding posse).But by the end of this movie it is clear nobody is innocent. Is this Tarantino's best movie? No. But does it touch on some wider concepts and challenge American entertainment with it's foreign subtitles? Yes. Therefore this movie is well worth the watch and can be very satisfying for the sick at heart. For me, this is another mediocre Tarantino film in which the characters exceed the story or even the background. However it turns you onto the idea of having no problem to kill and the most ingenious of it all is that it does it with killing the very people you would want to see killed the most through all our history. Now that is entertainment. Though let's not be irradiate and make it reality. hmm?",9,0,4,20 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," An excellent ending to a brilliant trilogy, but just a tad messy...
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is clearly not meant for one viewing. Any stone cold Pirates fan will most likely watch this more than once however the ones that don't watch it more then once might feel a bit skeptical about it; I know I was. I'm a Pirates fan so I watched it twice (not at the theaters) and I have to admit that on the second time I appreciated it a great deal more. It was a very satisfying end to the Pirates trilogy.When this movie starts out it has the usual touch to it that Pirates 1 and 2 had to them in that it is going to be awesome. However, as the movie drags on it begins to lose it's focus and just becomes a bit absurd with all the deceiving and different story lines going on at once - confusing. It get's sloppy with how many different things are going on all at once and has to make call-backs to the first two as comical reliefs to save itself. It worked a little bit. It worked just enough to get to the end of the film which seemed to be what most of the effort of the movie went to.I cannot even begin to explain the uniqueness and fantastic ending (including final battle) that it brings. Some say it 'left room for a fourth' however I do not think that it did, it left us with a happy and touching feeling of hope that seemed to have been lost at world's end (no pun intended). The loss of hope seemed to also be a major theme throughout the film and it was restored at the end. At the end of this on my second viewing it literally brought a smile to my face; not because it was funny, but because it was so relieving (not in a bad way either).If anybody is a Pirates fan then this is surely NOT to be missed. However, I think to truly appreciate this movie it has to be watched more then once. Yeah, it get's a tad bit messy in the middle and confusing on the first view, but then the ending is very rewarding and very entertaining. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat and people who are suckers for happy ending may or may not be disappointed (I guess it is the way you look at it) And, that is also what makes this movie excellent - your options are open. Pirates 3 is not to be missed, the final and very rewarding ending to, probably, the greatest film trilogy of all time. So watch it, enjoy it, and, stick through it to the ending, you will not be disappointed.",8,2,3,9 June 2007
Blood Diamond," Friendship, Love, and Human Ambition
","This movie has a lot of good points behind it. However, one in particular that was obviously noticeable was the political message: conflict diamonds. Of course that seemed to be the major motif in the film. However, I saw it differently. This movie seemed to be a movie about love, friendship, and human ambition with the political message as it's catalyst.Love is the connection between Danny and Maddy. Clearly, these two fell for each by the time Danny left her to go with Soloman after the diamonds, and at the end when Danny says 'I'm really glad I met you' and Maddy responds 'I'm really glad I met you too' they clearly wanted to say 'I love you' but, Archer is a man that tries not to feel so he couldn't say it. Mr. Zwick may not have gone into a great deal of detail with their love however it is greatly performed by DiCaprio and Connelly when they are on screen together and you can really sense their loss when Maddy walks off to go into the plane. Zwick also seemed to take a different direction with the love also: NO SEX SCENE. That is truly amazing given the fact that Hollywood usually finds a way nowadays to sneak in sex scene, but not this one. So props to this movie for not doing it.Another motif is that of friendship. Danny and Soloman seem to have a connection between them in the fact that they are both providing services for each other to get what they both want. However, it is clear by the end of the movie Danny and Soloman become more than just associates - they become friends; cherished friends. Enough to the point that Danny gives up his life for Soloman and his son. Even though Danny wouldn't say it, he did it for them; the diamond was just his bonus. However, and tragically, his bonus was also his ambition. Ambition is a big theme in anybody's life - however it cannot become your whole life, like it did Danny's. And that is ultimately what lead Danny to his death.So watch and enjoy this movie. Not because of the mediocre political message, but because of it's accurate display of Friendship, love, and Human ambition - and how they all coincide, and how they can all make or break one's life. This is truly an excellent film with excellent character development and excellent relationship displays. Blood Diamond is a classic, and deserves to be treated as such. Get it into the top 250.",9,0,1,27 May 2007
