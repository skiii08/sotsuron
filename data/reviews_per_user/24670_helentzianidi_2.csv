Hereditary," Bizzare
","It's was one of the most bizarre and disappointing films I've ever seen.Through the whole film I was expecting for a plot twist or some action, but all I got was a depressing and weird story line. The trailer was misleading and didn't prepare us for this concept.Not clever at all and the minor explanation at the ending was not enough to cover the huge amount of gaps,that the movie created to me as a viewer.

Avengers: Endgame," Disappointing
","I was expecting this movie for a long time and i was sure that since the last 3 avengers movies were good ,that this one will be the best , they even compared it to dark knight... but no, itt wasn't. The flow of the movie was very slow and uneven, 2 whole hours introduction for 30min of action and suspnce.. when the action finaly came i couldnt even be excited.They tried to create emotions, but you can't force that ,when yoou devote your 2 first hours to nothing. It has soem great scenes and it wasn't so awful but i excpected much more from the closing movie of avengers with not so many plot holes...",5,8,14,2 May 2019
