The Lobster," Boredom with a dash of nausea
","Meh. The film starts with a delightfully surreal premise, and gets off to a promising start as a Strangelovesque dark comedy, or perhaps even a 'Being John Malkovich' maze of mind-boggling left turns.The moments of humor, however, thin out. The plot hews to the obvious even in its twists. The deadpan delivery becomes merely dead, and a sea of intolerably flat affect gradually crushes any empathy we might have for the characters. Exhausted of its premise, disinterested in both the humans who inhabit it and the humans who are watching it, and groping for any sort of social observation that is not already obvious and well-trodden, the film finds it has littleÂ left to say and another 90 minutes to say it.It drags itself, sallow and lifeless, to a cliffhanger conclusion that leaves us wondering what happens next, but not really caring.",3,125,193,28 May 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," Don't look for explanations -- embrace the unknown
","In this world of 24-hour TV news stuffing our brains with millions of ready-made explanations and opinions about everything under the sun, we've come to *crave* explanation. We needs things sorted out and tied off. We need closure.2001 is a very unconventional piece of storytelling, as much a work of abstract art as it is a narrative. The movie is about humans exploring the unknown -- and finding things that they cannot understand. And flying in the face of our desire for explanation, the movie explains very little. Instead, we experience events as the characters experience them: awed, and utterly uncomprehending.I'd always loved this movie, but hadn't appreciated just how specular it is until I had a chance to see it on the big screen at the Heights Theater (a a lovely Twin Cities art house place with a working theater organ!). Then I realized: you aren't *supposed* to understand what's going on -- not at the start, not at the end. You are supposed to be mystified and utterly overwhelmed. I don't mean overwhelmed by huge explosions or lots of lots of rumbling THX bass gimmicks; I mean overwhelmed by a sense that the universe is vast, and we humans are tiny and ignorant.I think people often don't like this masterful movie because they expect explanations, and are disappointed. If you're seeing it for the first time, expect to understand nothing. It's about the experience, not explanations. See it on a big screen if possible, and embrace the confusion!",10,1,4,5 March 2006
