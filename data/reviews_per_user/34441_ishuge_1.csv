Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who did it.
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit The two known actors of this film are Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom) and Bob Hopkins (Eddie Valiant). There are others but they were voice overs for the toons. In this film it takes 2 different styles of film and joins them. It mostly deals with the real world as a setting but it has cartoon characters intermixing with reality. The theme of the film is thought to be clearing Roger's name by Eddie, but the whole story actually revolves around saving Toontown from destruction by Judge Doom. There are a lot of plot twists that the first time through you would not notice that help you see the dots connected. You learn about why Eddie dislikes toons so much as the story goes on. In the end he loses his hatred for toons and avenges his brother's murder by a toon which ends up being Judge Doom's real self a squeaky voiced red eyed evil toon. In the end the bad guy dies Judge Doom and Roger is cleared and Toontown is saved by Roger and Eddie. A film with a similar theme would be Hoodwinked. The fairytale characters are framed for doing something and the movie is about finding out who did it while proving their innocents. The lighting played a big part in leading the theme. When R.K. Maroon was murdered you see the shadow of the gun peeking through the window as it comes through to shoot him the dimness of the lighting adds to the evil feel of it. Then the dark alley as Jessica Rabbit runs off gives you the feeling she might have been the murder and plotter that framed Roger. Throughout the film the lighting helps you know something interesting or important to the progression of the film is coming or is happening. In the end when Toontown is saved, Judge Doom is dead and the Will is found the brightness of Toontown in the background lightens the mood as the film ends leaving you feeling like everything ended the way it should with a HAPPY ENDING.They say you can judge a lot about a film by its title that is more than true in the case of this film the title is the theme all wrapped up in a nutshell. The whole movie is about finding out who framed him and who did the killing and plotting.",7,0,0,2 August 2013
