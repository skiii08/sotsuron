The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Love all of the series.
","I loved this movie. I think they did a great job. I have been looking forward to seeing the wedding scene and also the birth scene and they were both acted out so well. I felt like i was there in the movie and got the full emotion. I also went with a male friend who said he didn't like it mainly because it was all based around sappy love stuff. But that is expected out of this one. This is what we have all been waiting for. The actors all looked amazing and it left me wanting more. Only corny part was the wolves talking. That is why I gave it a 9, but other then that AWESOME.. :) So excited to see part 2. I already have it written on my calender. I think that this movies brings our your inner teenager and what you at one time envisioned love being like. I have seen people say that Edward acts controlling, but in my opinion he isn't. Shouldn't you be there for the one you love at all times. :)",10,1,8,6 December 2011
