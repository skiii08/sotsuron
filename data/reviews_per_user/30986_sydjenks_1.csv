","I don't understand how this is 7.8. I am a fair reviewer and this is at most a 6 by IMDb standards.It is well rendered, and there are some innovative parts, the characters which were excellently formed in the first one have now no consistency, the subplots clumsily come together, and no matter how many reviewers say this has adult and child appeal, it really is aimed at very young children.if I was to compare it in standard, you are looking at a Ice Age/Madagascar standard instead of the Kung Fu Panda/Toy Story 3 level.Worth a watch but 7.8 sounds a bit fishy to me",5,48,87,12 July 2013
