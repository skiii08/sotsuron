Walk the Line," By-the-Numbers Biopic
","This is a very run of the mill biopic that doesn't provide any significant insight into Cash's character or his music. I was never an admirer of Cash's sound, so this depiction of a tortured drug addict merely came off to me as an annoying and self-centered man instead of a compelling one. The film's great saving grace is the performances of Juaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who provide highly watchable impersonations of their country-western counterparts (although their relationship frequently borders on being more obsessive than romantic, especially as Cash's descent into drug addiction worsens).But the story itself offers no surprises as a formulaic presentation of a troubled artist saved by the love of a good woman. When Cash first attempts to start his career by going into a small-time recording studio and singing a sappy Gospel tune, he is chided by the producer that 'that's something we heard a hundred times before.' The makers of 'Walk the Line' might have listened to that advice themselves.",4,9,21,19 November 2005
Inglourious Basterds," A disgusting travesty
","This is a disgusting travesty of a film that does its best to re-imagine the Holocaust as a comic book that was conceived by a 12-year old boy. There are a myriad of films that portray World War II in a fanciful light, but 'Inglorious Basterds' is one of the few that I can recall that uses the extermination of the Jews as a launching pad for an outlandish Sam Peckenpaugh -inspired cartoon which depicts historical figures like Adolph Hitler and Joseph Goebbels - monsters who were responsible for the murder of millions of people - on the same level as Lex Luthor or The Joker.Brad Pitt and his crew of seemingly invincible marauders cut through the German lines with such ease that it's a wonder that the war lasted as long as it did, and with such a sadistic bloodthirstiness that they seemed likely subjects for a war crimes trial at the conflict's end. Tarantino crudely and artlessly tries to take the narrative between their bloody and far-fetched 'heroics' and more genuine atrocities suffered by victims of the Nazis, so the line between Tarantino's outlandish fairy tale and the real-life horrors of the Holocaust are blurred to a degree that made me feel like the director was exploiting the brutal death of six million people in order to splash a lot of cool, fake blood on a movie set. That's perfectly fine if you're making a flight of fantasy like 'Kill Bill', but the blood that was spilled in the Holocaust wasn't supplied by Hollywood special effects wizards and deserves more respect than it's given here.",1,83,163,30 August 2009
Crash," Not equal to the sum of its parts
","This well-meaning collection of episodes depicting racial unrest in Los Angeles contains some powerful scenes, but ultimately comes off as pretentious and pointless. Bahar Soomekh as the compassionate daughter of an overwrought Persian shopkeeper and Michael Pena as a put-upon locksmith are the undeniable standouts in the cast, while more famous names like Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser and Don Cheadle flounder about in unconvincing characterizations.There are enough memorable moments to walk away from 'Crash' with respect for its good intentions, but its melodramatic script's reliance on outrageous coincidences and lack of a clear sense of anything specific to say about race relations leaves it cracked up on the cinematic shoulder instead of racing triumphantly to the finish line.",4,7,17,24 May 2005
Capote," Humanizing Capote
","This moving film lives and breathes on the powerful shoulders of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's stunning performance in the title role. Hoffman captures all of the unique physical characteristics that made Capote such a familiar public figure in his lifetime and invests them with a humanity that is almost unbearably poignant. The film focuses on Capote's research on the book 'In Cold Blood' and the personal journey that his relationship and identification with killer Perry Smith became (Capote says at one point that it was like they grew up in the same house, and he went out the front door while Perry went out the back), a compelling and complicated relationship that this uncompromising film presents in moving detail. But what truly makes it a unique work of art is the brilliant work of Hoffman - always an interesting actor - whose performance as Truman Capote should elevate him to the pantheon of film giants.",10,241,340,11 September 2005
To Rome With Love," The Bloom is Off the Rose
","'To Rome with Love' comes off as a series of short stories written by a middle school student, lacking any logic and possessing the sexual maturity of a thirteen year old boy. Employing the 'bigger is better' approach, Woody Allen takes the device he used in the far more successful 'Midnight in Paris' of a nebbish character swept up in an unexplained fantasy and cranks out a series of nonsensical vignettes depicting nebbish characters in unexplained fantasies, replacing the impressive vistas of Paris for the impressive vistas of Rome. There are a few laughs along the way, but Allen spreads himself so thin that he is unable to provide his universe with any depth or reality and tries to get by on the audience's familiarity with his work and the faded idea that whatever he puts on screen represents quality.The most successful episode features Alec Baldwin as a world-weary architect who makes a sentimental journey to the street he lived on as a student and encounters young Jesse Eisenberg now in residence and living out a romantic entanglement that Baldwin pops in and out of to provide jaded insight. This sequence at least offers some actual emotion for the audience to connect with (largely due to the fine acting of Baldwin, Eisenberg and Ellen Page as a sexy but neurotic actress steeped in Allen's signature pseudo intellectuality) but is so confused about Baldwin's presence that the audience is unclear if he is simply the person he is presented as, if Eisenberg is his younger self who he has come back to mentor, or if it is some bizarre 'Twilight Zone' scenario that is never fully resolved. Even when he is in the room with the characters Eisenberg is interacting with, no one makes any reference to Baldwin and no one except Eisenberg can seem to hear what Baldwin is saying (the few times when the other characters do respond to Baldwin only make it more confusing when they don't). Yet this peculiar relationship is never explained and seems a product of Allen's sloppy writing rather than mysterious forces at work.The rest of the vignettes are just lazy, implausible nonsense whose outrageousness is forced and seems planted there to make up for any genuine wit. The most tiresome sequence is Roberto Begnini as a mundane worker bee who inexplicably wakes up to find himself the most famous man in the world. It's a one-joke premise that goes on for far too long, and since Begnini's boring drone doesn't get any more interesting as a result of what he's experienced, neither does the story. A young couple on their honeymoon are parted just as they are about to meet some people who are important to their future, and the husband implausibly substitutes prostitute Pen√©lope Cruz for his absent wife. The newlyweds end up throwing aside the marriage vows that they just took in an alarming display of Allen's sexual immaturity. And Allen himself makes an appearance as a frustrated opera director who discovers a major talent who can only show off his gifts in the shower, in yet another one-joke misfire.It is sad that after a long stretch of sub-par work and redeeming himself with some quality films like 'Midnight in Paris' and 'Match Point' that Allen is content to present a lazy effort like 'To Rome with Love' which is so derivative of his 'early, funny films' without any of the freshness or inventiveness. If you're looking for something to do this weekend, I recommend popping 'Annie Hall' into the DVD player and giving this one a pass.",3,25,52,23 June 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Everything is Black and White
","It is ironic that this impressive docudrama about newsman Edward R. Murrow's television vendetta against Joseph McCarthy is shot in black and white, as that is precisely the sensibility the film has towards its deified hero and big brother antagonist. Murrow is presented as a plaster saint with no discernible flaws (or personality), while McCarthy is Evil Incarnate.The film's gimmick of presenting McCarthy and his HUAAC cohorts through actual documentary footage is both its strength and its weakness: by using the actual footage there is a strong sense of authenticity to the proceedings. It also occasionally breaks out into not only an intellectually stimulating, but emotionally engaging movie with scenes like Murrow prostituting himself by conducting a cloying interview with Liberace on 'Person to Person' or in Ray Wise's touching, angst-ridden performance as troubled newsman Don Hollenbeck. But since the villains are only shown through stiff public appearances they lack a sense of attachment to dramatics of the story. And since the Murrow camp is depicted as an earnest and somber think tank whose human interactions are either high school civics class-level conversations about television news ethics or breaking into spontaneous applause over their perceived successes, they rarely engage any response that emanates from anywhere beyond the frontal lobe.There is a lot to recommend the film: it provides a valuable remedial lesson about the McCarthy era and David Stathairn does a remarkably effective impression of Murrow (within the limits of the screenplay's stiff depiction of the character). But like films that attempt to tell the story of Adolph Hitler, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' fails to provide a context for McCarthy's villainy that explains how he rose to power or why he was such a powerful politician for such a brief period of time. But more than anything, the film lacks the human element that transforms the characters from exalted idols from a History of Television Journalism textbook into relatable human beings.'Good Night, and Good Luck' is an easy film to admire, but a hard one to cherish.",6,7,31,2 October 2005
Blood Diamond," African Diamonds - Hollywood Style
","This is a laughable little piece of nonsense where the very real dilemma of of the inhuman treatment of diamond workers in Africa is given the ultra-slick Hollywood treatment. Leonardo DiCaprio is the living embodiment of a clich√©d soldier of fortune that has populated Hollywood films since the days of Clark Gable: a mean stone-cold killer who can blow away whole armies of militia single-handedly while still displaying enough sensitivity to melt the heart of Jennifer Connelly, surely the most gorgeous investigative reporter to ever set foot on the continent.Djimon Hounsou is the film's only contact with reality, giving an earnest performance as a diamond mine worker who finds and hides a priceless 100 karat pink diamond and tries to use the windfall to find his family, who have been separated by the brutal militia that have forced him into slave work in the mines. But DiCaprio and Connelly's characters are silly, slick products of the Hollywood oil factory, and nothing that they do or say has any plausibility or packs any emotional resonance. The sacrifices Leo makes at the film's comic book finish are the acts of a movie star who requires a heroic ending in his contract, not the behavior of a genuine human being.",3,21,43,19 December 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Powerful But Gruesome
","This telling of the rise of Idi Amin as told through the eyes of the young Scottish physician who found himself in the dictator's inner circle long before he realized that was a dangerous place to be is a compelling, powerful film despite some incredibly graphic depictions of violence that are so horrific that they take the viewer out of the film rather than drawing him into it.I was somewhat surprised that Forrest Whittaker has won so many acting awards for his performance. He does a fine job as Amin and provides a chilling and complex presence, but it is to me really a supporting role (despite Whittaker's top billing) and the outstanding performance of the film is James McAvoy in the more challenging role of the young Scotsman who is at first charmed by the dictator and is soon horrified by him. The film is really McAvoy's character's story, and while I don't suggest that he should have been the rightful recipient of the awards that went to Whittaker (I would give my vote to Peter O'Toole in 'Venus'), I think he has been seriously undervalued in the praise of his fine performance (as is the superb Kerry Washington in the pivotal roles as one of Amin's wives).'The Last King of Scotland' is a fine movie, but there were some sequences that were so gruesome that I had to look away from the screen. In those moments, I was very aware that I was in a audience watching a film rather than feeling a part of it. I think the excellent performances of Whittaker, Washington and especially McAvoy would have been far better served by a more suggestive approach.",7,1,2,16 December 2006
American Gangster," Generic Cops and Robbers
","This is a generic, throwaway cops-and-robbers movie whose only memorable feature is the charismatic presence of Denzel Wasington as a Harlem drug lord. It takes the overly familiar formula of juxtaposing the life of a super criminal against the elaborate investigation of a dedicated and untouchable law enforcement officer (in this case, a forgettable Russell Crowe), essentially giving you two movies in one until the investigation and the crook go head to head.The problem is, neither movie is all that interesting, taking formulaic routes that we've seen a million times before. The only real result of giving equal prominence to the cop and the robber is that you wind up with an interminable running time.Both Washington and Crowe give performances that are reminiscent of roles that you've seen them in before (Washington in 'Training Day' and Crowe in 'LA Confidential') and if you have a hankering to see those actors, either of those earlier films would be a better use of your time (although the far-fetched 'Training Day' is only superior by a nose to 'American Gangster,' and then only because of Washington's riveting performance). If there is a competition between the two stars in this film, Washington wins hands-down even though this is just a retread of material that isn't really worthy of either one of them.",3,20,45,4 November 2007
Casino Royale," A Failure on Every Level
","It is mystifying to me that this film has received so many good reviews, as I thought it failed on almost every level. The plot is nominally centered around how James Bond 'becomes' James Bond (clearly hoping to achieve the same kind of success that 'Batman Begins' won), but it misses the mark by taking an established character firmly rooted in the 1960s Cold War mentality and implying that he starts out in the world of the mid-2000s with middle eastern terrorists, cell phones, and digital technology.Not helping the enterprise is the casting of Daniel Craig, certainly the most humorless actor to ever play Bond and who the script implies has the moldability and insecurities of a young man starting out in his career. But Craig is close to 40 years old with the complexion of a saddle bag, and it is impossible to buy that a man of that age is going to smooth his rough edges into the character in a white dinner jacket matching wits with super villains like Ernst Blofeld and Auric Goldfinger. Instead, Craig's Bond is a surly thug who would be shown the door by security at the first five-star resort that he tried to check in at.Craig isn't given any assistance by a lackluster script, which does its best to rob Bond of the glamour associated with the character. The plot centers around a silly plan for terrorists to raise money for their operations by taking part in an interminable game of Texas Hold 'Em, a game that one usually associates with playing with old college buddies while drinking beer on a Saturday night and not in the exotic universe of James Bond (in the novel, the characters play Baccarat), that Bond ducks out of occasionally to take part in unspeakable acts of violence (fortunately, Giancarlo Giannini is around as a character who sits table-side to spout ridiculous lines of dialogue that exist only to provide explanation of what's going on with the plot to audience members who have nodded off during the poker game). You'd think that characters playing for a hundred and fifty million dollar pot would be more insistent on Bond's attendance at the table.The script keeps the current post-AIDS trend of limiting Bond's sexual conquests to the single-digits, but his primary love interest is the listless Eva Green, a pretty girl with no apparent personality who we are supposed to buy as a government accountant, an occupation that has the same credibility as a Swedish Playboy playmate playing a nuclear physicist in an old I Spy episode. Green's character has no chemistry with the dour Craig (at one point she tells him that he would be more of a man than anyone she ever met if he were whittled down to just a smile and his little finger ‚Äì a peculiar inventory since Craig never seems to smile during the course of the entire movie) and it is difficult to accept many of the plot turns that result from the romance. The film also provides one of the least charismatic villains in Bond history in the person of Mads Mikkelsen, a quiet man whose only quirks seem to be bleeding from his eyes and a propensity for graphic displays of cock-and-ball torture (where is Goldfinger's laser beam when we need it?).",2,22,41,23 November 2006
