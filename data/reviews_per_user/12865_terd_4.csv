The Blair Witch Project," Better than any horror film I've ever seen.
","This film was better than any horror film I've ever seen. Forget The Exorcist. Forget The Shining. Forget The Changeling. This film is incredible! I saw it at a preview last night, and I was more than surprised at just how good it was, even though I already knew what to expect. My girlfriend sitting next to me said that she closed her eyes during the frightening scenes- I told her that she didn't miss anything- It's not what you see in this movie, it's what you hear. The soundtrack totally flattens you. One of the best moments is when one of the characters is chasing something in the darkness at full speed, screaming, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?' Most horror films try to effect you with various gothic lighting schemes, or all sorts of hyperbolic visual effects. Poopoo. This film lets you imagine what you're seeing without making it seem like a trick. The most powerful thing about this movie was effect of the ending- you're really left with a feeling at the end of having to figure it out for yourself (which I can't explain without giving away the ending). And because you have to think back on what you just saw, the film really starts to creep up on you. I've never had that happen in a film before- an after effect. I'd definitely  reccomend this film to anyone. GO SEE IT! GO SEE IT! GO SEE IT! The last fifteen minutes of this movie were some of the most intense I've ever seen. GO SEE IT!",10,1,2,25 June 1999

12 Monkeys," Maiming a sci-fi classic
","One of my favorite films of all time is Chris Marker's LA JETTE.  In half an hour and in french, that one movie did more to refine my ideas and understanding of science fiction than almost anything else to date has. This, of course, colored my view of Terry Gilliam's very disappointing 12 Monkeys.  I have to say that for anyone who can sit down and watch both films, there is little room for comparison.  The script for 12 Monkeys was surprisingly good, but what ruined it was the way that Terry Gilliam handled it.Usually, Gilliam's parabolic treatment and direction fits in well with silly or comic works like 'Time Bandits', 'Brazil', 'The Fisher King'. These are all films that I really love, but what I don't understand is how Gilliam's direction in the film is how he never bothered to try and make the audience believe that the protagonist might actually be imagining any of his experience, which is what the script is all about.  Gilliam seems more interested in the visual gadgets and silly images he can create- like the gigantic, ridiculous ball that the scientists question him through, or the dizzying views of a mental hospital, seen through a fisheye lens.  One of the most important moments- when Bruce Willis bursts in on a patient entering an MRI machine that looks strangely like the time travel device he entered- falls completely flat, since it is shot in a completely subdued, flattened manner.  Gilliam must have dropped his fisheye lens on the floor.For anyone even vaguely intrigued by 12 Monkeys (as I most likely would have been, had I not seen LA JETTE), please do check out LA JETTE at your local video store (yes, even Blockbuster Video has it).  The only criticism that anyone can have of it is that it moves a little slow, but I strongly believe that you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Null,0,0,25 February 1999
Cube," science fiction as allegory
","Fun, short film that reminds me of the creative power of the old twilight zone and outer limits episodes.  Not full of the sort of didactic crap that poses as science fiction these days, Cube is an allegory in every way. Back before science fiction was all about moralizing or political debates cheaply disguised as 'future settings', projects like cube could be made that simply offer a concept.  With the seven characters trapped inside a cube, trying to unlock the mystery of why they are there and how to get out, I was suddenly aware of how allegorical the whole story was, the whole point of solving a puzzle working on two levels (the scientific puzzle and the human puzzle). The characters had simple names and functions, reminding me of the characters in Stalker (writer, scientist, stalker).  Definitely an interesting film, and a must see for anyone who gets tired of going to the movies to watch Keanu Reeves blow up something for god and country.",9,0,0,29 March 1999
