Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Please don't go ,save your money
",What a disappointment.Total waste of six quid.I am usually immune to these adverts with the funniest film ever tag on it.I thought that this might actually be quite good i was wrong.I guess how it works that the reviews at the beginning of IMDb users review are written by Sasha Cohens friends from Beverly Hills.What i don't understand is how most of the critics gave it rave reviews as well.Have only been to the pictures twice in about two years.Last picture i saw was V for Vendetta.That is what i call a picture this is just a waste.Cant think of anything else to take up ten lines.So all i will say is please don't go save your money.I really mean it don't go.,1,16,52,3 November 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," I think we have been had.
",What a disappointment.The matrix really should have ended after the first film.They strung it out too long and ended up scaping the barrel at the end.The second film was passable but this one was a mess.They just threw everything in to the pot and as we didnt understand it anyway it didnt matter.I think releasing this at the same time over the world to combat privacy may not have been the only reason.They did the same with the Avengers a while back and what an awfull picture that was.I think i can say if you want to avoid a terrible movie this is truly the one.,Null,0,0,6 November 2003
Saw," very good with a message
",Overall i thought it was very good.It gets straight into the action from the first minute no messing about.Okay the acting wasn't that great but it held my attention.Getting a bit sick of this fast camera work that every film seems to have now.Also i thought the scene where Danny Glover was chasing the killer in the car was hilarious.It was like something out of Benny Hill.Towards the end it got a bit far fetched but then again what movies aren't.I thought the movie was just as good as seven.The first serial killer movie i have seen with an uplifting message.As the Doctor realises at the end what he had was perfect.Basically appreciate what you have gotand don't take life for granted.,Null,0,0,5 October 2004
The Happening," I see dead screenplays
",Oh dear oh dear that was bad.M. Night Shyamalan the Orson Welles of our time.Hopefully that was the final nail in his coffin and he never gets another chance to inflict such suffering on an audience.During the movie i had an idea for a screenplay.The movie starts with people committing suicide in a cinema.On further inspection it is discovered it is only M. Night Shyamalan later films that have this effect.The theory is the cinema screens have banded together to kill all the audience who have given the director another chance. So all i can say is please don't go and see it don't even download it.It is over now just a natural occurrence and things are back to normal now and will not reoccur as a final scene rip of 28 weeks later.,1,5,12,1 July 2008
Cloud Atlas," Loved it
","I was a bit worried about the film dividing opinions.Some people said it was boring or that it was a mess.Maybe having read the book gave me a head start on people who had gone into cold.All i can say for a film that length it held my attention pretty much all the way through.Only about two scenes i didn't like that probably lasted 5 mins.The breakout at the end of the nursing home story and the daft punch up in the pub.Also the few minutes chase scene in the Lousa Rey Mystery up to when the guy shoots the dog.Apart from that i thought it was fantastic.Well done for the directors making the movie and i hope their backers make their money back and more for taking a risk.The funny thing about everything being connected is if Natalie portman had not given the book to the Wachowskis when making V for Vendetta this film would probably would never been made. Then again if the Matrix had not made as much money it might have been a great stand alone picture,and we wouldn't have got the pointless money grabbing trilogy it became.",10,3,6,22 February 2013
