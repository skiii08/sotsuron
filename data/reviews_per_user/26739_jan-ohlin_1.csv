Mission: Impossible III," Who did what? Does anything make sense?
","First, for the record: I enjoy a good action film! There was lots of action I'm MI3, and the sound was great. But what happened to the plot? It didn't make sense! Where did the 'Rabbits foot' go? Did I miss something? No... Ethan/Cruise drinks something from a vial, and thats it. Next scene is the torture/execution that also started the whole thing. The nice boss turns out to be bad, OK, and the bad boss is the good one in the end... OK, but did it connect? OK, from the top: The intro scene is supposed, by tradition, to be spectacular, and hopefully connect to the rest of the film. Well, here it's merely kind of 'This was a strong scene let's put it first as well', out of order, and juxtaposed for maximum effect, beyond acceptance if you ask me. Bad guy: '...10' Blam! / Over to: Party party - happy Ethan getting engaged. Supposed to be disgusting and it is. And when it happens again, the shooting scene, it turned out somebody else got shot, of course, not the real wife, just some woman we don't care about... hello?But the real problem is the plot, where did the what-ever-it-was go?And the end, the Happy End, was simply too much, the concentrate version of happyending, Boss is kind, wife meets his friends, everyone laughs, hugs, they leave in slo-mo as the friends cheer in the background...?! Sorry, too much, too stupid, too bad.",1,6,10,28 May 2006
