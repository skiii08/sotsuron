Hereditary," Bewildered
","I am certain that a 'scary' film is meant to be scary? Having just left the theatre, I can still hear the audience laughter at some of the 'scary' scenes.To say that there was any suspense is laughable. I don't think I've ever spent 2 hours and 7 minutes less enthralled at anything. This film was slow, very slow, pointlessly slow. I am informed by other reviews here that the film exhibits the whole gamut of human emotion and senses. Having seen it, the only emotion I feel is annoyance at wasting time and money on it. And the only sense of mine that was teased, was my patience.I am bewildered by the storyline and am left with a feeling of mild annoyance at being duped into seeing it by misleading and, frankly, entirely inaccurate reviews on here.Or maybe I saw a different film from everyone else ............",1,135,273,16 June 2018
