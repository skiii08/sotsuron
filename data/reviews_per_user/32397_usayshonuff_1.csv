National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Wait until it is on late night cable...and absolutely nothing else is on
","This is my first ever comment on a movie. Most movies I leave alone after viewing, so others can make an honest opinion for themselves. I would have to say that I have a very high tolerance for movies, but this one had me writhing in my seat in agony.This movie goes astray from the very beginning when they try to make the main plot for the film in that the Gates family name is tarnished by the new accusal of his great grandfather's participation in the assassination of President Lincoln some 142 years ago. Well even if great grandpops was involved, WHO CARES. The reality is that this plot was so weak that not even 1/2 way into the flick it switches gears and goes a totally different direction. That was a good idea, but not good for viewers. The story then takes them to improbable locations to get clues that there is no way in hell they would ever be able to get to in the capacity that the did. Whatever...it's Hollywood, i let slide. THe thing i couldn't let slide is the way they find the keys to problems they run into. This is where the writers spent the least amount of time. They realized that in order for the movie to flow, they couldn't waste lots of time explaining how the problems were solved. The problem with this is that for the audience, there is absolutely no buildup or suspense moments from the sluething (just ask McGuyver). In my eyes, it is these non-action moments of revelation that can glue entire films together, and when the glue is of poor quality it ALL FALLS APART. There are so many things wrong with this film, that I would just bore you (and myself) with all the details. This is one of the few films that I wanted to walk out of (x4), but I stuck it out to the very very very bitter end. My recommendation is to save your hard earned money for a real movie, maybe a movie with an original script.Thank you for listening.",1,14,29,30 December 2007
