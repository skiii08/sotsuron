Iron Man 3," I feel sick
","I loved the first two Iron Man movies and almost anything else Marvel has done. This movie felt like it was made for TV. I haven't been this disappointed since Star Wars Episode I. The worst part is Iron Man 3 didn't have a 'Darth Maul'. There was absolutely nothing great about this movie. If Thor 2 is this bad, Marvel is in serious trouble. Nobody is going to risk paying to see Winter Soldier in the theater. I'm typically easy to please with movies. I'm one of those people that likes almost every movie I see to the point of annoying people. This movie was horrible bottom of the barrel stupid. The thing that angers me the most is the fact that the previews looked great! If this movie was what the previews pretended it was, I would be giving this movie a 9. I have never seen previews this deceptive. It wasn't even a decent popcorn movie. It was just bad.",1,1,4,26 September 2013
The Great Gatsby," This was a good movie, but...
","My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It's definitely worth watching. Don't get me wrong.But...I hated the obnoxious over use of 'Old Sport' and the out of time soundtrack. Gatsby had Rap, Hip Hop, and Techno music playing at his parties in the 1920s. A really stupid thing to do if you ask me. It helped ruin the overall mood of the movie.The scenery/style was accurate and breathtaking. As with all new movies far too much CGI was used to the point of some scenes looking more the Roger Rabbit than reality. Most of the scenes when he was driving his car looked like a cartoon.At the end I felt like I just watched a really great movie, but it could have been even better with music from the correct time period and less CGI. I would have given this movie a 9 instead of a 7 if it hadn't been for that.",7,0,2,27 September 2013
