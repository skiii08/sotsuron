The Lobster," Bizarre for the sake of being bizarre
","This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. The people that like this movie are the same people that like a piece of art comprised by monkeys smearing their crap on canvas. If you would view this art as brilliant for it's avant-garde sensibilities, you would love this movie. Every opportunity is taken to be intentionally bizarre reaching for some newfound art form that apparently is intended to appeal to those with only the most refined tastes that the common man couldn't possibly comprehend. Being one of those common people, nothing made sense. However, there are laughs to be found -- laughing at how ridiculous everything is and at the thought of how someone could watch the film and find it entertaining.Beware of the good reviews, these are coming from the same people that were high when watching or worse, they just simply like monkey crap.",Null,4,7,14 August 2016
Children of Men," Most overrarted movie of all time?
","Wow! I've never been so let down by the user ratings on a movie before. Warning! Spoiler to follow: This movie SUCKS!Admittedly, I skipped over this movie when it came out because the storyline synopsis didn't appeal to me. But it showed up in a list of all time greatest sci-fi movies so I checked it out on IMDB and saw the great reviews so figured I'd give it a try. Wish I hadn't. Watching it to the end was painful -- like poke me in the eye with a stick painful. The only thing that kept me going was the thought that something spectacular happens near the end to warrant the score on IMDB -- but it only got worse. Save yourself 2 hours of your life and don't watch this one -- despite the reviews.",Null,1,10,3 February 2018
