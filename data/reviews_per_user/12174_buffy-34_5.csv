The Blair Witch Project," Creepy, so creepy
","This is not a horror movie about gore, despite the title it isn't even about the Blair Witch after their second day of filming. It's creepy because it deals with raw human emotion, paranoia that sets in after you can't take being scared anymore, people so afraid for their lives that the slightest crack of a twig sends the into a babbling rampage. This movie feels real, and that's why it's creepy.I've read some comments here and I'm very surprised at other's ignorance. This movie is not supposed to be 35mm quality. It's supposed to look like 3 college students running through the woods with a camera turned on. Yes it's going to be shaky. It's supposed to look like a documentary, and it does. The scary part is not supposed to be the Blair Witch, so don't get disappointed when you don't see her. The movie is about the emotions and fears of the three students who desperately try to find there way out of the myriad of trees. Anyone who finds this movie dumb because it doesn't make you jump out of your seat, you don't get to see the Blair Witch, because it was shot on video, or just because you say it's dumb for these people to be running through the woods yelling for each other, I feel very sorry for you. Your ignorance has prevented your mind from realizing how truly creepy it is.So much credit has to go to these actors. They all did such great jobs on conveying what it's really like to be scared to death. Their paranoia and hysteria added to the freakiness this film already had. I can only hope movie rolls come in quickly to these three. Hollywood could use a few more really talented people.Finally, the last 10 minutes of the movie will forever be etched in my mind. Try going to sleep after seeing that. I know it took me forever just to be able to close my eyes last night!",Null,1,1,9 August 1999
Coyote Ugly," Coyote Crappy
","Have you ever sat in a theater watching a movie so boring that you wanted to scream? Or so clich√© and contrived that you wanted to puke? Go see Coyote Ugly and you'll be slapping yourself like I did.I honestly wasn't expecting anything special, but I definitely thought I would get something better than what I saw. So Violet wants to move out of her small town to pursue her writing career in music (yawn, been there, done that) only to realize that when she gets in New York she's going to have to do more than try to hand over tapes at record companies (You think!) It actually comes up that she's going to have to pay rent (Gee, wonder why she never seemed to have thought about that before)After seeing three girls 'winding down' after a night at their job, she gets a job there. And that's when I thought the movie might pick up. I'm a girl so I'm not really into that boobs and butts scene, but at least the bar was a cool setting and had the potential to pick up a little speed and actually get interesting. Wrong I was. The bar scenes were few and far between and some of them were kinda dumb. (i.e. let's make the rowdy crowd calm by me singing)By the third act, the main character has so many things happening to her that didn't even tie in with the resolution of her fear of the stage that it made me feel ill. So finally Violet gets a gig and somehow her boyfriend learns the building and knows where the power switches are so he can turn them off so she won't see anyone and get stage fright. Then her perky voice is heard and somehow, even after the main power switches were cut, the stage lights come back on. And when you finally think the trite c**p is over it cuts to the bar and you get to see the worst scene in the movie: the one with Leeann Rimes signing on top of a bar. And I thought the price of admission was scary!Save yourself from this movie. Unless of course you like predictable, cliched, fuzzy movies, and have time and money to waste. I will give the proper dues to the directing though, it was the best thing about this movie.",Null,9,19,15 August 2000
Moulin Rouge!," You'll be dumb with wonderment
","Since the opening of this movie, I've seen it four times. I own the soundtrack and an original movie poster. To say I like this movie is an understatement. I wanted to see it since I saw the trailer. But being as how movies have really sucked as of late, I had really no expectations except that it looked promising. This movie is more than promising. I'm not going to say it's the best movie ever made, but it's the most creative and beautiful movie I've seen in years. I realize that not everyone will like it. People have different opinions, but I thought it was great. I've never been a fan of Nicole Kidman, but she was absolutely fabulous in this movie. I don't care what anyone says about her performance, because it was OUTSTANDING. As an actress I know how hard emotional scenes are and she handled them with grace and made it seem that she wasn't acting at all. Ewan McGregor also did a commendable job. Both actors have singing voices that could soothe you to sleep. True, the songs weren't original, but as one critic said, it seems the songs were written just for this movie. Every familiar song you hear, every lyric, seems to go right with the storyline.This is a great movie. Not for everyone, but definately for me.",10,0,1,24 June 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," Brilliant
","I loved this movie. It breaks the mold of what movie standards have been as of late. To me a lot of it has been the same things repeated with different character names, but this movie is different. It deals with raw human emotion and the confusion life can put you through.All the actors in the film did great. They couldn't have put together a more perfect cast. But, although everyone was great, only three stand out in my mind. That would of course have to be Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, and the underrated Brittany Murphy. They all did amazing jobs. Angelina Jolie deserves to win any nomination she receives.",Null,1,1,14 January 2000
Scream 2," Could have been better
","I have to admit, Scream 1 was the first horror movie I had seen in the nineties. They frightened me to death and I almost didn't go to see it; but I did. Scream 1 was a great movie I loved it. i've now seen it so many times, I know the lines. Then Scream 2 rolled around. I went and saw it and left the theater in disgust. I couldn't believe that that movie was brought out by the same people who did so well the previous year. Kevin Williamson's work so far has been much better. I think there was only two scenes that I really liked. 1. Sorority Girl get's it. Sarah Michelle Gellar was great. She had the best death scene in the whole movie. Go figure: a minor character gets a better death than someone we all loved. And the other scene had to have been the cop car scene. It was pretty tense. But the amazing cast of Scream 2: Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Jamie Kennedy could not save this movie. Scream was loaded with a lot more action, suspense, and by the end of Scream the whodunit factor was killing me. But in Scream 2 when they revealed who it was, I didn't care. Why? Because I had no idea who the stupid people were!",Null,0,0,2 January 1999
