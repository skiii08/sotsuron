The Finest Hours," A Poorly Made Film About a Great Story
","I was so looking forward to watching this movie. I'd heard the comments about all the nominations for awards and so it has been on my most wanted list.Chris Pine is one of my favourite (English/Australian spelling) actors, as is Casey Affleck, and that big Scot, Graham McTavish, what a real let down from Game of Thrones and Outlander for him.It was such a shame to see so many great performers being undervalued by lousy direction. Every element for a terrific suspense filled drama was there waiting for the right direction and timing. Instead we got left with all the high drama being dawdled up to and then let slide down the other side with a whimper. Even the music score was no help. Chris Pine looked like he just wanted to sleep and I can understand that it probably was his frustration with the director. He had next-to-nothing to do. Into The Storm this wasn't, but it could have been and maybe even better. Too bad, so sad.",6,1,2,15 October 2017
Elysium," Great Potential Destroyed by Crap Camera Work
","Good idea, great graphics/CGI, some reasonably good acting (by Jodie and Sharlto, Matt coasts), music pretty good too, when you remember to unscrew your brain to hear it.Camera work was the absolute pits. Intensive, insensitive, incessant, intrusive, ill-performed, obsessive, obstructionist, obscenely over-the-top, eye-gouging, brain mashingly horrendous.So much is movement that forced most action scenes out of focus and difficult to watch. I'm was really glad I used a free pass to see this because I would have been screaming for a refund otherwise.Can't wait to get it on Blu-ray.",4,4,8,21 August 2013
Blade Runner," Bladerunner 4K Atmos
","Everything that could be said about this movie has been said and many times over. It still is one of the best made movies of all time, why? Just 'cause it is. Over the years I have purchased every new version that was released, starting with laser disc to DVD, to Director's Cut and eventually Final Cut. When it was released on Blu-ray I bought that too. All because I wanted to see this movie in its best possible mode.Now I also have it in 4K UHD with a remixed Atmos soundtrack. Whilst I use a 4K UHD player I only have a 1080p HD projector and TV. I bought the 4K player because there are still too many titles that release the Atmos version only on 4K. I like big sound, which brings me back to Bladerunner 4K.Even in down-scaled 1080p the vision is spectacular. It's better than the Blu-ray. It may be my imagination but I believe the higher resolution has improved the level of visible detail, even at 1080p. I can only imagine what it would be like to see this through a 4K projector.The remixed soundtrack in Atmos, WOW! It expands the movie so much, it is as the ad says, totally immersive. For no other reason, the soundtrack alone has justified the purchase.",10,1,3,15 October 2017
