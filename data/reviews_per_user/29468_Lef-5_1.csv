The Blair Witch Project," Waste of time & money
","Do not spend your time and money on this film. This must be the worst movie of all times.And I am still trying to figure out, why some people find this movie scary. Unless they are afraid of their own shadow. As for me, I already set the DVD on fire.Still I have to congratulate the 2 directors. Not for the film, because like I said I believe it is the worst film ever made. But because they managed to create all this hype about this peace of crap and make a fortune out of it. I suggest to them to quit directing and writing and start working on advertising. Because they are true masters at that.Who knows, if I give to them a home video of mine, they could turn it into a bigger money maker than Titanic...",1,2,4,19 December 1999
