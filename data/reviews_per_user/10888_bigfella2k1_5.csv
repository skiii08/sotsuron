Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Outstanding
","(Contains Spoilers) Well, after waiting first till February, then March, and now mid-April to finally see how this revenge fantasy plays out, I finally saw it last night, and guess what? This blows away Vol 1. for me. The characters are more fleshed out, we finally understand the Bride (and Bill's) motives for revenge, and believe it or not, Tarantino ultimately delivers a love story (albeit a sick, twisted and massively dysfunctional one.) Michael Madsen was amazingly sympathetic as Budd, an 'alkie loser' you feel sorry for because he realizes he deserves whatever he gets. I loved Daryl Hannah's evil Elle. I haven't liked her in a movie like this since, well, ever. The fight scenes are sparser than in Vol 1, but the Budd/Elle/Bride showdown is definitely worth the wait. (Don't open the suitcase!) Again, Tarantino pulls out his bag of cinema tricks- we get scenes with rear projection, shot in b/w, grainy color stock for the kung fu scenes, credit fonts from the thirties, etc. The final showdown is surprisingly brief, but still satisfying. Uma Thurman has never been lovelier, and the movie holds up well on its own as a separate piece from Vol. 1- amazing. This and the Dawn of the Dead remake are my favorites so far for 2004, but it's hard to see how anything could surpass this. 10/10.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Great End-Of-Summer Movie (mild spoilers)
","Had the fortune of seeing this the day after Labor day (furlough day) in an almost-empty theater. Loved the titles, the music, the storyline....Tarantino is already pretty well known for tense scenes but this movie is packed with them, and surprisingly less gore than expected, save for the last 10 minutes and the 'scalping' scenes. One of the main action sequences the movie hinges on lasts only about 10 seconds of screen time, which gives the movie a great feeling of existing in real time, in the moment.Great performances all around, especially Pitt (who seems to be playing a variation on his Thelma and Louise character) and Shoshona, the heroine and movie buff. By going against audience expectations (140 minutes of expletives and flying Nazi body parts), Tarantino creates one of his most fully imagined worlds yet. And I love the use of subtitles and the actors speaking primarily French or German (or bad Italian)- one of the characters even taunts the Americans for speaking only one language.Entertaining completely. One of my favorite Tarantino movies, better than Jackie Brown, not quite as good as Pulp Fiction. A grower for sure.",9,4,11,8 September 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Great story, but Keanu still can't act
","Well,the trilogy is finally over- and although some people have been griping about the somewhat vague ending, I can't think of any other way that would have brought a satisfying resolution to the story- which is left wide open for a sequel in the future (although they should really just stop here.)What I liked: The Zion Attack scenes were amazing, there's no padding in the first half hour like in Reloaded,unexpected character deaths,the final Agent Smith battle put the Burly Brawl to shame, and the whole train station scene was touching and well thought out.What I didn't like: Keanu still can't act, Morpheus and Persephone had nothing to do, the confrontation scene with Bane was ridiculously stretched out.This was far more satisfying than the last installment, although everyone should really watch all 3 movies in a row before they start griping about it. The philosophy elements were toned down as well, but still intriguing (The Merovingian's 'cause and effect' view, versus Neo's 'free will/choice' view.) My Score: 8/10",8,2,4,9 November 2003
Spirited Away," Indescribable, dreamlike
","I just saw this in the theatre last week, and was completely blown away. Just saying it's a good anime doesn't do it justice- face it, it's a great movie, period. Everything about this movie shines. The wonderful animation style and backgrounds, the bizarre but compelling plot, the sympathetic main character (although she is annoying at the beginning of the film, we grow to like her as her character grows in turn), the great musical score- I can't pinpoint one flaw here, although some scenes are a little intense for small children- I'd say Ages 8 and up for this one. It honestly felt like being transported to an insane but compelling dreamworld. And for those who complain about the story or lack of explanation behind some of the elements, who cares? Does a dream have to make literal sense to be enjoyable? Of course not.Rent this movie now. If you have an open mind, you won't be disappointed.",10,0,1,24 April 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Who says this movie ain't deep? (Spoilers)
","Very interesting sequel to the classic original. My friends and I were talking after the movie ended about the layers of philosophy at work here: if, as the Architect says to Neo, he has saved Zion 5 times before, and Neo was really never meant to save anyone, but instead was being used as another system for control ('religion' facilitating that control, then free will has been a joke in this world until that point. Consciously choosing a different path is the first real act of choice, and cannot be undone (as evidenced by the Architect saying 'you won't see me again.') So, the revolutionary/messianic aspect of Neo was used by the system as a means of control. This is similar to Foucalt's contention that leftist groups consolidate the power of the state and lend it legitimacy. If the average person sees a leftist group or demonstration, they themselves are less likely to act, as they think that 'Someone else will do that.' Therefore, the state contains dissent by encouraging dissent: the trappings of revolution are used to ensure the continuation of the state. Wow. What other movie has references to Greek mythology, Shakespeare, and Foucalt? People who didn't like this movie should give it another chance- it really is as deep as the original, you just need to process it all. I agree, though, that the Zion scenes are talky and boring. The movie doesn't really get going until the enter the Matrix. Can't wait for part III!",8,0,0,23 May 2003
