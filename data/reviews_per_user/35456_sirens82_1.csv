The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn is Intense and Well Worth Seeing
","Please go see this movie!!!! Sometimes critics can be so cruel. The Twilight Saga is a series that either makes you a fan or not. For those of us, who are fans; this movie is well worth the time to see. Bill Condon did an amazing the job portraying the first half of Breaking Dawn. I laughed, cried and squirmed through out the movie. The last half of the movie, literally had me at the edge of my seat. Beautiful job done by Robert, Kristen and Taylor. It is a must see!! Please do not listen to the negative reviews on this movie, go see it and judge for yourself. You will not be disappointed. I am waiting for Part 2 next year.",Null,3,11,19 November 2011
