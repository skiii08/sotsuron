Ford v Ferrari," Outstanding work from Bale as usual
",Since Bale is there in it you always expect something new from him and so he did in this movie too... Bale played the character of the legend Ken Miles who wheeled race for Ford and here he showed how he outrages all the problems that came between him and the track... Ken was also a veteran so Bale also tried to potray that time to time in this movie,9,0,0,5 May 2020
