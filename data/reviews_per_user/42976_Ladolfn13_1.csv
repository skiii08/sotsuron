National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Has excitement, mystery and humor....
","I love a good, exciting and mysterious movie where you try and guess whats going to happen next, along with just the right amount of humor, and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Well to me thats what National Treasure: Book of Secrets does. In keeping with the same actors as the 1st movie made it even better, with the addition of some new faces. What I love about both this movie and the 1st one is the blend of comedy along with the excitement, mystery and some danger, how it is put together in just the right places. It not only keeps you guessing, but also makes you laugh too. Thats important in a movie for those of us that not only like intrigue, but also like to have a reason to laugh and smile. The characters do that in this movie just like the 1st one. They mix interesting information about the United States government, with a reason to want to laugh.",10,2,5,30 December 2007
