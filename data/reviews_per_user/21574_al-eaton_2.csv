Spartacus," History vs. Modern Politics
","The release year of 1960 is significant. America was still living in the long and shameful shadow of the actions of the House on Un-American Activities Committee. This was followed quickly both by the Korean War (a struggle for freedom) and the Civil Rights Movement (yet another fight for freedom, but this time in a supposedly already free America). It was noted at the time that all these events had parallels to the wars in the period of the late Roman Republic. Howard Fast set his novel SPARTACUS during that time for obvious reasons. It wasn't just a novel of an ancient uprising, but a political statement on his own times. A few years later, novelist Taylor Caldwell would dedicate her 1964 novel of Cicero ('A PILLAR OF IRON') to the memory of President John Kennedy. She also stated that any similarities between ancient Rome and modern America were intentional.Producer Kirk Douglas' deliberate choice of Dalton Trumbo (a blacklisted American screenwriter) to write the script for SPARTACUS was a bold political move. Douglas' choice of a book source was just as deliberate. Howard Fast was also the author of 'April Morning' a very patriotic and heroic tale of the American Revolution.For an interesting, and different, take on the story of Spartacus, read Colleen McCullough's third novel of ancient Rome, 'Fortune's Favorites' which she insists was based on reliable ancient sources. Here, Spartacus is not an ignorant slave but a Roman officer who, found guilty of a crime, must choose between execution or life as a gladiator. Being a former officer, he is thus able to understand the tactics of the legions sent against his slave armies. The conclusion also shows Spartacus and his wife sailing off on a pirate ship into a luxurious exile in a foreign country hostile to Rome.We should be clear, in our praise and admiration of Kirk Douglas' heroic version of Spartacus, that we are not giving in to an idolized legend rather than the true story of the real man. The script's message is simple and straight-forward (or, perhaps too simple?): tyranny must always be fought and defeated by brave warriors fighting for human freedom. Thus the story of SPARTACUS could be set in any age, especially America at the beginning of the decade of the 60s. Such messages raise up heroic figures, composed of unequal parts of truth and legend. It will never be possible to present a true and accurate picture of the ancient past in movies. Movies create images, shadows - legends. They are not historical truth. They are 'movie truths.' We must be certain that we know the difference.",Null,1,2,20 August 2004
Ben-Hur," History versus Hollywood
","There is no doubt that BEN HUR is a superb achievement in movie making. It is deeply moving (esspecially Miklos Rozsa's magnificent musical score), beautifully photographed and well directed/acted. I think it correctly explores the culture of a dictatorship versus an enslaved people. For certain dramatic purposes, it changes the thrust of Wallace's novel. In the novel, Messala does not die in the chariot race, but is only crippled. Ben-Hur becomes a true Christian by bringing the invalid Messala to view the crucifixion and Messala converts. The theme is that forgiveness triumphs over revenge. The movie changes this in Messala's death scene where the Roman dies still hating his old boyhood friend. No redemption for Messasla, only for Ben-Hur. The original idea is portrayed in the new animated version, with Heston recreating his original role. Secondly, and most importantly, Wyler's movie changes history. It begins with a title card stating that the time is AD 26. We learn from Messala that V. Gratus is arriving in Jerusalem as the NEW Prefect. Five years later, after Ben-Hur returns to Jerusalem from Rome, Gratus leaves and Pilate arrives, just prior to Jesus' trial. (In the film, Ben-Hur is introduced to Pilate at Arrius' party where we learn that Pilate is the newly appointed Governor of Judaea, thus reinforcing the historical error.) In actual history, Pilate ARRIVES in Jerusalem in AD 26; Gratus was Prefect from 15-26 and Pilate from 26-36. Thus Wyler and his writers (while getting a true feeling for the cultural setting) have created their own history to serve their own dramatic purposes. I know some would call this nit-picking (and it was not the first, nor is it the last, movie to adjust history for the sake of a good story), so you have to accept the film as it is: good, solid entertainment with a somewhat fickle regard for history. Note: the new, 4-disc DVD release is the best so far. The film is split onto 2 discs. The original aspect ratio is truer than other DVD/video releases, and the sound has been beautifully recorded. Also, the 1925 silent version is included on a separate disc.",10,0,2,18 March 2006
