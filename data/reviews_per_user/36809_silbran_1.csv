Blade Runner 2049," Surprisingly boring
",I was very much looking forward to see Blade Runner 2049. It's such a cult film for many people my age and I thought you really can't do wrong with a story as interesting as this one. I just came home deeply disappointed. This movie is plain and simple boring. The visual elegance can't cover hollow dialogues and dramatic sound effects are not a replacement for actual drama going on. Some people left early and those who stayed until the end made it clear in comments after the film that they did not enjoy it. In certain moments one got a glimpse of how this film could have worked out much better if only the focus would have been on the relationship of the protagonists. But every time a bit of tension and honest interaction between characters took place it was washed away by clich√© and stylized ambiance. This is an excellent case study for generations of story writers and directors in how to ruin a film.,1,10,19,17 October 2017
