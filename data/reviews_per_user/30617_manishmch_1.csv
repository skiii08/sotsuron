Skyfall," Good execution, but weak plot
","The good stuff - classic Bond opening, a cocky James Bond, less gritty than QoS and Casino Royale and good overall feel of the movie. The not so great stuff - really weak plot. I get it that you don't go to watch a Bond movie expecting perfect logic, but Bond's big plan to gain the upper hand over the villain made no sense.-Spoilers below- The least he could have done was get Q to send some guns and men over. Even the old game keeper being around and having a few guns seemed like a bonus for Bond, without him the entire plan rested on Bond having a couple of magazines for his handgun. Even though Mallory and Q both knew Bond's location and plan in full detail, neither did anything to help him out. And how did Silva know that M would be at the hearing with the minister if his plan to come to England was 'years in the making'Too weak for Sam Mendes and $150mm...",4,3,9,4 November 2012
