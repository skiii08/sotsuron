Hereditary," Never wanted to give any movie 0 stars, until now
","I feel sorry for Toni Collete needing to take this role. I realize it is very difficult to come up with fresh horror executions but don't hype it all up and then rip off other movies. I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did all I could do was groan and chuckle. Some promoter made a boatload of cash, the rest of us have spiderwebs where our movie money used to be. Save your date night stash and look this up on Kodi. Or just go bowling.",1,0,2,8 September 2018
Annihilation," Pretty flowers, angry critters and....
","....painfully slow pacing, oh my. at least for me. Another reviewer said everybody talks so slowly in this movie, for more drama maybe, and I enthusiastically agree! Glad I downed a Red Bull near the beginning. With the estrogenic-laden cast I couldn't help but wonder if adding a little testosterone to the core crew may have added a little more tension to the story. Sorry ladies, At some points i almost wanted to genre this movie as a sci-fi chick flick. Not a terrible movie and the premise is still interesting and would make a great movie some day. This one misses the mark when there could have been so much more. The last half hour or so goes where I didn't think this concept would go, and I'm still not sure whether I liked the wrap up or not. I came out of it with some annoying confusion. CGI is decent and while the flora and fauna may not be in a similar ballpark as Avatar, it was well done without being in your face. The backing track and sound effects fit the movie. Would have been much more impressive in the theatre vs our 40 inch screen.",5,1,2,16 April 2018
