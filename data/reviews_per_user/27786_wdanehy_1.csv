Requiem for a Dream," Misunderstood Movie
","I think the people criticizing the film for being 'style over substance' because of the fancy editing have missed the point. The director seems to be using these effects for a purpose, to portray psychological time accurately, and in my opinion he succeeds. By slowing down time in some scenes or by speeding up events, he is showing us how it feels to be his characters, either under the influence of a drug or in a hurry to the next fix.Also notice that he does not hit us all at once with these devices. He starts out slow and gradually builds to the horrifying climax. I am not claustrophobic but I felt that way during the final 15 minutes all because the movie forced me to understand on a psychological level what was happening.",Null,1,1,9 June 2001
