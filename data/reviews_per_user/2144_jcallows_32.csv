The Incredible Hulk," A Great Tribute to the 70s TV Show
","I loved the way this film paid tribute to the 70s classic. A movie about the Hulk should have some references to Bill Bixby's Hulk and this film had them. It was great to hear some of that music again, see Banner do the lonely walk and see him being given radiation in the way that was done to Bixby. We all loved the 70s version, so why stray too far away from it? The filmmakers had the good taste in deciding not to.With the tone set to more like the 70s show and less like Ang Lee's version, this film was instantly engaging. And along with an interesting story, gripping action and great special effects, this film was thoroughly entertaining. I also liked that it explained how the Hulk has always been able to keep his pants on. I'm not sure if it was explained in the comic books or anywhere else, but this was a nice touch.Edward Norton was an excellent choice to play Banner. No one could be more opposite to the Hulk. (I suppose the Jekyll/Hyde character he played in Primal Fear prepared him for this.) And Liv Tyler was fine. But as much as I like William Hurt, he didn't seem to have much energy. Perhaps it was the script, but he just seemed detached.The CGI effects have come a long way since Ang Lee's Hulk. When I heard they were still going to use CGI for the Hulk in this version, I had my reservations. While it can render reptiles and all sorts of creatures fairly well, computers have always had trouble making humans or human-like creatures look real. But it seems they have come pretty close for this film.One thing I would have like to have seen kept in this film from the 70s version was Banner's reason for getting the radiation-- so that he could become stronger to protect his loved ones. Here, this film went with the comic books' version-- to become a super soldier for the military. I liked the 70s version. It just seemed to add more empathy to Banner's character, and it was just plain more romantic.Well, all in all a great film, and I'm looking forward to the next.",7,3,5,5 November 2008
Mission: Impossible III," What happened to the music?
","First off, I actually liked this film. I'd rank it right behind the first and slightly above the second. The story did seem like a re-hash of the first, though. (Does this count as a spoiler?) Anyway, what had helped make the first two enjoyable was the film score which was almost non-existent the third. The use of the original theme in the first two films (especially in the first) enhanced situations where spy activities were done and served as a reminder that we were watching a Mission Impossible film. This theme was missing here. MI:3 was still a good movie, but it could've been better with more music, more of the original theme and more Philip Seymore Hoffman.",8,0,1,8 May 2006
The Hangover," not bad but not funny
","Against my better judgment I decided to see this film because of the success of its sequel and the high ratings here. Surely if a sequel was made for a film, then the original film must've been good enough to warrant that, right? Well... no, it wasn't. I should've remembered the Resident Evil and Scream series. (They just keep pumping these out, don't they?)Anyway, I can't say I was disappointed. I pretty much got what I expected: a bunch of guys getting together to do something wildly stupid so that we could laugh at them. OK, I was hoping for more because of the success of the sequel but, unfortunately, that was it. It was about as funny as watching some guys trying to tip a cow. In the words of Seth from Superbad, 'That's not even clever!'This film could've been funny and the jokes sound funny on paper, but on film, they weren't. I mean, an image of some guys waking up from their stupor to find themselves in the middle of a disheveled room with a chicken and a tiger and no clue as to what they've done does sound funny. So why wasn't it? Probably because there was no chemistry among the main characters. It was just a group of individuals experiencing unusual circumstances. I felt nothing for them.The only time I actually laughed was during that scene where the bearded guy was playing with the baby. That was roughly 20 minutes into the movie and that was pretty much the only, really funny, though somewhat vulgar and tasteless, scene. The rest of the time I was only interested in finding out how the movie would end. I didn't find much humor in this film but it did keep me interested enough to finish watching it which is why I'm giving it a 7.",7,0,2,30 May 2011
John Wick," better than johnny mnemonic
","Well this isn't Reeve's worst film. It's probably somewhere in the middle. It reminds me a lot of those mindless 80s action films that were led by Silvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris.The plot is simple. No problem. This is an action film and there's plenty of it. Think 80s action films but with more gore and intensity. It all looks pretty too. This is supposed to be a fun movie. I get it. But it would've been nice to see more realistic gun fights that showed John Wick's using his entire repertoire of skills to take out dozens of armed gunmen instead of just showing his incredible quickness and ridiculous gun shooting accuracy. I'm not sure how this film got rated above a 7. The film looks pretty but the script is awful and the characters are uninteresting. If you want to watch an action film that's been recently released and are similar to this I suggest watching either Shooter or Olympus Has Fallen. These films are just as violent but are more interesting to watch.",7,1,3,3 February 2015
Gravity," see this in IMAX, but 3D unnecessary
","Four films come to mind when I think about Gravity: Mission to Mars, Deep Impact, WALL-E and, of course, Apollo 13. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.As others have said, this film is visually stunning. It's best to watch it on the biggest, clearest screen you can. An IMAX screen is ideal. 2D is fine. 3D is fine, too, but unnecessary because the 3D effect is used only occasionally.Despite ideas lifted from a certain Brian De Palma film and a certain Pixar film, Gravity is thoroughly enjoyable. As a side note, the similarity between George Clooney's character and Tim Allen's Buzz LIghtyear in voice and appearance is so close I kept expecting him to say, 'To infinity and beyond!'Anyway, back to the movie. The action begins nearly right away and continues nonstop. I've seen 80-minute films that felt like 3 hours. But this 90-minute film felt more like 5 minutes. The action and the immersive visuals will give you the feeling you're on a theme park ride, not in a regular movie. Once it's over, you'll want to go on it again.",9,4,7,5 October 2013
The Maze Runner," almost like a two hour twilight zone episode
","Dystopian. What is that? The word of the decade? I'd never even heard of this word before a few years ago and I'm not sure what it really means and I doubt most people who use it do either. Now I see it at least once a week. I'm still trying to figure out what 'post-apocalyptic' means. That was the popular word in the 80s and 90s for low-budget sci-fi flicks. Anyway, with the title and concept like 'The Maze Runner', the movie 'Logan's Run' quickly comes to mind. There are some similarities. Both movies are about a bunch of young people, stuck in a man-made environment, running to escape death. And in both films, there are people called runners.But this film reminds me more of the Twilight Zone episode where a group of people trapped in a large round room escapes only to find out they were just dolls thrown into a toy bin. Too bad this film is not quite as interesting. Sorry for the spoiler, but, in the end, the kids are indeed human, not action figures.You have to hand it to the filmmakers. They saw an over-crowded marketplace filled with trilogies based on popular teen books and had the nerve to say, 'Me too!' And still they submitted something that offered few original ideas and resembled many of the films of this type that came before it recently. That took a lot of guts.This film isn't that bad. It just feels like it belongs on a Saturday morning along with the cartoons. I still think the Twilight Zone ending would've been better.",7,4,5,13 May 2015
Spider-Man 3," Loved it.
","I just loved this film. It was much better than the second and about as good as the first. The dynamics among all the characters was great. It seemed a lot more natural this time around. There was definitely chemistry between James Franco and Kirsten Dunst. They were great together. The Sandman was a cool villain and Thomas Haden Church was an excellent choice to play him. He was great at playing a helpless, desperate guy doing the best he could in a bad situation. And he didn't have to say a lot to portray this. And lets not forget about the great action and special effects. I loved the way how everything kind of got tied up at the end.",9,1,4,7 May 2007
Cloverfield," Pretty good, despite the gimmicky camera work.
","In this day and age of reality TV and reality TV style shaky camera work, here's another film that just says 'me too' all over it. A cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla pretty much sums up this film. Now I'm not a big fan of this style of camera work but I've been able to put up with it in many of today's films because it's been used sparingly. But this film not only uses it, it takes it to the extreme. I understand this film tries to add realism by using this technique but aren't there other ways to to this? Ways that don't cause migraines?Anyway, despite the occasional headaches, this film is pretty good. I'm especially impressed by the visual effects. The monster and destruction of Manhattan all look very real. I'm especially impressed by the relatively small budget on which this was made. The effects is comparable or even better than those made on a much larger budget. So, the interesting story and characters and kick-ass special effects make this film worth watching.",7,0,1,26 November 2008
Spider-Man: Homecoming," almost amazing
","Spider-Man: Homecoming could've been great if it had been a stand-alone film. Instead, its constant references to the Avengers weighed it down. It's tied so closely to the Avengers it should've been called Spider-Man: The Seventh Avenger.But coming to the rescue were Tom Holland and Michael Keaton. They were great. Also, having Spider-Man be younger, more playful and witty was a refreshing change. I don't read comics but apparently this new depiction of Spider-Man was more inline with the comics than previous depictions.Ironically, if this Spider-Man reboot was supposed to stay truer to the comics, it only did so in some aspects. At least it did get the main character, Spider-Man, right but if you're looking for more, you'd be disappointed. Other characters were changed slightly. Their ages and races were changed. And Spider-Man's suit is now tech created by Stark. It's practically another Ironman suit that does all the work.Despite this film's strong ties to the Avengers, its ham-fisted attempt at political correctness, and a Spider-Man suit that does everything for whoever who wears it, the strong performances by Tom Holland and Michael Keaton made this film enjoyable to watch.Tom Holland was great. Then again, I thought Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were fine too. If there's one thing I've learned from watching all these Spider-Man films, it's that anybody can play Spider-Man.",7,1,5,24 October 2017
Horrible Bosses," As Dull As The Hangover
","LIke The Hangover, the main characters were uninteresting and unlikable and had no chemistry. One was simply annoying. And that guy was Jason Sudeikis. What the heck was he doing there? How did he get the part?Anyway, like in The Hangover, the main characters experienced wildly, fantastic, knee- slapping events. And just as in The Hangover, I just stared blankly at the screen watching these guys try to make me laugh. I saw the cues where I was supposed to laugh but I couldn't. As time passed, it became more and more evident this film wasn't going to get funnier. So now the only thing that kept me watching was to see how the bosses got knocked off. Interestingly, The Hangover had a similar gimmick-- to find out what happened to the bachelor-- to keep people hanging around until the end.Despite my curiosity about the fate of the bosses, the shear dullness of this film kept me from watching the remaining 15 minutes. To be fair, I did laugh a few times. The film started out promising in the first 5 minutes, but just sputtered from there until the finish line (which I didn't really get to.) It felt like there was an opportunity here that was missed. This film had a good premise. Would it be a black comedy like Heathers? Or would it poke fun at the common, mundane work environment like Office Space? I laughed just thinking about it. The actual product ended up being neither and was just poorly executed. It would've been better as a half-hour TV show. In fact, it felt like one-- except it was stretched into 2 hours. Watch Office Space instead. Jennifer Aniston is in that too.",3,2,4,30 October 2011
The Italian Job," definitely better than the first
","I saw both the original and this re-make and I must say that this is much better than the first. Although, according to the DVD commentary, the writers for this film didn't actually see the original before writing for this one, it really looks as if they did and made a conscious effort to improve on it. Because where the original seemed to meander and drag, this one quickly takes you into the story and continues non-stop until the finish. And while the first lacked emotional punch, the re-make added some via the seeking of revenge for death of the team's father figure. And I liked the way how the mini-cooper was introduced by allowing us to see its usefulness early on in the film so that we could understand the team's choice for it in their heist. In the first film, the mini-coopers were simply arbitrarily chosen with little reason as to why. The heist and getaway plan in this film was more intricate, clever and interesting than the one in the first. In short, this is a fast-paced, exciting and smart film. The original was just too slow and boring. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's better.",8,0,2,19 September 2004
Man of Steel," not bad
","Looks like we'll need to wait a little longer for another Superman film to match the standards set by Richard Donner's Superman. But this film isn't bad.It's definitely better than Bryan Singer's Superman. The strengths of this film are what Superman Returns lacked: a great cast, a good script, an interesting story, and a powerful music score.The cast, particularly Russell Crowe, is what saves this film. All are great for their roles. There is even some chemistry between Henry Cavil and Amy Adams, although they don't spend much time together. Unlike Richard Donner's version, this one is less about Superman and Lois than it is about Superman fulfilling his purpose in life.It's hard to imagine a Superman film without John Williams' memorable score but Hans Zimmer manages to come up with something unique, just as grand and nearly as hummable. It's a powerful, uplifting score befitting of a Superman movie with some very distinct themes. Though the score isn't quite as complete as that by John Williams-- not many music scores these days are-- it's very adequate.Of course the special effects are great. But they're nothing we haven't seen before. Some of them seem to have been inspired by the Matrix films. But that's fine. Most big budget films have such high quality special effects than they cannot differentiate from one another simply by special effects alone. They need to have-- do I dare say?-- a good cast, story, script, character development, etc. Fortunately, this film has most of that.I understand this version is supposed to be a grittier, more down to earth Superman. But ironically, it ends up being less realistic than Richard Donner's Superman. It is a little darker but darker doesn't necessarily mean more realistic. It spends too much time on the negative aspects of growing up and too little on the positive. A kid with all those powers can't be all that bad, can it?Also, this film has more of a science fiction feel which takes us even farther away from reality. It presents us with too many alien ideas, strange technology and technical details that we have a harder time to believe the setting is actually present day on earth. All these alien ideas and details should've been kept in abstract terms as they were in Donner's Superman.I would've liked to see more interaction between Superman and Lois Lane. And I would've liked for General Zod to appear in later films, not at the beginning, as was done in Donner's version. With General Zod, a man with the same powers as Superman, already appearing in this film, it's hard to imagine there could be a stronger, better foe for Superman without getting weird. There's talk about other aliens like Braniac appearing in the sequel but I'd hate to see the series go off into the deep end into science fiction fantasy.Basically, Sneider's Superman is a combination of Donner's Superman 1 and 2. Donner's Superman was lightening in a bottle. It appears there will never be a Superman film as good. Special effects do get better in these remakes. Can you imagine Donner's Superman 2 with today's special effects? I'd love to see that. All in all, Sneider's Superman is a good remake. It has a strong cast, good script and catchy original music score. It has most of the elements that made Donner's Superman great.",8,1,5,18 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," disappointed
","I was getting tired of re-watching my favorite movies so I decided to try this one out, as it got good reviews and won some awards. And I'm baffled why. Maybe because it tried to be different? I definitely could see an attempt at it. But different is not necessarily good. It appeared that it was trying to be different for different's sake, not trying to be a good original story.The essence of a good rom-com is the chemistry between the two protagonists. Everything else is just filler. In very good rom-com's, the filler is interesting as well. But in this one, the filler was uninteresting and contrived. And there was a lot of it. It took a good half hour or so before we got to see Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence together. And when we finally got to see that, it was disappointing. They are fine actors on their own but do not have much chemistry together. No chemistry between the romantic couple and an uninteresting story in this movie. So what's it got? Not much.",5,6,12,5 September 2014
Ender's Game," just for kids
","How the mighty have fallen. How did Harrison Ford end up here? It's hard to take a movie about saving the world seriously when it depends on kids, especially kids that are good at video games. Sounds like a story written by a kid, doesn't it?Well, this film looked like a movie made for kids, by kids. I'm sure many have imagined their video game skills would be put into practical use someday. Since the reality isn't the case, they made a movie with a different reality.The kid, or chosen one, looked a lot like Jeremy Renner. The film would've been a lot better had it focused on the kid as an adult and used Jeremy Renner to play him. Instantly I would've taken the film more seriously and even overlooked the cartoonish-CGI, video game appearance of the it.",3,0,2,5 September 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," disavowed again?
","Wash, rinse, repeat. I thought finally this time they'll come up with a story that's a bit more original than the previous four but it didn't happen. If you've seen the first four, you've already seen this one. You can literally just skip to the chase, or rather, the actions scenes, and you've pretty much seen all that's different in this movie from the others. To be sure, the action scenes were great, but outside of that, the movie was slow and dull. This film nearly matches the second as the worst of the series. Interestingly, it was the second that had the most original plot and yet it was the worst of the series. Perhaps that's why they didn't want to come up with anything original anymore. Part five started out promising with a credits intro that was reminiscent of the first and the original TV series and an exciting action sequence to boot but it eventually delved into the very familiar. Keeping a few familiar elements from the first film and TV series makes sense, but do you have to recycle the entire plot? Another NOC list, another betrayal, the IMF is disavowed yet again, etc. The IMF, like the Avengers, is actually causing more problems than they solve. It seems we'd be better off if they didn't exist and I don't think that's the kind of message the filmmakers are trying to send. Perhaps in the next film the writers could come up with a problem that wasn't caused by the IMF themselves. At least it would be more original.Recycled plot aside, this film just seemed slow and uninteresting, despite some spectacular stunts. There was little chemistry among the IMF members and no reason why any of them would care about Ethan at all. And Jeremy Renner, and the other returning actors, were generally unnecessary. It could've been, and probably should've been, other actors playing Ethan's teammates. Because when you see key familiar faces returning, you expect them to do more this time. You expect their characters to grow. But that didn't happen. It was still the Tom Cruise show.I'm curious what they'll do with the number six. Perhaps the sixth time will be the charm.",7,1,4,4 August 2015
Pearl Harbor," can't say it's awful
","Maybe it's because I watched it with little or no expectation, but I thought this film was OK. Great visuals, cool effects and just plain nice to look at. You could've freeze-framed many scenes and used them as wall painting. I loved the aerial shots of the planes flying over the blue ocean through the smoke in-between the burning ships. Really cool. Sure it was a little long, the pacing could've been quicker and the script better, but it was still fun to watch. Maybe it would've worked better as a (big budget) television mini-series. The pacing and sub-plots made me feel like it was one. And the retelling of the events leading up to, during and after the Pearl Harbor attack seemed fairly accurate, except for the side story about the love triangle of course. Even the Doolittle Raid, which I had thought was Hollywood's creation added to quickly give the audience something to cheer about, was an actual event that happened. So, despite Michael Bay's direction, it's a pretty good film. I've seen worse. Between 1 and 10 I give it a 6.",6,1,2,23 April 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," More of the same.
","If you've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you'll find this film very familiar. Like the previous three, this film follows a similar plot: to overcome a series of random obstacles to reach a goal. I suppose the same can be said of most films but nowhere is it more clear than in these. And in this film, the simple-minded goal is to reclaim property that was stolen from these new adventurers. Overall this film is enjoyable to watch and better than most pieces of garbage out there. The graphics is pretty, the action is big and characters are likable. Of course, there is a 'but'. And the 'but' here is that this film suffers from the same two problems the previous Lord of the Rings films had: a disregard for logic and a lack of suspense.I suppose these two problems go hand in hand. Because if logic was used more I'd be more convinced that the characters truly are in danger and feel greater suspense. But unfortunately there are just too many times I find myself wondering, 'Now that he has this weapon/powerful ally, why isn't he using it/him more?' Or, 'Why didn't they do this before? It sure would've saved them a lot of time.' Perhaps the book explains the lapses in judgment, but this film doesn't. Like in the previous Lord of the Rings films, I never get the sense these characters are in any real danger, especially when they always seem to have an ace up their sleeves to bail them out. It seems characters just move from one obstacle to the next. And after witnessing this same ace bail them out time and again, one can't help but wonder, where was he when their home was attacked in the first place? Also, if thousands can't protect their home, how can just 13 reclaim it?This film, like the previous Lord of the Rings films (and the Harry Potter films for that matter), has a habit of doing something I hate. It does what lousy mystery novels do when they bring out a never-before-seen character at the end and say he did it. Whenever our heroes get in trouble, this film conveniently pulls stuff out of thin air to get them out of it, without any foreshadowing or any hint for us to see it coming. And I hate that. Because no rules have been set. And when there are no rules, anything can happen. It can be an escape tunnel appearing out of thin air or creatures magically appearing to come to the rescue. It's just lazy writing. And I hate that.Good films set viewers up for what might happen later. For example, in Aliens, we are introduced to a giant robotic machine being used as a cargo loader, so when we see it later, we are not completely surprised. In fact, we are pleasantly surprised and we appreciate its use in a clever way. It's not something that was conveniently conjured up out of thin air because the writer got lazy.I won't say if anything happens to these characters but I'd be nice and more suspenseful if more characters were hurt or killed. Anyway, despite the flaws in logic and lack of suspense, I still liked it much better than the Harry Potter movies.",8,3,12,18 December 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Weakest of the three but better than Fantastic Four
","If you loved the first two X-Men films, you will not like this one. I walked into the theater not expecting much, knowing a new director had taken over. And I still walked out a little disappointed. I don't understand the high marks this film got. The special effects were great for sure but there was something missing. A story? A good script? Character development maybe? Anyway, with all the amazing special effects and a short running time, I still felt the movie dragged. There wasn't much suspense or mystery or emotional attachment to the characters, except to the ones that already had been developed in the previous films. There wasn't much reason for me to continue watching. Nothing new was added. When the film ended-- and it ended abruptly-- I was left with an empty feeling and wanted to say 'what the...?' And what happened to the film score? It's non-existent! Too bad the series had to end this way. But at least we still have the first two films to enjoy.",7,0,0,30 May 2006
The Mist," engaging tribute to twilight zone
","I liked this film despite the cheesy special effects and unexpected ending. It had interesting characters and good interaction among them. After 10 minutes I was hooked. And then, the strange ending. It was unusual, although not entirely original. It was the type you'd see in a Twilight Zone episode. In fact, the entire film had a Twilight Zone feel. Many Twilight Zone episodes dealt with human nature, mob mentality and twisted irony. This film had it all. Frank Darabont all but confirmed my suspicion he was borrowing from the old Twilight Zone series when he released a black and white version.I'm surprised the producers allowed such an ending. I would have preferred-- dare I say-- a more Hollywood ending, but I still enjoyed the film.",9,0,1,4 December 2011
Kick-Ass," cross between spiderman and superbad with some heathers
","This film took me by surprise. It was strange and unexpected. I didn't know what to make of it yet I enjoyed it a lot. The trailers weren't impressive. It looked like a movie about ordinary people trying to be superheroes. I've seen other movies like that but it was obvious this film wasn't meant to be realistic, with the over-the-top violence and the supposedly ordinary people performing impossible tricks. At first this put me off but as I continued to watch, the more I liked this film. It had likable characters, a great fairytale story, exciting action befitting of a film whose title is Kick-Ass and a surprisingly good soundtrack. There was a lot of Spider-Man and Superbad in this film and a touch of the black comedy of Heathers. It's an odd mix, yet it all just worked.",10,1,4,13 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," it's craptacular
","Let's not kid ourselves. The Last Jedi was made for a particular audience. It just wasn't for the right one. To say the filmmakers tried to carry out an artistic vision with little regard to what anyone else thought is complete bogus. It's obvious the filmmakers were catering to a specific audience. Which audience? A few theories exist. But one thing's for certain, it wasn't the audience that made the original Star Wars so popular in the first place. Let's face it. If this film didn't have the Star Wars name behind it, it would've simply been looked at as a silly science fiction fantasy film for kids. For sure, The Last Jedi was visually stunning and had great special effects. But only kids could be satisfied by that alone and ignore this film's serious flaws in logic, continuity, and storytelling. The Last Jedi also had some of the best acting of all the Star Wars films. Sure it had some great acting, but so did Geostorm. And, no, a second viewing didn't make it any better. That actually made it worse as it exposed more flaws.In conclusion, if you're gonna pick an audience to make a Star Wars film for, why not pick the audience that made the originals so popular in the first place?",3,6,7,17 May 2018
Saw," good but over-rated
","I can't believe this movie is considered to be in the same league as (or better than) The Ring or Final Destination according to the ratings here on IMDb. It shouldn't even be in the same class. When I read that this was originally going straight to video, somehow I wasn't surprised. I agree with the filmmakers in releasing it to theaters because it is a little better than the usual straight-to-video flicks, but just a little better. The story is interesting and the puzzles are clever. But somehow this film is missing something. Maybe it's the casting. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Cary Elwes or Danny Glover, and after seeing this film, Leigh Whannell either. I don't find Cary Elwes interesting to watch. He just seems bland. Danny Glover is again playing the role that made him famous, although without his partner, Sgt. Riggs. Because I still identify him with that role, his presence just lightened the mood up too much in this film. Leigh is a little irritating, but that could be due to his character and the script. But somehow I doubt that. The casting director should've spent more time looking for more interesting actors to watch.Then there are the scenes that are too unbelievable and Hollywood-sy that they lessen the suspense even more. I would've like to have seen the story more dark and tragic.All in all, this film is above average but falls short of being great.",6,0,0,22 October 2005
Thor," well done!
","How could a film about a superhero who's power comes from a hammer be so good? This was what I was thinking before I saw this film so I didn't expect a whole lot. Then I read the reviews and saw that Kenneth Branagh directed it and my hopes were raised. And when I finally saw this film, it didn't disappoint!The casting was great. Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Oudin were terrific. And the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman seemed genuine. Throw in an engaging story, amazing special effects and an awesome soundtrack, which by the way, was one of the better soundtracks for a comic book movie in recent years, you have a great movie.",10,6,12,3 October 2011
30 Days of Night," Conventional Vampire Flick with a Few Twists
","There's nothing new about this vampire film. It's your basic vampire/zombie film about a group of townspeople making that familiar last stand with the usual bittersweet ending. But this was what we came here for, wasn't it?Anyway, sure, these vampire/zombie films have been done before many times, but I'm a sucker for them and can probably see many more for years to come. Still, this film could've been done better.First of all, it just took too long to see the vampires. We have to wait about 30 minutes of setup and dialog to get to them. Now, we all know this is a vampire movie and if you're gonna keep us waiting to see them, there'd better be a good reason. And there wasn't. All that waiting and listening to dialog was just to describe a background that was clear from the start and to develop characters who we ended up not caring much about anyway.But once the vampires showed up, things got more interesting. Visually, anyway. Otherwise it's just the usual monsters running amok killing everyone. It was just cool to see heads being decapitated. I don't think I've ever seen so many heads being cut off in such graphic detail in one film. Pretty neat. But it could've been gorier had the wood chipper been used more. It was shown early in the film as if it was going figure prominently in the ending, but, unfortunately, it didn't.The editing of this film was strange. Or perhaps it was the direction. People would just appear or disappear without much explanation. It was like in one scene someone was wondering 'what happened to so-and-so' and in the next scene that so-and-so simply just reappeared without explanation of what happened in between. Then there was this other scene where the sheriff and his friend had to break from the group to look for another hideout. They struggled to get there as they fought vampires along the way, but they finally succeeded. And in the next scene we saw the rest of the group just appear in the new hideout. They were just sitting there calmly as if they had found safer path or had just been teleported somehow. Pretty odd.The ending was a conventional vampire movie ending, but with an interesting twist.As vampire movies go, despite the slow start, odd dialog, characters I didn't care much about and some strange editing choices, this film had enough gore and suspense and an interesting ending to keep me entertained.",7,8,14,17 February 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Slow and boring.
","It's been a while since I've wanted to walk out in the middle of a movie like I did last night when I saw 'Stranger Than Fiction'. I wanted to, but didn't because my friend insisted that I give this movie a chance. I did and, boy, was I sorry I did. Not a very original story: a cold, structured businessman meets a fun-loving, carefree young woman who gives him something to live for. When he discovers he is just a character in a story that ends with him dying in the near future, he searches for the author to ask her to keep him alive. I'm not sure how this film got such high marks because I saw so many things in it that bothered me. Besides its slow pacing, pretentiousness and its unnecessary inclusion of Queen Lattifah's character, this film failed to explain a lot. How did Harold Crick come to life? If he was a character in Kay's book, what about all the people he met during the course of his life? Why weren't they also characters in her book too? How could some parts of his life be in the book and others not? I'm sure some may think I'm being nit-picky, but if this film addressed these questions instead of trying to be a pretentious, hackneyed film about a man finding more substance in his life, it would've been a lot more interesting.",3,8,17,25 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," it's an ending
","I saw this in the theatre when it came out and wasn't very impressed. It was at least the best of the 3 prequels, but that's not really saying much. But when I saw the high ratings it got here in this website, I thought I might've judged it too harshly and decided to give it a second chance. So I watched it again yesterday. Still boring. Everything I saw in the first two prequels I saw here: weak story and acting, little or no character development and no build up in tension and suspense. There were characters dying left and right. Characters I hardly new or cared about. True, on the plus side, Jar-Jar was left out and Samuel L. Jackson was finally knocked off, but these things happened too little, too late to save this film. Though at times, the special effects were nice to look at, most of the time it seemed like I was watching a cartoon. With the heavy use of CGI and colorful sets and the lack of character development and chemistry, this film probably should've been considered a cartoon.What really bothered me about this film was that everything tied up too neatly to lead us to the next film. It seemed too convenient that within a span of say a few days or weeks or so that Anakin becomes Vader, his kids are born and sent away, Yoda and Obi-Wan decide to go into exile, the emperor becomes disfigured and takes on his current appearance, etc. The way these events happened it seemed as if they were rushed, as if Lucas was approaching a deadline and needed to tie up a few loose ends and end the story quickly. Like the first two films, this one was written with a heavy hand and without subtlety. I would've liked to have seen a few more surprises. Maybe I was a little spoiled by the surprises we got original films. But without them, all we would've got was a rehash of what was already revealed to us in the original trilogy, that Anakin becomes Vader, his children are Luke and Leia and their mother dies. This is what we already knew from the original trilogy and we didn't get much more in the prequels. Without good character development and chemistry, this film could've used a few surprises to maintain our interest. Sure it was a bit of a surprise that the push that Anakin needed to turn to the dark side was the promise of saving his wife's life. But that was weak and didn't seem consistent with how evil he was becoming. What surprises would I have added? I'm not sure. Maybe another reason Anakin was attracted to join the emperor: he out-grew Obi-Wan and longed so much for a father figure he never had that he overlooked his evilness. As for how the droids lost their memory, anything but a simple memory wipe. Oh well, at least it's an ending.",7,1,1,19 June 2007
Wonder Woman," forgettable
","And this is considered one of the better DC films? DC must be cursed. Perhaps my expectations were too high when I found out Patty Jenkins was directing but this film was a big let down.Wonder Woman is a cross between Thor and Captain America but not as good as either. The casting of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor was fine as both actually had good chemistry. Unfortunately, the script was poor and they didn't anything good to say. Add to this a boring, illogical story and average action sequences, you have a huge missed opportunity. Strangely, Thor and Captain America, films which Wonder Woman borrowed a lot from, were far superior to Wonder Woman yet were rated as inferior on IMDb. This unfair rating and the inflated rating of many mediocre films have made me lose faith in the IMDb rating system.",5,1,6,15 September 2017
Midway," excellent war drama
","This is an excellent film with an accurate portrayal of historic events. I had misgivings about it when I had heard the director of Independence Day would be doing it but he actually did a great job at staying true to history while making it entertaining. He didn't simply focus on the heroism of our American soldiers but also covered other aspects that contributed to our success such as code-breaking, strategy and sheer luck. He crammed a lot into a 2 hour film. Many historical names, places and events were mentioned in passing and if you're not familiar with this battle you might miss them. But no matter, you'll still get the gist of this film.The aerial battles were beautifully shot and the attention to historical accuracy was incredible. This film did justice to the code-breaking aspect and treated the Japanese with respect, even though they were the enemy. Because of its historical accuracy, this film could pass for a docudrama. On the other hand, it covered a lot at the expense of character development, although it did manage to focus on a few protagonists.Roland Emmerich's Midway is a historically accurate, beautifully shot film with none of the fictional romantic soap opera that weighed down the 1976 version or Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. It's puzzling that critics didn't like it. Perhaps they forgot this film was a historical drama and there's no room for a fictional event or character to promote their social justice agenda. They complained about the lack of character development. Again, this film needed to cover a lot of history in 2 hours so something had to give. That said, many of the characters were adequately developed, which is more than I can say for The Last Jedi. Oddly, critics overlooked the non-existent character development in The Last Jedi and laughably praised it anyway. Midway is a far superior film and is just another film that's exposed the critics' bias. Ignore the paid critics and take it from me, someone who hasn't been paid by any studio to write this review: Go see this film!",10,4,5,16 December 2019
Heat," good cop movie but a little long
","This movie was good.  I loved the gun fight scene in Downtown LA and Neil's last confrontation with Waingro.  This must've been my fourth time watching it and I still enjoy watching those two scenes. However, much of the rest of the movie could've been edited out. I always thought it ran a little long.  Also, I thought the dialogue could've been better.  Am I alone on this?  Everyone seems to praise this movie as one of the best they've seen.  Am I the only one who thinks the sub-plots, especially those involving the characters' personal lives could've been shortened or eliminated altogether?  And that the dialogue was weak, even during that coffee shop scene?  The pacing was slow and, except for a few scenes, the movie was boring.  The movie was basically a few great scenes strung together by a lot of weak ones.  Despite the movie's flaws, I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the performances of Al Pacino and Robert Dinero.  It's too bad they didn't get a better script.  In short, this is an over-rated film that ran too long and that has a couple of great actors and some good action scenes.  7/10 stars.",7,19,36,14 June 2003
Fast Five," Vin Diesel does The Italian Job
","This is the best film in the series, probably because it borrowed heavily from the recent version of The Italian Job. It borrowed ideas such as deciding to use a fast, nimble car to navigate through a narrow parking garage, creating a copy of the target location in which to practice, obtaining the same safe they will need to crack later, and using street cameras to direct cars through traffic. All of these elements were used in The Italian Job. Oddly enough, rumors had it that a sequel to The Italian Job was going to be made and be set in Brazil but it was never made. Was this supposed to be that sequel? Probably not. A sequel would've had new ideas and this one just had a rehash of old ones.Anyway, despite similarities to The Italian Job, this film was entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",8,2,3,10 October 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," meh
","This film dragged. The story was weak so I was just waiting for the final showdown between the Autobots and Decepticons. I was hoping for something different from the first film but it seemed all the same. I guess you can only do so much with a bunch of machines pounding on each other. This film, like the second one, was a rehash of the first with similar stories and battle scenes. What's new in this film was the lack of chemistry between the lead actors. Michael Bay simply got lucky with the first Transformers. I didn't like any of his previous work until that one. When he got the first Transformers right, I knew he just got lucky, and I was right. We've seen his true colors ever since.",6,2,7,5 July 2011
The Martian," that boy's alive. and we're gonna get him the hell out of there
","This movie is about three brothers sent to Mars. Two die, and one, James Francis Ryan, is left stranded. NASA doesn't want to have to tell the mother it lost all three of her sons so it plans a dangerous rescue mission to save Ryan and bring him home. Well not exactly.The actor and premise may bring back memories of a certain Spielberg film but this movie is actually more like a combination of Cast Away and Apollo 13. (Others have mentioned this.) Throw in a bit of Gravity, Mission To Mars, and Interstellar you have The Martian.Does the feeling of familiarity make this movie bad? In this case, definitely not. Fortunately the Mars setting provides enough new elements to make this film interesting. The science is believable and, according to real scientists, fairly accurate. Matt Damon brings his usual likable, everyman charm. Thinking of films about Mars released over the past couple decades like Mission To Mars, Red Planet, Ghost of Mars, and Mars Needs Moms, this movie is easily the best movie about Mars since Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall. Still, I can't shake the feeling that Ridley Scott must've watched Matt Damon's part in Interstellar and thought to himself, 'Gee, I could turn this into a 2-hour movie' and did. But whatever the inspiration, this film was well done.",8,2,4,26 December 2015
