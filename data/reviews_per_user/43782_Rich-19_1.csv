Requiem for a Dream," REALISTIC, BLEAK ART FILM 7/10
","This film is an uncompromising look at addiction and the price one eventually pays down the road. Director Darren Aronofsky is masterful in the way he uses editing and sound to emphasize his camera images. He has a fresh, unique style that is completely his own. Ellen Burstyn is a wonderful actress and disappears into her character. It's a remarkable performance. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly also excel as two addicted users drawn to each other for their own selfish reasons. Connelly is a risk taking actress and allows herself to be shown in 2 or 3 degrading scenes. But they are essential to her character and the film. 'Requiem For a Dream' is not a fun, entertaining picture. That's not the intent or the point. It takes you to a place and shows you the way these people live. It's real, bleak and does not pull punches. Aronofsky's got one overwhelming message. DON'T DO DRUGS!!!Overall Rating  7/10",7,0,0,23 May 2001
