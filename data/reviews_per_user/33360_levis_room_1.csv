The Avengers," Great movie even the best of Marvel
","I'm Levi from Netherland(Next to Germany),And this movie is also showed in my country And i liked it so much. That's also because i am a huge fan of Marvel movies but this one was until now the best marvel movie. My Favourite avenger is: Iron man( Robert Downey Jr.)because he is funny and just greatNow i have seen that there will be a sequel, And there where questions who will die: I'd say: Iron man because we saw in iron man 3 he don't need that glowing subject( I don't know how its called) Anymore! So there will be going a lot of wrong with Jarvis! But i'd might be wrong! But this movie deserves a '9'",9,2,7,5 August 2013
