The Benchwarmers," I loved it!!!
","I saw this movie last night. Both my husband and I loved it. They COULD NOT have picked better stars to play the roles of their characters. They each played their character wonderfully. There were a lot of laugh out loud parts. When I left, my sides hurt from laughing. The theater was full of teenage kids (I am 27 and my husband is 29) and we all found the same parts funny. It is a film that you can share with your children and enjoy yourself!!! The way the movie ended really left you with a good feeling. I have found that some movies I've seen just leave you hanging and you're sitting there going 'what the heck just happened, it's over'...but not this one. It ends in a very happy way. It also sends a good message to children. I work with high school students every day and there were a lot of messages that this movie sent to show the effects of bullying and that it is not OK.",8,0,4,8 April 2006
