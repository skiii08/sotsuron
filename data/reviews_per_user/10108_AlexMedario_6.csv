First Man," Too much history for just a film. Nevertheless itÂ´s a must see film.
","I liked to review the story again. Of course all of us know a lot about this landing but the film packs together a lot of the events that deserve to be remembered. Even so, my humble opinion is that the films tries to pack too much in two hours. I missed too some images about the ships, too much first-person-shoot. It would have been a good opportunity to recreate the events letting the viewer enjoy som special effects to put us into situation. Anyway, I liked the movie. I'm not fond of the main character actor, but no doubt about his perfomance was superb.",7,0,0,7 April 2020
We Were Soldiers," Too wonderful, men are not like that.
","I cannot believe such a nobility and greatness in soldiers. Men are not like that. This was the first great battle of the war, I suppose soldiers were really professionals and not just poor people forced to fight. This explains the lack of wrong characters as happens in the rest of the big Vietnam films.Nevertheless, it's like the Star Wars films, bad guys seem to be cross-eyed. Because a few scenes depicting the local forces the film pretends to be portraying both sides, but it´s not like that.",6,0,0,9 April 2020
Full Metal Jacket," 'I'm in a world of *, yes... but I'm alive. And I am not afraid'
","Sorry that I cannot include the whole sentence, that summarizes very well the bottom line of the movie. This movie is full of memorable sentences, so is that that I remember a few of them even now after so many years. I watched the movie first time when it was released and a couple of times recently. It has aged very well, I'm glad of having watched it again and my high opinon about the film remains the same.",9,1,1,7 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," Nonsense of war masterfully portrayed
","This film is going to let a lot of images fixed in your brain, and sounds, I've never been able to hear again the Valkiries musica without remembering this film. The Doors music the same, it belongs into the movie. Incredible piece of art in my opinion. After watching again the film recently I recommended it to my elder son, in his twenties, I think that this film is kind of a 'must' if you pride yourself of being fond of cinema.",9,0,0,7 April 2020
Total Recall," Mindblowing future, action and some funny moments.
","A construction worker decides to get a virtual holiday. In this next future the film portrays the way to do it it's just to 'implant' a remembering in your brain. You will remember that you have been on holiday, you'll feel that it's true but you have not the real experience, it's just a few neurons connected. 'But, what it's always the same in all your holidays' the seller of the vacations ask to Quaid, the construction worker. He doesn't know but the smiling seller doesn't make him wait: 'you, you're the same in all your travels'. Quaid is offered to make his vacations really special. He's going to go to Mars, visit the planet, but not as a tourist but as a special agent who is going to fight against terrorist and save the planet from destruction.The plot is really interesting, it's not a specially complicated story, you don't get lost but there are twists enough to surprise you and make the ride a joyful one.Technology has changed the world, so much that even in so recent past as 27 years ago they didn't foreseen the miniaturization degree that communication devices could attain. You see into the movie a few screens with a depth box behind them, the ruler of Mars even get into the phone connected with a cable to the device on the wall.It's nice the hologram device able to replicate a person, and of course the costume-robot Quaid uses to enter into Mars.Excellent way to let a couple of hours go away, and even if you watched it a few years ago it's quite interesting to review it again, how fast time runs, you'll think.",7,1,1,19 November 2017
Platoon," In the podium of the best Vietnam War films ever
","I've watched in a short period Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. It's hard to decide for the best, the three of them are masterpieces. Insanity of war is best pictured in Apocalypse Now, FMJ adds a lot with the soldier training, and Platoon really brings you into the battle like no other.
There are characters in the films that being secondary bring a lot to the movie. I like the trio Lance (in Apoc, the surfer), Rafterman (the photografer in FMJ) and Bunny in Platoon.",9,1,2,8 April 2020
