Iron Man 3," Decent action movie with some good laughs
","Mixed feelings about this movie. The trailer does not match the movie hence I can understand why people are a bit upset, especially those who are into the tradition of marvel comics and want the characters and plot line to be congruent with what they have read.I was expecting an all out action movie, Iron Man bringing to the table a new collection of gadgets, epic scenes and heroics. There was all that but not to the degree some would have wanted.I do feel like the bad guys the Mandarin and Aldrich Killian just didn't seem like 'real bad guys' or guys that you would expect to stand toe to toe with Iron Man in the finale.Though what stands out is Robert Downey Jr's acting. I had quite a few laughs and the comedy played out brilliantly.Like I said fun movie but not one for the purist..",8,3,7,16 May 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," Scaringly realistic in this day and age
","Are we going to act oblivious to climate change?. People are saying the storyline is unrealistic but look what has happened weather wise over the past couple of years. Even more scary was the part where New York got flooded.Something like that happened last year but obviously not to the same degree.The UK experienced some of the coldest winters in the past 50 years during 2009 to 2010.I imagine people who are unaware of their surroundings or whats going on in the world would label this scare tactics.Acting wise the movie was OK, but the whole premise with the north Atlantic drift changing has some scientific basis.go do some research.Furthermore, why watch a movie and whine about it being 100% realistic, no one watches this genre of movie to experience excessively realistic plot lines because they are boring.",7,0,1,9 March 2013
Oblivion," Awesome movie with a good message
","I didn't watch the trailers for this movie hence I didn't really know what to expect. However, this movie contained all the elements of a good old sci fi movie that will have you on the edge of your seat.I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline too, whoever is saying it is unrealistic, walk away and go watch some artsy fartsy b class movie from the sundance or whatever genre you enjoy.On the surface level there is the usual archetype of the hero putting his life on the line and doing what is right. But anyone who has any taste of some of the conspiracy theories going around with respect to the elite (illuminati) backed by aliens to medal with and de-rail man. Well,This movie will really hit home and you will enjoy it.",10,2,5,2 May 2013
Man of Steel," I want to watch it again!
","Many people have their views on what makes a good movie but for me this is a masterpiece.Henry Cavill is the perfect character and very likable, he is a mix of Christopher Reeve but nonetheless provides the perfect blend between the old character and someone who fits in this day and age.Honestly, what is most impressive with this movie is the CGI and fight scenes. Planes crashing, Skyscrapers being destroyed and a fight scene on a freaking satellite out of space. Trust me the avengers, dark knight rises or whatever movie you have on the pedestal cannot touch the raw action of the man of steel.I will take my time to appreciate and savour this masterpiece again, because I was unfortunate that my friend kept adding silly commentary throughout the entire movie!.I don't care what opinion critics have or people who incessantly need to bash the blockbuster movies, Man of steel brought to life my childhood hero and I want to give a big thank you to the cast and crew.",10,3,7,19 June 2013
Marriage Story," A brutally truthful depiction of divorce courts & misandry
",I saw a comment on another platform where someone said they were rooting for both Charlie & Nicole. Are you kidding me??? To have such a view just goes to show the blatant level of entitlement & narcissism among certain women. No its never OK to destroy a man's life . Had the genders been reversed the reactions would have been off the chart.,5,1,6,19 January 2020
Taken 2," Not great, Not Awful 6/10
","The negative comments are a bit too extreme. I guess this movie is living in the shadow of the first taken. First of all , the storyline was a bit shallow. In the first Taken, liam neeson going gung-ho and righteously being heavy handed with the bad guys felt justified . In this one ,Liam seemed like he was being far too heavy handed with the bad guys.I also agree the bad guys looked and acted pretty stupid.It is almost a cliché in Hollywood movies to have bad guys swept aside easily.There was one credible fight scene towards the end where Liam was somewhat tested.There was nothing peculiarly thrilling about the ending.I do feel the character development was lacking, Murads character needed to be stronger and his vengeance needed to seem more believable. I did like the scenery (In turkey) and action scenes (the car chase..etc). But the poor storyline and character development acted as a bit of an Achilles heel.I wouldn't discourage anyone from watching it, overall good fun action movie to watch, One worth going to the cinema for or to have a movie night, but it wouldn't be a memorable one, More like one to pay tribute to taken 1.",6,1,1,26 May 2013
The Croods," All around great family movie
","I have to say this movie is worth a watch for whatever age you are. It will be fun for the younger ones and even older adults. Basically this movie revolves around the age old debate of how to live your life, in fear cautiously(in the dark ie:the cave) or freely with courage (towards the light)?. Basically it may seem the girl EEP is the main character who basically wants to 'leave the cave' and become independent. But it shifts towards the end focusing on Grug who learns to break out his shell and fulfill his desired role better ,as the masculine protector of his family.As it can be seen there are some interesting character development and relatable issues at hand. Nonetheless the Croods manage to blend this perfectly with a humorous and compelling adventure.I had quite a few laughs, it is a special movie and one I would recommended movie enthusiasts to purchase.",7,1,1,9 July 2013
The Martian," Borefest
","I had high hopes for this movie based on the trailer and adverts that I had seen but my god was I wrong. The movie was utterly boring. it is a cliché these days to say 'there was so much potential' and yes there was but there was not much to salvage. The casting was bad, Matt Damon has made a few decent movies but he is no Christian bale, he has very little variance in his character, i mean being stuck out there on another planet you would expect someone to be freaking out,but instead happy clappy Damon is saying he is going to 'science it'. Yeh i suppose if you are into science and the physics behind it you would be somewhat entertained. But from a cinematic point of view there was very little to be entertained by. Very little CGI , very little character development . It came off more as a B movie that you would be aired on TV.",3,47,113,3 October 2015
