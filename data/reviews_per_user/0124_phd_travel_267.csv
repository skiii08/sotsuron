The Devil's Advocate," Pretty good
","This is a stylish supernatural thriller about the temptation of evil for a young lawyer from the South. When he is offered a big time job in New York by big time lawyer played by Al Pacino, he finds there is a price to pay.The cast is good. Al Pacino before he got really devilish looking is good except for the silly dance at the end. Connie Nielsen is sophisticated and elegant. Charlize Theron is moving and convincing as the young wife sacrificing her looks for a standout performance. Even Keanu acts quite well as the young lawyer and you can't say that about too many of his movies.They didn't make it over the top horror - it's clever and frightening without much gore or in your face violence. Along with Rosemary's Baby this is the best NYC supernatural horror movie.",9,7,7,15 June 2013
Ford v Ferrari," Exciting races - story could have been edited and shortened
","This long movie is quite involving and the races are exciting. The in the driver's seat point of view makes the races exciting and the David v Goliath thing always gets you rooting for the underdog. Enjoyable even for non race car enthusiasts. The actors are good from main to supporting. Bale is convincing as the driver. Damon looks suitably tired and puffy as the ex driver turned designer.Some faults - Some scenes could have been cut. The wife's hissy fit could have been cut. Josh Lucas' mini nasty character was over done for the sake of having a villain, Jez Butterworth the screen writer wrote plays that have made it to Broadway and are excruciatingly and unnecessarily long. Don't understand some of the strong accents of Christian Bale and his wife. The movie should have ended right after Le Mans. Less of a downer if they had.",7,5,12,19 November 2019
The King's Speech," Engrossing if not perfect
","I expected to be bored by parts of this movie but wasn't. It's just a speech impediment but they managed to make it moving. You feel for the King and what his burden and duty was. The historical events surrounding are nicely added in like the abdication and coming war. The acting is competent. Colin Firth does a good job as the belligerent but well intentioned king. His stammer is well done not annoying and spontaneous looking. His outbursts may have been a bit overdone and coarse for a King - perhaps for dramatic effect. Helena Bonham as the Queen is more likable not her usual over the top self. Geoffrey Rush is fascinating to watch. The pace and screenplay are good. Guy Pearce was a bit out of place as the Prince of Wales - not aristocratic enough. The actress playing Wallis wasn't ugly enough. A couple of faults. It would have been better to speed up the earlier part of the movie and cover a much longer time period through WWII to show the importance of speeches during the dark days of the war. The score was wrong. Using music of the German composer Beethoven, in a movie about England entering into war with Germany was a wrong choice. I know there aren't that many great English pieces of music but still German? Enjoyed it more than Helen Mirren's 'The Queen' because the scope of the storyline was more interesting. A deserving Oscar win.",7,0,1,7 March 2011
Insidious: Chapter 2," A decent follow up but it's no Conjuring
","It helps to re-watch the first Insidious in case you can't remember it that well because chapter 2 goes back and explains and expands the story and background of the first one. It's pretty grand compared to the first chapter. Quite a few spooky places and lots of ghosts. Surprising laugh out loud hilarity too about the evil ghost! I know it is unfair since they are different movies, I can't help comparing it to the Conjuring which I watched a few months ago and found much scarier and more believable because of the straightforward story. This one just seemed a little contrived and silly compared to it.Patrick Wilson is the Amityville type possessed daddy here and he is okay. Rose Byrne is good at acting frightened. The scary part was watching her being tossed around - she looked so thin she could have snapped.Overall for fans of the first Insidious you get your money's worth.",7,0,2,18 October 2013
The Avengers," Takes itself a bit too seriously
",This is worth at watch but just once. The I wouldn't watch this again. Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.This screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.There is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners. What happened to the charm of the old action hero movies?,4,15,29,28 July 2012
First Man," Could have been better
",This well meaning but flawed movie is still interesting. The screenplay is hard to follow at times. This movie is for people who know a bit about the characters and events already. If you want a clear and thorough depiction of the moon landing watch the series From the Earth to the Moon. The camera work is shaky when it doesn't need to be.This movie doesn't glamourize things. It shows the physical trauma during training and landing.Ryan plays it strong and silent. A bit too expressionless. Claire Foy looks worried as his wife though she is written very assertive for that time. Also her hair style is so severe. Jason Clark as Ed White who was killed is miscast. Looks too evil.The landing is well recreated and the best part of the movie.,5,1,3,11 February 2019
Black Swan," Just too dark - didn't enjoy it
",I understand this was a thriller set in the ballet world and did not expect a 'Turning Point' kind of ballet world movie. But there was too much unpleasantness that it seemed one dimensional. I wouldn't really want to watch this again. They succeed in making one of the most beautiful ballets in the world ugly.There are some good points - like the blurring of reality and fiction was like an actual delusional person. It does succeed in keeping you on edge.The main actors: Natalie Portman does the anguish and fear well she has evolved as an actress. She used to have a high school drama class expressions on her face now she is clearly better and deserves her awards. However physically she does not look like a ballerina. She is bit stunted and doesn't have the lithe long look of a ballerina or an arched back. She didn't really have to train so hard since her dancing moments were actually quite short. But I see why they couldn't use a real ballerina for this role - it wasn't really about dancing.Mila Kunis is a good bad girl but the trashy look is a bit overdone for a proper ballet company - it seemed more appropriate for a Step Up kind of dance company.Winona played her crumbling aging ballerina well could hardly recognize her but wasn't given enough screen time they didn't focus enough on her face. Also her storyline of collapse is a bit exaggerated. Retirement cant be that bad.Vincent Cassel is a bit too unattractive and predatory for the role. He doesn't look the part either - bad casting.Barbara Hershey was quite effective. Her crumpled face was probably the most frightening thing about her.The main fault is the screenplay and story. The sexual elements were just too much and distasteful. About 10% would have been enough. It distracted from the story. It should have had more beautiful elements to contrast with the ugly. Showing things from just one perspective can be limiting. The horror elements were a bit too cringe inducing.Overall worth one watch but just didn't enjoy it.,3,5,9,2 March 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Too much action not enough brains and ludicrous plot
","Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be about clever mystery and crime solving not martial arts action, Mission Impossible style disguises and futuristic plastic surgery. Most of the plot is so impossible for the time period. The machine guns, the plastic surgery, the massive weaponry etc - it's just so wrong. There is little humor and they made Sherlock so beaten up and damaged looking.The good points: the sets art direction provided an atmospheric visually pleasing 19th Century European feel. Old London and Paris were well recreated.Casting: Jared Harris is a bad villain - too rough looking. Too little Rachel McAdams. She was the best thing about the first movie. Noomi Rapace is not pleasant to watch even if she looks gypsy like. Robert Downey's accent is bad and his mumbling is incomprehensible. Jude Law looks haggard and the actress playing his wife is common looking.Guy Ritchie's direction with some sequences so fast you can't see what's going on then silly frozen nonsense just doesn't work.Don't bother with this one it's a dud.",2,23,44,18 January 2012
Captain Phillips," Gripping and real - exceeds expectations
",This true story of 4 Somali pirates attack of a cargo ship is gripping and terrifying and totally believable - allowing you the feel the vulnerability of the unarmed crew and the tragedy of the doomed pathetic pirates against the mighty navy.The acting from the Somali pirates is top notch. Their emaciated look makes them so authentic. Tom Hanks as the titular Hero is suited to the role. I thought he looked tired and puffy in Da Vinci movies but here he is just right. His acting during the last part of the movie is so convincing.Direction is top notch. Shows you everything you want to see without any cheap shock tactics or unnecessarily ugly images. The production on the ship and in the sea are good too.Wish the subtitles for the Somali dialog had been clearer - sometimes hard to see the white words against the background.A must watch - the 2 hours just sped by.,10,4,8,14 November 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Beautifully filmed - but
",I am a huge Twilight fan and I enjoyed it. They did some things really well. There are a couple of faults.Good points: The wedding is lovely. The natural setting in the woods was magical. Liked how they used music from the first Twilight movie. The back of her wedding dress was nice but the front was a bit severe and matronly. Overall photography is quite pretty throughout. The beach house in Brazil is stunning and the beach and waterfall are quite magical. For those who want to see the two kissing you sure get a lot of it. The love making scenes are not over the top quite chaste in fact. The humor when there is some is quite unexpected like what happened to the bed.The makeup and effects used for making Bella gaunt and sick were very convincing. The wolves move quite naturally and don't look too gigantic or CGI.Faults: Didn't like the wolves vs vampires over the baby issue. Felt unnecessary melodramatic and contrived. It feels like much ado about nothing and the wolves were taking themselves too seriously. But I suspect that is a story fault not a fault with the movie making. The Cullen house keeps changing in appearance - I know they switched houses but it just looks too different. The whole birth was kind of gross and gory with all the blood and stuff. Bella's suffering was too drawn out. The romance was kind of nullified after that. Left a down feeling in the end. After waiting a year I wish they had just had one movie instead of 2 parts - there isn't enough story to break into 2 parts. Felt a bit draggy at times and it wouldn't have been if it had moved faster. But everyone knows why it had to be split up $$$.Not much vampire action - got to wait for part 2 for that. K Stew looks a bit too worried for too much of the first part that is supposed to be happy and romantic. She should have looked more excited and really happy for some scenes. Taylor's scowling is a bit repetitive. Another story fault though.Overall of course if you are a fan you have to see it. Beautiful filming but not enough story for a whole movie. On the downside there is some heaviness and a depressive vibe in the second half. I still liked the first Twilight movie the most because it was fun and exciting and romantic. This one gives a bit of a bitter aftertaste but hopefully taken with the second part it will seem better as a whole. Is it as good as it should be? Probably - not much better or worse given the restrictions of the story.,7,2,7,24 November 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Touching drama - worth watching
","There is a touching teen drama with romance, some humor and good acting. I'm not familiar with the novel but as a movie I think it is quite a good story. The different themes are quite varied for one movie: first love, drug use, homosexuality, sexual abuse and friendship. They are not new to movies about teens but the way it's put together is fresh, realistic and entertaining while avoiding clichés or melodrama. Logan Lerman is well cast as the wallflower Charlie who starts high school with some emotional baggage, makes new friends and falls in love. He is likable enough to be the central character and his crush is quite sweet to watch. Emma Watson acts as the object of his affection Sam. She brought attention to the movie but I think she is a bit too androgynous and lacking romantic appeal. Also her diction was too well articulated which made her sound like a fine British actress rather than a troubled Pennsylvania girl. Mae Whitman was suitably repulsive as Mary Elizabeth the unattractive friend. Nina Dobrev as the sister Candace didn't get enough screen time - maybe because she is prettier than the lead Emma Watson. Ezra Miller as the gay friend is quirky enough while not acting too flamboyant. The adults have supporting roles from Dylan Mcdermott as Charlie's father and Paul Rudd as a sympathetic English teacher.Overall this is a surprisingly moving and well worth a watch.",9,1,3,12 October 2012
The Equalizer," Excessively violent and unevenly paced - needs a Besson touch
","Watching this movie makes you wish Luc Besson had given the makers of this movie some lessons about how to make an action movie. Director Antoine Fuqua turns things round with an invincible African American hero dealing with white criminals eg the Russian mob and crooked Boston Irish cops.The problems are mainly in the pace and the action sequences. The pace is uneven, with some draggy staring scenes interspersed by some sudden excessively graphic violence. The violence is revolting, not funny - too much is shown during each killing.Denzel as the invincible vigilante like ex agent does some fighting and action but it's a bit like Liam Neeson's fighting in the last few Taken movies - a bit suggested with camera work.Chloe Grace Moretz as an abused Russian prostitute is a scene stealer and shows she can act any kind of role well.Overall a not quite get your money's worth flawed action thriller.",5,0,0,2 August 2015
The Expendables 2," This one is expendable
",OK enough! After this one it's time for the bunch to retire. Too many bullets back and forth. The overall impression is a mess of shooting without a good enough story to string together the weak plot. Didn't care who was good and who was bad after a while.Sylvester and JCVD's fight at the end was just too painful. It's scary to see him fight at his age. I know they wanted a not so young girl as the female lead but of all the beautiful Chinese actresses they could have chosen why did they pick this one. She had an unattractive expression throughout. You can give this one a pass. It's simply not worth it.,3,1,3,22 September 2013
War Dogs," Eye opening - very interesting and funny look at arms dealing
","The story is eye opening, relevant and very clearly told with a humorous tone through the serious subject matter. This is based on a true story with some fictionalized elements to make it entertaining. A massage therapist links up with a childhood friend who is a small time arms dealer. Very interesting to get a look at the legal but morally questionable world of arms dealing. I thought this would be a juvenile buddy movie with a bit of war thrown in but it isn't.Jonah Hill has some funny lines and he does a great job with the over the top character but he can be subtly sinister when he needs to be. Miles Teller plays his character sympathetically and I liked him here. Quite different from the rather annoying characters he usually plays. Bradley Cooper who produced the movie and has a small but pivotal role and he is effective as an arms dealer.Quite a transporting experience as the action takes you from Miami to Jordan and Iraq with some funny situations there and Albania.Watch this movie. It deserves to do better than it has so far.",9,74,96,1 September 2016
Source Code," Predictable - not that great
",The story is kind of predictable for this type of movie. The groundhog day element gets old fast. Read the good reviews and expected more. It is just adequate - no more no less. Could have predicted the outcome from the premise of the story. It's just not very interesting and the whole thing feels repetitive and limited in scope.Michelle Monaghan isn't pretty enough to carry this kind of show. She looks a bit pig like - a younger Marcia Gay Harden and is more of a character actress. Jake does an adequate job but anyone could have done it. Like seeing Vera Farmiga but don't know why she has to do the behind the scenes kind of HQ woman - she is young enough for a more central role.,5,2,4,7 March 2012
Skyfall," Bond on a budget starring the old folks home
","There are so many things wrong with this movie. Most of the elements of a good Bond movie aren't there.The locations aren't well used. The Istanbul roof top & Bazaar chase has already been shown in 'Taken 2' and the TV show 'Missing'. Dejavu. The way they showed 'Shanghai' and 'Macau' at night it could have been filmed anywhere. The Scottish countryside shown was so grim.Where are the cars and gadgets? Nothing but the old Aston Martin. Just that pistol and tracker. The new Q is so ineffective. The villain played by Javier Bardem. He is more comical than sinister. With the blond fright wig, the campy overtures and the most frightening of all, the dentures this must the most absurd bad guy in Bond history.The climax feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down Scottish house. With the home made defences and geriatric defenders, it felt like Home Alone meets the Golden Girls. Might as well have asked Betty White or grandma to join in. The new Bond girl Berenice Marlohe is exotic and fascinating to look at. But why only one? Writing her out of the show so early and not having another was a mistake. The Bond girl is supposed to end up saved by Bond with a hook up at the end. Unless you consider M a Bond girl.The focus of the movie is M. Judi Dench was always too provincial looking for MI6. The only good thing about this movie is that Ralph Fiennes is replacing her. Finally. There was no need to dedicate a whole movie to her farewell. Daniel Craig is just so haggard he looks worse than the villain. It's time to replace him with someone younger and handsomer. Baffled by the good reviews. Be warned we are being short changed.",1,351,666,1 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Too little story and too much fighting - time to retire Iron Man
",This was a mostly brainless action movie with too much fighting and too little plot.On the plus side Gwyneth looked nice in her white suit. Guy Pearce's makeover was amusing.The destruction of the Malibu House was quite good. But things kind of went down hill after that.Didn't like the fast little one liners in typical Robert Downey speak. Too many too fast - couldn't catch most of the quick mumblings. A few is amusing but there almost all his dialog was like that.Didn't really get the red glowing exploding stuff. But at least it provided a change from the usual Iron Man routine.The ending battle is just way too much back and forth - dragged out fighting with little actual plot advancement.It is high time for Iron Man time to retire.,2,0,2,8 November 2013
Marie Antoinette," A waste of good subject matter
",This could have been a good movie but it was really disappointing.The good part beautiful sets and costumes. Dunst is actually not bad and she is Austrian looking as Marie Antoinette was. Judy Davis is good but under used.The story seems cut short. It would have been better to show her life till the end for some balance and poignancy.The rock music score is totally wrong. Even if they didn't want a period style biopic - the brash heavy metal sound was just jarring and distracting.Jason Schwartzman is totally wrong for the king. Nepotism in casting can ruin a movie.Sophia Coppola has a lot to learn.,1,3,4,12 August 2010
Child 44," Bad novels make bad movies - don't waste your time
",This movie is a disaster. It's grim story about how the mistreatment of Ukranians mixed badly with a serial killer story.The varying degrees of Russian accents mix together badly and a lot of the dialog ends up incomprehensible. It would have been better that everyone didn't try to fake an accent than for them to have some exaggerated accents (like Tom Hardy's) and some faint accents (the rest). Make a movie about the Ukrianian serial killer and keep it true story. That may have worked.There are some incongruous characters. The villain played by Joel Kinnaman seems evil for no reason. Very fake and contrived. Noomi Rapace doesn't look or sound Russian at all. Strange choice.Don't bother with this long and dreary nonsense.,1,24,45,5 November 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Confusing direction during disaster sequences and incomprehnsible technical dialog
",Firstly the explosion and fire is filmed in a way that makes one seem right in the thick of things. Quite scary. Unfortunately things are confusing both in terms of dialog and direction.The movie starts off with some family time with Kate Hudson in a fairly convincing blue collar wife role although she is a bit slim for the role. Mark Wahlberg looks short and out of shape - he let himself go a bit for the role and that's realistic. John Malkovich plays an evil BP guy who was in a rush and caused them to proceed despite supervisor Kurt Russell's misgivings. Liked Gina Rodriguez as one of the bridge personnel caught up in the explosion.2 major faults:Confusing dialog One of the main faults is the dialog is needlessly difficult to understand with all the technical speak bantered quickly around by the cast. Didn't understand much except a few words by Kurt Russell in the meeting. There must have been an easier way to explain the problem with the pressure. Hard to tell people apart during the disaster sequences A major fault in the direction is having everyone's face covered by mud and soot. I couldn't tell who was injured and killed and when especially when it came to Ethan Suplee's character. I could make out only Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell but Dylan O'Brien only sporadically. Could have had a few more minutes about the investigation and aftermath and ecological impact.,4,6,14,29 September 2016
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Clever blend of fact and fiction
",This movie is worth a watch. It's quite a clever blend of fantasy horror with historical characters and events. Liked the 'alternative' reasons for keeping slaves and how Gettysburg was decided. Nice contrast the Spielberg's Lincoln now in cinemas. Vampire movies work better with a historical framework than a sci fi modern setting.Benjamin Walker resembles a younger Liam Neeson and is a competent and charismatic lead. Nice to see the lovely Mary Elisabeth Winstead in a historical role. Rufus Sewell is lead vampire.The slashings are a bit repetitive and the killings could have been more inventively humorous.,7,1,2,13 December 2012
If I Stay," Real and genuine - a cut above the rest
","This is a well balanced romantic drama. The movie has a good balance between family tragedy of a horrific car accident and teen romance of young love. Also the theme of music is well shared between classical cello and Pacific Northwest rock band. The romance is a convincing tale - not too passionate for their age but with the real problems of differing paths and East Coast (Juillard) vs West Coast (rock band). This is a problem that face many couples and it's good to see proper issues as the problem instead of trumped up melodrama. The story felt more real than 'The Fault in Our Stars' and less sentimental too. In fact although the tale is a sad one, it's the best of the recent teen based romance movies far better than 'The Giver'.Chloe Grace Moretz proves she can do anything from horror (Carrie) to action (Kick Ass) to moving romantic drama. Her face is sensitive and expressive. Even though she is very pretty she is such a good actress she can still pull off the shy musical prodigy without being fake. Her love interest is played by Jamie Blackley who does a good job without overacting. He isn't too good looking so it's a believable romance. The ex rocker type parents seem like they couldn't have had such a beautiful daughter but never mind. Stacy Keach is surprisingly effective as her grandfather.Well done - moving, involving, rings true.",10,78,117,4 September 2014
Rocketman," Too much on the sad and bad
",The focus of this story had too much emphasis on the drugs and his breakdown. Since Elton himself was behind this don't understand why he didn't go on to show his sober days - The Lion King and friendship with Princess Diana and his happy marriage. The early part with his budding musical talent was actually quite good. Quite a lot of anger towards his parents here. Another grating thing is the sometimes Bollywood style musical numbers.Taron is a good actor - quite intense. Few actors actually look like Elton but if they made him fatter it would have helped.The Freddy Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody was a better movie.,5,0,4,17 October 2019
A Star Is Born," Medium acting and okay but not great singing
",Bradley acts addicted but he looks too healthy. Lady Gaga shouts her songs a bit too much - does every note seem the same loudness? Her acting isn't that great because her face isn't very expressive.The formula is depressing - why is he so self destructive?,5,2,4,5 April 2019
Gravity," Visually stunning and quite thrilling
",This movie is better than the trailers suggest.The visuals of space are stunning. Deserves a best cinematography award for sure.It's refreshing that a story about space can be just as exciting without aliens and monsters from outer space. The natural perils and dangers are even more terrifying. And you do get all of them from debris to suffocation to fire and water. You can almost feel the physical hardships that the astronauts feel. The dialog is alright not annoying. Sandra Bullock does a good job playing it inexperienced but not incompetent. George adds his usual charming support. But the acting is secondary in this movie anyway.The soundtrack is a bit overwhelming at times. I know they were trying to make things exciting but it could have been dialed down a bit.I just saw the 2D version in a medium sized cinema screen - wish I had chosen a cinema wit a bigger screen to see it.,9,2,3,16 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Most exciting war movie for quite a while
","As far as war movies go this is exciting tense involving and well made. The story is compelling not just because it is an extraordinary true story of one soldier surviving but because the bravery and tragedy are keenly felt without unrealistic bravado. Once the fighting starts, you're in for a terrifying and unforgettable ordeal.Good points include identifiable characters (unlike Black Hawk Down) and a likable cast. The main actors are all familiar to movie goers and they don't look out of place in their roles. Mark Wahlberg doesn't look that combat ready being relatively middle aged looking compared to the rest. Eric Bana is convincing as the commander. Never thought of Emil Hirsch as a soldier type but he is okay. Ben Foster is good. Taylor Kitsch is a bit too much of a dude for the role of a career soldier.The story shows the people of Afghanistan from both sides of the conflict. During the battle it seemed like a bit like a video game killing Taliban but then it became quite eye opening when the Afghans saved Marcus and helps to show the difficult situation the anti Taliban Afghans face in the country. The story isn't political or anti war though one does come away feeling the loss of such brave men and the suffering is such a terrible waste in the bungled mission and rescue.A must watch for war movie fans especially since it's about Afghanistan an under represented conflict on screen.",9,2,5,10 May 2014
Star Trek," Quite good even if you are not a trekkie
",I enjoyed this movie even though I am not a trekkie - just enjoyed the original series but never followed any of the subsequent series. Good points: Story: It was quite enjoyable in the beginning when they set up the backgrounds of Kirk and Spock. Although Kirk's maverick rebellious style was a little annoying. The casting was quite good overall. Quinto was right for the role. Saldana is quite elegant. Chris Pine looks a little haggard for his age. Anton Yelchin's Russian accent is a bit too hard to understand. Wish we could have seen more Winona.Effects: The slightly old fashioned and not over the top effects is a good contrast to the dizzying new scifi movies. What happens to the cast looks quite realistic except Kirk getting beaten up too much. Bad points: The time travel element was a little bit bewildering - might have to watch twice. Some of the action in the latter part also seemed to jump from one scene to the next too quickly without a clear explanation. I realize for fans they had to pack in a lot of details which probably added to my confusion.Music: It would have been nice to hear the glorious theme song earlier in the movie instead of just at the end.Overall: Worth seeing - not a let down at all. Only thing is what more can the do with the sequel?,7,3,11,8 February 2010
Fury," Entertaining and not that violent
",Put aside preconceptions about this movie and you will be surprised. Firstly it's not that violent by today's standards. No way it's in the 'Saving Private Ryan' category. What was cringe inducing was the romantic interlude in the German town with the two German women that was drawn out and clichéd. The ending went a bit over the top in a fantasy hero 'Lone Survivor' way but it isn't 'Inglorious' crazy just a bit unrealistically brave. The atrocities shown weren't that gory. Just Brad Pitt's character shooting a POW and some Nazis stringing up Germans who won't fight. Don't expect a realistic historically based true story type war movie and you won't be disappointed.The good points are: gripping tank photography both during the battles and inside the claustrophobic tank. The cast is mostly likable with Michael Pena and a mature looking Shia. Logan Lerman is well cast as the fresh faced idealistic typist plunged into the horrors of the war. In fact the movie is mainly from his POV and he is a sympathetic character. Brad looks older and I couldn't understand too much of his dialog. In fact a big weakness is the dialog which was too thickly accented and almost unintelligible except for the expletives.Overall this was entertaining (if not realistic) and not excessively violent well photographed war movie with a likable cast.,7,4,9,23 October 2014
Train to Busan," Best Zombie movie ever!
","As clear as day after watching ths movie I'm totally convinced that this Korean Zombie movie is the best zombie movie ever made. It is breathtakingly exciting with a whole range of interesting scenarios on and off the train. To top all that there is a relatable bunch of characters father and daughter husband and wife etc that are involving, endearing and clearly identifiable. In terms of excitement and enjoyability this is just way above WWZ or Zombieland and all the other recent zombie movies.",10,2,3,1 January 2020
Darkest Hour," Drags at first but it's worth it for the latter part
","There have been so many portrayals of Winston Churchill recently it's hard to choose the best one. John Lithgow in the Crown was too tall but very convincing. Albert Finney was droll and memorable. Now Gary Oldman gives a slimmer more sprightly and bouncier stepped version of Churchill. His voice is fine but sometimes he looks to slim and young compared to what we are used to on screen. 
As far as the plot this is an interesting but not perfect movie. A lot of scenes show the appeasers wearing down Churchill. FDR is portrayed negatively. It's interesting to see the planning of Dunkirk from this point of view to complement the grand war movie Dunkirk. The tube ride and final speech is moving and rousing.Lily James is a lovely secretary and Kristen Scott Thomas is a little sweeter than the usual Clementine. The relationship with KG V is interesting.
Worth a watch even if you think you have just had it with Churchill movies.",7,0,3,4 January 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Thoroughly entertaining and funny
","This is the most enjoyable and original of Quentin's movies to date and a pretty good war movie even if it is an all out fantasy.I have not always been a Quentin fan. Too much violence and too many unpleasant images. But here everything comes together in perfect proportions. There are moments of great hilarity especially between the French cinema owner played by Melanie Laurent and the German Officer who is attracted to her. The scene in the tavern is both tense and darkly funny at the same time too. The inventiveness of these scenes alone deserves an Oscar for best screenplay. There are some moments of unexpected humor like when Christoph Waltz is negotiating at the end. And the over the top violence is appropriate to the story for a change, especially the feel good ending.The casting - especially the European cast is excellent and their acting spot on. Melanie Laurent is fascinating. Diane Kruger is totally perfect. Bruhl and Fassbender are well cast too. Christoph Waltz is memorable and deserves all his awards. With this cast you don't depend on Brad Pitt who often can be too obvious and self conscious with his exaggerated expressions. The only thing is you wish more of them had lived at the end.Definitely worth seeing more than once.",9,0,5,7 February 2010
Captain Marvel," Confusing boring childish
",The screenplay is convoluted and confusing. The beginning feels like you walked into a movie half way. When things start to get explained it's too late. The humor is unfunny and childish. Samuel L Jackson singing and playing with the cat. The story is so confusing and silly - bouncing around between Earth and the space ships and shifting shapes. Then the good guys are the bad guys.Miscast is the word to describe the cast. Brie and Annette are so out of place - they belong in dramas and rom coms not action movies.A black hole in the Marvel Universe.,2,20,40,9 March 2019
Iron Man 2," BORING - Couldn't understand most of the dialog
",Much preferred the first Iron Man. The parts between the action sequences are incredibly dull. None of the characters is really that interesting.I think the story is just way off. There is no onward thrust in the story.The dialog is obscure to say the least when you can understand what they are saying. And what is Stark's problem. The story expects you to understand too much from little hints.Robert Downey Jr needs to speak more slowly and articulate each word.Mickey Rourke is just so bizarre looking.Gwyneth is older looking - her face is drawn but still has a stunning figure.Scarlett is alluring with her dark hair and her action sequence near the end is quite good. But her role is a bit puzzling.Just forget it - its a waste of time. Even the fighting between the silly looking Iron Men is so lame.,2,1,4,23 October 2010
World War Z," Succeeds both on the grand and small scale
","Enjoyed both the big scale city zombie attacks in Philadelphia and Jersualem. The smaller scale battles with zombies in the WHO and airplane.The cast apart from Brad Pitt is not very familiar which keeps it more real. Brad didn't have to be so terribly scruffy looking and his wife was a bit plain though. After all, want to keep the zombies and humans distinct!It's not too violent or gory for this type of movie. The movie launches into excitement quite quickly so you don't get bored. The ending is clever enough. After this and warm bodies I don't think we need any more zombie movies.",9,8,24,21 June 2013
Passengers," Better than expected
",Surprisingly this science fiction movie without big battles or tonnes of special effects is engrossing.The premise is a bit hard to accept - that the planet would be so far away and people would give up all they know for something unknown via such a long journey. But once you accept the premise of this intergalactic journey to a colony planet it's quite interesting.Chris Pratt slightly overweight is likable enough. Jennifer Lawrence - yes her again is has a good on screen rapport with him. Michael Sheen is the robot.A little of their previous lives would have made things more poignant.Things worked out alright and the drama is quite moving when it needs to be.,8,1,1,7 June 2017
The Hunger Games," Only for fans of the books or those who enjoy seeing teens fight to the death
","First of all, the premise of the story is unpleasant. What's so nice about watching teens fight to the death in some kind of survivor gladiator tournament? The plot is irritating and annoying. The changing of the rules back and forth is silly. The pageant like beginning of the competition is out of place. About 20 minutes could have been shaved. The jerky camera action wasn't necessary and gave me a headache.The casting - apart from Jennifer the rest was hit and miss. Jennifer Lawrence is a believable and moving actress. She is good at looking like she is suffering and has the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her vulnerability and strength are touching. She manages tug some emotional strings as she did in Winter's Bone. But even she can't save material that is weak.Josh Hutcherson isn't handsome enough for a romantic lead. Even if they didn't want a heartthrob they could have picked someone slightly better looking. The chemistry between them is lacking and the love story unconvincing. There isn't enough reason for her to love him so much. Liam Hemsworth's role isn't big but he looks more earnest. Woody Harrelson as the mentor is too goofy. Donald Sutherland as the President is a bit feeble and looks like he would rather be elsewhere. Wes Bentley is suitably deranged looking. Elizabeth Banks getup is silly.There are very few good points besides Jennifer Lawrence. It isn't gory or too violent so the family can watch it if they want to. But careful about the message they might be getting. You do want to see how she survives. It is a bit touching in parts eg the initial parting.Overall not even really worth one watch for all the hype. It wasn't enjoyable or romantic like Twilight. Won't want to watch it again. Please don't make this a box office sensation that smashes all records. It just isn't good. Even enjoyed John Carter more. I think this one is more for fans of the books. If you like the premise of the story then you will probably enjoy it. Otherwise you probably won't.",2,22,53,23 March 2012
The Impossible," Impossibly good
","The impact of this movie is truly devastating. Even though you know the outcome that the family lived, it is still no less tense throughout and I felt stricken after watching it. See it on the big screen if you can. Much more compelling than those large scale over the top CGI disaster movies of recent years because it's a true story. The tsunami scenes are so well done it makes the viewer feel like they are immersed in the disaster. Felt every sweeping wave, every gasp for air, impact with objects, footstep on debris etc. The Spanish director Bayona did an excellent job. The on location shooting in Thailand gives an authentic feel even though some filming was done in Spain.The story is good with a balance of the disaster itself and the aftermath including the search and overwhelmed hospital. The screenwriters avoided sentimentality yet achieved an emotionally powerful reunion. I didn't get a Hollywood feeling from the film. The emotional scenes are done quite matter of factly and the movie is better of for that. Those who criticise the scope (just one European family) can watch the miniseries 'Tsunami the Aftermath' instead. Naomi does a terrific job looking anguished, caring and injured in a totally convincing way. The young actor who plays her son Tom Holland is equally good not overdoing it but conveying the right amount of confusion, bravery and terror. A must watch.",10,1,2,17 January 2013
42," Overcoming discrimination
",This well intentioned movie about Jackie Robinson's first couple of years in Major League Baseball is worth a watch.Most of the emphasis of the movie is the racial discrimination he faced on and off the field from his own team and other teams. The portrayal of the ugly red neck is very direct and quite painful to see. There have been some more over the top movies about racism like Django Unchained and more light hearted ones like the Help recently. This movie is somewhere in the middle.It would have been better to have some establishing scenes on his life prior to 1946 and in his successful years after the first 2 to give a more rounded picture. Also it was a bit lacking in humor and the uplifting element was a bit too little too late.Chadwick Boseman as Jackie acts well and it's good that it isn't too familiar a face so you can believe the actor in the role. Harrison has a strange hair do and drawl that's distracting. But at least he is playing someone old.Worth a watch even if you aren't a baseball fan.,8,0,0,19 November 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good story - you get quite a lot of movie
",Liked the plot even if didn't get all the twists about who is bad and who is good. The story goes in unexpected and interesting directions. Liked the use of the different characters especially Spock. Liked the futuristic cities that weren't too futuristic. The space battles are well done even if the Enterprise gets too much of a beating.Cumberbatch is usually too weird looking for human roles (Parade's End) and looks quite suitable in this movie as the villain. He makes gibberish sound convincing. Why there is a heavily British accented Alice Eve is a little out of place with the rest of the characters.Couple of things that need were a bit jarring though. Firstly Anton Yelchin's Russian accent is a bit exaggerated. Chris Pine is getting old rather rapidly. Better stay out of the sun and make the sequel soon.This isn't one of those let down sequels.,8,3,7,22 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Good story and funny just a little slow in parts
","This movie is good. There are a few faults, but overall it is one of the better movies about relationships and different kinds of love. It's not a laugh a minute film but it is a laugh out loud film when it is funny. The silly title suggests a more comical plot but it has more of a laid back not over sentimental feel. Enjoyed Steve's makeover that wasn't too extreme. The different aspects of the plot lines come together very nicely. One part I found very realistic but amusing was the take on divorce from the man's point of view and the relationships that fill the void. Julianne Moore is a bit haggard looking. Steve is his usual self - lucky the movie doesn't rely too much on him looking helpless as usual. Ryan is cool, good to see him out of his usual serious role he could do more comedy. Emma isn't very beautiful but she is expressive so interesting to watch. The kids who played the baby sitter and son could have been more endearing - they were a little bit unappealing. A few faults: It is a bit draggy in parts. Some scenes could have been shortened and cut. Some cringe inducing parts could have been left out. I think the director needed to tighten the story and cut about 15 minutes or so. Also there are some times when the characters reactions could have been toned down. There are some over reactions eg Marisa Tomei's. Overall still very enjoyable.",8,1,2,12 September 2011
The Notebook," Passionate and sweeping
","Once every generation there is a romantic movie that just works. In the 80s it was 'Somewhere in Time'. In the 2000s it was 'the Notebook'. There is an epic sweep of time and passion that feels real. The leads are convincing and moving. Rachel McAdams is a luminous expressive actress and every emotion of joy and sadness is shown on her face. Ryan Gosling's understated passion is a perfect counterpoint to Rachel's performance and the chemistry between them is undeniable. He is right for the underdog part. The niceness of the characters is refreshing. Supporting cast is well chosen from Joan Allen to James Marsden. The older characters are good played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands although they look nothing like the younger ones.The music used and score are appropriate for the time. The filming on location in South Carolina is beautiful and evocative adding much to the charm of the movie.It isn't a perfect movie - some of the dialog isn't well written. Although the past and present story lines are what makes this story unique, some of the flashing back and forth is distracting and the dementia is a little overwhelming. The class difference thing is a bit clichéd. But in the end it doesn't matter. It's not just the ultimate chick flick date night movie. It works as a whole and remains the most poignant and deeply felt of the Nicholas Sparks stories.",10,0,1,12 June 2013
The Danish Girl," Eddie isn't pretty enough and medicine is full of quacks!
","Firstly the good points: The cinematography is quite beautiful and the Continental locations interior and exterior are so atmospheric. Costumes are good too. There is a morbid fascination that keeps one interested in watching how 'perversion' was dealt with in the past just like another movie this year 'Carol'. Plus with the Caitlyn Jenner in the news this movie is topical.The weaknesses: Casting wasn't perfect. Eddie Redmayne acts as well as can be expected, but he isn't a pretty man so how can he make a pretty woman? He looks worse than Norman Bates in drag. Amber Heard is a scene stealer as a vivacious ballet dancer. Alicia Vikander although a bit tanned for a Danish is sympathetic as the most understanding wife in the history of cinema.Don't understand why they made a movie about an ultimately unsuccessful operation - why not make a movie about the first successful gender reassignment instead? The message I got is some doctors will do anything even if it isn't in the best interest of the patient. Obviously the Dresden doctor shouldn't have gone ahead with the 2nd operation so soon.",4,5,8,18 January 2016
Little Boy," Really cute WW2 family movie
",This movie is one of those heart warming movies that has all the right elements. It isn't just one of those movies that jump on the WWII band wagon types. There actually is a charming and moving story that involves the war to be told here. Enjoyed the slightly magic realism nostalgic style of the movie that had a Forrest Gump quality to it.The cast are all good from big names like Emily Watson to Kevin James to the other less famous supporting cast. The actor who plays the little boy is effective at tugging at the heart stings when necessary. Reminds a bit of the recent underrated 'Book Thief' which also has Emily Watson. Good trend to turn to historical settings to make family movies.Worth watching/,8,1,1,5 September 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Entertaining but the story and cast are not the best
","There is too much fast paced action in the first half. Needs to take a breather now and then. Some of the jumping around is little bit deja vu. The time travel element makes sense - but you do feel you wasted a bit of time on the story as the time travel goes back too far.Casting - Jake is a strange choice - not too hero like but that is the trend these days. Gemma is feisty but not pretty enough for a romantic lead - can anyone explain why she gets all these plum roles like Clash of the Titans? She just isn't that pleasant to watch as the main actress she is supporting cast at best.Overall if you missed it, doesn't matter.",6,7,11,28 July 2010
Knives Out," Involving but didn't like some aspects of the story
","This movie is good but it isn't that great. The Agatha Christie style who dunnit with an all star cast is involving and fun to watch. The tension you feel for the character Marta played well by Armas is unique. So there is an inventiveness that keeps the viewer concentrating for clues and wrapped up in the dynamic of the characters. The in fighting in the family is funny. And the way they turn on her is painfully real. The way nasty relatives are shown may be too close to home for some viewers.Christopher Plummer is amazing actor - he in his late eighties and the rest of the cast hams it up including Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig with an exaggerated but intelligible accent. In 'Fierce People' Chris Evans acted a similar role so it was a bit of a dÃ©jÃ  vu how his character turned out.But there are some flaws. The grand explanation with the switching of the medicine is confusing and unconvincing. Also the family wasn't that bad to justify a total disinheriting. If the patriarch wanted to help Marta he didn't have to leave her everything. She was doing a job well and a sizeable legacy would have sufficed. There is a political slant to the story that Agatha Christie wouldn't have had. Here the writer pits the sweet good hearted daughter of an illegal immigrant against the evil white entitled wealthy mercenary people. Too cliched.Despite the flaws it's worth a watch because movies like this aren't that common anymore.",7,5,10,4 December 2019
The Irishman," Lots of history via a hitman's POV
","Well done biopic of a hitman. Plus what happened to union boss Jimmy Hoffa.
It's amazing how well done the makeup is making RDN look younger and older.
Al acts like he always does.
Have to concentrate. It's confusing keeping the characters sorted out. Even with all the funny captions explaining what happened to them. Some unexpected funny moments. Mostly gangster jokes.
This is long but it's okay. Think of it as a 2 part miniseries.",7,2,6,12 December 2019
Just Go with It," Funnnier than expected
",I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan but I enjoyed this one mainly because the screenplay is good and it doesn't rely too much on Sandler. The other cast members provide most of the funny lines. Jennnifer is quite attractive even next to the much younger Brooklyn Decker who incidentally is quite an adequate actress. The cute little girl Bailee Madison is a charming scene stealer her accent is much better than Selena Gomez in Monte Carlo (for anyone who has seen the disappointing Monte Carlo). The story is pleasant and funny without being obvious or corny or cringe inducing. There are many laugh out loud moments and most characters are likable except Eddie played by Nick Swardson who is a little annoying. Overall enjoyable and worth watching.,Null,2,4,20 August 2011
Spotlight," The reporter's point of view isn't that interesting
","This is a movie about the sex abuse scandal by Catholic priests in Boston. It is a movie that should have been made properly since abstract headlines don't tell a lucid story. However, making it from the point of view of the Boston Globe journalists simply isn't that interesting. It should just have been one of the aspects of the movie but not the main one. More emphasis on the victims and families, some major perpetrators, high ranking clergy actually doing the cover up etc could have been shown. After all, the reporters are not the main players in this tragedy. A more complete picture like in 'And the Band Played On' would have been better. Difficult to keep track of who all the lawyers and reporters are.The earnest actors are all people you want to see succeed in their quest. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams particularly exude journalistic integrity. Liev Schreiber looks different here. As far as awards there just isn't that much of an actual acting role for any of the lead actors.The wrong focus of the story makes a scandal difficult to follow and tedious.",5,27,54,2 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," Worst of the entire series
",This is an ugly movie. The story is weak. There is no forward thrust in the narrative. You don't feel a connection with the characters that is what made Terminators 1&2 so great. Also the sense of pursuit by an invincible villain is missing. Maybe it just doesn't work without Sarah J Connor.Casting isn't good either. Sam Worthington is not leading man material. Can anyone explain why he has been cast in all these action leads? Christian Bale is a little bit gaunt and unattractive - would have been good to have someone a little better looking for a hero. The 2 kids are annoying rather than charming. Having 2 heroes is a little confusing. Moon Bloodgood has a bit of an unpleasant forwardness about her. Bryce Dallas Howard is out of place.,1,4,9,12 August 2010
Aquaman," Simply the best, better than all the rest
",A more perfect cast couldn't have been put together for this movie. Amber Heard is the most beautiful creature on land or in the sea. Even with orange hair or wet hair she is so stunning that she eclipses all the action going on around her. Her character Mera is no damsel in distress either. So happy she finally has a worldwide audience for her legendary beauty. Jason Momoa is has the build and the hybrid looking eyes that comic book creators could only have dreamt of. Who else could be more suited to the role of Aquaman? There something a little tongue in cheek in his personality that helps too. The multi talented Patrick Wilson as evil brother shows how versatile he is jumping from other Wan movies like Conjuring to this superhero movie effortlessly. Nicole Kidman's towering height has finally been put to good use as queen of Atlantis.The visuals are also beautiful beyond expectations. When there is too much in the sea there is some interesting surface action too. The satisfying and epic story has remains easy to follow from start to finish - Marvel movies could learn from DC here.A standard bearer for the future of action hero movies.,10,2,7,7 January 2019
Concussion," Shout the message from the rooftops!
",The message of this movie needs to be shouted from the rooftops: football is too dangerous a sport for human beings. Is it somehow unpatriotic to say anything bad about football and how brutal and barbaric it can be on the players? People watch human beings pound and smash against each other but don't think what it does to those people being hurt. The story of this brave doctor from Africa is very interesting and it's admirable how he takes on the establishment at great personal cost. It's quite moving to see the damage inflicted on the players and their families.Will Smith does a good accent and inhabits his character well. He should have been nominated for an Oscar even if it wasn't maybe an Oscar winning performance.Haven't we evolved from Roman times watching gladiators get killed for fun? Parents think twice about what you are letting your son in for. It's a violent culture that enjoys boxing and football so we shouldn't be surprised that there is so much violence on the streets.,9,3,5,5 September 2016
Match Point," A must watch - who knew Woody had it in him?
",Woody Allen is so versatile that he has written and directed an almost perfect drama thriller. I don't even see his usual neurotic dialog or characters. What you get is a totally convincing and entirely engrossing movie.Jonathan Rhys Meyers acts superbly and you really feel his anxiety. Scarlett is very suited to the role and perfectly annoying at the same time. I'm so glad Woody has taken on London. You get the best of Polanski realism and detail and Hitchcock like enjoyability and pleasant non gory tension. But the best aspect is how he makes you feel so much on the side of the central figure played by Rhys Meyers.A must watch. It's one of those you want to watch again for the detail. Just loved this dark fable and the vintage operatic score.,10,0,1,13 March 2011
Midnight in Paris," Delightful - one to watch again!
","Woody Allen is getting better and better. This is one of his best preferred it to Vicky Christina and some of the London based ones. All the historic encounters are so fascintaing it needs to be seen twice to appreciate all the detail. Makes you want to know more details about the different people he meets. It's one of those movies you wish could go on longer. Owen is typical Owen I think the role was made for his laid back charm. Rachel is pretty and hilarious. Such a versatile actress. The cameo actors are interesting to watch from Brody to a slightly inexpressive Bruni. It's not just about cultural differences, it's about the magical past of the city. My favorite Paris film since Le Divorce. Can't wait to see how Woody handles Rome in his next movie.",Null,2,3,25 August 2011
The Last Song," Story is OK but miley is unromantic
","The story isn't bad of course there are some clichÃ©d things but it is a Sparks romance. This was better than Dear John which was irritating.Miley's acting has been criticised roundly. I don't think she entirely spoiled the movie. She wasn't bad all the time. She was better in the upbeat snappy moments and not so good at the tear jerking moments. Because she is not pretty (let's face it she has a rather ugly smile and her body is hunched), the sad moments weren't moving. And the romance didn't ring true. It was a rather dry eyed tear jerker at the end. If there had been a prettier better actress it might have been more romantic and moving. The kid brother wasn't that moving either.Kinnear is good though the didn't look sick enough at the end. Liam is OK but not very facially expressive. Other supporting characters were a bit annoying and unattractive.The song they played (the Last Song) kind of sucked. Couldn't they get a better composer? As if Juillard would want someone who composed that kind of nonsense.Overall not as good as the Notebook but better than Dear John.",5,1,8,29 August 2010
The Hateful Eight," A gripping, nearly 3 hour long experience
","At nearly 3 hours long, it's surprising that I didn't feel bored during the movie at all. The gripping story of bounty hunters in Wyoming is quite an experience.The orgy of violence at the end is pure Quentin but what comes before is an interesting mix of funny darkly comic dialog and a clever whodunnit construction that plays out nicely. The dialog is long at times but always entertaining.There are some top notch performances here. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a meaty role. Samuel L Jackson is good as usual. Bruce Dern is good too. Another good Kurt Russell movie this year, 'Bone Tomahawk' is a very different movie less comedy more horror. Liked them both.The music by the composer of 'the Untouchables' is effective and memorable and deserves awards.Worth watching - quite unforgettable.",8,3,10,24 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," Still a fascinating story
",Margot Robbie is a terrific actress - eminently watchable. But she is bit too mature and large for the role of Tonya Harding. When she and Sebastian Stan as Jeff Gilooly take over from the child actors they look ludicrously too old. But then the whole movie is done in an over the top parody style so I guess it's forgivable. The scenes of abuse from Jeff Gilooly and her mother are quite shocking. Alison Janney does a great job as the mother from hell. Sebastian is a bit too clean cut looking - white trash don't look like him. All the abuse she suffered invokes a lot of sympathy for her overcoming such grinding poverty and sacrificing so much to get where she did.Just as in real life the events of the attack are not that clear cut.Whatever it is the story is one of the most interesting scandals of the sports world and worth watching.,7,4,5,8 January 2018
We Were Soldiers," Old fashioned and modern at the same time
","This very good Vietnam war movie about the first major conflict between North Vietnamese and U.S. troops is old fashioned in some ways and modern in some ways. It turns out to have the best aspects of being both old fashioned and modern.It's old fashioned in it's patriotic heroism of the characters and that the soldiers are too good looking. Chris Klein plays a brave hero, Greg Kinnear a brave helicopter pilot and of course Mel Gibson is the religious and dedicated Colonel in charge. Watching this movie in 2014 again it's quite amusing to see Jon Hamm and Taylor Momsen in a supporting roles. There is no political agenda here about being in a wrong war etc. It's about the heroism of the soldiers not whether they were on the right side or not.It's modern in the realism of the well choreographed battle scenes and graphic injuries. But it's not as gross as Saving Private Ryan. Also it's sympathetic and unbiased towards both sides Vietnamese and U.S. It actually is quite a clear depiction of the overall battle instead of a confusing mess that some war movies are. There is a good setup of characters prior to the battle and you can clearly see who lives and dies.There are some faults. The filming location & vegetation didn't look like Vietnam at all. Couldn't they have planted some more suitable trees here and there? Poor Madeline Stowe as the dutiful military wife, probably the most beautiful actress of her generation did something to her lips that made her look strange for a few movies. Thank goodness the cosmetic procedures have settled down since. And what is wrong with that crazy long hair? It's a good solid war movie that's moving without being preachy and exciting without being too violent.",10,2,5,15 January 2014
Molly's Game," A treat to follow the wonderful Jessica Chastain though the seedy world of high stakes Poker
",The central character is smart and beautiful and who better to play such a person than Jessica Chastain. She is stunning and keeps your attention throughout. There's a lot of dialog and some times the dialog could have been shortened to make the speeches and crucial dialog more meaningful when they take place. There is such a thing as too many words in a movie. It's an interesting if not very appealing look at the kind of horrid people in high stakes poker. I guess I don't understand poker because all I can think is what a waste of time and money! It kind of reminded me of Maylfower Madam.Worth a watch. Makes you want to find out more about the real inspirations behind the movie.,7,2,6,5 January 2018
Dear John," Amanda is just not pretty enough plus the plot is silly
","Regarding Nicholas Sparks' novels into films its been downhill from the Notebook on. Casting Why does bug eyed Amanda Seyfried get so many romantic roles? She already ruined Mama Mia. She is not beautiful enough for lead romantic roles - she is just the supporting girl. Compared with Rachel McAdams luminosity Amanda's bulgy eyes are just gross. Channing Tatum has to work on his range of facial expressions. They are just too limited. He looks like he is struggling with his weight - needs to lose about 15 pounds. Plot climax is silly and annoying. The main climax of the plot is irritating and illogical. Why on earth would she marry the sick guy just to look after him. It just doesn't make sense. She could look after him without marrying him. And John's saintliness about selling his coin collection is clichéd and silly. If we get anymore like this, people will start to lose interest.",4,0,1,14 July 2010
Fast & Furious 6," Lots of action but too much punching and kicking
",This is a grand and extravagant looking production. The exotic locations are good. The car vs car action is what you'd expect and doesn't disappoint. Things go even further with tanks and planes. The car race in London was a bit artificially sped up. Who knew tanks could drive so fast. The attempts at humor are weak and mostly unfunny. But who care if some things are unreal thats part of the charm.Sadly the cast has aged. Paul is looking older = needs to stay out of the sun. Vin looks a little flabby. The Rock looked a bit too pumped up. Doesn't he know steroids are out now. The long drawn out obsession with Michelle Rodriguez's character is a bit tiresome. Jordanna is looking a bit gaunt. Luke Evans as the villain is a bit forgettable.Can there be too much action in a movie like this? In a way yes. The punching and fighting has come to equal the vehicular action. Enough of the fighting and punching back and forth! I know they had to use Gina Carano's skills but it felt like overkill. You can see that in any other action movie. Felt like a Hong Kong action flick.Overall things are quite grand and large scale especially looking back to the earlier ones in the series. Worth a watch.,7,1,5,30 May 2013
The Expendables," Sly style no brainer action
",The good thing about Sylvester movies is that there are no silly plot twists or flashbacks. Everything is straightforward and easy to understand. You get the action and a climax of explosions and a rescue. It was really fun to see all the action heroes and some in their unexpected cameos.Couple of faults: On the down side there wasn't enough comic relief. There wasn't much humor or witty dialog. I expected bit of a joke on their has been status but that was lacking. Think Sly needed some help with the dialog.Although the main action leads were in shape their faces were old esp Sly. The romantic female leads weren't terribly pretty but then I guess they matched the heroes.Some of the action at the end was too fast -couldn't make out who was fighting with whom. Also couldn't figure out why Eric Roberts grabbed the girl for. And why she stopped her father from killing Eric.Worth watching for a good old fashioned action movie just don't think too much about the plot.,7,1,4,23 August 2010
The Flowers of War," Unforgettable and unexpected story - a must watch
","A lot of things about this movie are quite different from what I expected.First of all it isn't a docu-drama with too many characters that squeezes every incident about the atrocity into a few hours. Instead it is actually an intimate story about relatively few people which makes a more effective if less informative movie than some of the recent grand productions from China.Secondly it isn't graphically violent. There are battles, shootings and rape but it doesn't have Saving Private Ryan type close ups. It would be too depressing and morbid if it had.Thridly, a good portion of it is in English and the subtitles are clear so it's suitable for an international audience.Fourthly, this movie is actually driven by an unexpectedly fascinating and bizarre story. It is about an American mortician (Bale), a group of convent girls and a group of prostitutes all hiding in a church in the middle of war torn Nanking during the Massacre. Some parts of the plot have fantasy elements eg the part where 1 Chinese soldier fights a whole group of Japanese soldiers/rapists. Brought to mind Inglorious Basterds. There are some very tense and scary moments like the first invasion of the Japanese into the Cathedral and the 2 prostitutes in the city later on. The romance isn't a big part. There are some lighter moments of humor eg the makeover which is kind of astonishing. There are some touching and not over sentimental moments. The horror of the Massacre is shown but in a more intimate scale.Christian Bale does an earnest interpretation even though he has some silly parts in the beginning. Actress Ni Ni is quite beguiling as a courtesan with a heart of gold. Their relationship is a bit clichéd with a white man and a Chinese prostitute.The sets and productions are top notch and have an authentic and well photographed feel and look.Overall this movie is far more watchable and uniquely fascinating than expected. Don't miss it.",10,9,11,3 April 2012
The Way Back," Moving and epic
",This is a grand and touching movie about the human spirit and quest for freedom. A real great escape. Good points: Well directed makes you feel the cold of Siberea and the thirst and heat of the desert. The Gulag and its horrors are quite well portrayed. There is an epic sweep and some very beautiful scenery. The acting is good. Ronan does a good job. She looks the part is very angelic looking and provides a good balance to the male actors. Colin Farrell provides some comic relief though he is not too Russian in style. Ed Harris is always convincing and looks quite haggard for the role. Jim Sturgess is very competent - though not very Polish sounding - maybe it's better than a bad accent.Faults: Don't really get to know who the secondary cast are. Not much introduction to them prior to the march beginning or during the march. Maybe a bit less of the walk and a bit more background and later life would have balanced things a bit.

Begin Again," Keira can sing! Nice feel good movie about music making today
",This is a feel good movie about musicians making an album. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley play producer and song writer who team up to make a demo filmed all over the city. The songs are pleasant and the characters are sympathetic and likable even Hailee Steinfeld as Mark's daughter. There is a nice dynamic between the characters which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. There is almost as much music as a musical but it doesn't feel much like a musical.Who knew Keira could sing so well? She doesn't have the most powerful voice but her singing is musical and right for the type of songs. Mark looks suitably scruffy for the fallen on hard times composer. Nice cameo by Ceelo Green and Adam Levine who sings quite a few songs.Movies like this are pleasant and uplifting to watch - if you want a break from action or violence of summer blockbusters.,8,140,162,3 July 2014
The Book Thief," Moving and unexpected
","There are quite a few surprising things about this movie.Firstly it's not childish at all. The title and poster seem to imply that it's a children's movie about the war and books. Although the central character is a child - it's not a childish movie at all. It's a movie for adults too. And books aren't the main thing.Secondly although there is a Jewish character, the Holocaust is not the main subject here. Rather it's about good Germans - civilians who were just helplessly caught up in the events.Thirdly it's very moving and quite emotional in an unexpected way.Fourthly the acting is good. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are always good. Sophie Nelisse is cute and not annoying at all. Her acting is just right - restrained but effective.Overall this was one of the most moving less violent WWII movies ever made and deserved more acclaim than it got. Liked it more than Life is Beautiful, Boy in the Striped Pajamas etc.",10,3,6,11 May 2014
Horrible Bosses," Funniest comedy this year
",For those who remember '9 to 5' this is an up to date take on it and it succeeds because of a well written screenplay and a terrific bunch of actors. Enjoyed it from beginning to end. The scenes are delightful and the acting is superb especially the bosses. Jennifer has perfect timing and just the right amount of vamp for the role. Kevin Spacey is mischeviously menacing. Wish he would do more comedy. Colin Farrell is hardly recognizable but good. The employees are good to although they have to play it straight. There are many laugh out loud moments that are worth watching again because there are so many funny incidents. One of the best comedies in the last few years. We need to have more good comedies instead of just action and violence. Go see it.,Null,1,2,23 August 2011
Black Mass," Fascinating but screenplay is a bit unbalanced
","This fascinating true story about Irish gangster Whitey Bulger who is the brother of MA State Senator. Whitey becomes informant to the FBI to help take down the Mafia. In return they turn a blind eye to his shady dealings. The story requires some concentration as there are a lot of characters. The good point is that it's not too jumbled up. It's clear about the 'deal' and the character's motives and the gradual corruption of FBI agent John Connolly Whitey's childhood friend. The screenplay is a bit repetitive about these points and could have spent a little time on his early years and later fugitive years. Not enough of his personal life is shown as well. The focus is too much on the rub outs and the agents. There are several brutal killings but it's not too graphic by today's standards.The cast is stellar. Johnny Depp though not very Irish looking is quite convincingly made up and sinister with less hair and bad teeth. He is effective without overacting. Benedict Cumberbatch is a strange choice to play the senator brother, not looking like Depp at all and coming across quite British and reserved. Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons convincingly plays Whitey's sidekick Kevin Weeks. Joel Edgerton is well cast as the FBI childhood friend of Whitey. Corey Stoll has a small but effective role as a good guy who comes in to clean up things. Peter Sarsgaard is suitably druggie as the drug snorting associate. Dakota Johnson as the baby mama is surprisingly effective. More of Whitey's personal relationships could have been shown.Worth a watch for the fascinating true story.",8,2,16,18 September 2015
The Town," Exciting but needs subtitles
","Is there a different language in Charlestown MA? Couldn't understand half of what this crime gang was saying whether it was Blake, Ben or Jeremy. When the criminals were speaking, apart from the expletives most of the dialog was unintelligible.Ben Affleck does keep up the tension and pace as director.In the end it is a cops and robbers story which gets you on the side of the robbers. The central romance is unconvincing - in the end I can't see why he fell for her. Also the effort in going into the crime doesn't seem worth the payoff. If they were so smart and well equipped they should have been really rich by legitimate means. The story has a satisfying feel good ending - not too happy and not too depressing. Ben looks older and acts a bit better than when he was younger. He is no longer pretty so he can do these kinds of roles. Jeremy Renner is a good character actor. Blake Lively makes a good effort to be different from TV but she is a still too pretty for the role. Supermodel types just cannot be the most convincing white trash. Must admit I wanted to see more screen time for her though. Jon Hamm looks suitably haggard and down to earth as a cop - I can see more of him in this type of role. Rebecca Hall is too ugly / intelligent for this role. So the female leads were slightly miscast - but it is the big name cast especially for TV fans seeing Don Draper and Serena Van der Woodsen do different roles that is the main attraction.This is an engrossing if not perfect thriller.",6,0,2,21 October 2010
Shutter Island," Good not great
","This is a decent drama thriller. It's well shot and atmospheric. Not too violent like some of the new thrillers are. I didn't see expect the ending twist at all. So that was quite a well done twist. I'm glad there is an unambiguous conclusion. Shows clearly what the reality is. Doesn't leave you wondering. It's well acted but why does Leo like such unpleasant roles? There are a couple of bad points though they aren't major: If it was all an act feels a bit like you wasted your time. Imagery is quite unpleasant: holocaust, wards, kids. Maybe deserves a second watch to look out for things that fit into the twist.In the end it leaves a rather depressed feeling. The twist isn't as good as the Sixth Sense twist which was more poignant.",7,0,1,27 August 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Not as good as the first one - feels incomplete
",The problem with these sequels breaking up into 2 parts is that with the years in between you kind of forget what happened earlier. This movie felt half finished. The first one had the historical setting which made it interesting. I know they are trying to go in a new direction. They should have finished the Bucky story and shown some romance with Agent 13. There simply wasn't enough story for one movie over 2 hours long. What there was enough of was punching and kicking with fights between almost all the main characters.The cast did a good job with the material. Big role for Scarlett. Good to see Emily Vancamp from Revenge in a role here.So in the end the draggy moments got the better of the movie.,4,10,25,16 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Watch this even if you have Marvel fatigue
",I was exhausted by all the Marvel movies so felt a bit reluctant to see this but I was pleasantly surprised. Sure some things are still beyond understanding but there is something better about this movie.Benedict Cumberbatch is watchable and suited to the role. He isn't too ugly to be a hero because he just suits this strange hero.The story draws you in from his injury to his healing in Nepal. The space and time bending fight sequences are quite novel and not as confusing as you might imagine. Though I didn't get all their spells and the back and forth. I usually don't like Tilda Swinton in movies but here she was actually quite good. Rachel McAdams is a so lovely that it adds a human warmth and sweetness to a cast that would have been a bunch of mainly fine but not very attractive British and Continental actors.The visuals demand a big screen viewing and they are quite something.Watch this one even if you have Marvel fatigue.,8,2,4,3 November 2016
Interstellar," Spectacular, deafening, partly comprehensible
","The good points first. Liked it better than the other Nolan flicks: Inception and Transendence. The story is better. The first half with the start of the mission is quite moving and believable as the environmental catastrophe is quite plausible nowadays. There is some connection to the characters emotionally. The cast is as stellar as the title with a still gaunt Matthew with an inappropriate drawl, unlikely scientist Professor Anne Hathaway, lovely daughter played by Mackenzie Foy of Breaking Dawn and later the not seen enough Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine as Professor senior. The planetarium like space scenes are beautiful, realistic and spectacular. Going to the other planets was fascinating. Thank goodness no monsters and other aliens.The faults are as spectacular as the plus points. The soundtrack is deafening and cuts out dialog. For no good reason the music blasts cutting out dialog in many scenes. It's like being stuffed in a Cathedral Organ while it is being played. The second half of the movie with the time relativity stuff and saving the planet is partly incomprehensible. I concentrated but still didn't understand why one hour would be 7 years. The 'stay' thing just isn't explained well nor how the planet was saved with the information. Matt Damon isn't a good 'villain' at all. Bad choice.Overall it's worth a watch because it's just so grand and part of it is makes sense. At least can understand the broad picture. Just be prepared for some bewilderment and bring ear plugs.",7,4,13,6 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Original, dramatic and unexpectedly funny
",This unusual and original story grabs your attention and keeps it from start to finish. The story is just so unpredictable with a combination of drama emotion laugh out loud unexpected humor. The consequences of angry actions are the thread threads that weave through the story.The central role of grieving mother is perfectly suited to Frances McDormand. The way she delivers her caustic lines and the emotions she shows are just so her. Best role since Fargo for her.The actors are the best to play small town folk. Sam Rockwell as bad cop is terrific. Woody is warm and funny as the sheriff. A bevy of good support is provided by Peter Dinklage and Lucas Hedges.Worth watching.,9,4,8,4 January 2018
American Sniper," Politics aside - gripping movie about a dedicated soldier
","Putting politics aside, this is a terrific movie about the war in Iraq. This isn't a movie about whether the war is right or wrong it is about an excellent sniper who is totally convinced he is protecting troops with his skills. Things are shown from his point of view and the Iraqis he kills even children are shown as the ones attacking the troops. So immediately the viewer is on his side. Subsequently there is a more questionable incident involving a family. Whether his instructions were just or unjust, we see how well he carried them out. The screenplay is well paced. From the get go it is completely involving. Clint Eastwood's war movies have been rather draggy in the past but this one is almost like a different director was in charge. The civilian to battle switches are well balanced. It's more modern and matter of fact than 'Enemy at the Gates' which was a bit theatrical.Bradley Cooper is transformed physically into a bulky soldier and his facial expression shows determination. He inhabits this role convincingly. Occasionally his version of a Texan accent was a bit hard to understand. Sienna Miller looks beautiful as a brunette here and she acts well invoking sympathy without overdoing it. She is talented and lovely and should be a bigger star than she is. Hopefully this will propel her to more leading roles. The soldiers on Kyle's team are played by Jake McDorman and Luke Grimes and you get to know them just enough to feel when they are killed.The ending which everyone will know going into this movie is a problem. I can understand they didn't want to show the terrible tragedy of his being killed by a PTSD suffering vet and let Kyle go out as a hero. I think it should have been shown because it is such an integral part of his story and it would really bring home that the tragedy of the war goes on after the fighting is over. They do show injured vets and amputees but this was an opportunity to highlight psychological damage as well.If you can put aside feelings about the correctness of the war this is a very good movie. It does show Kyle using the term savages to refer to Iraqis. If that's the way he was then might as well show how he was an unfortunate product of the times. Maybe by showing his total dedication it will make policy makers realize the responsibility they have in using such a skilled soldier in the proper way.",9,10,28,23 January 2015
The Lost City of Z," Fascinating journey of an explorer but kind of depressing
","The story of an early 20th Century British explorer in the Amazon with 8 lives - not 9 as we will find out.The cast is good Sienna Miller as a supportive wife and dumb mother, Robert Pattinson uglied up in a supporting role - quite convincing, and Charlie Hunnam as the explorer who can't seem to survive without danger. His journeys are quite scary but what did he really achieve? Then fighting in WW1 trenches after that is just too much.OMG the ending is so depressing. Father and son dumb and dumber. Both of them being cannibalized or worse? With the advent of airplanes they didn't need to go by land. What's wrong with the 2 of them? And to go alone at the end? It's good they had an unhappy ending because it's realistic but be warned it's kind of depressing.Don't know if it was the cinema where I saw this but the cinematography seemed a bit dark.",6,4,8,17 May 2017
Ant-Man," Finally a Marvel movie that is completely enjoyable
","This movie is not just enjoyable, it's pointing the right direction for Marvel movies to take. It works because it is missing a few things that have bogged down recent Marvel movies. Absent is the over convoluted plot that takes itself too seriously. Absent is the absurd angst that is out of place in a comic book adaptation. Instead it is fun but exciting family friendly without being childish and has lead actors that have a good chemistry between them.Michael Douglas who looks amazingly young in the flash back makes a welcome return to the big screen and his expert delivery of lines makes his character believable. Also well cast is the lovely and alluring Evangeline Lily of Lost fame. She looks smart and endearing at the same time. Paul Rudd has finally found a good big screen role and an action one no less that suits his winning style. Instead of lamer and lamer comedies, the role of Ant Man is just right for him. Corey Stoll is such a versatile actor showing he is just as good as the bad guy (without overacting) as a sympathetic good guy. He is convincingly evil.Even if the battles are relatively small scale, the interesting plays with size and unique scenarios make the action more watchable than the last Avengers.Worth watching!",9,0,8,21 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Funny and crude
",Generally funny and crude. There are some laugh out loud funny scenarios in the first part. Some of the one liners are hilarious and unexpected. Liked the contrast between high school then and now. As with most of today's successful comedies the crudeness is to be expected but I think it relied more on crudeness during the middle to end. Loses a bit of steam in the middle.Channing is right for his role as the dumb popular guy. Jonah is alright too though not that funny as I would have expected in parts. Cute cameos. The directing is a bit rushed around the jokes themselves and some are lost in the speed.Overall worth a watch.,7,1,2,2 October 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Better than expected
",Overall this movie is quite enjoyable. The historical World War 2 setting gives it some depth and meaning. Chris Evans is likable and its quite amusing seeing his skinny version so all nerds out there can identify with his character. How did they do that? Hayley Atwell is a fiesty non English rose type (maybe because she is part American anyway). Stanley Tucci's German accent is a bit laughable might have been better casting a European instead. Doesn't rely on violence and overdone CGI for excitement so it's quite suitable for the family. The weapons seem a bit high performance for the time period but that's a small thing. Go see it on the big screen.,Null,5,12,25 August 2011
American Hustle," A showcase of fine acting - story could have been slightly clearer
",This rewarding true story of two con artists in the70s who are forced to assist the FBI is enjoyable and worth watching for the terrific performances Christian Bale gives a convincing accent and performance with his scary toupee. His partner in crime is played by Amy Adams who is given a racy role to show of her versatility as an actress and she looks stunning. Her low cut dresses were a bit overdone though. Jennifer Lawrence is very funny as the idiot wife. Bradley Cooper is alright but his role isn't that demanding.The only minus point is that I got lost a couple of times in the latter third of the movie. The narrative could have been clearer. With such a complicated plot it helps to not break up the continuity and explain things a bit.,8,1,10,26 December 2013
Rush," Rush to see this on the big screen
","This movie succeeds on many levels. As a movie about racing it's well photographed and exciting. As a story of the two racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Ron Howard's deliberate pace is just right here showing two different personalities both likable and human. In fact because both are so sympathetically portrayed I wanted both to win and it the races had as much meaning as the Ben Hur chariot race. There is a good balance of humor and drama. There may have been some liberties taken to play up the rivalry between the two but it's forgivable.The acting is top notch. Chris Hemsworth gives charisma and charm to the role and shows he can do much more than Thor. Daniel Bruhl of Inglorious uglies up and gives such a touching performance especially after the accident. Olivia Wilde has a brief but effective appearance as Suzy Hunt.Even if you aren't a Formula 1 fan it's still very watchable especially on the big screen. This movie deserves to be a bigger hit than it has been.",10,2,3,21 October 2013
Nightcrawler," A darkly comic original and exciting masterpiece
","This is a very funny, dark, exciting, original satire on the terrible state of voyeuristic headline journalism today. Kudos to director writer Dan Gilroy. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a man who captures crimes and accidents and their aftermaths on camera to sell to news channels. There is a 'Breaking Bad' type of very dark humor amidst a morally bankrupt context. There are some very funny scenes with his assistant Rick - the interview and the salary negotiation. So to his 'date' with news director (Renee Russo) is quite laugh out loud. The climax is exciting and disturbing at the same time. Jake Gyllenhaal is made up to look particularly ghoulish and gives a spellbinding performance as this anti-hero with few redeeming features. He delivers his originally hilarious lies with the business like terms perfectly. Renee is well cast as the slightly over the hill, big haired, morally questionable news director. I didn't think her look suited romantic roles well in the past but here she has found a good fit for her physical type. This is one of the best and most original movies of the year and deserves accolades in the upcoming award season.",10,2,5,4 December 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Well balanced biopic
",Rami Malek is an actor who gives a 110% performance and he does look like Freddie Mercury towards the end. In the beginning he doesn't resemble him so much because he is a bit too slender and small and his face more irregular than Freddie.The movie strikes a good balance between the various aspects of his life. The creative process and the success and the Live Aid performance are given prominence. Unlike modern biopics it doesn't focus too much on the salacious or perverted parts of his life. Though they do show his love interests of both sexes. The beginning of onset of AIDS is shown but not his decline and death.A good reminder of how much his music has made a mark on popular culture.,8,3,4,29 January 2019
Baby Driver," Cute & stylish with great music and super car chases
","For this kind of heist movie this turned out to be watchable and slightly different. You may think you've seen enough heist movies but this one has a fresh approach. A terrific getaway driver has to do some jobs to pay off a debt to a big boss but then the boss isn't finished with his services. What sets this apart is the tasteful use of music and songs throughout, angelic looking Ansel Elgort as Baby, and some watchable enough vehicular action. Lily James is a sweet love interest as Debora the waitress and the team of robbers consisting of big boss Kevin Spacey, a haggard looking Jon Hamm and the always entertaining Jamie Fox. LIked the complete ending - didn't leave you hanging.This is a nice way to do an action thriller - have A list likable cast - not too much violence and enough charm in the characters and story.",8,4,8,21 July 2017
Justice League," A Gal Gadot spectacular
",Just when you think there are just too many superhero movies that are taking themselves too seriously one comes along like this that is a step back in the right direction. Gal Gadot makes this movie worth watching. Every time she appears she lights up the screen. Luckily she appears regularly from start to finish. Kind of wish I was watching Wonder Woman II. The in between parts are bearable but Ben Affleck looks tired. As for the story itself the whole reincarnation of Superman thing is a bit silly. Don't really get the villain Steppenwolf's story. Sometimes it seems like a Superman & Wonder Woman photo shoot as the photogenic pair pose and posture. That isn't a complaint just a fact. Getting introduced to the Flash and Aquaman was moderately diverting.One thing that was quite good was the humor that was quite spontaneous and funny. The Flash has some good lines. Keeping it lighter made this one better.,7,2,4,8 December 2017
Man of Steel," Terrific cast - lots of action but a bit too serious
","This is a visually stunning exciting serious movie. It's different from the Christopher Reeve version. It shows a lot more background about Krypton, Zod (quite noble here), Clark's childhood angst, his adult angst. I know it is no point to do a similar plot and so they have made some interesting changes in the Lois and Clark relationship. The action sequences are over the top and range from Smallville to Metropolis to space.The cast is almost perfectly chosen. Amy Adams is the ideal Lois Lane -charming and brave. Her role is sufficiently proactive. Diane Lane is moving and believable as Martha Kent. Russell Crowe is usually a bit grumpy looking but here he is alright. Chris Meloni is a good U.S. commander. Michael Shannon (who knew Boardwalk would lead to this) is quite a sympathetic and charismatic Zod. As for the comic book handsome Henry Cavill, he completely looks the part of Superman. It's too bad he has to look gloomy and scruffy for a good part of the movie. The new blue suit is an improvement on the older one with a more modern color. A few faults: The music was a highlight of the 80s version with the 'Superman Theme' and 'Can you read my mind' which are still memorable today. This 2013 film had a completely forgettable score. The climactic fighting and smashing into roads buildings is a bit overdone and repetitive. A few clever and original action sequences without so much destruction would have been better. But even if they went overboard, too much action is better than the Brandon Routh version which just sank.I missed the charm and humor of the Reeve version (eg the magic of the first flight with Lois) are not found here. Just a couple of chuckles in 2013. Some lighter moments might have made Superman a more rounded hero than some gloomy Dark Knight kind of action figure. Superman needs to be more fun than the other Avengers and Marvel heroes. Hopefully a sequel will go more into these other aspects of romance and humor.",Null,12,25,13 June 2013
The Revenant," Much more than just a bear attack
","The direction of this movie is stunning. The movie starts with an attack that is the most exciting since Last of the Mohicans. One is really placed in the thick of things with the expert cinematography and direction. The bear attack is unbearably terrifying. Story: There is more to the story than just making it home after being mauled and left for dead. It has a significant Native American aspect. Politically correct in handling the Native American portrayals for a 21st century movie, the villains, murderers of women and children and rapists are mostly the French soldiers and trappers and the main bad guy is named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The only thing I didn't like about the story is why only 2 of them went out to look for Fitzgerald. Also the fight scene at the end was just overkill. Made it end in a formula Western way when it should have been above than that.Acting: Acting is generally good. Leonardo is convincing in his pain hunger and suffering in the snow and freezing water. Give him an Oscar just for the physical hardship alone. The mainly British supporting cast is good too. Will Poulter is good as the kind of dimwit. The main problem with the casting is that some of them look alike. Better to have had some with different colored hair and no beard for some. The Captain and Fitzgerald look a bit alike. Tom Hardy as the villain mumbles. Couldn't understand most of what he said. Unnecessary to have such a thick accent when the others were speaking more or less normally. A gut wrenching and exciting film.",9,2,5,4 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Timely but missing some crucial scenes
","This meticulously made and filmed movie is fascinating and topical considering the state of relations with Russia today.Some crucial things that should have been shown are left out. This movie had too much focus on Tom Hank's character Jim Donovan and his negotiations. It's interesting including the details of his catching a cold and the state of Berlin after the War but it sacrificed the broader picture. I think they could have shown the impact of the incidents on the relationship between Heads of State Eisenhower and Kruschev. Next, the shooting down of Power's plane was exciting but the movie should have shown him getting caught on the ground and paraded around Russia on TV. Thirdly, I wasn't sure how Abel was spying apart from the coin paper and how he was caught. Not very clear. Also I don't know if the silly student really got held up because he was so whipped about a fraulein but I found it so irritating that the whole negotiations could have been ruined by a silly infatuation. Leave him in East Germany - he deserved it considering what was at stake.The movie really plays the unsung hero card making him scorned by the public and his ungrateful boss (as always Alan Alda plays a schmuck to perfection). Mark Rylance is effective as Abel. Austin Stowell makes a suitably stunned looking Powers.Bottom line worth watching as a timely warning not to get into another cold war but the movie could have been better.",7,1,3,30 October 2015
Split," NOT a comeback for sure - time to stop making movies M Night
",What a disappointment this movie was. From good reviews I expected something like the best movie of M Night since the Sixth Sense. It turned out to be one of his worst. I give up on him. Everything since the Sixth Sense has been a let down.The story is awful - not clever just irritating and unpleasant. 3 teenagers get kidnapped by a man with split personalities. Of course you want to see what happens if the girls live or die but it wasn't scary just boring and predictable.It's good Betty Buckley had a big role as the psychiatrist. She is so talented she deserves a resurrection in her film career. Unfortunately the character she plays is rather dumb. James MacAvoy tries hard with the material - A for effort. But he is not Sally Field in Sybil.Unequivocally this movie is no good.,1,2,9,6 July 2017
Hugo," Annoying characters and an unimaginably boring story
",Please don't watch this terrible movie. The story is very slow. Each one of the characters is hateful unpleasant and annoying. You don't feel for any of the silly people. The boy Asa is not cute. Baron Cohen's character is a terrible monster. I can't see any children sitting through this boring mess. It's not for adults either. Who cares about the silly robot and who cares about the primitive films that Ben Kingsley's character made? After being so unpleasant the sudden change of heart at the end is abrupt and illogical. Their English accents were all out of place.The station was colourfully recreated and some scenes are quite picturesque but the story just doesn't involve or captivate.Martin Scorsese's worst movie ever. Time to retire old man.,1,10,18,7 March 2012
U-571," Confusing and unbelievable
",If you accept it as a fictional submarine battle movie than it's an okay watch for die hard WW2 movie fans. But bear in mind there are some faults. The first storming of the U571 was confusing with too much machine gun fire and it was hard to keep track of what happened to some of the characters. That's simply bad directing. Later on there were too many violent explosions on the submarine for them not to have sunk immediately. Sometimes less is more. Things get a outrageously unbelievable as the battle proceeds.There was some noise about historical inaccuracies but face it would Hollywood make a movie about British finding an Enigma machine in a submarine? How are they going to put Matthew McConaughey in it?,3,1,2,6 September 2016
Salt," Exciting - need to keep up with it
","This is a very exciting thriller. It' a bit confusing at the end and you need to keep up with the twists.Jolie is a pleasure to watch. She captures your attention at every move. The action and car chases are quite original and well done.In the second half the plot twists are unexpected and fun - a bit confusing but if you take the time to think about it, it does all fit together. Wish it had been a bit more clearly spelt out at the end to make it really obvious who everyone really was doing what to whom. Ending is a bit abrupt I wish it went on a bit longer. Took me about 20 minutes after the movie finished to figure it all out. You need to concentrate a bit, but at least its fun to watch and very thrilling - more fun than Inception anytime.Supporting cast is a little forgettable.Do watch this one.",7,3,6,17 August 2010
We're the Millers," Very funny - everything works.
","Surprisingly this movie is extremely funny and gets funnier as it goes along. It's well written and original with a combination of funny situations and one liners. The characters are endearing. Unlike the comedies these days which rely on excessive crudeness, this one doesn't. Yet the jokes are current enough especially the Border jokes.The cast of the fake family smuggling drugs is terrific. Jennifer Aniston has cornered many of the best comedies of recent years and she deserves it. She still is very slim enough to pull off the stripper role tastefully. Jason Sudeikis is suited to his role as drug dealer - brings to mind an updated Chevy Chase in the National Lampoon movies. Emma Roberts is also well cast as the sulky runaway. Will Poulter as the 18 year old virgin has such a comically hilarious face. He has some of the funniest scenes. Supporting cast is good too.Really good comedies are few and far between maybe one or two a year - go see it in the cinema.",10,2,8,9 September 2013
Apocalypse Now," A brave fantasy but not the greatest Vietnam war movie for sure
","If you want a good movie about the Vietnam War watch Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth for the effect on the Vietnamese, watch Casualties of War for war crimes on the Vietnamese, or Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or Deer Hunter for the effect on the soldiers. For the impact of the War on the Cambodians, watch The Killing Fields. Apocalypse now is not mainly about the Vietnamese or Cambodians even though it is set there. It is a fictional dark fantasy allegorical tale inspired by Conrad about the ugliness of the Vietnam war and what it did to the soldiers fighting it. It's brave for the time, but it's by no means the greatest of the Vietnam War movies because it is so unreal.In 1979 when this was released, the Vietnam war hadn't been over that long. This movie was an anti war statement showing the effect of the war on soldiers. Contrasting the ugly behavior of the soldiers fire bombing peaceful villages to Wagner and killing civilian fishermen and women. The ugly Playboy entertainment that gets out of hand shows the soldiers at their most base and primal. Finally holed up in a Cambodian temple they resort to some pagan mass murdering decapitating barbaric tribal society. Martin Sheen is good. Look out for young Lawrence Fishburne and Harrison Ford. But Marlon Brando is too overweight to have been a military man.Brave, unreal and not the greatest.",7,1,4,15 January 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Feel good comedy - Jennifer is good but an Oscar?
","This was better than I expected. It's an amusing not too serious look at mental illness bipolar, add, addiction. The characters are quite endearing all round and the upbeat feel of the story and dance climax are what makes this a hit. The humor is surprising and fresh. The romance itself was expected but the evolution of it wasn't that clear. They seemed to be just getting friendly then suddenly they are supposed to be all in love. How did it happen? Bradley's character Pat looks pretty sane compared to some people I know but it's light hearted so that's okay. Jennifer's performance is good but not Oscar worthy. A nomination would have sufficed. Her delivery is convincing but her face wasn't that expressive here, I think she was better in Winter's Bone. Despite the age gap her chemistry with Bradley is good. Robert de Niro as Pat's father looks older here than of late. Interesting to see his OCD as a milder form of mental illness. Chris Tucker has put on weight and isn't as funny as expected.Overall worth a watch.",8,0,2,2 June 2013
Divergent," Much better than similar movies
",The story is so much better than 'Hunger Games' which I found sickeningly stupid. The more intelligent premise of Divergent is involving and you feel more for the characters. Even though the movie is long is moves a long and is well directed and well paced. The fight scenes aren't overdone which makes it convincing.The cast is likable and well cast like in Twilight. Shailene Woodley is actually good and sympathetic here seeming vulnerable and feisty at the same time. She isn't as beautiful as Lily Collins in Mortal Instruments but she is a very believable actress here. Theo James looks a bit older than her but they have good chemistry. Supporting cast is good too. Liked seeing Ashley Judd on the big screen again and she looks like she could be Shailene's mother. Maggie Q is quite a welcome presence too. Kate Winslet is suitably loathsome without overdoing it.Looking forward to the next installment.,9,2,9,16 April 2014
Ender's Game," Visually stunning but it's meant for teens
",For someone who was unfamiliar with the story I thought this was an okay watch because of it's visuals. But bear in mind I feel it's a teenagers show. I think adults may find it childish. Visually it's quite spectacular. The games and battles are beautifully shot.The story is really meant for teenage science fiction fans. Doesn't have the universal appeal of a Star Wars story. The young kids saving the planet is fun in a kids fantasy but that's all. At least the violence and concept weren't revolting like in the Hunger Games.Harrison Ford is a little old for the role. Middle aged actor would have been better than an elderly one. Asa Butterfield from the tedious Hugo has a lot to carry on this shoulders in the role and he does a good job with the role he is given - feisty and vulnerable at the same time. Hailee Steinfeld is suited to her role too. Can't imagine they could cast her as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet though she isn't romantic role beautiful.Overall it's a grandly done kids movie - that's all.,5,1,4,6 November 2013
The White Ribbon," Fascinating a must see
","I'm not generally one to watch German language black and white movies with subtitles. But this movie turned out anything but boring. What a fascinating and voyeuristic look into the German village in the early part of the 20th Century. At first it seems like a tale of village life then things get more sinister. There are deliberate 'accidents', beatings, acts of revenge, abuse and cruelty. It is interspersed with unexpected romance and humor ( I thought the Doctor and the midwife were hilarious during their breakup).Such an unusual matter of fact tale - horrible things happen but it isn't a horror movie. It's so great to see a horror without fright tactics. It's not chilling but more enlightening. Occasionally it's like a Continental high brow soap drama. It never stays one thing or another for long.At first it is a bit hard to tell the many characters apart esp the children apart but it gets easier.There are many things you can read into the meaning of the movie - was it the rise of Nazi sentiment in early 20th Century Germany or is it more a general explanation of cruelty? The cycle of cruelty is what is clear though - parents or children its for the viewer to decide who is worse.It purposely doesn't have a conclusive ending leaving many questions unanswered. At first I wished everything had been tied up neatly. But after thinking about it I felt I didn't really need to know - the viewer doesn't have any more answers than one could get in real life sometimes. This is one of the most unique things about this movie.",9,0,2,9 April 2011
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Exciting funny story with lost of action
",The story is quite a humorously written action version of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. The original fairytale gets covered quickly with the house made of candy and the witch. Fast forward to the pair of adult witch slayers. Liked the modern dialog thrown in eg the fan stuff. Also the weapons were inventive with the version of modern guns. The explanation of the parents story is clever and the troll and good witches complete the plot well.The violence makes this one for only older teens upwards. It has lost of killings and lots of fighting - maybe too much punching and kicking and exploding bodies. Still not as graphically violent as a Quentin movie. The witches are a refreshing villain - we have had too many zombies and vampires. Their powers seemed way too strong though.I always thought Famke Janssen is more suited to the villain role and she is well cast here as the evil witch. Gemma is quite suited to her tomboyish role. Jeremy Renner is a strange pick. Someone a bit more leading man looking would have been a better choice.Overall worth a watch for more mature audiences.,8,1,2,5 August 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rooney Mara gives a stunning performance as a most unorthodox heroine
","The most memorable thing about this movie must watching the anti-heroine Lisbeth. Rooney Mara gives and unforgettable performance. She played the European street urchin so well that if I didn't know she was an American I would never have guessed it. Her persona is so effectively weird and yet totally fascinating. For what she went through for this role she deserves some awards for sure.I found that as a film adaptation it was good. There are things I didn't like about the story itself though.Casting: As the central reporter character Daniel Craig looks suitably weatherbeaten to be a middle aged Scandinavian. Christopher Plummer is always a welcome stately presence - how does he do it at his age? Joely is good. Stellan is suitable. Robin Wright came across as not very European even though she tried to put a slight accent on. Would have been better with someone like Kristin Scott Thomas. Anyway liked that they all had slight but not overly obtrusive Swedish accents.Production is good - the cold and depressing Scandinavian city and countryside in winter feel really comes through. I didn't read the books or watch the Swedish film versions so I came to watch this movie not knowing much about what was in store. There are problems with the story that it's not fair blame the movie for. For example: if she was so smart how come she was in such a pathetic position before. Surely she would have got out her financial problems by some other scheme. Also how she became such a Mission Impossible agent in Zurich is far fetched though the transformation is fun to watch. The story had some twists for the sake of twists. The salacious bits are too unpleasant. The lesbianism is just there to titillate. The sexual violence is distasteful. But these are all faults of the storyline and the film is bound by the story. Some of the details are a bit rushed for people who are unfamiliar wi th the story as time is short. Whatever the faults, the complex and scary Lisbeth is just thoroughly engrossing from start to finish. It's quite a feat that the story makes you on her side and triumph in her successes.Overall its an atmospheric transporting experience with a real European mystery feel that I haven't felt since good old movies like The Odessa File. The story may be a little too unpleasant in parts. However in the end the character of Lisbeth - one of the most unusual and unlikely heroes in the history of movies makes this worth a watch for mature audiences.",8,2,7,9 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The best Mission Impossible
",The multinational plot involving the 'IMF' vs 'the Syndicate' is surprisingly clear and you can follow it without too much effort. The excellent direction lets you see everything you want to see without wasted scenes. The action is original fun and exciting from the Vienna Opera House to the underwater sequence to the motorcycle chase through Morocco. Incorporates everything you want to see from MI involving getting out of impossible situations. Music is effective using the main theme and Puccini.The cast may not seem very glamorous at first sight. The mainly British supporting cast are pretty droll. Strong and masterful breakout role for the 'White Queen's' Rebecca Ferguson as an enigmatic British agent. She holds her own action wise in fight scenes and subterfuge. She has an intelligent look that recalls Ingrid Bergman. Tom Cruise in his 50s can still make the action convincing and exciting. Look how out of shape his contemporaries from Top Gun have become compared to him.Best action movie this year.,10,11,21,30 July 2015
Dunkirk," Some very well filmed scenes and some very glaring faults.
","This movie is a mix of very good and very bad. The good parts are superb but the faults are glaring. First of all the bad parts. The soundtrack is terrible and intrusive. Good music would have made a world of a difference. The dialog is 75% incomprehensible either behind masks or with excessively heavy accents. The movie jumps from one scenario to another too often breaking up the narrative and causing confusion. Night and day seem to be mixed up - suddenly it's day time in the air then night time on the boat and back and forth. Some of the things that are shown seem hardly worth screen time like the 17 year old boy dying and Cillian Murphy's character with his shell shock. With all the brave stories to tell why so much of that awful story?Good points: This is no Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor movie with it's silly love triangle. Quite an antidote to those war movies with too much love story. It's all Dunkirk.The airplane battles are quite well filmed.Some of the scenes are the most tense in War movie history. Worth mentioning are the scenes on the ships when the torpedo strikes, bombing of ships and the men in the water with the fire on them, and strafing on the pier are second to none. The action is really seems in your face. The downed pilot almost drowning was quite scary. But the part with men being shot while hiding in the beached ship seemed overkill. Good that they mentioned how the evacuees weren't sent enough ships and planes for the evacuation and how civilians had to help.This movie is still worth a watch for the great parts.",7,11,25,20 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Quite funny actually - not as bad as the reviews!
",I was expecting the worst with all the bad reviews. But I actually found myself laughing out loud at many parts of this movie. Cameron is always a great comedian. She is funny and charming. Plus she looks prettier and less haggard than of late. I liked the feel good story - it wasn't irritating - the situations are amusing and work themselves out well. Her character is a likable kind of 'bad'. It isn't slapstick or draggy - you wan't to see her succeed. The supporting cast is good. The British actress Lucy Punch is quite versatile. Jason Segel isn't as annoying as usual. Justin doesn't have that big a role thank goodness - he just isn't a great actor. Give this one a chance. It's actually pretty above average!,Null,1,4,17 October 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Different and better
","Going into this movie I was wondering what else they could do after all the recent Tobey and Kristen movies. I was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be different - more serious, with good acting and a compelling story that leads into a sequel.Andrew Garfield is a good actor if a bit mutant looking. He is quite good in the role. Emma Stone can play a wide range of ages and looks quite convincing as a high school student. She is more vulnerable and expressive than Kristen Dunst was in her role. Sally Field provides high quality supporting cast.The scenes of NYC and the swinging around are as good as can be expected.Liked it better than the Tobey versions. Looking forward to the sequel.",8,3,7,13 January 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Shocking weight loss of the actors aside, interesting lesson about the FDA
",One of the most memorable things is the weight loss to the two lead actors both Matthew and Jared. Jared Leto is unrecognizable as the mincing cross dresser. Matthew is painfully thin especially considering what he used to look like. Apart from the weight loss Matthew does give a convincing and believable performance. So does Jared. Their performances are deserving of the awards won so far. Jennifer Garner is less perky than usual and is good too. The story doesn't drag and has some humor and light heartedness which keeps it from getting too depressing. Maybe it didn't have to emphasize the drugs and promiscuity quite that much - just enough to show how he was infected.What is unexpected is how interesting the story about the treatment drugs and the FDA. Not since And the Band Played On has there been such a good movie about the disease from a medical scientific point. The government interference in the best treatment and having to go abroad for better options is a good lesson for any disease.,9,1,1,23 January 2014
Now You See Me," Clever fun unexpected
",The story about a group of diverse magicians assembled for a purpose that isn't clear till the end. There is fun magic in different locations and a few twists and turns that are not what you'd expect.I thought this might be a crime caper in the vein of Ocean's etc but it was way more interesting.The cast is good because it doesn't rely too much on one cast member. Jesse Dave and Isla lack star quality to lead a movie so they are fine in supporting roles. Woody looks younger than of late. Mark Ruffalo is suitably disheveled and bewildered. Melanie Laurent is quite lovely to look at as the Interpol agent assisting Mark. Hope she gets more English speaking roles - all she need to do is improve the clarity of her English pronunciation a little. Morgan Freeman - seems to be in every other movie is alright.There was some critique about the ending not resolving things enough and leaving too many red herrings unanswered. I think the ending is clear about what happened if you had concentrated throughout but it was a bit rushed in not showing enough flashbacks of the explanation of things. Still liked the feel good story and momentum of the movie - it doesn't drag and keeps you guessing.Worth a watch - good plot dialog humor and enough originality with a feel good ending.,9,0,2,16 July 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A buffet of stars doesn't a good movie make.
","This is a grand long stuffed full of characters movie which will satisfy fans but can try the patience at times.Some scenes in this movie are good like the slowing down of time take down with Peter and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) speaking Vietnamese. This movie has a lot of characters new and old - some only get a few minutes of screen time. Hard to identify the new ones. Peter Dinklage with his distinctive voice is quite a good addition. Fan Bing Bing is more or less silent but pretty. Hugh Nicholas James and Michael are all quite good and convincing.The logic defying time traveling story needs some concentration and pre knowledge of the other movies. I liked X Men First Class for it's historical setting and this one has a some with the Vietnam context. Nixon is quite well done. All the fighting and then it didn't happen feel like a waste of time. In the end I didn't really care which character was trying to stop which one and was quite glad it was over.Overall die hard fans will be happy but for moderate fans it's a bit trying at times. First Class was more palatable, this one has some plus points but it's not as good.",5,3,6,27 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Finish up already!
",There isn't enough story for this plot to be stretched out over so many movies and so many years. This movie should have been the end of it. They have taken this Bucky story which isn't that interesting and made several movies around it. Enough! Liked Emily Van Camp here need more of her. Not sure about Tom Holland as Spiderman. A bit too puny for a superhero even Spiderman.The so called civil war was surprisingly watchable even if it didn't really make much sense. At least you could understand who was fighting who. Still it's grandly made and not too headache inducing.Please wrap it up!,6,11,22,6 September 2016
Jackie," Natalie is quite right but the movie has some faults
",This voyeuristic but fascinating biopic is worth a watch. This movie is pretty intimate. It shows a lot of detail not shown before in depictions of the assassination and the aftermath.A more linear sequences of events would have been better. The flashbacks weren't good for the momentum of the story.Of all the actresses to play her Natalie actually is pretty acceptable. She imitates the whisper like voice but sometimes too much so couldn't make out the dialog. Some actresses in recent years eg Katie Holmes and Ginnifer Goodwin were glaringly out of place. Natalie captures her elegance and her small stature is camouflaged well. The actor wo plays JFK doesn't figure much but looks like him. Something about Peter Sarsgaard isn't right for Bobby - not wiry enough.One major fault is the film score is loud and obtrusive. Something classical would have been better.,6,0,3,24 January 2017
No Strings Attached," No chemistry between the leads
",The main reason this movie isn't good is that their is too little chemistry between Asthon and Natalie. Physically he is too big for her. In terms of persona they are too incompatible as well. They look like they could never hook up in real life.Natalie Portman isn't right for romantic comedies. She has a pretty face but since her body is so small she has very little sex appeal required for a romantic lead. Ashton was never a good actor but here he looked even goofier than usual. It wasn't charming just amateurish.Kevin Kline is miscast and his performance is painful. I don't understand how this movie was such a hit at the box office.,2,6,8,28 August 2012
The Duchess," Fascinating for its modern day parallels but some faults
","This is a serious and fascinating movie worth watching for it's depiction of marriage in its time period and for good performances from Keira and Ralph. There are many parallels with Princess Diana's life shown in the movie like how everyone in the country is in love with her except her husband (especially since the Duchess was related to Diana). This took place hundreds of years ago so like women of the time, she initially accepts the unloving nature of her husband who doesn't talk to her and cheats almost from the start. They really had no choice then as the dilemma of the divorced woman having few rights is shown.Ralph Fiennes is convincing and chilling as the cold husband. Keira actually acts very well and you feel for her unhappiness especially when giving up her love child.There are a few faults. Miscasting is one of them. Firstly Dominic Cooper is not handsome or dashing enough to sweep her off her feet. They could have chosen someone with more leading man looks for this role. Secondly Haley Atwell as Lady Elisabeth Foster doesn't look at all like and English rose. She has a more modern multi ethnic look and is out of place. The movie should have gone on a bit longer showing briefly how the rest of her life played out and her various highs and lows like political achievements and gambling problem. Bit too much focus on the menage a trois aspect. Although the costumes are grand the English countryside and houses could have been more beautifully portrayed.The first time I watched this I didn't enjoy it. Found it a bit gloomy and depressing. But the second time I watched it I had visited the house of the Duchess 'Chatsworth' and read up a bit about her life and figured out who was who. I appreciated it more and liked it.",Null,0,0,25 August 2011
Mamma Mia!," They can't sing at all!
",I've seen the Broadway show which was energetic and enjoyable. The movie version was much much worse - totally amateurish.Casting: What were they thinking using a cast that totally couldn't sing except for Dominic Cooper. The grownups were all 10 years too old for their roles. Meryl Streep cannot sing at all. She looked too fat. Must she take every role? Even those she is not suitable for. Branski was frightful as usual. Pierce Brosnan's voice was too weak. Stellan was too unattractive to be in this movie. The whole thing looked like an amateur playhouse version of the Broadway musical. Why didn't they chose actors in their forties not sixties. Amanda Seyfried with her bulgy eyes just isn't pretty enough for one of the leads - she is a supporting actress at best.The pretty scenery didn't even help because the singing was just so bad. If you enjoyed the stage version stay away from this dud or it will spoil your memories.,1,13,21,24 January 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Frustratingly incomplete but at least there is some action
","This trilogy shouldn't have been a trilogy. There just isn't enough story. After watching the first part which was so dragged out and inconsequential this second part finally had some action and excitement in the river and dragon fight, it ends before the real climax.Everything was dragged out and unnecessarily so. The river fight was well done but twice as long as it should be. The dragon was too chatty and long winded. Reminded me of the Gollum conversations. Gandalf's fight with the orcs was superfluous. Actually we have seen too many orcs. Enough! At least compared to part 1 there was some action and a hint of dwarf elf romance. Other good points are the beautiful scenery. The new supporting cast are good. Evangeline Lilly from Lost as an only in the movie character, a female elf fighter is quite good and beautiful. Both she and Orlando Bloom's Legolas have some pretty good fighting sequences. Luke Evans as Bard the Bowman is quite convincing too. It's nice to have something else to look at than middle aged vagrant looking types with British accents running around the forest. Can't believe we have to wait for another movie to finish things up. Two parts would have been enough.",3,20,51,12 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Surprisingly touching
","You may think you have seen enough terminal romances but surprisingly this one works. Even though you can expect some predictability and clichés, this tear jerker romance is engaging and watchable. It doesn't get too cute too often. Good twist.Good job on how they made up Shailene Woodley to look tired around the eyes but not too sickly. For this kind of role she is quite dignified and restrained. Ansel Elgort smiles a bit too much at first but later on his sad face is touching. The trip to Amsterdam is enchanting and the valiant visit to Anne Frank's house is quite touching. At first I thought that the pairing would be strange with the sibling casting in Divergent but didn't really figure because the settings are different.The Willem Dafoe writer thing is a bit annoying but it's good contrast so show how in real life everyone isn't all sweetness when it comes to cancer. The bitterness and bile are the reality check in this movie.Overall worth a watch.",8,1,4,23 July 2014
To Rome With Love," Very funny parts even if it's not Midnight
",How nice to have Woody Allen's humorous look at Italian culture and people especially the paparazzi element. Wonder what country will be next? The formula of different stories intersecting in a European city works.Great to have Judy Davis acting in one of Woody's tailor made roles again. Penelope Cruz is quite good as the sexy Italian. Alec Baldwin's thing with Jesse Eisenberg wore a bit thin. Ellen Page is good. Woody has a good role for himself here. The interesting and not internationally known (except for Roberto) Italian cast lend an authentic flavor and there are lots of subtitles. The opera scenes are hilarious and my favorite.It's not as magical or delightful as Midnight in Paris. But it's not fair to compare it to that gem. We can't expect more of that style anyway. It's a thoroughly pleasant comedy with some unexpected original laughs and is well worth a watch.,8,2,6,4 October 2012
Bridesmaids," Not funny just painful - way overrated
",I don't understand the success of this generally unfunny painful and juvenile in a bad way comedy. To top it all of Melissa Mccarthy getting nominations for her acting is absurd. For that silly food poisoning thing too! The jokes are so lame and drawn out beyond it's proper length like the toast scene. I like Rose Byrne but the lines she had weren't funny at all.I can understand there is a need for a ladies version of the Hangover type comedy but this one is just so badly written. Kristen Wiig isn't up to writing a feature length movie. The humor is not even SNL standard.I can't be the only one who found this just disgusting.,2,7,12,24 October 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Boring and dragged out like a bad Wagner opera
",This movie could have been cut by an hour. It's just way too dragged out. Every scene is three times as long as it should be and this results in breaking up the narrative and losing any dramatic build up. That is the problem when there is a short novel split into 3 movies - there just isn't enough to plot last 9 hours! The monsters were repetitive: trolls orcs and whatever! There is so much inconsequential dialog. That dinner at Bilbo's house was interminable. And the scene with gollum just went on and on with so many riddles. The only exciting part was the fight at the end with the tree. But it wasn't worth the 2 and a half hours before that.The scenery is beautiful but the unrealistically deep valleys and caves feel fake.Don't bother unless you are a die hard fan or you enjoy a bunch of ugly middle aged men running around with a variety of hard to understand British accents.,1,14,36,22 December 2012
Non-Stop," Enjoyable not just another airplane thriller
","If you think you have seen enough airplane thrillers after Red Eye, Flight Plan etc, think again. This one is actually entertaining well paced, well written, not too outlandish, and it has a good cast. The story keeps you guessing long enough and there is a nice sense of who is who among the characters on board.Liam Neeson the action hero who doesn't have to move too much does a convincing job as the air marshal dealing with a threat coming from someone texting. Julianne Moore works well with him as a passenger. Michelle Dockery shows her versatility - she can play the aristocrat and the flight attendant equally well.It's exciting till the end and well done.",8,0,1,30 May 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Depressing excessively violent and irritating even for a war movie
",It's hard to criticize good intentions to make a war movie about D Day but the violence was horrible and it was too close up. In the end it didn't give a good picture of the landings just too much close up carnage with the bullets and the blood. The German killing the soldier slowly at the end is just too much.The story to find Private Ryan is kind of irritating and it's just such a waste of effort - so many for 1 person.The acting is alright. Although Tom Hanks looks like he'd rather be elsewhere. And Matt Damon is a bit too perky.Give me a war movie from the 50s to 80s instead over this any day. This one leaves you with a sick feeling.,2,0,3,13 June 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Quirky European trip
",This quirky story has a magical feel to it. It has a stellar assortment of actors in unexpected roles. Loved the European journey and atmosphere.Ralph Fiennes hasn't had a good original role like this for a while and he takes full advantage of it. Nice to see Ms Ronan in a period role that she is suited to.There are some faults. It could be funnier in parts and the plot doesn't always make much sense but that is the charm of it. Why they were so confrontational with the 'Nazis' doesn't add up. It would have been better to see more character development with some supporting cast instead of just a brief cameos.It's great that movies like this are a success and there need to be more.,8,0,4,25 April 2014
The Favourite," Off putting bunch but people like that are around today
",This modern take on the favourite ladies of Queen Anne is a part of history not often shown and this movie is partly fictionalised. I guess they didn't want to do a BBC type movie so they added lots of profanity some nudity and modern dialog. Sometimes it makes things lively but often it was jarring just like the classical music mixed with some droning rubbish sounds. The theme of favourites jousting for the affections of the queen is oddly still relevant - there are actually people I known who behave like this today.Rachel Weisz is a little out of place in her look. Emma actually looks less out of place. Olivia acts sick quite well but it's not a best actress worthy performance. Nicholas Hoult is quite appropriate.The on location filming in Hatfield House is atmospheric.Ok for one watch.,4,6,12,31 January 2019
Revolutionary Road," Miscast - not as good as Mad Men
",The movie is weak and the story seems flat and not revolutionary on screen. Just not involving any more. The ending is just ugly and seems uncalled for. You feel so little for the uninteresting characters that it is just leaves one totally unmoved at the end.Casting is weak: Kate Winslet always comes across as slightly British. She looks too much in control to freak out. Leonardo doesn't come across as a man just an old looking boy and a rather puffy faced one at that. Sam Mendes might want to rethink casting his wife when she doesn't suit the role. Mad Men is much better. Don't bother with this ugly and depressing movie.,Null,0,2,9 February 2010
Foxcatcher," The actors are really transformed
","This is a true life murder about an eccentric Du Pont heir shooting a Olympic champion wrestler he was sponsoring. The murder itself is shown but you kind of want more of an explanation. Maybe there just isn't one. If anything one comes away with increased sympathy for athletes, who without state sponsorship are subject to financial uncertainty and in this instance a mentally unbalanced patron. After watching this movie I can't understand what wrestling is about as a sport.They did a terrific job transforming the actors. Steve Carrell with the prosthetic nose and make up looks and behaves unrecognizably. He gives off a wacko vibe that is chilling. He doesn't have a lot of dialog or change of facial expression but what he does is convincing. Channing Tatum with some Neanderthal prosthetics in the nose and mouth does the primate walk quite well. Mark Ruffalo is ard to recognize at first but his voice and smile come through. Some big name support from Vanessa Redgrave and Sienna Miller in small roles.Overall it's a tragic grim movie worth one watch.",6,1,4,10 January 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Dull and small scale - a waste of time
",Didn't enjoy this movie. The story is weak and uninvolving. Good points: How they made the apes act is quite amazing. Very real. Faults: Bit confusing which ape was which. The story was irritating and uninteresting. Franco's scientist did cause a lot of trouble just because got attached to his ape. Too much of the story took place in the facility. The whole thing felt very small scale. Only the last part had some epic feel. Didn't feel for any of the characters human or animal. There is no chemistry between Pinto and Franco. She gets cast in roles that don't quite suit her. Overall about as bad as the Marky Mark movie. Only the original Heston version was good. Forget all the rest.,2,5,12,28 December 2011
Legend," Involving and well acted - a bit hard to understand Tom
","Despite not being able to understand about a third of what Tom Hardy was saying (and I doubt too many East London Cockneys would be able to either) this is a surprisingly involving movie. You can figure out what's happening even if you can't get all of the dialog. A true story is better than fiction and it's quite fascinating to see the craziness. There is a dark comedy vibe going on which helps keep things entertaining. The violence isn't as bad as a fictional gangster Mafia movie - no machine guns blazing but it's scary enough because it's more believable.Tom Hardy gives 2 good performances as both the Kray twins and he speaks and acts and looks differently. He also looks like the real life twins too. Quite amazing. He didn't have to mumble so much but his acting is quite mesmerizing. Emily Browning is well cast and sympathetic as Reggie's wife. Finally a role she is perfectly suited for. The supporting cast including David Thewlis and Taron Egerton, is good except the Scotland Yard detective looked too much like a gangster - should have been more of a good guy looks wise.",8,3,6,13 November 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Wow! Watch this movie!
","First of all this movie isn't very violent by QT standards. Yet there is this sinister anticipation of violence that makes it scary because of what you know happened in real life. It's difficult to discuss this movie without revealing the ending, which is actually what makes this movie.
Here comes the spoiler. It's a fantasy like Inglorious. Everything you want to have happened to those horrible killers in the real life events you get to see. There is a pent up justice against the digusting serial killers that get off so easily. QT manages to turn a story about one of the worst incidents in California history into a feel good and affecting wish fulfillment story. It's not an account of the murders, it's what you wish could have happened instead.
Brad is the unlikely hero and although weatherbeaten he is still a big screen hero. Leonardo does a great actor facing a crisis in his career. He is a sympathetic character surprisingly and his story is quite interesting. Margot isn't as pretty as the real Sharon Tate but she does a good job at evoking sympathy with her joyfulness. Dakota is memorable as one of the irritating hippies.
What a feel good movie!",10,34,57,22 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Matt Damon & Michael Douglas as you've never seen them before
","Michael Douglas stars as Liberace and Matt Damon as his young lover Scott. This story is about their relationship from the latter's point of view and is in parts drama, dark comedy and horror. The drama is in the pathetic and inevitable cycle of their relationship with the tragedy of addiction and aids on the side. The comedy is scattered through out and is provided by the grotesque entourage. The predatory nature of their relationship is quite horrific especially the intimate moments. Watching these actors stretch their acting abilities is quite amazing. Matt Damon gives an intense dramatic performance. He looks younger than of late even if a bit older than the character he is playing. Michael Douglas usually doesn't do biopics so it's fascinating to see him act as someone else instead of a fictional character. He does a good job suggesting Liberace without overacting getting his voice and mannerisms while not being too campy. Watch out for the supporting cast too especially an unrecognizable Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother and Rob Lowe - hilarious as an amphetamine pushing doctor from hell. The makeup is good transforming them into the characters and through their weight and plastic surgery changes. The mansions, cars, pianos and flamboyant shows are all there. Impressive for a TV movie. Well done Sodebergh. Deserves an Emmy or Golden Globe.",9,0,4,17 July 2013
Gone Girl," Stylish but not plausible
","This starts off like a Lifetime thriller - Drew or Scott Peterson come to mind. But it's got a more A list cast and is slickly filmed with slightly too attractive household interiors and a black comedy vibe that gives it a big screen style.Ben Affleck looks quite weighed down as the unhappy husband. Rosamund Pike's with her blank rather cold expression finally finds a role suited to her as Amazing Amy.The different perspectives and plot twists keep one interested and entertained for over 2 hours but the murder is just too much, more shocking than plausible. Something less brutal but more clever would have made a better story.Overall entertaining for its style but the story doesn't come together in a believable way.",3,25,50,27 October 2014
Django Unchained," A terrific comedy!
",For fans of Inglorious this is a fitting follow up dealing with slavery before the civil war. His homage to Westerns is charmingly done. There are many hilarious moments and the performances are right on. Samuel L Jackson is unrecognizable and so funny he deserved a nomination. Jamie Foxx as Django is suitably perplexed then intense. It's a role he is really suited for more so than his more serious roles. Christoph Waltz's comedic delivery of his lines completely carries the first half of this movie. It was wrong to kill him off. Leonardo is quite good and I found him more convinging in this comic supporting role than his leading serious roles.The over the top violence and gun fights are a bit deja vu. And the ending is a bit predictable. But overall it is extremely enjoyable and is'a a terrific comedy with a serious historic setting. The writing in Inglorious was more clever and inventive but it's still pretty good here.,9,0,2,3 July 2013
Get Out," Stepford and racial satire
","Something different here. It's quite a fun and entertaining watch as racial satire meets Stepford Wives. When a black man goes to the burbs to meet his gf's white family he gets more than he bargained for. Something seems strange about all the black folks there.
Sometimes the dialog is hard to catch unless you concentrate. It all comes together quite nicely and the cast is good.",8,4,7,24 September 2019
Drive," Super cool and violent thriller
","Ryan Gosling has become one of the best actors at playing a really cool dude. The supporting cast is A list. Mad Men's Christina Hendricks has a brief but memorable role. Carey Mulligan is as always very good as the pitiful long suffering damsel in distress. Ryan plays a stunt driver / car repair man and part time getaway car driver. Carey plays his neighbor. The driving is realistic - not jammed with special effects. This isn't a movie about car chases, it is a thriller. The music is retro and hypnotic. The muscle cars are quite in vogue for movies these days (eg. 'In Time'). The story makes sense in its own little world. Even the heroism is kind of noble. There are one or two parts where one will ask why but it isn't about the story so much as the tension and the style. One thing I understand but don't like is the fact that movies these days have to be so violent. I guess if they aren't they seem boring to some. Actually if they cut out some of the excessive violence it would still work. Overall a very well made and absorbing thriller well worth a watch.",Null,2,5,3 November 2011
Aladdin," Flawed - not as good as the Broadway show
","There are many disappointing things about this movie. The tone is too sombre like a serious action movie with a message of female equality instead of comic musical. The songs aren't nicely handled. The melodies are lost in the distracting sounds and things going on. The lead actor isn't charming or cheeky enough. Too serious looking. The lead actress is ok but her voice isn't great. In fact both their voices aren't great. The sets are overcrowded, less is more sometimes. Will Smith is wrong should have been a jolly fat older guy.",5,2,3,15 July 2019
Insidious," Better than you'd expect
",A young boy falls into a coma like state and his parents try to find a cure. Is there something supernatural in play? The movie is watchable because it's well directed and paced. The shock tactic scares are effective. The story is quite logical in a horror movie way.Liked the cast. Rose Byrne as the frightened mother is good as always actually a bit like her role in 'Damages'. Barbara Hershey is a surprisingly good non irritating mother with a sympathetic slant. Patrick Wilson is good too as the father.A fault is that it was a bit too dark (lighting wise) at some parts.It's a non gruesome but scary horror movie. Looking forward to the sequel as it keeps you wanting more.,8,0,0,7 January 2013
The Theory of Everything," Refreshingly chronological!
","The best thing about this biopic is that it avoids 2 things that plague modern biopics nowadays: 1. jumping back and forth in time and 2. showing just the sordid, usually later part of the subject's life. This straightforward and effective biopic about scientist Stephen Hawking focuses primarily on the effect of coping with ALS on a family and the physical and emotional difficulties they face. Because this happened in the UK there seems to be no major financial difficulty like insurance running out etc. It's sympathetic to his wife since it's based on her book. Don't quite understand his scientific contribution party but it isn't about that. The recent biopic Mr Turner was dreadfully boring and showed things no one wanted to see. Also the one about Dickens with Ralph Fiennes was pretty bad too. At least in Theory you see what you want to see. Felicity Jones as his wife is right for the role - not too pretty. Eddie Redmayne finally has found a role that suits him. He isn't handsome enough for major romantic lead roles like Les Mis. So this role is just right for him with his slightly crooked features. He looks a lot like the person he is playing, much more so than many other biopics of late. It isn't right to give an Oscar just because the actor is portraying terrible illness on screen but in this case he is pretty good. Overall even though it is done in as light hearted a way as possible, the subject matter isn't pleasant and doesn't bear more than one viewing.",7,0,0,10 January 2015
2012," Completely thrilling and stunning - just some weak casting
","This is the by far best disaster movie for a long time. Thrilling from the first quake to the end. There is every kind of disaster in it - water, volcano, earth quake, the most exciting car and plane rides - you get your money's worth and more. Far better than any of Roland's previous movies. A good blend of grand scale disaster scenes and close up terror. The destruction of LA is stunning. Could have dwelt a bit longer in the other cities.The only problem was the casting. Amanda Peet's face was stony and showed no terror or even anxiety. John Cusack was a little bit too un-leading man for the role. Chiwetel Ejiofor looked a little un-scientist. Thandie Newton came across as very un-American to be the first daughter. Danny Glover was a little too old and senile for the President - not dignified at all.Screenplay had a few cheesy moments about 'humanity' that could have been left out.This should win best effects over Avatar any time. It will be hard to top this one for a long time.",9,2,5,7 February 2010
Room," The true stories would have been better than this fictional movie
","With all the real life stories about women who have been abducted and kept prisoner in basement Ariel Castro etc why did they need to make a fictional movie about this topic? The true stories are more compelling. It's a depressing story that is slightly relieved when they are rescued.Brie Larson is competent at acting scared and sad but her performance is limited to these emotions. It was not an Oscar worthy performance, why she won over some better actresses is one of the mistakes of last year's Oscars. The little boy Jacob Tremblay is alright but there isn't that much that he can do.After the voyeur in us is satisfied by watching these horrible situations it's just a rather depressing movie.",4,3,8,5 September 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A travelogue with a very slow story
",This movie is way too slow. The story about Life Magazine closing down and the last issue would be interesting if the story had unfolded more quickly with more interesting characters and some historical context. But the imaginings of Walter are off on a tangent. The pace needed to be much faster and the dialog more witty and interesting.On the plus side the travel photography in Greenland and Iceland and Afghanistan is breathtaking. The skateboard ride is quite fun too.Ben Stiller as director and star needed to tighten things up. The romance with Kristin was so mundane.A nicely photographed movie with a slow and lackluster story.,3,6,11,27 January 2014
A Quiet Place," Just can't buy into the premise
",The preposterous premise about these blind aliens killing anything that makes a sound is so hard to swallow that it just doesn't grip the viewer. Of course once you start watching you want to see how the 2 likeable stars and their kids fare in this absurd situation. The childbirth is ludicrous. Silly movie.,2,3,5,5 August 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Bad and ugly
","This isn't worth watching. Period. No attractive actors or actresses, no glamorous locations, no interesting plot, what is there to like? 0.It alternates badly written and obscure conversations between not too attractive middle aged men including Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Stacy Keach, which fail to convey the plot clearly and weak action sequences. The shootouts in the lab and the house are moderately diverting but not tense because no one cares about the characters. There is no build up of sympathy for any of the characters at all. The car chase in the slums of Manlia is boring and ugly.Jeremy Renner isn't leading man quality. He was the good simple soldier in Hurt Locker but he isn't watchable as the hero of an action movie. Rachel Weisz is a bit out of place - looking very European.Forget this one it's totally miss-able.",1,0,11,13 January 2013
Kick-Ass," Funny and different
",This is an unusually interesting comic book adaptation movie. It's got action but it's actually part comedy romance and part teen movie. It's quite story driven too with interesting amusing dialog and voice overs. IT doesn't take itself too seriously which is good. The violence is there but it's not as bad as some of the new movies. The leads are appealing Aaron Johnson has an expressive face and suits the role. Lyndsy Fonseca is quite a charming love interest. Chloe Moretz makes a rather controversial role quite cute as the violent kid. Nicholas Cage is in a supporting role. Quite watchable and different.,7,3,4,19 March 2012
Unknown," Very good thriller - go see it
",This is a very well done thriller. It's good to know there still are good stories out there to be made. Great on location European feel. The cast is all superb. Its a bit like 'Frantic' but more action based although not as over the top action as 'Taken'. The always earnest Liam Neeson is a good central figure. Diane Kruger is really getting to be a very good actress - totally believable and with just the right amount of European accent to be understandable. January Jones is the ideal beautiful good icy Hitchcock blonde. Good to see Aidan Quinn in a big movie again. Good satisfying storyline that doesn't confuse or have silly red herrings. The German supporting cast is good too. Berlin looks pretty miserable in the winter though. A must see for 2011.,9,1,3,4 March 2011
The Hurt Locker," Good not great - not best picture by far.
",Simply put this movie is good but no great.The direction is precise and the actors never distract from the plot and realism. There is no very obvious message or preaching. Also the way big stars like Fiennes and Pearce are killed off unexpectedly is quite good.The story about bomb disposal is just not that interesting. Some incidents like diffusing the car bomb etc are tense the first time you watch it but I wouldn't want to watch it again.Compared to other war movies it is unique in that it is very intimate and does not aim for a grand scope. But this is also its fault. It is just rather boring.Some rather painful moments like the punching each other for fun among the soldiers could have been left out.Renner is a good actor but his face is rather unpleasantly ugly. His heroism and self sacrifice is quite moving to watch though. Despite this he is not a very sympathetic character.The other characters are not too memorable either.Overall it is a unique war movie but it is not the best war movie ever or the best movie of the year for that matter.,6,2,6,6 February 2010
Moulin Rouge!," Overacting and bad singing
",There is hardly anything French about this movie. It is just an exaggerated overacted Ozzie fiasco. Just a couple of borrowed tunes here and there.Ewan can't sing at all. His silly startled look is just plain dumb.The hyperactive slapstick acting through out is tiring and silly to watch.Nicole pre-plastic surgery looks pretty but her overacting is painful. But what a silly script she had to deal with.The silly songs don't fit in with the time or place.Why are the ratings so terribly high for this movie? Bad taste reigns supreme.Don't bother watching this at all. Baz is bad!!,1,13,22,13 August 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Weak story
","To start with a good point, the effects are good and Jamie Foxx's electric villain is cool. The swinging around seems a bit better controlled than the 1st movie.The middle part with the angst was draggy especially after the Times Square fight.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are unique in Hollywood that two not conventionally good looking people lead a blockbuster. But their chemistry is convincing. Dane De Haan looks sickly enough, which the role requires.As far as superhero stories are concerned, this one was weak even by those low standards. The reasons why they would both hate Spider Man so much are weak. Gwen dying finally provided some impact to the story.Overall see it if you must but the story is weak.",3,11,38,12 May 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Disappointing after Twilight
","I am a huge fan of the first Twilight movie which was fun, exciting, romantic and enjoyable. I know New Moon is the darkest episode but sorry to say the movie was just too dreary and slow, often lacking both intimacy and excitement. I actually felt sleepy during some scenes and I had been so looking forward to see this.Firstly, New Moon does have good points: Wolf Pack animal effects were good - not over the top. Acting: Great cast delivers. Kristen Stewart was natural and unaffected. Taylor Lautner gives an earnest and energetic performance. Ashley Greene was sweet, strange and right on spot. Rob Pattinson was even paler than before and showed a different side but might have been slightly too distant and subdued.Attractive scenery in Italy and the Pacific Northwest. Bad points: Direction. The plodding direction of Chris Weitz dragged the whole thing down to a BORING pace at times. If even a fan can be bored then he can't have done a good job. The romance between Jacob and Bella felt awkward. In fact most of the scenes lacked edginess and tension and intimacy and vulnerability when required. If only they had stuck to Catherine Hardwicke. A woman's perspective is valuable because this is a story centered on a female heroine and that's what made Twilight successful and different. If it ain't broke why fix it? Music. The score mostly didn't suit the movie. The thick orchestral violin background music was out of place. I know they were trying to be more classical and less music video but it just sounded grating and old fashioned. The songs with vocals loudly distracted from what was going on instead of enhancing the storyline. Sometimes there was no music when music would have helped. I much prefer Twilight's score and song selection which helped set the mood of each scene and didn't overwhelm instead.Supporting cast: Insufficient camera time and dialog for supporting cast namely the Cullens and Bella's friends. A little more focus on the people around Bella would have been good to show contrast and give some perspective. One or two more funny lines would have helped.Screenplay: In Twilight the screenplay added humor and sped up the pace by combining characters and using certain composite scenes to make it a better and more fast moving story. In New Moon following the book more closely resulted in too many slow and uninteresting scenes and draggy moments. There wasn't enough improvement from page to screen Cinematography: The change in filming location from Oregon to Vancouver was quite noticeable and it felt like a different place. The scenes in the woods were not as attractive as Twilight. Instead of being eerie and cool they looked bleak and washed out. The cool blue gray colors often found in Twilight became yellowish in New Moon.Casting: Michael Sheen looked goofy and lacked both stature and a sinister side. Dakota looked unappealing. The other Volturi were unmemorable. Why use so many less than charismatic and average looking British actors? So overall - if you are a fan or just dating a fan do go and SEE IT but be prepared to be disappointed and yawn a bit.",4,6,10,4 December 2009
Transformers," Machines look too much alike
",The good thing about this movie is that it introduced Megan Fox to a wide audience. Shia is quite likable too. But the story isn't well written. There isn't much charm or humor. Michael Bay made the machines look too much alike. Seeing them tumble round and round is headache inducing. Can't tell which one is which. Shouldn't have been nominated for Oscars for visual effects - it was so awkward and confusing.The fault with many Michael Bay movies is that they have annoying stories (Pearl Harbor) and bad dialog. He needs better screen writing for all the effort and dollars dumped into this mess.,2,1,6,10 April 2011
Hidden Figures," Enlightening and enjoyable
",This enlightening and enjoyable movie pulls out all the stops to show the contribution of African American women in NASA in the 60s and their battles against racial discrimination. There are many scenes showing segregation like colored toilets buses coffee. Some scenes seemed exaggerated and if you look up the real story online it turns out they were but who cares it makes for a very dramatically successful story. Really root for her as she gets the recognition she deserves.Taraji P Henson plays Katherine Johnson a brilliant mathematician who made a significant contribution to calculations for the launches and reentries of several flights. She is the main character. Octavia Spencer plays a supervisor and programmer. And Janelle Monae plays a woman who becomes the first African American engineer in NASA. Kevin Costner is the big boss. Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst who looks a little older here plays white NASA people with racist attitudes of the time.Worth watching.,8,1,4,4 July 2017
1917," Ridiculous, irritating and implausible story
",Fictitious war stories are generally not good and this movie 1917 is an example with what is wrong with recent war movies. The ridiculous story is implausible from the get go.A really good war movie is the recent Roland Emmerich movie 'Midway' with a straightforward factual story and thrilling action and heroes that look like heroes. It's a travesty that 1917 won the Golden Globe and Midway didn't even get a nomination.There are so many holes in the story. Letting just 2 of them go is insane. The way Blake died was beyond irritating. Schofield's journey through sniper fire and river were just too unrealistic. Running through the battlefield at the end was just too much. Plus the elder Blake did not look like the younger Blake. Because things didn't ring true they weren't really exciting. Of course it is tense in the way you don't want him to die or get shot. But you know he will make or there is no movie so it wasn't the right kind of excitement.How not to make a war movie. Please don't give this one an Oscar.,2,31,81,9 January 2020
Casualties of War," A courageous movie - deserves more praise
",Kudos to Brian de Palma for making this brave movie. There aren't many movies that show war crimes by U.S. soldiers. Most Vietnam war movies focus on the impact of the war on the U.S. soldiers. The effect on civilians in Vietnam is often too painful and unpopular to deal with. It is a movie that shows Vietnam as tragedy for everyone involved not just the combatants. The true story of the rape and murder of a Vietnamese farm girl and it's exposure by a soldier who refused to take part is shown in a straightforward and unflinchingly direct way. The rape and murder itself is beyond heartbreaking. Yet the story isn't one sided. It shows the perpetrators being in such a horrid situation that allowed something like this to happen. The movie shows the difficulties and consequences of being a whistle blower - how relevant today.Michael J Fox gives a very moving and sympathetic performance showing he is a fine dramatic actor. My initial misgivings of him as being mainly a comedic actor were quickly dispelled. Sean Penn gives a totally believable performance as the idiotic sergeant in charge. The Vietnamese actress Thuy Thu Le's performance is so good that it's almost too painful to watch.This movie isn't as famous as it should be and deserves a place among the most powerful and well acted war movies of all time.,10,5,8,29 January 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Better and worse than the English version in different ways
","Watched this original Swedish version after watching the 2011 Rooney Mara version. It's not bad considering the budget was a lot less. Both have their strengths and weaknesses and it's interesting to compare them.Noomi Rapace's portrayal is more like a normal person and less punky than Rooney - she is actually quite sweet, although she is less beautiful than Rooney. Noomi reminds me of Nadal. The actor playing Mikael in the Swedish version is a bit stony looking. Daniel Craig was more charming. The Swedish version couldn't boast the star power of Christoper Plummer and Joely Richardson.The Swedish version is better in some ways: the crimes are more clearly explained. The English version is a bit rushed and confusing in some crucial plot areas. It was interesting to see Lisbeth's parents which is shown in the Swedish version not the English one.The English version has better casting, a better score and the Zurich transformation of Lisbeth was one of the best parts of the movie. It was glanced over in the Swedish version.Overall I liked the English version better. But the Swedish version is about 80% as good.",8,0,1,4 June 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Visually spectacular, sometimes funny, unengaging characters
",To start with the good points the effects and battles are quite visually spectacular. The out of place humor is funny now and then. But the characters aren't familiar so the don't end up really engaging the viewer. Can't feel for them. The first part of the movie was confusing figuring out who is fighting who for what. It all felt a bit pointless and silly after a while.Zoe Saldana looks pretty slim. Chris Pratt the ordinary guy isn't charismatic enough to lead a movie. Just cause he shed a few pounds doesn't mean he's suddenly watchable. The silly creatures are tiresome after a while.I don't think this one is that great despite all the hype and high production values. If you just forget about story and sit back and watch the visuals it's okay but it doesn't deserve any follow up.,5,9,19,7 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Engrossing but obviously fictionalized in parts
","This is a very engrossing WW2 dramatization of the breaking of the Nazi's Enigma code by a group of code breakers in the English countryside. Well produced exciting and dramatic and moving especially how they use the brain to defeat the enemy. However there are some faults. There are some things wrong with the screenplay. Most glaringly there are historical inaccuracies for dramatic storytelling purposes that are obvious even without reading up about them. The part about possibly saving the brother of a team member is too hard to believe. And how they had to decide how to use the information - it is ludicrous that they would be in charge of that. The main breakthrough is too sudden to be believable. The military person played by Charles Dance seems exaggerated to be a dramatic obstacle. The shifting back and forth in time was a bit too much. It would have been better to have had the arrest for homosexual behavior all at the end instead of interspersed throughout.The acting is good. Kiera is too beautiful for the role but it doesn't matter because it makes it watchable. Who would have wanted to see a plain Jane as the only main female character. Maybe someone plainer like Emily Blunt would have been more like the real person. Matthew Goode and Downton Abbey's Allen Leech provide support as other members of the team. Benedict Cumberbatch looks suitably vulnerable and plays it very Sheldon Cooper eccentric. Read that in real life Alan Turing he wasn't really so odd. Better not to read up on the fact vs fiction beforehand as it will spoil the experience, so just accept the inaccuracies as dramatic leeway to make a possibly rather dry story dramatic. Worth a watch if too theatrical.",8,1,4,22 January 2015
Clash of the Titans," Despite the new effects the 80's version is much better
",The effects are great but the most glaring thing wrong with this new version is the great things about the first movie that are missing here. Where is the romance? What happened to the relationship between Perseus and Andromeda? What about all the charming dialog and incidents from the first movie? The riddle? Calibos? The goddess Thetes? The casting wasn't good. Sam Worthington is certainly not demi god like hero material - small sized and common looking. Are they looking for an anti-hero or an everyman that we all can identify with? At least Harry Hamlin looked the part. Gemma Atreton's large role here was a bit annoying making her the heroine instead. Alexa Davalos is a bit plump and common looking a far cry from the doll like Judy Bowker. After watching this movie you'll just appreciate the first one more.,2,7,9,17 July 2010
Jurassic World," Watchable leads and a well paced story
","This movie is a leap forward for the series. If you think you've seen enough dinosaurs you'd be surprised by how fresh and exciting this blockbuster is. The story involves the escape of a genetically created hybrid dinosaur in a dinosaur theme park. The action is thrilling and isn't too dizzying, or too kiddie.The two leads Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are more watchable than Jurassic Park's Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum. Bryce is an excellent expressive actress with a beautiful watchable face - she was the most convincing actress in 'The Help' and it's great to see her back on the big screen. Chris is likable - not too over built to be unrealistic.The production is grand and attractive. The theme park is fun and the rides are the best version of a fantasy theme park come to life. The story has a good pace, you get to identify the different dinosaurs enough and get to know the humans like the two brothers well enough to be scared for them too.Well worth watching. It deserves the box office success it has had.",10,36,98,13 July 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," boring and anticlimactic
",Don't bother to watch this silly yawn of a movie. It's neither here nor there. This movie is totally missable. The story is weak and the cast is totally wrong for their parts. There is no chemistry between the leads. Matt Damon looks too boyish for a senator and is a bit small sized for Emily. Emily looks a bit cross eyed and doesn't have that lean look of a ballerina. Serious miscasting. The running around and doors are repetitive and the passing of time is abrupt. The ending is a let down. Just a silly far fetched waste of time. The basic premise makes no sense if you think about it. Can't imagine why people went to see this dud and the box office was so respectable.,Null,7,10,10 September 2011
Prisoners," Good acting but bad directing and weak story
",First the good points. There is a top notch Oscar nominated cast assembled here and the acting is good. Hugh and Jake are impassioned and calm respectively but equally effective. Hugh has always had intensity and this is no exception. Jake is sympathetically dedicated and carries his role off convincingly. Paul Dano is actually suited to the dim wit. He isn't suited to mainstream roles because of his looks but here he suits the role to a T. Not enough material given to Viola Davis and Terence Howard. Photography is good and they really capture the dreary weather of the area in winter.Now the weaknesses. The direction is lingering for unnecessary details and rushed for vital plot elements. Doesn't link up the clues and hints clearly enough. I concentrated but still was confused. The ending was badly done. Showing so much detail earlier and then short changing at the end by not showing conclusively what happened and instead just hinting at it was a cheap let down.The story - the only thing I thought was good was the slightly feel good end. But the the weaknesses in the plot show clearly how it suffers in comparison to a true story. The fact that Paul Dano's character could hold out through all that isn't believable. It's an ugly story and gut wrenching in parts.Overall this movie has a good cast and is earnestly acted but it doesn't deserve unmitigated praise. You want to see what happens and that keeps you engrossed till the end but after watching it you will have the feeling that the story just isn't that good.,5,4,11,26 September 2013
Hotel Mumbai," A timely reminder and a well directed movie
",This is a clearly told and very scary movie about the Mumbai terror attacks. It's so much more effective than a typical thriller because it's a true story. There is no Bruce Willis type hero to burst in and rescue everyone. It was a tragic end for so many. The heroes are everyday hotel staff like the one played by Patel and under equipped policemen. Sometimes you wonder if Armie Hammer's character's foolhardiness was just a fictional composite to show different events and places in the hotel. The best point is how well directed the movie is. Everything that happens is clear and even the Pakistani terrorists are distinguishable. Often thriller action movies can be confusing.There have not been many movies about terror attacks of recent years. It isn't exploitative it's a reminder of the threats innocent people all over the world face from terror.,10,3,14,15 September 2019
Everest," Spectacular cinematography and gripping story
",The photography and cinematography and effects are worth seeing on the big screen. Very realistic sense of being on the mountains and in the storms. Can almost feel the cold and the physical suffering. The story is gripping too. It gives an interesting look at the arduous journey - the practicalities and physical weaknesses encountered by the different climbers along the way.The big name cast makes this interesting to watch. The spouses: the New Zealand accented Kiera Knightley to Texan accented Robin Wright. Emily Watson makes an unlikely but sympathetic base camp manager. Like Jason Clarke more after this role as expedition leader. Josh Brolin smiles a bit too much but at least he is easily recognizable. Jake Gyllenhaal is quite easy to identify even in the snow.After watching this movie I do feel more sympathy for the climbers. Before I saw this movie I like many people felt climbers knew what they were getting into by taking such a risky venture etc. But while watching the movie I didn't feel that at all. In the end couldn't help feeling sorry for the pregnant wife left behind and the farewell phone call. Although it is entertainment maybe it will serve as a warning to people not to tempt fate doing dangerous things.A couple of faults. The New Zealand or Aussie accents are unnecessarily strong. Maybe a more neutral accent would have sufficed. Didn't help that the wind was howling and snow blowing in many scenes. Half the dialog is not comprehensible. Another problem is it was a little difficult telling who was who with all their masks and hats on. The death of some of the characters could have been more clearly shown especially Jake Gyllenhaal's character and the Japanese woman.Worth watching on the biggest screen you can find.,8,0,0,25 September 2015
Friends with Benefits," Hectic dialog - it's better when things slow down
",The faults of this movie slightly outweigh the good points. It tries to have an informative SATC type look at relationships. But it kind of feels silly more often. Good points: Nice locations in NYC & LA beach. There is some chemistry between the leads. Patricia Clarkson is different in her hippy type role. Mila is pretty and okay to watch. The part with the father is quite touching. There are some laughs here and there. Bad Points: Too rushed dialog trying to jam in too many jokes in too short a space of time. The sex scenes are a bit like jack rabbits. Justin's voice is a bit high pitched and the singing is juvenile. The supporting cast are used kind of briefly and then discarded like Emma Stone. The screenplay could have been tightened and edited a bit.Overall OK for one watch but not one of the better ones.,4,1,2,6 December 2011
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Worth watching even if you are not into golf
",This is a feel good triumph against the odds uplifting true story about a amateur golfer from a poor background who won the US Open golf championship in 1913. The snobbery and class barriers he had to overcome seem a little exaggerated for effect. Shia La Beouf as Francis Ouimet is endearing and his 10 year old caddy is a scene stealer. The David vs Goliath tournament is quite exciting as he takes on the British Champion Henry Vardon played sympathetically by Stephen Dillaine. It's interesting to see that Vardon himself faced class discrimination in the sport.The actor Bill Paxton is a good director. The photography is interesting with a mix of shots and visual effects to make the movie exciting even for non golf players.,8,0,1,13 January 2015
Blood Diamond," Leonardo's most convincing role
",This is probably Leonardo's most convincing role among the more grown up serious roles of the last few years. In some other roles he looks like a slightly puffy and his boyish face is at odds with the role. But here he seems right and his accent whether accurate or not at least shows some effort to get into a character.Jennifer Connolly is always welcome in any role and she looks convincing in spite of her great beauty. Djimon Hounsou is a good actor here very powerful and believable.The story is interesting if fictionally dramatic. Makes you think about where diamonds come from. One of the better movies with a mission to educate.,8,3,4,16 June 2013
War Machine," An unflinching humorous look at Afghanistan
","Even though Brad acts in a comical style doing a caricature of a general, almost everything this satire seeks to illuminate rings true. So this movie isn't an exaggerated satire but a very illuminating look at the impossible situation in Afghanistan.There haven't been many movies critical of Obama's policy in the Middle East so it's quite surprising to see one on TV.Brad acts well enough as the well intentioned but misguided general and the viewer feels his struggle to do what he thinks will make a difference despite all signs and advice that he will not succeed. The futility of the counter insurgency is so clearly portrayed.With all the different conflicts going on in Iraq Syria Lybia etc it's hard to keep clear what the struggle in Afghanistan is about so it's quite illuminating to see the conflict and the policies in focus here. It's also refreshing to see a non battle centered war movie that shows broader policy errors instead of concentrating on the individual blood and guts stories.",10,8,16,27 May 2017
Pride & Prejudice," Best version out there fresh and lively
",This adaptation was energetic beautifully filmed and captured the romance and passion of the novel with just the right balance. Compared to the BBC version with Colin Firth this is much better. The actress in the BBC version was too plain for a romantic lead. When I first heard Keira was going to play the role I thought she might be a little contemporary looking but I was wrong. She is quite lovely and does a very good job. Matthew McFayden as Darcy at first seemed a bit non leading man but he is quite a good actor and suits the role. The interesting mix of international (non British) cast members like Donald Sutherland and Jenna Malone is good.Liked the photography and settings. Darcy's house which is filmed at Chatsworth in England is a bit too grand for a Mr Darcy but it is lovely. Overall this was a very good adaptation and should be a standard for other adaptations of literary classics.,9,2,4,12 February 2012
Elysium," Preachy and unpleasant - don't waste your time
",This is a strange movie. The story isn't well written and the characters aren't interesting or involving.The premise is that Earth is an overpopulated disease ridden poluted disaster zone for common people and the elite live on a space station called Elysium. They didn't show enough of the latter for contrast - too much was on Earth.The immigration message is confused and didn't get what it wanted to across. I don't understand why future LA (filmed in a slum in Mexico) is portrayed as a mainly Hispanic slum. Why didn't they have a multiracial future city? Instead of showing that immigration boundaries should be relaxed and highlighting bad treatment of illegal immigrants it looks more like a warning against letting more people across the border. I think the message backfired - unless that was the real intention.I didn't like the character Matt Damon was playing - very me me me. His selfishiness in seeking a cure for himself got his friend killed and his lady friend and daughter in trouble. She was rather annoying too with my daughter this and that. There was no chemistry between the couple. The hit-man villain's accent was hard to listen to and out of place (was it South African?). The brutal fighting didn't really advance the plot and was tiresome. Just as annoying was 'Secretary' Jodie Foster's strange clipped accent. She lacked dignity for the role and looked too high strung and mentally unhinged. Another evil guy is the CEO - how clichéd.I don't think the writer director thought out this story very well and it shouldn't have been made into a movie. Not worth a watch.,1,16,30,19 August 2013
Taken," A feel good action thriller
","This is one of the more enjoyable thrillers for quite some time. There is a good human element and story. There is a lot of action but because the way it is directed, it never seems too violent. You feel on Leeson's side for most of the killing and shooting. Pace and directing are excellent.As usual they have to stereotype ethnic minorities and wealthy foreigners as villains but its a small flaw in the movie.Maggie Grace is a bit large and ungainly looking and acts a bit silly and gushy for a 17 year old but I guess she wouldn't be in that position if she had been more sensible. It's a bit hard to believe she would be worth so many Euros to anyone.A good warning for teens abroad too.",8,0,0,8 August 2010
Avatar," A bit of a Headache
",Avatar is just okay but not that great with both good and bad points. Why do so many people keep praising this movie so unreservedly? I don't want to watch it again for sure.The storyline is weak. Not that much really happens and there aren't any surprises. There is a little excitement at the end but it just doesn't have the genuine thrill and likable characters of Terminator or the romance and sweep of Titanic. The environmental / anti war message is noble but too rammed down your throat. The dialog lacked humor or wit.The characters are unsympathetic. The blue creatures are mostly ugly and mildly annoying especially Zoe Saldana's high pitched squeals and strange movements. You don't really feel for any of the humans either.The much lauded effects are beautiful at first but after about 20 minutes its just the same thing and the same colors over and over again. Quite monotonous. I watched the 3d version and I had a headache for hours after. Its actually quite hard to see whats going on with the blurry backgrounds. Make sure you see it in a bigger 3d screen because I saw it in a smallish one and that could have made things worse.Casting is alright though Sam Worthington is a bit stony. Sigourney is a welcome presence.In the end it not an Oscar or golden globe worthy movie. Just a nomination will do. Just because Cameron takes a long time over a movie doesn't make it a great one. Of course it is still worth seeing. Just don't expect that much.,3,1,2,24 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A lot of bang for your buck
",You get a lot of horror for 1 movie. There is everything from shock tactics to evil spirits. A little black comedy runs throughout.Alison Lohman does a good job - looks a little too calm after each 'encounter' - but she deserves her paycheck for the gross stuff she had to go through.The topical story is amusing foreclosure. The old woman is good and gross. Justin Long is quite good too.Enjoyed this more than the recent horror remakes like Friday 13th etc. because the story is more central to the movie instead of just incidental to the horror. Liked the ending.Two thumbs up.,8,0,1,15 September 2010
The Artist," Unique but not best movie
","This movie is an interesting art piece with a nice look at old Hollywood. The silent aspect makes one watch carefully the emotions and facial expressions. The story is simple and pleasantly predictable about one star on the rise and one on the decline at the era when silent films gave way to talkies.The plot of the first half is a bit frustratingly thin but the second half the story picks up. The infamous use of music from Hitchcock's Vertigo is good - actually makes me want to see Vertigo again.Dujardin as Valentin the screen idol of the silent screen looks the part. Berenice has a harder role acting wise. Both are good and dance well. Nice use of John Goodman and Penelope Anne Miller.Compared to the other good movies that came out this year eg War Horse, Midnight in Paris etc, the Artist isn't quite as good. It's only the timing of the release and the continental background that have people praising it beyond it's worth. I don't think it is best picture.",7,2,6,30 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," As good as it gets
","I don't care about the detractors, this is a poignant and grand final chapter in the saga. Of course it isn't the best movie in the series because it's the ending. I still find the first one the best. But for what it seeks to achieve it does it well as anyone could hope for.Kristen does a good job with the transformation to Vampire. Rob's role is a bit limited in nature so he has only a a few expressions that he can use a gentle smile and concern. Taylor has more to work with but he's about the same. Mackenzie Foy is suitably peculiar looking in her bizarre role.There are some funny moments with Charlie etc.The confrontation with the Volturi is well staged and scary because by now the characters mean something to the viewer. The twist took me by surprise as even though I am a fan of the movies, I had never read the books.A couple of faults: A lot of new characters introduced in too quick a time. The logic of going after the child makes it's own sense even if it is silly.Some dialog is cheesy especially the final scene but they have to be faithful to the books so I guess there was no choice.The earlier part is a bit music video like.The extended farewell to the characters is fitting and felt like that in memoriam segment in the Oscars and Globes.Overall looking at all 5 movies as a whole, it's a good beautifully filmed movie with a grand climax.",9,5,15,22 November 2012
Invictus," well intentioned but miscast
",From a historical point of view it is interesting to see the transition of power from the white to black. But in the end it doesn't quite show how a mostly white rugby team winning a game helped to unify the country as a whole. The game just looks trivial compared to the problems of the country as a whole. Also the screenplay is simplistic in that Mandela's wisdom and saintliness is exaggerated here. He is unrealistically good here. Clint's direction is as usual a little indulgent. The game at the end is too long. Miscasting is the worst fault of this movie. Morgan Freeman's accent isn't that good - in fact it distracts from the movie. Maybe they could have found an African actor for the part. Matt Damon's accent is better but he is too small sized for a rugby player - it looks like they are trying to make him look bigger by using camera angles etc but it doesn't work.,3,1,3,28 July 2010
La La Land," An enchanting step in the right direction
",In some ways this is a lovely movie with a wonderful homage to old Hollywood musicals and a romantic if slightly derivative and simplistic main musical theme. The cinematography is nostalgic and the musical numbers are for the most part quite good. I liked them except for the Glee like freeway opening number. Generally they were not over done. Less is more. The romantic Observatory number is a standout.The story of a the different careers of music and acting pulling them apart is a familiar one. The modern twist is the poignant ending and what if flashback. They could have made things work if she had just gone back to him after her movie. A happy ending would have been too old fashioned I guess. But the story is a bit of a downer.Ryan Gosling - kudos to him for singing and dancing. Not many successful screen actors of his generation are capable of it. He doesn't have a Broadway caliber voice by any means or snappiness in his dancing but it doesn't matter - it's his screen presence that brings in the crowds. Emma Stone is slim and dances satisfactorily - her voice is acceptable if not that lovely. There are too many closeups of her face. Her face isn't really beautiful. The two performances aren't as high a standard as those of the multi talented MGM stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood - those who could actually sing dance and act. They don't dance for very long.It's just so good that movie makers of this generation are trying to do this type of musical on screen again - maybe it will pave the way for some successful Broadway actors and actresses to get big screen roles they deserve. The broader audience has missed out on a lot of fine talent the last couple of decades. If only the music was more sophisticated and better written.,8,1,6,8 December 2016
Mama," Not that great
","For fans of ghost stories as opposed to slasher horror movies, then this one is alright but it's not great. It's not very scary - it just shocks now and then.Jessica Chastain looks different and contemporary with her dark hair and eye makeup. Her reluctant caregiver is interesting to watch.The movie has got a Guillermo feel but that makes the ghost a bit silly looking. There is some needless resorting to shock tactics.Good thing the story is straightforward and easy to understand. Bat thing is the ending is a let down.If you miss it you won't miss much.",5,3,8,31 January 2013
Snowden," Eye opening
","Whether one supports what Snowden did or not, this movie is watchable, well made and well acted. Before this movie I wasn't that familiar with what he actually disclosed except that it was overreaching by the NSA spying on everyone including innocent people and friendly countries and their heads of state like Angela Merkel. Oliver Stone does a good job of showing Snowden's story from his beginnings in cyber security to his disillusionment. By the end of the movie the point is clear - the NSA was spying on people for reasons beyond terrorism like economic gain. And the point of the people disclosing the scandal is that invasion of privacy violates our civil rights and undermines freedom and democracy. Also cover up by the NSA CIA and the administration is shown. So the case in support of disclosure is made. For completeness I would have liked some characters arguing against disclosure like if the disclosures compromised terrorist surveillance and let the main characters rebut their arguments.It helps to watch Citizenfour before or at least know what about the main disclosures because the characters speak very fast and sometimes the viewer can get lost during the technical dialog. Maybe some narration would have helped.Joseph Gordon Levitt now slightly older looking does a good job of imitating Snowden's voice and manner. He portrays him as calm logical intelligent and sure that what he is doing is right. Shaliene Woodley plays his loyal girlfriend Lindsay.Nice on location filming around the world including Hong Kong.Even for people who can't decide if he is a hero or not this eye opening movie make the viewer think about how much we are all being watched. Also about the consequences of whistle blowing.",8,2,5,15 January 2017
Woman in Gold," A must see - moving and engrossing
","Blend art, music, Vienna, and the Holocaust you get a completely mesmerizing true story about reclaiming a painting by Klimt stolen by the Nazis and reclaimed by the heirs. Interesting to see a Holocaust movie from a different perspective firstly set in Austria and showing stolen property. The story shows the effect on the family which is a more personal view point than what was shown in Monuments Men. Even though you know they live, the escape through the streets by the young Altmann couple is tense and involving if slightly Von Trapp.The cast is excellent. Helen Mirren is masterful in her role creating sympathy for the character of Maria Altmann. Ryan Reynolds as her lawyer might at first seem to be an odd choice because of his generally goofy roles but this actually works to his advantage emphasizing the Erin Brokovich type odds he is facing in taking on the Austrian government. The younger version of Maria is played by Orphan Black's Tatiana Maslany does a German speaking role convincingly and Max Irons surprisingly looks well suited to her Opera singer husband.Moving and completely engrossing.",10,1,1,10 July 2015
The King," Robert Pattinson and Timothee Chalamet should have switched roles
","What a tedious movie. Terribly miscast, incomprehnsible dialog, often too dimly lit. Chalamet is too slender to be the heroic warrior king. So many other actors would have been better. In fact Rob and him should have changed places. Robert Pattinson is totally laughable as the buffoon like Dauphin would have made a better Henry and Chalamet as the Dauphin. The dialog is often incomrehensible. Why fake such heavy accents? Bad casting.
The story is hard to follow unless you are familiar with the plays. Bad writer. Very modern expletives. The characters are had to differentiate. Bad director. The lighting is pitch dark or close to some scenes. Can't make out what is going on.
The muddy battle isn't exciting because can't tell who is who.
Lily Rose Depp as the queen is out of place with her exotic looks.
Give this mess a miss.",2,8,16,10 November 2019
Don't Breathe," Don't miss this!
","Who knew there was still an original exciting thriller to be made? There isn't anything deja vu about this very well paced and directed movie. The camera work is excellent showing just what you need to see to be scared but never leaving you confused. There is a skewered sympathy for the characters - the 3 protagonists are bad guys - burglar scums you can't really feel sorry for. The person who they rob is a victim of sorts blind Iraq veteran but flawed as you will find out. The story is good with unpredictable but still plausible twists. You never feel cheaply shocked or let down by an unbelievable twist. It's more exciting when you are kind of rooting for both sides at the same time.Steven Lang is well cast as the blind man. The other cast including Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette make bad characters kind of sympathetic. Best thriller in recent memory. A breathtaking roller coaster ride. Kudos to the director, screenwriter and actors.Deserves to top the box office.",10,17,37,26 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Beautiful production but Emma Watson is wrong
",This movie boasts stunning sets and delightful animation with an expanded story. Maybe a little too much story.The main flaw is Emma Watson is wrong. She looks like a young teen and speaks and looks like Hermione still. Too childish. Other recent Disney heroines have been better like Lily James In Cinderella or Lily Collins in Snow White. The singing should have been dubbed by real Broadway or West End performers. Luke Evans as Gaston being a real stage performer is more convincing.Still worth a watch.,5,1,2,18 November 2019
Sicario," Well made and tense, overcomes some plot weaknesses
",This drug war thriller is exciting and partly frustrating although some of the frustration is part of the plot.In the first half FBI agent is recruited to assist the agent Josh Brolin and the mysterious Benicio Del Toro to fight the drug war. They go across the border to Juarez to grab someone they need. What is she doing there on this mission. Things are answered eventually but that seems more of a plot device and doesn't ring true. The scenes there and at the border bridge crossing are quite suspenseful. Later on the hook up with the bad cop gone wrong seems a bit unrealistic. How could they know that would happen for sure. When they going through the tunnels it's again quite scary. Later on don't really get why she is so terribly upset about taking down a drug lord even though it's against the proper procedure and international jurisdictions and protocol. Is that something worth being so eaten up about? Emily Blunt is getting some action roles and she is watchable - both feisty and vulnerable. Josh Brolin is quite good as the questionable agent. Benicio del Toro is of course terrific and it's a good change to see him on the good side after playing 'Escobar Paradise Lost'. I actually think that 'Paradise Lost' was a better movie on the whole.Overall this film is worth a watch. It's a well made and tense and holds your attention. The heartbeat like soundtrack is adds to the excitement. Unfortunately like any fictional thriller some things are ridiculous but entertaining like Benicio's one man killing machine in the climax.,8,5,12,17 September 2015
Jack Reacher," A bad novel made into a bad movie
","This is a Tom Cruise vehicle to show him shooting, fist fighting, driving in a car chase etc. Often his vehicles work as in the MI series. But in this movie the story is silly and not very interesting. The story is bad often boring and meaningless or disgusting. The editing and directing is confusing and abrupt. The casting and acting are bad. Rosamund Pike has a rather expressionless blank face and comes across as cold. Even whie being held captive she looked like she was going to a PTA meeting. NO fear or anxiety on her face at all. Tom tries to be a cool guy but he looks to old for the fist fights gun fights car chases etc. The worst part is when Jack Reacher threw down his gun to fight the bad guy by hand while a hostage was waiting for rescue. This is a waste of time. A bad novel made into a bad movie. Shouldn't have been adapated for the big screen.Don't waste your time.",1,8,21,4 July 2013
"McFarland, USA"," A feel good sports movie
","This is an enjoyable moving and inspirational movie. A high school coach in a mainly Hispanic Central Valley farming town bringing his team of farm pickers/students to Cross Country Running State Championship level. We have seen the underdog overcoming odds formula before but it works so well here. The hard lives of the kids picking in the farms and training is touching and eye opening. A nice slice of life look at the farming community in central CA. The races are well filmed without being repetitive.There are some formula scenes that are obvious but still watchable like 'never seen the Ocean', and the gang incident. Also of course the teams they are competing against are always taller and all white.Kevin Costner is suited to the role and his struggling to run is quite believable for him.A feel good Disney sports movie.",8,0,0,20 September 2015
Les Misérables," Russell and Eddie are terrible
","What a shame that the miscasting of Russell Crowe and Eddie Redmayne should ruin a good half of the movie.A most deserving Hugh Jackman gets to show a wider audience his charismatic Broadway and West End performer side. Unfortunately he doesn't sound as powerful and resonant in this movie as he does in real life. There has been some criticism about the method of recording the voices. It becomes quite apparent in some of Hugh's songs where his voice in the movie sounds thinner and weaker than on stage. Anne gives a moving performance. Maybe they didn't need to make her look so terrible after all it is a musical.Eddie Redmayne is seriously miscast. He is not leading romantic role handsome. He is more supporting cast character actor with his slightly crooked features. His voice is limited and sounded like he had a cold. Bad choice. Aaron Tveit, a real Broadway performer is so much better a singer and has more leading man looks. They should have switched roles.Russell Crowe as expected has no singing voice whatsoever. Every time he sang it spoiled the movie and made it feel amateurish. He was completely monotonous and lacking in any emotion or passion in his singing. What were they thinking? Even if they wanted a movie star there are so many famous actors who can sing better. Or they could have done what so many prior screen musicals have done (My Fair Lady, Sound of Music) - dub his voice with a real singer.Amanda Seyfried is a competent singer and is suited to her part. Helena and Sasha are alright in their comical supporting roles as well.The battles and sets were more involving than on stage. Didn't like some of the strange camera angles and prolonged close ups. Some of the over the top cockney accents were ludicrous. If you see it for Hugh and Anne be prepared to cringe when Russell and Eddie take over. Many great musical movies of the past are changed for the better from stage to screen but in this movie they didn't improve things and that was a disappointment. The seriously bad singing and miscasting just ruin the movie.",1,38,80,3 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Rubbish don't waste your time
",The story is plain rubbish. It is silly simplistic illogical and I'm not objecting from a religious point of view. To anyone of any intelligence the story is daft.Aside from that - the making of this movie itself was not great. Tom Hanks is too old - squinty and puffy looking he looks tired. It would be better he retired than take such silly roles. Tatou looks like she'd rather be elsewhere. The sheer idiocy that she could be anyone of any significance is laughable.People who go round looking at Da Vinci code sights are mad since it's all based on absolute rubbish anyway.Angels and Demons is even more ghastly so don't bother with either.The most anticlimactic movie ever.,1,0,3,13 August 2010
In Time," Better than expected - good casting
",This movie is better than I thought it would be. It is stylishly made with an attractive cast and has some good points. This is a dramatic science fiction story about time left to live being the currency of the future. The premise is quite interesting and isn't too ridiculous. There is tension from wondering if some characters will die when they run out of time. The casino segment makes use of this. The casting is good. Justin Timberlake is the Robin Hood type character trying to redistribute time. He has matured a bit as an actor. He is less teeny bopper than usual and his voice is a few registers lower here. The supporting cast is good especially Cillian Murphy as the cop or time keeper - his obsessive look is quite convincing. Vincent Kartheiser of Mad Men has an eerie preserved look and is well cast as Amanda's father. A lot of the humor comes from the 'science fiction young' characters like the slim Olivia Wilde as Justin's 50 years young mother. One of the scariest things is seeing Amanda Seyfried run around in very high heels. Don't get her hair style and color. Johnny Galecki of Big Bang Theory has a small but against type role. Matthew Bomer plays a suicidal man who doesn't want to live any more and gives Justin a present of time. Alex Pettyfer plays a villain thug with a British accent - something he is quite suited for. Liked the use of vintage cars but the city scenes were a bit science fiction drab. A couple of weak points. The story has Justin and Amanda running around a lot and it gets a bit repetitive. It drags a bit in the middle to last quarter. Overall still worth watching if you have the time.,7,3,11,27 October 2011
Thor," Not that good - see it only if you feel like it
","There are two contrasting worlds. The celestial science fiction world of Thor, Anthony Hopkins and the immortals quite grandly shown with epic battles stunning backdrops and serious words. When this is all getting too heavy we move into New Mexico on planet Earth with the rather girlish Natalie Portman for comic relief. Somehow it doesn't quite succeed - it feels schizophrenic. There isn't much chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. He although a bit inexpressive facially does portray an other worldliness but she just seems silly. She wasn't a good choice. The dialog could have been better - it's rather heavy and obvious. Didn't really feel for any of the characters. The only humor comes from Thor being like a bull in a china shop on Earth. It's not very consistent. Overall missable.",Null,1,3,8 November 2011
The Godfather: Part III," The weakest of the 3 but watch it for completeness
",If you are a Godfather fan you of course have to see this to end the saga but be prepared to be let down.This movie has a different feel from the first 2. And not in a good way.Pacino has become more gruff and is less attractive with time.The casting is weak. Andy Garcia comes across as being not that Italian - why did they choose him? Much has been said about Sophia Coppola's acting. The only good thing about casting her is that you don't feel sad when she gets killed.There are too many rub outs. Overkill. At the end with all the security why take the exposed way out of the Opera? It's a bit silly.,3,1,2,22 August 2010
Mystic River," Unpleasant and boring
",Good actors but such a stupid and unpleasant story. Who on earth would want to watch this for entertainment? It isn't good drama just misery. It's a meaningless and pointless story.Did the 2 male leads Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deserve to win Best Actor and Best supporting actor? Don't really think so. Except they look quite tortured.It's so stupid of Marcia Gay Harden to tell Sean Penn her unfounded suspicions. The wrong killing leaves one so depressed and unsatisfied after watching it.Directing is typical slow Eastwood style. This movie should not have been made.,5,3,5,7 March 2012
American Made," For anyone who enjoyed Narcos
","For anyone who enjoyed Narcos the best series on Netflix, this is a real treat. It's got a light comic tone and lots of grinning from the youthful looking Tom Cruise as the Top Gun style commercial pilot who gets recruited by he CIA to do some covert flying into Nicaragua. While there he takes the opportunity to make some money by running drugs for Escobar et all into Louisiana. This true life story of Barry Seal is fast moving and an illuminating look at the complicated relationship between the different drug cartels and the the CIA. The things that happened are so unbelievable they have to be true.",8,2,6,6 September 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not worth watching, even for Megan Fox fans
","Please don't watch this movie. There is not even 5 minutes of good film making here. This movie says absolutely nothing new from the first Transformers. This time, it is even harder to tell the good machines from the bad ones tumbling around in one nauseating fight after another. Even slightly more exotic locations in Egypt etc can't disguise the fact that there is no proper plot.No interesting or witty dialog or any humor at all. Such a waste of time and money. Michael Bay has really directed a total stinker. Why do the studios give him the money to make these silly things.Don't waste your time. You will totally regret it.",1,2,10,28 July 2010
Jersey Boys," Detailed but not uplifting
",Often the point of a movie version of a beloved musical is to give more story and detail than the stage version. Clint Eastwood surely gives more emphasis to the story. For fans of the musical it's fascinating to watch the characters of each singer brought to life in a less rushed manner than on stage where the story is more quickly handled that it's secondary to the music. In the movie the mob connection and role of each singer is clearly shown. The period detail is good and the actors and singers are all terrific having been picked from various stage productions.Unfortunately this shift in focus is what brings a damper to the overall feel compared to the musical. The story of the struggle to succeed is interesting but the break up of the group and the family troubles of Frankie Valli are depressing. The biggest fault was what Clint did to 'Can't Take My Eyes Off of You' by linking Frankie Valli's daughter's death to the song and having the performance in a ballroom. In the musical it was a grand happy build up and the feel good climax of the whole show. In the movie it felt so anti climactic.Overall it's a wonderful thing to have the great songs of Jersey Boys captured on screen for immortality. So despite the faults it's still worth watching for sure.,8,0,2,18 July 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Riveting
","Whatever the controversies it is riveting and well made cinematic version of the most significant man hunt in history the search for and killing of Osama Bin Laden.Because this movie is a sort of historical testament, if there never was any torture in the search, it shouldn't have been included. But as far as movie making is concerned the torture scenes keep one engrossed during the early part of the movie. It would have been hard to keep the tension up during the first third with the slow search for the contact that took years. The screenplay is quite adept at minimising confusion in a long story.The raid on the Bin Laden compound is scary and well filmed. Even in the darkness and green lights it still is quite clear what happened.Katherine Bigelow's direction is generally very good showing the viewer what they want to see. Some of the camera angles were a bit close and jerky at first but that soon stopped. Production is good with an on location feel.Jessica Chastain does a convincing determined and balanced performance that doesn't resort to painful jerky overacting like Clare Danes in Homeland.It is a scary and fascinating movie and well worth watching.",8,0,3,25 January 2013
Crazy Heart," Boring and ugly don't waste your time
",There is really nothing much to this story. Just a film spent looking at Jeff Bridges passed out or puking and hardly singing properly. The only good thing is that Jeff Bridges' mumbling is slightly discernible. Really didn't deserve to win the Oscar just a nomination would have been way enough.Maggie is unattractive as usual but suits the role for once after all she can't be too great looking to fall for Jeff. Colin Farrell is strangely out of place here - he doesn't look like he could have anything to do with country music at all - why on earth did they cast him? The ending is weak and you feel like nothing happened and you just wasted all this time watching trash.,1,5,10,18 July 2010
12 Years a Slave," A must see - heart breaking
","If you think you already seen enough of slavery on screen this year with Django, think again. This movie is completely effective because it's a true story of a free black man kidnapped into slavery. The film is direct and very personal in its photography and direction. The scenes of the brutality feel terrifyingly real. Every whip or beating has impact. The jumping back and forth in time in the beginning though not too confusing wasn't necessary. The story has a varied mix of good and evil white folk and plantation owners and the different types of sufferings both male and female that the slaves endured.The acting is excellent. Chiwetel Ejiofor who has always been good at acting worried and sad in other movies like Tsunami the Aftermath is very good here. He doesn't over do it and makes it believable. Of the other slaves, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey with her pure African looks is perfectly cast and her acting is convincing the scenes of her beating and rape are heart breaking and hard to forget. In contrast with the horrors, the photography of the plantations and Louisiana bayous is very scenic and evocative. Michael Fassbender and Sarah Paulson as evil plantation owners are better than expected. Casting of Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti wasn't so good. They came across as good guys playing bad ones for this role.Although the subject matter is so depressing and sad, this movie is surprisingly watchable. The brutality is never for the sake of violence but serves to move forward the plot. One of the best movies on slavery made to date.",10,6,11,19 December 2013
30 Days of Night," Don't waste your time
",Starts out with quite an eerie snowbound setting. But the story is weak and unpleasant and the whole show just feels like a waste of time.The story involves a lot of silly running around for no reason and stupid self sacrifices of the various 'heroes'. You certainly won't feel for any of them.Why did they have to make Josh Hartnett die? He came out almost when the sun was coming up anyway.The vampires for some reason speak some stupid language and look rather daft. Lets hope this director has not ruined Twilight Eclipse.,1,2,6,31 January 2010
Burlesque," Enjoyable - a real treat
",Aguilera is multi talented - she can belt it out in different styles and act as well. The dance and song numbers are over the top and well choreographed. The camera angles were good - didn't jump around much like some of the recent musicals like Chicago.The supporting cast is top notch. Cher is a bit facially frozen but she is amusing to watch. Kristin Bell is a surprise here - who knew she had the vamp in her. Tucci and Gallagher are good. Eric Dane is just sleazy enough. Cam Gigandet is a cool boyfriend.Loved the old fashioned feel good storyline and neat plot. The romance is lighthearted and predictable in a good way. No ugly characters and unnecessary angst. The dialog is quite fun and witty throughout. It was like watching a good Broadway musical but with a more attractive cast.One of the more enjoyable musical movies of the past few years.,9,1,2,20 January 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," Make this your summer blockbuster choice
",This is an very enjoyable well written and entertaining sci fi action movie that works.Tom Cruise plays a reluctant soldier thrown into combat against alien forces in Europe.The story is clever and comes together well. The Groundhog day formula works - it provides laughs and keeps you interested for details. It has in intelligent feel because things add up without unnecessary red herrings. Yet it isn't confusing at all like other time travel shows. You don't feel like you wasted your time watching the different scenarios. Liked the homage to D Day landing beaches theme. Liked the European setting.Tom Cruise does a good job. He doesn't look too aged like some other action movie actors who are past their prime. He can still do the action convincingly and only flashes his trademark grin once. His charm helps make the character likable. Emily Blunt is believable as the soldier. She has a sincere look that is likable. I at first thought she didn't have the appeal to lead a major blockbuster but she is actually very suited to the role. It isn't a romantic movie after all. The fight scenes are well done. With enough variety of scenery and not dizzying like some others.Found this more enjoyable than X Men. Worth watching on the big screen.,10,2,5,6 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," More painful than funny and the music is just mediocre
","This follow up isn't as good as the original as they compete with a rather unfunny German group all the way to Copenhagen. It's nice to see the cast again especially Brittany Snow and Anna Kendrick and they look quite good. There are some funny one liners here and there like about Hayden Christensen and Germany & America. But generally the humor isn't funny mostly painful especially new addition Hailee's lines. Rebel Wilson isn't even as funny as usual.The music isn't great, every time a nice song comes along it's just a couple of seconds. There just isn't enough good music for a musical. The original songs are just forgettable and derivative. Not even as good as a mediocre Glee episode.Can't understand how this could be the highest grossing comedy musical of all time. It's far from one of the best musicals of all time.",3,4,16,2 October 2015
Whiplash," Comically exaggerated and entertaining
","The nasty teacher from hell that we've all had is exaggerated to the point of comedy but this makes for an entertaining movie unlike others before. A top musical school is the setting where a young jazz drummer played very convincingly by Miles Teller. JK Simmons in his award winning role as Fletcher plays an over the top abusive in all senses of the word teacher. The verbal, psychological and physical abuse is shocking and darkly funny at the same time. Amazingly this movie is exciting and the pace is quick and involving. Even though the music isn't that varied what is featured is used in an exciting manner.It's over the top but so what, I had a good time watching it.",8,0,2,19 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Laugh out loud funny with a perfect cast
","This excellent true story comedy of a wall street hotshot downfall is laugh out loud funny. It's well written, over the top at times about the drugs sex and excess but it's comically so and relevant to the story. The way the dialog is written and the way the scenes played out is fresh and witty. The scene with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler on the boat is hilarious. So is the drive back from the country club. Doesn't feel draggy even though it's nearly 3 hours long because the story moves along and the characters are sympathetic.The casting is terrific. Leonardo demonstrates some good comedic delivery without overacting even if the scenes and dialog are a bit exaggerated at times. It's good he isn't playing a more familiar person so you don't have to deal with him not looking much like Howard Hughes or J Edgar Hoover. Jonah Hill has some hilarious moments that he pulls of well like the cousin conservation. Margot Robbie is quite good as the poster second wife. The European supporting cast is perfect - Jean Dujardin as a sleazy Swiss Banker is spot on as is Joanna Lumley as the English aunt. Wonder why Matthew McConaughey is skinny and haggard for this movie as well.Liked it more than American Hustle. Good to have a comedy about Wall Street crooks to contrast with the more serious Wall Street 2 and the recent documentaries. It doesn't glamorize drugs rather it shows the effects. Good warning about the dangers of penny stocks.",10,7,19,10 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," I don't get it - not funny at all
",I just don't get this story. As a comedy it isn't funny except for the scene between Alden and Ralph where he is directing him. That was the only laugh. Josh Brolin looks quite convincing as the fixer in a Hollywood Studio.Things I didn't get: 1. The twin gossip queens played by Tilda Swinton. Strange. 2. The gay themed sailor dance starring Channing Tatum. 3. The gruff way Scarlett Johansson's swimming movie star was behaving. 4. Slapping George Clooney - was that supposed to be funny?I guess it's just the day in the life of a studio fixer. The only thing to admire here is the look of the 50s Golden Age of Hollywood is captured well. It's a handsomely filmed movie. But the looks can't save this unfunny movie.Bad Cohen Brothers,2,5,9,18 March 2016
The Reader," Distasteful and unpleasant
",This movie is distasteful in the extreme. The storyline is really about nothing at all except a silly affair between two unattractive people. With all the good stories about WWII why do they pick such a silly topic to make a movie about. Why do some people think that you just throw in a bit of WWII and it becomes serious art? The characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting. Kate Winslet's constant need to display her nudity rears its ugly head again. Absurd to give her an Oscar for this unconvincing performance.The young boy is daft looking. Ralph Fiennes is totally miscast. There is no way that boy could have turned into Ralph Fiennes.Don't waste your time on this kind of unpleasant 'entertainment'.,1,5,26,30 July 2010
Dark Shadows," Quite delightful throughout
",Liked the story. It's 90% dark comedy and it works especially with the 18th Century vampire adapting to the 1970s. The humor is quite sophisticated. As expected the Tim Burton style and effects don't disappoint.Johnny Depp carries the movie. Eva Green is quite good as the witch. She is better in these kinds of monstrous roles. What they did to her reminds me of 'Death Becomes Her'. Michelle Pfeiffer is still lovely in a natural way. Chloe Moretz is still cute. Some reviews say it lost steam but I think it was alright. Could have had a bit more good lines from the supporting cast though. Worth a watch for sure.,7,1,3,7 November 2012
12 Strong," Finally a war movie where you can root for the heroes
","Finally a heroic war movie with lots of action that is an interesting true story and the viewer can root for the hero because they are on the right side of history. There have been a lot of war movies recently that are on the depressing side where everyone but one is killed, or it's an anti war movie where the futility of war and being on the wrong side for the wrong reasons, or they are up against overwhelming odds and put up a valiant fight but fail. 12 Strong isn't one of those being set in 2001 before things got all muddied in Iraq.. The story is simple and clearly explained and the mission is easy to understand. They are the first force to go after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. As things progress the battles become more and more intense from planes dropping bombs then scary gun battles to tanks vs horses to a grand finale that is a true Western style horses and guns blazing all out battle. The cast is good - Chris Hemsworth doesn't overwhelm the screen so he is convincing enough. Michael Shannon plays a soldier quite well too. There are a few slightly cheap things about the beginning and ending, it's not as slickly done as a Peter Berg movie. Nevertheless it's a good solid almost old fashioned in concept war movie that leaves you with a good feeling.",8,115,247,18 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Creatures galore
",You get a lot for your buck here - not just King Kong but a whole bunch of giant animals and insects. And the effects are good so the fighting between the animals is quite something. It's also quite a violent movie with a pretty high body count - feels like a Vietnam War movie. The filming was in fact in Vietnam and Hawaii and it's quite beautiful and exotic.Brie Larson is good for this role not annoying and believable. Tom Hiddleston is miscast - like some Engish gentleman on a hunt. Out of place. Samuel is a good match as Kong's adversary. And John C Reilly is good in this role for a change. There is a sense of adventure and a variety of scenarios and creatures that sets it apart from another Jurassic style adventure.,7,3,4,6 October 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Good riddance to bad rubbish - excruciatingly drawn out
","The fiery dragon wreaking havoc is good. But then things start to get sleep inducing again. Whenever Bilbo comes on it just gets so boring. As for the fighting I gave up figuring out who is fighting whom for what. The story isn't enough for 2 and a half hours. There is less impact due to the split into 2 parts. Don't feel for any of the characters. The greed of the dwarfs, the love affair. Big mistake. The large scale battles were excessive in their CGI and uninvolving. The individual battles were better. Legolas fight on the bridge thing was good. However it was so irritating having Evangeline Lily's character distract her dwarf boyfriend and kind of causing his death. Luke Evans as the concerned father is a good plot to have developed but then it kind of loses it's thread.Watch this if you have to but it's just good riddance to bad rubbish",1,32,63,19 December 2014
Inception," Absolute nonsense - don't waste your time or money!
","This is a totally incomprehensible movie. Unlike other jigsaw puzzle movies of today this one doesn't come together at all. There is no excitement since you can't understand what is going on anyway. There is no emotional connection with the characters since its just a mess. One scene just moves to another without any explanation or logic. I concentrated as hard as I could and it didn't make any sense at all. Even if I watched it another 3 times I still wouldn't understand it.Ellen Page looks like she was plucked from Junior high and thrust in the middle of the Matrix. Cotillard is out of place too. Even Leonardo and Gordon Levitt don't seem enthusiastic at all. Don't waste your time just because Leonardo is in it. This is his worst movie ever. This may be one of the worst movies ever period. You don't learn anything, feel entertained, laugh, cry or feel any excitement at all. The only things you feel are bewilderment and confusion and frustration. The praise - its just the Emperor's new clothes. The box office? Just the blind leading the blind.",1,27,51,26 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," The 1974 version is better - just watch that one instead
","It was a mistake to remake this movie. The 1974 version had a much more stellar cast and was in color. This 2017 version is inferior. Kenneth Branagh who is the worst Hercule Poirot in history. He just can't do any role that's nor British. He was a terrible Nazi now he is a terrible Belgian. He's incomprehensible and unconvincing. Johnny Depp is wrong for the villain compared to Richard Widmark in the 1974 version. Johnny is so benign looking.The production is handsome but it isn't clear the way the details emerge. If I didn't know the story from the 1974 version, I would have been confused.Don't bother.",3,6,10,24 January 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Difficult to follow the story and understand Robert Downey Jr
",It was mostly confusing and incomprehensible. This is not fun for the whole family and I doubt most children would enjoy it.Firstly the good points: Atmosphere of Old London quite vividly brought to life.Rachel McAdams is luminous but the character she plays is irritating. Jude Law is OK but his role is not really necessary.Bad points: Guy Ritchie's style of directing is confusing and he packs in too much plot detail into every single minute. Need to concentrate too hard to figure out what is going on and he expects you to remember all these split second images as clues. Interaction between the leads was strained.Acting: Robert Downey's speech is unclear and hard to make out. Couldn't understand about half of his dialog. Why didn't they just cast an English man in this role? Story: There are very few funny or witty moments. The trailer is about as funny as it gets. So it is not a comedy at all. The dialog is not very pleasant or entertaining The overall confusion and chaos leaves you unsatisfied. Still don't understand the new crime at the ending. Or the role of the professor. Still some loose ends and the plot doesn't come together like why was Watson's girlfriend so strange.Overall: Not an enjoyable movie. Just too hectic and unclear.,2,5,12,31 January 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," An emotionally devastating Korean war movie with stunning battle scenes
","An emotional powerhouse of a movie, this involving epic story is about 2 brothers caught up in the Korean War and shows the terrible chaos of the arbitrariness of the 2 sides of this tragedy of a civil war. The epic battle scenes feel so real and you are terrified throughout because you want both brothers to live.This is the best war movie centered around a story about individuals as opposed to a specific battle. I can't recall a recent Hollywood movie that can come close to the personal impact about war that this movie delivers. Looking back at Saving Private Ryan and Platoon they all feel less meaningful compared to this.There are times when you want to shout don't do this or don't do that or don't go there but the plot and the characters of the 2 brothers is there to show the personal toll this conflict took on the Korean people so you can understand the poetic license.One of the great war movies of all time.",10,0,0,1 February 2020
The Blind Side," Feel good
",You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this story of helping others. Its competent for what it is.Bullock is good. She does not overact. Lucky it wasn't a heavy competition year or she might not have won for this role which didn't require that much acting.The movie avoids sentimentality. The only thing is the saintliness of Leigh Ann and her family is almost hard to swallow. Maybe it should have shown some more of the difficulties of the family's acceptance of the adoption to be more balanced.The actor who plays Michael seems a bit impassive. I guess it was deliberate.Worth watching once.,7,0,0,24 July 2010
Parasite," Unforgettable and original
","Stunning. This is a movie of superlatives. Every aspect of this movie is well done from the original story to the acting and directing. It is a drama, comedy, unbiased social commentary, thriller - a lot in one.The completely accessible and involving story is well written and constructed - every scene has a purpose. Given the extremes that this story goes to - it's still plausible - the thriller elements don't get out of hand or descend into stupidity. There is a social commentary on class and wealth that is so effectively laid out from start to finish. It has changed the way I
think about relationships across the wealth divide.Don't read anything about the story before you watch it. Just go and see it.This Korean cast and director have made an unforgettable film that will be talked about for years to come. And it deserves every accolade out there.",10,26,42,18 December 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Puts you backstage Broadway
",The best thing about this movie is the backstage look at mounting a Broadway play with all the insecurities and neuroses of the personalities involved. The photography really puts you there in the back streets of the theater district and makes it look pretty gross. The fantasy alter ego bird superpower thing is okay not too much till the ending which should have been more resolved.Michael Keaton's performance is good and reminds sometimes of Beetlejuice in parts with the hyper muttering. Don't really feel that much for what his character is going through. Naomi Watts is good as the insecure actress. Wish there was more of her. Edward Norton is a bit unattractive to be the leading man of Broadway. Emma Stone looks disheveled as the ex rehab daughter but sounds a bit together to have been in rehab.Worth a watch for it's originality - although not a classic for the ages.,7,0,6,16 January 2015
The Big Short," Some parts are okay but a lot was confusing and boring
",I didn't enjoy this movie that much even though I was interested in the subject matter. I think it was just that how these people shorted the market isn't that interesting an aspect of the crisis. It's technical and boring. There were some good points here and there.The good points first: The little explanations of the toxic products were illuminating. The way the main protagonists found out about the depth of the crisis was also entertaining. There are some interesting moments like how S&P gave out their AAA rankings.The bad points: The main characters are just not very interesting to make a movie about and you don't feel for any of them or understand what they are talking about for a lot of the movie. Christian Bale's character was kind of uninteresting. The wake you up strippers and music were kind of daft and spoiled the tone. The conflict that Steve Carrell's character or Brad Pitt's character felt about making money from the crisis wasn't very genuine. There are 2 movies about the financial crisis that are much better about the crisis itself: the HBO movie 'Too Big to Fail' and the excellent 'Margin Call'. I understand that 'The Big Short' wasn't trying to tell the same story and it was showing things from the POV of these people who shorted. It may have the nominations and the A list movie stars but it ranks below both of the above in terms of clarity and entertainment value.,5,2,5,17 January 2016
The Conjuring," Scary and superb - horror is on the right path again!
","How wonderful it is to have a real classy haunted house horror movie again. Recently there have been lots of gory slasher films but not many effective ghost and possession movies. 'Haunting in Connecticut' wasn't great. In the Conjuring you get a lot - creepy dolls, a very haunted house, demonic possession, paranormal investigation etc. This movie is wonderfully nostalgic in the best way - the setting and straightforward story without the overuse of modern effects. But it doesn't feel dated.This is based on a real life haunting during the 70s in a rural house in Rhode Island. The creepy history involves witches. Ed & Lorraine Warren investigate and help the young family the Perrons which includes 5 young daughters. There are so many vulnerable people there it keeps you constantly on edge. Liked the house and setting of the movie - historic looking but not obviously creepy. The screenplay is effective at making it feel like a true story. It allows for you to get a feel for the people involved. The cast is well chosen. Playing the Warrens, Patrick Wilson and the lovely Vera Farmiga look so right in their 70s get up. She has a sympathetic face for this kind of role. As Mr Perron Ron Livingston looks suitably baffled and worried. His wife is played by Lili Taylor is a talented actress who should be in movies more often. The kids are good too especially Joey King of 'Romona and Beezus' who is convincing at looking scared.The directing by James Wan is well paced and effective showing you all you want to see - providing real scream out loud scares. He doesn't use unnecessary shock tactics or film too much in the dark. The scares are saved for the most effective parts of the story. For fans of Wan you get much more than in 'Insidious'.Heed the R rating it's frightening enough to play on the mind after the movie is over like the original 'Amityville Horror'. Although kids are in the show it is way too frightening for kids to watch.Let's hope this movie sets the right path for horror movies again. After all there are so many 'based on a true story' hauntings to adapt. Can't wait for the sequel.",10,0,1,12 August 2013
Prometheus," Story doesn't make much sense
","THe story doesn't make enough sense. Things don't seem to add up or lead to anything with lots of red herrings.What was the opening scene's creature relationship to the rest of the story? Why did David the android infect Holloway? Why were there all these different kinds of alien creatures the bald human like creature, the squid baby, the snake? Generally the characters were not interesting except the android played by Fassbender was interesting to watch. The Cesarean scene was quite morbidly fascinating.The effects are grand but too much was in darkness.Charleze was too good for this movie. Noomi is an interesting heroine, not too pretty and not too tomboyish.Overall it doesn't make much sense - don't bother. Even the Aliens series had a better story.",2,0,4,14 October 2012
The Water Diviner," Well filmed - entertaining if imperfect story
",Surprisingly I enjoyed this historical war drama about a father searching for his sons in the aftermath of WWI in Turkey. The Gallipoli battle scenes are well done and exciting. The locations are stunning and exotic. The Istanbul hotel is charming. Some of the continuity is lacking between scenes and the story seems to progress abruptly in some scenes. The sending of so many British soldiers after one poor old man is ludicrous.The story is interesting and is well crafted around the historical context. Looking for bodies in the aftermath of battle is quite a powerful anti war statement. Liked the political correctness by showing the Turkish point of view (you invaded us). The weakness is in the message of reconciliation which is a bit too strong - hints of romance between Crowe and the stunning Olga Kurlyenko and between his son and the lady of the night is too much. Russell is too old for Olga. That kind of cheapens the effect and seems like a plump old man's fantasy.Worth a watch.,8,1,3,28 January 2016
Wonder Woman," Amazingly well done - Gal Gadot is a star!
","Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish this is the most well made of the recent superhero movies.Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, so beautiful she makes every scene she is in watchable, yet sweet enough to be endearing and statuesque enough to be convincing as an Amazon goddess. She really has the chance to shine here that she didn't have in the Furious movies. Thank goodness they cast her instead of some other less convincing actress. Chris Pine as the spy who brings her to War. They look fine together even if they could have cast a slightly younger actor.The story is clever, blending her origins with World War I. Liked the humor interspersed which felt quite spontaneous and not corny at all. Managed to incorporate enough things from the original series like the wrist bands and lasso. but not the plane and spinning around.Beautiful production from the stunning Mediterranean isle to London. I read that the look of the movie was inspired by the painter John Singer Sargent and there is a painterly quality in the color palate and art direction that makes the historic setting very attractive - look online for his paintings of WWI soldiers and the painting 'Gassed'.The battle in the Western Front is the most exciting WWI trench warfare battle sequence I have seen. It doesn't matter that it's fantasy - it was thrilling.Villains here are pre Nazi era Germans - they just can't get a break on screen. The ending is grand - maybe a few explosions could have been cut.For sure the blockbuster movie of 2017.",10,23,51,1 June 2017
Marriage Story," Divorce the good bad and the ugly
","A well written drama dealing with divorce in 2019 is overdue. Kramer vs Kramer first showed divorce from a man's point of view. Then there was the memorable dark comedy / horror story The War of the Roses. Now we have this superb movie. So many good points. It excellently covers the toll on the parties of the financial and legal negotiations. Excellent array of lawyers played by Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. Despite their best intentions initially this divorce was bound to be a messy one with adultery, custody financial issues and geography all coming into play. From the beginning it's sad to know the little things that are going to be used against each other eventually.We get a whole range of the emotional turmoil from some ironically funny moments to the big quarrel between the pair which is quite devastating. Surprisingly the child seems the least scathed in the battle.Scarlett does a good job of acting genuinely sad. You feel for her. Adam Driver gives a tour de force performance. His strong personality works in this movie and his emotions on screen are so accessible to the audience.A must watch. Be prepared to be left sad but enlightened.",10,3,8,10 December 2019
The Queen," Helen Mirren is great even if she doesn't look like the Queen at all
","Helen Mirren is a terrific actress and deserves all her awards. All the more so because physically she doesn't resemble the Queen at all. She is slim and Russian looking. The Queen is more plump. Their bodies looked distractingly different. But she did a captivating performance.Good supporting actors like James Cromwell as Prince Phillip. Though the Prince Charles was a bit unlike him.This movie isn't so much about Elizabeth II, as about her reaction to Princess Diana's death. If that is the most interesting thing in her life to make a movie about then so be it. In the end I don't really think it is such a great movie because the subject matter isn't really about the subject itself but rather a specific event that concerned another.",5,1,2,24 October 2012
Taken 2," LOVED IT, best thriller since the first TAKEN
","This movie succeeds both as a sequel and as an action movie on it's own. It helps to be familiar with the first Taken (remember 'Listen very carefully') but even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it. Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen are taken in Istanbul and Maggie Grace steps up to help rescue them. There are so many things that are good about this action thriller: 1. Makes good use of Maggie Grace - liked her part and the father daughter co-operation.2. It relies on Liam's ingenuity (finding locations) in a Mission Impossible way using his 'set of skills'.3. Builds on the story of my favorite bad guys 'Marco from Tropoja'. I'm afraid it isn't too flattering to Albanians but it kind of does put the country on the map. 4. Great use of Istanbul rooftops and streets for pursuit and car chases.5. The fight sequences for Liam Neeson and the kidnappers is varied but not graphically violent. It shows good action is based on co-ordination, choreography and originality not gore. There isn't much profanity too so it's actually more family friendly than many other thrillers.6. Some unexpected humor. You'll see. Forget the bad reviews - what haters! If you are a fan of other Luc Besson movies you'll love this one.",10,56,113,4 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Genuinely spooky ghost story - very well done a must see
",This is an excellent adaptation of Susan Hill's novel about a young man who goes to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman in an old spooky house where he sees a woman in black. People in the village are scared and it involves the children. It's so refreshing to watch a ghostly horror story instead of a gory slasher movie like Nightmare or Friday etc. A real ghost story is more frightening and much more entertaining in the end. A single ghostly apparition is more scary than all the CGI and shock tactics that many modern movies use. Daniel Radcliffe's face is older and he suits the role. His short stature isn't obvious. He acts well and his facial expressions are good. He is versatile. Looks like he has a good grown up career ahead of him after Harry Potter. Supporting cast like Janet McTeer and Cirian Hinds are good too. The production is very well done. The eerie house (where did they find it?) and village are very authentically recreated. Well captured atmosphere and good photography. I saw the stage play in London and this movie is much better and grander. For those who know the Hammer productions this is much more big budget and beautifully filmed. The story is consistent and makes logical sense in its own supernatural way. in The ending is in the Hammer tradition. A must see.,10,2,5,15 March 2012
The Wolverine," A huge improvement
","This is much better than the 2009 'X Men Origins'. It has an onward momentum, involving characters and an exotic story set in Japan with a bit of WWII. Wolverine protects a Japanese friend's daughter.Liked the seaside setting in Nagasaki and the Tokyo villa. The mostly Asian cast is good from Korean American Will Yun Lee to the two different but attractive Japanese actresses: the lovely model like Tao Okamoto as Mariko and Rila Fukushima as a feisty sidekick. Hiroyuki Sanada from Revenge plays Marikos evil father.The action sequences aren't tedious. Liked the bullet train scene. The various martial arts sword fighting and arrow sequences are clearly done. If there had been any more fights it would have been repetitive. Only the last part was a bit too overblown. Unfortunately the Famke Jansen flashbacks are a bit annoying - she is getting a bit old for the flashbacks. Didn't really need to have the Japanese girl and gaijin hookup.Hugh Jackman still is fine in his tough role despite the passage of time and puts a lot of effort and intensity into it.Overall if you are thinking of giving this one a miss it would be a mistake. This is a worthwhile summer blockbuster to see on the big screen.",8,4,9,2 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A bit confusing but quite grand and sweeping
",There are some good points and some weaker points in the movie.There is a grand feel especially towards the end. Quite exciting for a long movie like this.The cast is good. All A List even in smaller supporting roles like Matthew Modine. Anne Hathaway is attractive and the role suits here here. She has chemistry with Christian Bale. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a sympathetic looking cop. Minus point: The story is a bit confusing especially if you don't remember Dark Knight's characters and story. There are lots of different things going on and sometimes I was wondering who was doing what to whom and why. Tom Hardy was hard to understand. Did they have to make him talk through that thing. Didn't like poor Batman being so little of a hero for much of the movie. His fighting seemed like normal people boxing. Never like to see the hero suffering too much. Overall it's alright but not perfect.,7,0,6,28 October 2012
Mother!," Please don't watch this
","There is not way in the world this could be considered a good movie. What a waste of good actors - 2 Oscar winners, a great beauty and one of the finest character actors out there. Jennifer acts well but what a waste of talent. Javier as some fame whore is convincing but what on earth for? Michelle's attitude is quite something - she should act more.Too many things that don't add up to anything - red herrings and pointless scenes and dialog. It's not clever and just so awful.Tried to be fair to see the allegory about mother Earth and Adam and Eve is just not enough to justify such an assault on the senses.",1,34,65,29 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dumb story
",What the #$%* was the quarrel between Batman and Superman about? And the sudden change of heart. There has never been such an expensive grandly produced movie with such a weak story.The actors are good given the silly material they had to deal with. Ben Affleck looks unhappy enough - can't have been easy to play such an irritating role here. Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot look their parts. Look forward to seeing more Wonder Woman. Amy Adams is still pretty even though she is quite a lot older than superman it doesn't look it. Diane Lane was aged realistically. The exception was Jesse Eisenberg who was just too small and whiny to be taken seriously as a villain. Wasn't clear how he manage to create that oversized Krypton monster.This is one of those movies you kind of have to see but ask why couldn't it have been better. It's all about the story!,2,2,10,28 March 2016
Tombstone," The best version of this legend
",Superb. There is no better movie version of the OK Corral shoot out than this. It is so exciting - with perfect pacing and a stellar cast. It has an action adventure pace and leaves out some historical facts about the Earps and character interactions etc but it doesn't matter you can't put everything in a movie. When you compare this to the old B&W version with Burt Lancaster it is just such an improvement. The actors are perfectly cast. Kurt is excellent as Wyatt. Val Kilmer has one of his best roles as Doc and the others are great too like Joanna Pacula. Thomas Haden Church is terrific. Michael Biehn is a good bad guy Johnny Ringo. The Kevin Costner movie about Wyatt Earp may have more details about Earp's life but was a bit of a drag overall. Even watchers who aren't generally fans of Westerns will like this one. I'm generally not a cowboy movie spaghetti western fan and don't like the trend of the recent 'ugly' and realistic Westerns but this isn't just a simple Western - it's historically based and the story isn't contrived since it's based on a true story. This is a must watch.,Null,0,2,3 October 2011
The Greatest Showman," Jackman's talent propels the show but the songs are weak
",It's great that Hugh Jackman has another chance to fill the screen with his singing and dancing talent. And he is truly the star of this interesting biopic of PT Barnum. His strong vocals and energy propel the show on and the story keeps you wanting to see what happens. Michelle Williams plays his wife. Her voice seems thin and weak compared to his and she should have been dubbed. Rebecca Fergusson looks good as the diva Jenny Lind and even though she is lip syncing she moves you when her character is singing. Her face with it's old fashioned beauty is just right for the period. Zac Efron is alright if a bit small sized compared to the rest of the cast. At least he can sing and dance. Not much chemistry with Zendaya. The weak part of this movie is the music itself. The songs are derivative and the lyrics are banal relying on repetition of simplistic tunes and lyrics over and over again. The composing team is tragically untalented. The style of the music and songs are totally out of place with the setting. What a waste of such singing talent.Things slow down during the rather forced dramatic climax.Worth watching for Hugh,6,3,6,8 January 2018
Casino Royale," Bond has taken a wrong turn here
",There are many things wrong with this movie. I used to like rewatching Bond movies with Sean Connery and Roger Moore and even Pierce Brosnan because they are so entertaining. But this one is just revolting.1. Daniel Craig is a good actor but he is just NOT handsome enough to be Bond. He is a character actor and looks like the bad guy. Bond is supposed to be good looking and sophisticated. There are so many other actors they could have chosen who are more suited to the role. 2. Eva Green as a Bond girl? Think of the tradition of stunning beauties in the past from Ursula Andress to Jane Seymour to Kim Basinger to Teri Hatcher. Now look at Eva Green who is so lacking in sex appeal.3. The torture scene. Bond is supposed to get out of scrapes in the nick of time - not get wacked in the you know what.4. Judi Dench is wrong for her role. She looks more like a village grandmother than MI6.Producers and directors wake up. You got it all wrong here. No one will look back on this as a Bond classic like Goldfinger.,1,6,14,24 October 2012
Pitch Perfect 3," Meaningless story - this one better be the last
",The story has hardly and substance whatsoever. The appealing cast can't help by singing snipets of hit songs. All they seem to do is put on different outfits and sing a few bars of hit songs. John Lithgow with his fake Aussie accent is so ludicrous. Brittney Snow's romance with Matt Lanter's soldier character could have been developed more. Don't bother. This better be the last of them.,2,10,17,17 February 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Not funny - more often painful
",There is potential in the idea of a Nazi spoof but the creators are not up to par. The standard of humor or writing is very low. Where is Mel Brooks when you need him. This movie tries too hard cramming slapstick or unfunny jokes. The result is their are some funny moments but they are few and far between. The bad jokes spoil the effect of the few funny ones. When things turn serious and dramatic with the bombing it's more interesting but just too little too late. The spoof just does not work here.Rebel Wilson has the best accent and delivery. And the best lines. Scarlett Johansson as mother has a strange accent. Sam Rockwell gives a lazy performance. The Hitler imaginary friend overacts and he's the director.The movie only gets better at the end. So it neither succeeds as a comedy or a drama Or a spoof. Go watch the Producers for comedy or the Book Thief for drama instead.,3,108,248,29 December 2019
Lucy," Fascinating, watchable and understandable
",Scarlett Johansson plays a student in Taiwan who inadvertently gets caught up in drug smuggling and is exposed to a drug that makes her maximize her brain capacity way beyond normal boundaries. The bio sci fi is fascinating and stylishly filmed. Like the National Geographic like counterpoint imagery. The action is enough to keep action fans entertained. The car chase through Paris is quite something. On top of that you have Korean popular influence which is in so many current movies represented here. Liked the look back in time. You get a lot in this movie and it's held together by a strong performance by the moving and lovely Scarlett Johansson. You feel for her and that is not easy in a sci fi movie.Unlike Inception and the like this is sci fi you can follow and understand. May not get every part of it but it's okay. For this kind of movie it makes enough sense How versatile Luc Besson is - someone who can write Taken and this. Worth a watch.,9,5,13,3 September 2014
Midway," Best WW2 movie in decades
","Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling. I've always preferred the straightforward stories in Tora Tora Tora and A Bridge Too Far over the newer gory angst filled war movies and those which deal with obscure insignificant incidents. Unlike Bay's Pearl Harbor or the older Midway movie there is no wasted time on silly romances. Also the dragginess of Eastwood and the gore of Spielberg are not present here.The screenplay is clear and comprehensive from pre Pearl Harbor to the decisive day everything is clearly explained. Doolittle deserves mention. Good history lesson for some folks nowadays who seem to forget which country was defending themselves against those who waged aggressive wars! Slower moments are not dull as they are used to explain strategy, training and the role of intelligence.The air battle scenes and dive bombing scenes are thrilling yet clear. You can still see who is who. You are really put right into the center of things. Superb exciting cinematography without looking fake or too CGI.The casting is brilliant. Using distinctive famous actors to portray the various heroes helps the viewer remember who is who and build up sympathy for whether they make it or not. Ed Skrein usually the anti hero type role. Here he plays the cocky pilot and his eventual vulnerability is touching. Luke Evans is convincing as another hero pilot. Patrick Wilson is perfect as the intelligence officer who helped get it right. The older actors like Denis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart are well cast too and Woody usually a goofball is fine. Actors usually don't associate with historic roles like Darren Criss and Jonas are surprisingly right. Mandy Moore looks pretty and suitable in her WW2 getup. Should do more roles from this period. The Japanese naval officers are distinctive enough to differentiate.A truly international effort it took a German director, Chinese producers, an American writer and great British and American cast to make the best WW2 movie in decades.",10,125,223,7 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Grand revisiting of the past - the future doesn't look that great though
","The best thing about this movie is the delightful and nostalgic reappearance of the original Star Wars cast, robots, fighters and similar battle sequences. There are so many references and to the first 3 movies that fans will have a blast noticing them. The tone and humor of the original trilogy are well captured. Unfortunately the new elements, mainly the cast and the story aren't perfect. Story wise the mission is nothing really new - get attacked and then hit back and destroy . There is a shocking thing that happens but I have to say it happened to the wrong one. Cast wise, it's great to see the oldies again. Harrison looks better than in recent movies. Carrie looked a bit stiff. R2D2 and C3P0 are fine. The new cast however is hit and miss. The best new addition is Oscar Isaac. He is watchable and believable. Daisy Ridley is feisty and she reminds a bit of Keira Knightley but minus allure. That may prove a problem as far as romance goes. John Boyega is a bit plump and out of shape looking - not like a stormtrooper. Someone fitter looking would have been better. Adam Driver is a strange choice for the son of Leia and Han because he doesn't look like either one of them or a combination of the two. At least for now, Daisy, John and Adam don't seem to have the charisma to carry their roles.As a fan of 1 to 3, mainly 1 and not so much 4-6, I was glad to see a throwback to the first 3. Go watch it.",7,2,16,18 December 2015
RED," Clever and entertaining
",Thoroughly enjoyable action comedy about retired ex spys swinging into action again as someone tries to rub them out.This cast is top notch. Bruce Willis is his usual deadpan good. Helen Mirren is ladylike and delightful. Brian Cox looks fat but he's good as a Soviet spy. Morgan Freeman is older looking but John Malkovichh really has aged. Even Mary Louise Parker is less annoying than usual. Richard Dreyfuss should dye his hair he looks a bit washed out. But they are all fun to watch.The story is good full of humor and amusing situations and has a good logical storyline. The action bits are amusingly done. Highly recommended.,9,0,2,2 April 2011
Flight," Only the first part is worth watching the rest is depressing
",The flight and crash landing are well filmed. But then it's depressing irritating and uninteresting.It's not entertainment to watch the story of a drug addicted alcoholic pilot. It's all a bit far fetched.Denzel looks younger than of late. He acts okay but it wasn't an Oscar worthy performance. Just as well he didn't win. The supporting characters like the goofy John Goodman as a drug dealer are rather silly.The struggles with drug addiction and the druggie relationship isn't interesting and it's depressing.,2,2,7,7 July 2013
Unbroken," Very well done - from air to sea to land
","This true WWII movie about runner Louis Zamperini feels like several movies in one because a lot is covered - from the air to the sea to the land. So things are kept interesting throughout the 2 hours. Angelina Jolie did a fine job - don't understand the negative criticism. She puts the viewer very much in the place of the protagonists and shows what you need to see with just enough detail. The screenplay by the Coen Brothers is surprisingly lucid. Firstly there is an exciting plane battle which puts the viewer right in the vulnerable position of the crew. The story of Louis's running is inspirational. Then there is the survival in the sea on life rafts for many days. Situations like this have been shown before but here it is particularly well done. Finally the conditions at the prisoner of war camps. There is a lot of brutality shown, more so than previous movies like the recent 'Railway Man'. Can feel for each beating. The production values and technical aspects are top quality.The acting by Jack O'Connell is winning and convincing. He may not look very Italian even with the dyed black hair, but he gives a moving performance. The weight loss the actors had to endure is painful to watch. The actor playing the sadistic Japanese prison guard looks a bit androgynous - someone more menacing and masculine looking would have been better choice.This is a moving and harrowing movie that is well made deserving of more Golden Globe and Oscar nominations than it received.",10,11,20,5 February 2015
The Purge," Dumb story with annoying kids
","The story is so stupid. Can't believe it became a hit and a sequel is being made.Ethan Hawke looks gaunt. Lena Headey riding on the Game of Thrones success, deserves better than this rubbish.The 2 kids are the most irritating kids in the history of thrillers. How could they not give the son a dressing down for putting them all in danger by opening the defenses? After the boyfriend turned homicidal, why did the daughter run off on her own? The not so subtle class message is so crude that it fails to deliver any thing at all.Don't watch this movie or the sequel.",1,3,5,9 October 2013
Pitch Perfect," The actresses are talented for sure.
","One thing this movie about college level a capella singing competition demonstrates is that the actresses involved are multi talented from the control freak played by Anna Camp to the lovely Brittany Snow and of course Anna Kendrick. They can sing dance whatever. But Anna Kendrick as a the lead wasn't quite right. She is better in a supporting role. Anna Kendrick's face can't express different types of emotion, eg anger sadness happiness - it's all the same showing a bit of teeth like a beaver. The girls are the stars here. The leading boys are rather dorky and forgettable. Breakout comedic star Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy provides comic relief.The writing isn't that good some scenes could have been funnier. But at least it isn't as hyper and freakish as Glee. Some rather surprising negative stereotypes shown but overall it's quite a feel good pleasant movie.",6,4,10,8 November 2012
Godzilla," See this on the big screen - it's worth it
","This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch.",10,72,118,19 May 2014
Looper," Only partly successful - too loopy for my taste
","The movie is a bit of a mixture of styles and paces. Some Inception, some Die Hard, some Damien Omen. From futuristic cities to tenements to Shanghai. Maybe that is a good thing so that everyone can find some moments they enjoy. But in the end this movie is only partially satisfying.The first half hour is quite confusing. The silly shootings to close the loop are irritating. The thing about time travel movies is they have to be told simply and chronologically or you end up with a big mess. Of course no time travel story can make complete sense. This one tries to leave some things tied up but it still doesn't make enough sense.JGL and Bruce play the same person 30 years apart. JGL's makeup to look like Bruce was unnecessary and distracting. Emily Blunt is a bit too sophisticated looking for her role.Not a must see.",5,6,14,11 October 2012
Footloose," Not enough dancing plus not very well choreographed
",The 80s version had more energy and focus. This remake was a bit lacking in impact. The story is similar to the original but here the obstacles felt contrived especially the confrontations with the trashy boyfriend. Dennis Quaid and Andie Macdowell looked like they would rather be elsewhere.The group dancing and modern street style dancing isn't well choreographed and isn't exciting. Too much was done as a group and not enough emotionally interesting pairings.The casting was hit and miss. Kenny Wormald isn't handsome enough for the lead even though he is a good dancer. Julianna Hough is very lovely though her dancing wan't showcased well. It couldn't have amounted to more than a few minutes.Overall not a must see.,4,20,31,13 April 2012
50_50," It actually works - a comedy about illness
","This was funny touching balanced realistic and entertaining movie about a young man who gets cancer.The screenplay is well written. There are laugh out loud moments which I won't give away. It's touching just when it needs to be, never depressing which is a relief. There have been some recent movies of people with cancer that haven't been good eg 'A Little Bit of Heaven'. It's a fresh approach and isn't clichéd or deja vu at all. Good dialog throughout and lots of realistic details.The characters are balanced and real. They are quite endearing and none are irritating. Bryce Dallas Howard acts well. She plays the tricky role of the girlfriend with the right touch. Seth Rogen is funny and not annoying as the best friend. Angelica Huston is surprisingly soft and good as the mother. Anna Kendrick is suitably awkward as the novice therapist. Joseph Gordon Levitt gives a very well rounded performance as the cancer victim not overacting but very convincing.Given the subject matter which could have been terribly sad this movie thoroughly succeeds as a feel good touching comedy about cancer. Quite amazing.",9,0,0,29 August 2012
Deadpool," Funny
",This is different from the other Marvel action movies. It's primarily a comedy and a grown up one at that with lots of dirty jokes. The action is funny and inventive. Lots of one liners some too quick to process or catch.This movie suits Ryan Reynolds because he is a better at comedy than more serious roles. Morena Baccarin is very beautiful in this movie and deserves to be on the big screen more not just television shows that not that many people watch. Gina Carano is suited to her role but she has become a very stocky.Prefer this to Guardians of the Galaxy. Worth one watch.,7,1,10,19 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Like flipping channels for 3 hours.
","A grandiose production and stellar cast doesn't help this overly ambitious mix come together in a coherent movie. The series of different stories isn't set up well in the beginning so it feels confusing for a while. Then when they sort of come together it isn't clever or convincing. Maybe this story was unfilmable. It just felt like a mix of bad movies shredded and mixed up together. It tries to have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or other via corporate corruption, musical composition, the slave trade, science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.The white actors acting as Asian and vice versa are distractingly comical although I understand there is a reason for it.It's easy to see why it wasn't a box office success and didn't receive any major nominations.Skip it.",1,197,342,22 January 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," All the fun and inventiveness Bond has been lacking recently
","What a surprise this entertaining and very funny spy with an younger slant deserves to be a hit. A young delinquent whose father was a special secret agent gets recruited to join the Kingsman secret agents after a run in with the law.The effects, fight sequences and action are original which is no mean feat after all the action movies out there. There is violence but it is comic not Quentin gross. The good thing is the sense of humor that stays throughout the movie. The gadgets are inventive. There is a variety of settings and scenarios that keeps it interesting.Taron Egerton in the lead role is likable and his cockney accent is understandable. Unlike some of recent British comic action movies in the past like the Guy Ritchie movies, all the accents are quite easy to make out thank goodness. Good supporting actors with Mark Strong, Michael Caine and as well cast Colin Firth as a mentor. He is best in these kind of supporting roles. Samuel L Jackson plays the villain with a lisp.Definitely worth a watch - especially for those who aren't watching 50 Shades this President's Day weekend.",10,8,17,12 February 2015
Easy A," Good dialog and narrative insightful story
","The story is a change from the recent teen movies. It is more serious, well structured and thoughtful. The dialog is interesting and smart and the jokes and situations while not generally laugh out loud hilarious are quite unexpected and witty. The overall message is about rumors and reputation is actually quite insightful and entertaining. Also the pressure to fit in and concern about appearances rings true. The literary link up with the Scarlett Letter is well done.There are good supporting performances from Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow. Penn Badgely blends in well to a lot of movies now from The Stepfather to this one. Cam Gigandet is good too.Emma Stone has a lovely figure and she acts well but she hasn't got the most pleasant facial features. I understand she isn't supposed to be very pretty for this role. Its just that watching her face as the main feature for a whole movie is a little trying. Someone like Anna Faris might have been more watchable.Speaking about facial features, what on earth happened to Amanda Bynes? Did she have plastic surgery at her age? Still she is quite hilarious. This is watchable and enjoyable overall.",7,1,2,30 November 2010
Fast Five," More than just a car chase plus the Rock helps
",There is more story here than in the previous instalments. Combine that with an exotic setting in Rio and a stunning car chase climax it's well worth watching. Not just about car chases anymore. There is a daring break in. The Rock provides quite a good addition. His scenes with Vin Diesel is quite memorable. Couple of minus points: the way they portrayed parts of Rio as a gun infested slum must not be the image Rio is hoping to promote for the 2016. There could have been more attractive settings. Bit too sexist use of the ladies too. Overall enjoyable and a bit more far ranging than the last few.,Null,0,1,6 November 2011
Green Book," The best movie about racial prejudice in a long time
",The best thing about this movie is the characters in it. Ali portrays a classically trained jazz musician and highlights the dilemma of the highly educated and cultured Black man of his time. Viggo with weight gain and all is amazingly authentic as the good hearted hot tempered Italian American driver. There are some laugh out loud funny parts like the letter writing and fried chicken. The humorous tone and approach of the movie is what sets it apart from other race relation movies. That doesn't mean that it glosses over the discrimination at the heart of the movie. Even if you think you have seen enough of white people behaving badly in the South the incidents portrayed really cause the most righteous indignation in anyone watching. Very illuminating is the difference between the cops in the North and South.This is the best movie of the year.,10,0,2,24 January 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Better than New Moon - mostly enjoyable
","Really liked this one. I was so disappointed with New Moon. Thank goodness Eclipse is an improvement.Pluses: 1. Action and romance are back. There is a lot of action and romance for those who found New Moon a drag. Much more intimacy here as well. At least you feel you got your 10 bucks worth here. 2. Directing. Slade is also a better director than Weitz any time - better focus and faster pace.3. Acting. Kristen looked very pretty and carried the movie - no mean feat for an actress her age. The proposal and abstinence message were quite romantic. Rob is good though it's puzzling why his coloring seems to change from scene to scene. He doesn't seem consistently pale. Taylor's facial expressions are a bit limited and sometimes his face is a bit weird looking. They really do exploit him here poor thing. 4. More balanced storyline. A lot more air time for the supporting cast especially Rosalie and Jasper's backgrounds and the wolf vampire history are interesting. It was nice to get behind the characters more and have some explanation of the history. Although would have liked a bit more from the human classmates like Angela, Mike and Eric. Minuses: 1. Dialog.There are long heartfelt emotional speeches by the leads, and some of the dialog is a bit lame. Maybe some of the weaker parts could have been shortened. Ms Meyer's words do need a little help when moving from page to screen. In Twilight the dialog was more humorous and to the point. There are some funny moments though like Charlie's talk with Bella 'I'm a virgin!' and Jacob's 'I'm hotter than you'. 2. Score. The songs chosen were inappropriate and distracting especially when the Cullens were training the wolf pack. Twilight 1 was the best for scoring and music they need to look back to that for inspiration. 3. Casting The newborns Riley and the new Victoria - Bryce Dallas Howard are not special enough (why did they dump Rachelle Lefevre?) and you don't really get a feel for them like the James in Twilight. Basically lame looking threats - no charisma. I still think Dakota Fanning lacks menace she's just too babyish looking.4. Scenery. Some pretty parts used but the Seattle killings felt repetitive - is there only 1 dirty backlot they could have used? The meadow and clearing were not great. Photography could have been more stylish in parts. Overall an improvement over New Moon. I still find the original Twilight the most enjoyable. Eclipse was entertaining and romantic, a big step in the right direction for Breaking Dawn.",8,0,7,21 July 2010
A Walk to Remember," Not great not bad
",This is not the best Nicholas Sparks novel into a movie.There are some good points and some bad points. The romance is not that great like in the Notebook. The early part of the romance is terribly clichéd. But it is surprisingly quite moving after she gets sick. And then it turns into a decent tear jerker.Mandy Moore fans will enjoy this. But I found her acting ability limited. She had a daft look in trying to look angelic. If there was a bit more of her sickness in the story she might have shown more acting range. Lori Singer looked a bit frightful. Peter Coyote was a bit menacing. Shane West is a bit ugly and his expressions are unattractive.So in the end its an okay tear jerker but it is a bit weak.,6,2,2,14 October 2010
Spectre," Fizzles out fast - time to change both actor and director
","Things start out quite exciting with a spectacular helicopter sequence in Mexico City. But things fizzle out quickly and there are too many yawn inducing moments leading to a clichéd anti-climax of an ending. In between, it feels interminable. The actors: When the villain and the hero kind of look alike you know the Daniel Craig has to be replaced - even he himself doesn't want to do another Bond movie. Let a younger, less haggard, more suave actor take his place. Christoph Waltz as one of the more insipid Bond villains wasn't given the opportunity to shine. It seemed like a caricature of his other villain roles. That C guy was forgettable. Ralph Fiennes looked pretty dour throughout. As the main female lead Lea Seydoux was a bit of a plain Jane for the role. At least her diction is understandable. It was fun to see her quite proactive in the train fight but she lacks the special quality and unique beauty required in a Bond girl. Locations: At least there were some exotic places but Tangier could have been portrayed a bit nicer instead of that dirty looking hotel and street. Every time the location changed to London it got boring and drab. Wonder why they had to film in such wintry looking conditions in London. A few glamorous scenes would have helped balance things. The train was hardly a romantic place for the hook up.Gadgets and cars: The car chase in Rome seemed fake - not enough traffic on the road. The car didn't look very special - a bit last decade and common looking. Nothing unique happened with the gadgets or technology. The bomb watch was too simplistic. Directing and story: Sam Mendes isn't good for action. He let the pace slacken too much throughout. He needs to look at the recent 'Mission Impossible' or any Luc Besson movie to see how to keep up momentum. The plot was uninvolving - don't really get Lea Seydoux's role. The ending was so deja vu and predictable - giving him enough time to escape and tying her up. The falsetto Sam Smith song is out of place.Most fans will probably see this movie. Too bad it's hardly better than the dismal 'Skyfall'.",2,14,38,5 November 2015
Joy," Interesting process of inventing and selling a product
",Divorced struggling mom with a quirky family soap including addicted mom (a very funny Virginia Madsen) and dad (Robert de Niro) invents a special mop and makes it big. The process of invention and the business hurdles she faces are both interesting and entertaining. Jennifer acts well and evokes sympathy for the gutsy character. It's strange this was under the comedy category for the Golden Globes because her role is more dramatic than comedic. The highly flawed by funny family is the comedy part of this movie. Isabella Rossellini makes a welcome return to the big screen. If you read up on the real character you will find out that while the basic premise is similar (divorced mom invents mop) to the real person on whom it's based - a lot of the quirky family stuff is just fiction for the screenplay and that's fine.This uplifting and enjoyable movie is worth watching.,8,1,6,11 January 2016
Her," Strange but still fascinating
","This movie is better than you'd expect from the subject. It's watchable and fascinating although not without it's problems. The relationship is with the operating system is a tricky concept to accept. Although the communication and friendship are believable, the more romantic aspect isn't. After all he could never see her.Another thing that isn't quite right is how such a strange looking guy like Joaquin could have so many A list beautiful women in his life from Rooney to Olivia. Even Amy Adams is way too cute for him despite her geeky disheveled get up and hair.Interesting blend of China and LA for filming locations.Worth a watch but a bit long.",7,1,3,8 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," An endless ugly chase in the desert
",I just don't get the praise for this movie. The straight launch into fighting and chasing doesn't let one feel for the characters or identify with them. Lots of gross creatures chase each other in disgusting vehicles along the endless desert.Tom Hardy hardly gets a chance to act - could have been anyone. Charlize Theron is the star of the show and the only redeeming feature. She can do action as convincingly as drama and comedy. She is so beautiful it's a waste that she is used to play dirty roles in these monstrous ugly scenarios.Don't bother.,2,10,20,2 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A remarkable hero and a remarkable movie
","This is the best large scale war movie in years. The screenplay by Robert Schenkkan is emotionally charged and involving. The direction by Mel Gibson is superb. The battle sequences is second to none. Scary and not confusing at all. This movie is a must watch. The first part shows the childhood and character shaping events of Desmond Doss. It may seem slow to those eager for a typical war movie but his unique personality is what made him different and such a unique hero. His alcoholic father and other reasons why he abhorred violence are made clear. His romance is unlike some movies not annoying at all. Teresa Palmer makes a believable and warm love interest. She reminds of a more salt of the earth K Stew - really purty. His training and the opposition he faced not carrying a gun seems a little too much. Makes you more amazed why he still wanted to fight at all. All this gets a lot of sympathy for the main character emotionally like most Mel Gibson's movies you are 100% behind the hero.Then the battle begins. That ridge looks pretty daunting. I know it wasn't possible to film in actual locations since the location in Okinawa is very much built over. But the ridge doesn't look like the landscape of Okinawa I guess because it was filmed in Australia. But that doesn't detract much from the terrific battle sequences that are scary and some of the best ever filmed. After the first main battle is over then the heroics of Desmond start and they are just so unbelievable it has to be a true story. Andrew Garfield is right doing the hillbilly thing well and then the unlikely hero even better. He is perfect for the role. It helps to have recognizable supporting cast like Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey so you can remember who is who when they are fighting.This is a movie that will leave you spent. If Mel's name didn't carry with it the unfortunate associations with his tirades it ought to bag all the awards.",10,9,17,20 January 2017
The Runaways," Degrading for the 2 leads - don't watch it if you are a fan of either
",This is a depressing and totally unpleasant movie about sex drugs and rocknroll. It concentrates too much on the sex drugs and not the success. I am a fan of K Stew but if she chooses these kinds of movies she could damage her career and image. She wasn't really right for the role anyway. Dakota looked exploited and uncomfortable. There are other ways to demonstrate range as an actress instead of acting drugged out and drunk and skanky. The plot really amounts to very little its not worth your time. The kissing is cringe inducing and the angst is false. They didn't even sing properly so what's the point? If you are a fan of either K Stew or Dakota don't watch this or it will spoil your image of them.,1,5,11,27 July 2010
Me Before You," Beautifully done - superior handling of an old formula
","In a beautiful Welsh town complete with a castle and moat, a young waitress becomes caregiver to a wealthy handsome young man who has become a quadriplegic due to a traffic accident. He wants to end it and she comes to care for him more than just as a patient.Things are kept restrained and light hearted for most of the movie so that when more dramatic parts arrive it is much more effective. During the wedding of his ex girlfriend his pain is quite moving. The emotional climax in their tropical getaway is one of the more effective scenes in recent tear jerkers.Emilia Clarke gives an effervescent likable performance with her quirky costumes. Her character is likable and one that could easily have been annoying but she avoids that. Sam Claflin does a good job. Considering he can only move from the neck up for most of the movie he manages to convey all his character is going through. The relationship between the two is believable and not over sentimental. Charles Dance and Janet McTeer plays his parents. Liked the contrast with her working class family and their simple pleasures.If you can remember the Julia Roberts movie 'Dying Young', 'Me Before You' shows how to take a theme that has been done before but do it better.The issue about assisted suicide is handled well. It doesn't preach but you feel alright with his choice at the end.This movie deserved to be a success. Worth watching.",9,4,5,1 November 2016
Gladiator," Overrated
",Anyone who likes the old epics of Hollywood's golden age must cringe at this ugly and unenjoyable production.Russel Crowe must be the most overrated actor of this century. He is gruff and rough but he is just too fat and ugly for the hero. Just compare him to the heroes of the period epics like Charlton Heston. Why do they choose the opposite of handsome. He didn't have to be pretty. In the end who cares if he lives or dies.Joaquin is a bit modern looking and out of place for a Roman Emperor. Although he does have a depraved air - he doesn't combine a regal like presence with it. He's more run of the mill pervert. Connie Nielsen is a bit un Roman - too Northern European but at least she has a certain dignity.The awards this movie and its cast got are mostly undeserved.,2,5,10,7 August 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Rose is no Megan
",Steven Spielberg how could you? This is the third of a terrible trilogy of tumbling crashing metal. Hopefully it's the last. People how could you make this a billion dollar movie? It's just too brain dead. The only good thing : the battle in Chicago and the destruction in the city involves some amazing filming. But the robots all look alike and it's too long and confusing. A little less confusing than in the past. Michael Bay has always been about visuals and not story and dialog. This is no exception. Bad the worst thing is the casting. Rose Huntington Whitley just isn't beautiful. She is tall and slim but her face is way below average - actually quite frightful and her acting isn't good. Her diction is poor for a British actress too. Huge mistake replacing Megan Fox who was the only good thing about the last 2 movies. Patrick Dempsey isn't right as a villain he comes across as he always does - a weak good guy. Frances McDormand is usually such a good actress but even she can't do anything with the silly lines she is given. What a waste of time.,Null,1,4,4 November 2011
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Disjointed - doesn't engage the viewer
","This is a well intentioned film about the Bosnian war but unfortunately it doesn't work that well. Despite the powerful message it wants to deliver it doesn't draw one into the story. Firstly the good points. Angelina Jolie makes a good attempt and achieves a good on location feel. The battle and destruction scenes are quite effective - realistic not exaggerated. It is interesting to see the war from 2 sides with lead characters on both sides of the conflict.The main problem is in the story and screenplay itself. Maybe Jolie was taking on too much by both directing and writing. There have been more main stream movies about the Balkan conflict eg Flowers for Sarajevo and Behind Enemy Lines. I understand she was trying to make a very Un Hollywood movie but maybe a bit of a more traditional dramatic narrative would have been more compelling. Continuity in the story is lacking as the story is broken up between the love and scenes of fighting and other brutalities. The romance is unconvincing. Needed some serious editing.The main actress is good but the main actor is a bit cold. Their scenes together are awkward and painful to watch. Overall feels schizophrenic, disjointed and self indulgent.",3,34,51,30 August 2012
The Great Gatsby," An extravaganza - a very detailed update with some miscasting
","This is a modern re-imagining of the Great Gatsby. It works and doesn't in some ways. The most modern aspect of this movie is the over the top cgi mansions and parties with 21st century music. Gatsby's mansion was a bit hideous looking. While the scenery is quite magical in it's own way, the music was a mistake. It would have been better to use 20s music with a modern interpretation instead of the rock rap style music. The screenplay takes great pains to clearly lay out the whole story very explicitly both in background of the characters and the plot events. That is one of the strong points. The dramatic Plaza scene is well done.The casting consisted of some good choices and some bad choices. Carey Mulligan is much prettier here than in other movies like Wall Street 2 - she looks good in the period costumes and acts movingly vulnerable and weak enough for the role. Tobey is a boyish but quite suited. Leonardo is earnest but his face is a bit puffy. He isn't 100% convincing but it's a difficult role - none of his predecessors was perfect either - Robert Redford was wooden, Toby Stephens scowling. The main miscasting was Joel Edgerton who looked more like a thug than a blue blooded moneyed scion. He could have been Myrtle's husband instead. Doesn't look like he could have swept Daisy off her feet. Some one more preppy looking would have been better. Casting the Bollywood actor as Meyer the Jewish businessman was another distracting mistake.For a more realistic version, the Mia Farrow Robert Redford movie is a 'grown up' version compared with Baz's update. The scenery on location in Newport feels more authentic.Overall it's worth a watch for the spectacle.",7,0,2,11 June 2013
The Proposal," Strained
",The story is strained. And is basically one joke throughout. There is little romance in this unromantic comedy. 90% of the movie is the sparring and awkward situations. Only the last few minutes of pleasantness and romance during the credits. Hardly shows why they should fall in love at all.The cast tries hard but some aren't suited to the roles. Bullock is looking a bit old for romantic comedies. Don't think she can do too many more. Betty White is energetic. Craig T Nelson looks a bit vagrant like. Mary Steenburgen is a bit too elegant for the boonies. Ryan Reynolds is not quite leading man - maybe his over boyish voice and behavior. He looks a bit young for Bullock too.Overall not good but if you have nothing better to do why not.,4,3,3,12 August 2010
13 Hours," Just put politics aside and watch it
","As polarizing as this movie is just put your politics aside and watch it. The attack is a part of history that deserves to be put on screen in as grand and well produced manner as can be. And in that sense it succeeds. The filming in Morocco and Malta captures a really on location feel. The battles are well done and engaging, not over the top. It was a bit confusing at times distinguishing the main characters. Maybe they shouldn't have had beards for the movie because it made them look alike. Jon Krasinski and James Badge Dale, Max Martini and Dominic Fumusa are all good as the heroes. There is just enough background with kids and wives shown to put a human element to the people. Whatever your politics is, they were brave. Liked Jon Krasinki's characters statement about dying over there at the end.The journey under fire from the embassy to the annex was gripping. The prolonged gunfire and mortar attack on the annex was quite scary too. It was chaotic but as long as you kept the 2 compounds separate in your mind it was okay. Initially, a little bit less back and forth between scenarios would have been better. There are the 'bad' good guys - the incompetent CIA people especially the chief who gives the infamous and disputed 'Stand down' order. Wish they had shown a bit more of the Ambassador's death and recovery of his body but maybe it was just too disheartening for the screen. Some people against the movie are probably just unhappy it was made in the first place. Apart from the stand down and request for air support it isn't too directly critical of the administration. There might not be a way to make a movie about Benghazi that actually could make the haters happy. Watch this movie.",10,130,177,18 February 2016
Warm Bodies," Likable feel good quirky romance
","This Zombie - human romance comedy works and is worth a watch.Nicholas Hoult looks better as a Zombie because his features are a bit crooked especially the mouth. The whole get up actually suits him. His role could have been a bit idiotic but he pulls it off quite well. Teresa Palmer looks just like a blond Kristen Stewart. She acts well and is cute. Supporting cast is good including John Malkovich, Analeigh Tipton and Dave Franco.Liked the tongue in cheek vein of dark humor that runs through the movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some moments of laugh out loud humor but not quite enough.The story is quite satisfying and feel good that's why it was a hit.",7,0,2,16 June 2013
Sully," Well done recreation of the event but too much about the investigation
","Bottom line is this movie about good luck and heroism is a unique and rare true story that is worth watching and deserves a grand big screen portrayal. It shows everything you want to see about the water landing and rescue in painstaking detail. Tom Hanks is right for the role of modest hero. The production values are good and the content is interesting. Liked the way he imagined the alternatives to the water landing and the way the flight and passengers were portrayed quite realistically with middle aged stewardesses and cramped seats.The flaws in this movie are the structure and focus. Firstly the jumping back and forth in time breaks up the impact. Better if the story had been told chronologically with maybe just one flashback. The right way to do it would have been the whole flight and landing, then the investigation.Secondly the focus was more on the NTSB investigation which should have been maybe a 15 minute part of the movie. It was terrible that he had to justify his actions and you feel righteous indignation at the NTSB investigators etc who questioned his judgement. The exoneration could have been faster. So it was right they had all this in the movie but this aspect was dragged out and left a bitter aftertaste.Tom Hanks looks old here with his white hair and a little less lean than the real person. But he does a restrained and effective job. Aaron Eckhart is a good co pilot. Anna Gunn is good at playing the hateful character - here the villains are the investigators.There aren't many happy endings in events like this so it's good it was made into a movie. Worth watching.",8,2,5,9 September 2016
Valkyrie," good effort
",The story is fascinating and you feel the genuine frustration at the end - if they were all going to die why didn't one of them just shoot Hitler himself? Tom is better than usual - he avoids the million dollar smile. He still is a little bit all American but at least he didn't try to fake a German accent - that would have been a disaster.Kenneth Branagh has been playing a lot of Nazis but I don't think he is very convincing - he doesn't have an evil look. He is more like a milkman or a baker. Other supporting cast members are better.There was an earlier Brad Davis version which isn't as good as this called the Plot to Kill Hitler if you want to compare.,7,0,1,29 July 2010
The Martian," Intelligent science fiction
","This movie about a manned mission to Mars is over 2 hours long but it doesn't feel long. Each part is absorbing, from the evacuation to the 'Castaway' type survival innovations on Mars to the space rescue.The cast is all well chosen. Jessica Chastain is an intelligent looking commander. The likable crew includes Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Michael Pena. Matt Damon does a great job and is just the right person for this role not too hero like so he is believable.It's good to see brain power solve problems instead of super hero powers. This makes it a more palatable form of science fiction. I didn't always get how they reached all their scientific breakthroughs but managed to follow what they were trying to achieve. There is a feel good international co-operation going on with help from China.A couple of minus points. The set is a bit too much like a desert on Earth but I guess that's what Mars is like. Kind of wonder why they bother to go there if the planet is so unhospitable and it takes so long to get there. Even if it's hard to believe they would do all that to save 1 person the feel good aspect of the rescue is very enjoyable. There is much more to this movie than 'Gravity'.Worth watching on the big screen.",9,7,76,1 October 2015
The Fighter," Boring and unpleasant
",Boxing movies can be formula and unpleasant and this is no exception. It was very ho hum except for the fight at the end. Predictable story and not very interesting choice between sticking with his brother and going with his girlfriend's advice. Who cares. Plus points: Christian Bale is a versatile actor and he does act quite drugged out. He is quite a scene stealer but in the end who cares about his troubles. Minus points: Didn't like the jerky camera style. Amy Adams (the main reason I watched this movie) is a good actress but she was kind of miscast here. She plays against type and doesn't quite make it. Too sweet and classy still. Melissa Leo is okay but the performance isn't really that fantastic. Why does doing a good white trash imitation give the right to a nomination? Marky Mark is adequate but his story isn't worth telling. The people are uninteresting and unpleasant. The dialog uses expletives to add drama. If you missed this one you didn't miss anything. Don't bother unless you are a boxing fan. Just a step better than that depressing nightmare of a Million Dollar Baby.,Null,0,0,8 September 2011
Up in the Air," It's just not about very much at all - a total yawn
",This movie is really disappointing. The story is weak. It's about very little - a corporate downsizer and a boring little affair.The praise and nominations are really undeserved. Everyone hardly has much acting to do. George Clooney is his usual self with that little half smile. Vera Farmiga is attractive but she really doesn't have much to do. Anna Kendrick's much lauded performance as Clooney's young colleague is adequate but again there isn't a lot required of her. The story is not moving or interesting. The ending is predictable and you feel that nothing happened at all.If it wasn't a Clooney movie and heavily marketed I don't think it would have even got any nominations at all. It isn't even interesting enough to be a made for TV movie of the week maybe less.,2,11,22,31 July 2010
