It," Not worth the hype it got.
",Except the cold open there is nothing else to look out for. If you have watched the trailer then that's it there is nothing beyond that in film.,5,1,2,29 March 2018
Se7en," Should have been titled Fiv5 not Se7en
","Premise of the film is woven around 7 punishable sins : Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust,Envy and Wrath. People who exhibit any one of the these sins are brutally murdered one by one.Detective Somerset (Freeman) and Mill (Pitt) join the dots to catch this serial killer. 
Acting,cinematography,direction,background score, editing in Se7en are brilliant except the climax.Film is convincing till 5th murder but goes haywire in climax. Last two sins Envy and Wrath are not convincing.
And it is also confusing that people exhibiting any of the deadly sins are murdered or killed but person exhibiting Wrath goes to jail.",7,0,0,15 March 2018
Annihilation," No logic but film is executed beautifully plus incredible acting
","Don't expect much from the movie you are going to bang your head if you start looking for logic in it. But it's a well made film with power packed performances by Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson.",7,2,5,29 March 2018
