Changeling," Wow! Really good film based on true events
","Wow! I am blown away.I generally love films that are based on true events but this story is just unbelievable. It made me emotional, curious, angry... all at the same time.Also I really liked the fact that it played in the late 1920s.Also Angelina Jolie is great. I have never seen her like that and she would have really deserved the Oscar.Watch it!",9,3,4,5 January 2019
