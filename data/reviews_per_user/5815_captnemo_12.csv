Alien 3," Kills off the franchise.
","If you don't care about continuity, then this is the flick for you. If you don't care about good characters, then this is for you. If you want to see a future Doctor Who, then this is for you. The biggest problem with this flick is the beginning. In Aliens, Ripley risked her life twice to rescue Hicks, Bishop and the little girl. It was a major plot point and very important to the overall chronology of the films. Along comes Alien3 and the first thing the director does is to kill off all three of the people Ripley had worked so hard to save. These were the only people in the Universe she had any feelings for. To senselessly murder them killed off any interest I had in the rest of the film. The remainder of the flick was unpleasant at best, with no one to root for except Ripley. What kills this film and any others that may follow is the end. When Ripley jumps into the fire pit(Whatever it was) because she is carrying a queen alien just insulted those fans for whom Ripley was the Ultimate Survivor. Now she was dead, and there was no way to carry on the franchise. Alien4 was a cheap cheat, and the less said about it the better.",5,490,521,14 June 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Far too sloppy to be anything but a decent film
","When I first saw this in '82, people everywhere were praising it. I saw a film whose structure and story fell apart if you asked too many questions. For instance:-Elliot and his friends are being chased. They take the air nozzles off the bad kids bikes and the tires deflate!(This is one of numerous convenient things that happen in Spielberg films that would stop the film dead in its tracks if they didn't happen.) -If ET can fly, why didn't he just fly back to his ship at the first sign of trouble? (Another Spielberg convenience.) -One kid, being chased by bad kids, leaves the road on his bike and flies off a cliff into the top of a forest. He shows up in the next scene without a scratch.(Ditto. It was 'cute.')These things, and many others, are stuck inside a sappy, unconvincing, feeble story about an extremely ugly alien who mooches on a stupid, naive kid until the alien's parents come back to get him. This is the 2nd of a long line of spielberg films that are chock full of errors, logic laps, pathetic dialogue(especially if spielberg writes it.), and indifferent direction. His worst films are Hook, The Lost World, Close Encounters, and Goonies.Rating: 6 out of 10. The rating is so high because it is fairly entertaining.",5,2,5,14 November 2001
Citizen Kane," The Greatest, plus the other 9.
","Can there be any doubt that CITIZEN KANE is it? There have been critics who have called it the greatest 'American sound' film of all time. Let me clear that up. As far as silent films go, there are a lot of great ones. The General, Nosferatu, The Iron Horse, Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame come to mind. But all of them pale before Kane. When you turn to Foreign films, I'm sorry but none of them measure up either. Too many of them are culturally obscure, boringingly artistic or simply bad. There are great films made over seas, but again they fall far short of the pinnacle that is Kane. 2 centuries from now, Kane will be mentioned in the same breath as the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's Fifth. It is the very definition of the term 'Classic.' No other film has ever put together all of the bits and pieces that are needed to build a film in such perfect order as Kane. From Herrmann's score to the Welles/Mankiewicz script to Greg Toland's cinematography, this is an encyclopedia of film-making in one neat package. The number of people influenced by Kane since its release is incalculable, but evident in many films that have come opened after it. This film became Orson's curse. He never was able to duplicate it, and he was reviled/loved for not being able to do so. He is nonetheless one of the true geniuses of film history, ranking with Buster Keaton, Kubrick, Hitchcock and Kurosawa. It is to Hollywood's great shame that they never allowed Orson to get that close again. Their jealousy robbed us of who knows how many more films like Kane. THE TEN Greatest Films of all time: (In no particular order except #1)1] CITIZEN KANE 2] NORTH BY NORTHWEST 3] SEVEN SAMURAI 4] THE GENERAL- 1927 5] KING KONG 6] 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY 7] GONE WITH THE WIND 8] VERTIGO 9] SINGIN' IN THE RAIN 10] CASABLANCAAnyone who believes that Godfather I & II or Raging Bull are anywhere near the top ten needs to see more movies.",10,0,1,28 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Stupid Unbelievable Crap Kills Sequel
","Let me say this as a springboard for the rest of this review: I still don't buy the Annakin becomes Vader story. Lucas stated that these two persons were distinct individuals, not the same person, way back in the summer of 1977. Watch A New Hope and listen to Ben talk about Vader and Luke's Father and you'll hear it. Yoda also speaks of two different people in Empire. I choose to believe them. So what happened? Lucas changed his story after Empire to please the fans, and all the myth building went into the toilet. That brings us to the latest episode from Lucas. In 1977 and again in 1980, Lucas made two films that sucked me into their world and took me for an incredible ride. It was a ride I was glad to go on many times. Clones sucked also, but in a completely different way. I don't know whether it was the sucky dialogue, the bad acting or the lousy story that turned me off within five minutes. I was not involved at all in the film. I was so tempted to speak back at the screen a dozen times or more, but my wife kept pinching me just as those moments happened. I slipped once, when Annakin asked Sen. Armadillo, `Are you suffering like I am?' I screamed, `Yes, we are.' This brought cheers from the audience. The audience, by the way, sat in stunned silence as the suckieness unfolded. Everything was wrong with this film. Only Christopher Lee and Obi-Wan brought any class to this dreck. It just plain sucked, in more ways than I have room here to relate. Take away all the razzle dazzle creatures and effects and the costumes and the sets and nothing is left but an empty, boring shell with nothing to say. For instance, when Obi-wan just walks into the HQ of the cloning world, the clone masters take him and show him everything. They don't ask for any kind of ID or proof that he's whom they were waiting for. They just assume that he's a Jedi and he's here for an inspection tour. The old Lucas would have shown the audience how the character would have bluffed his way through, ala Han Solo. The new Lucas blows any opportunity to create suspense at all. Even the fight with Jimbo Billy Bob Fett at the complex didn't raise any kind of alarm among the cloners. I guess they just never look out their windows, nor do they turn their communications gear on to hear Jethro Fett tell them that this Jedi was a spy. Nope, they don't do any of that, and the clone shipment goes ahead without a hitch. Stupid writing, even stupider plotting, sink this sucky excuse for a film in ten minutes. It was not compelling in any way, despite the effects. In fact, as I watched, I kept thinking that the effects were being wasted worse than putting curtains on a camel. As impressive as Star Wars and Empire were in their time, Clones is repulsive. I think the audience agrees with me, as the last time I looked, Clones was sinking fast at the box-office. I've said enough. I'll go back now and watch Spiderman, a far superior film.",2,0,0,1 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," As memorable as a stubbed toe, but with less plot.
","SPOILER ALERT!- As if anyone cared. This 'film' is about as uninvolving a piece of junk as I've ever seen. The day before I saw this, I saw 'Robot Vs. The Aztec Mummy,' an old Mexican horror flick. That was a masterpiece compared to what I had to sweat through with 'Clones.' Mummy had characters I cared about, an hilarious, but fairly well crafted story, interesting music and it wasn't BORING. Clones lacked characters and story, and it bored the Hell out of everyone in the audience.SPOILERS/STUPID THINGS- When Obi-wan goes to the Clone planet, nobody asks for his ID. The security guy basically says- 'Are you the guy we've been waiting for?' Naturally Obi-wan says- 'Yes.' That's enough to get Ben through the door, where the idiots show him everything!!! What dolts. Annakin(NOT Luke's father, I don't care what Lucas says) acts like a 3 year old the entire film. He whines and carries on like he needs a bottle of formula. He goes out and slaughters an entire village and Miss Poopybutt feels sorry for him! They deserve each other.RATING: 4 out of 10. 2 for some decent music. 2 for the hilarious dialogue.",2,1,2,4 December 2003
Blue Crush," Like, wow, a girl surfing flick. Dudette!
","I was invited to see this for free and thought 'Hey, it's free. How bad could it be?' Well, about ten minutes into the flick, Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. This is a typical surfing flick, with girls in the leads. They are stuck in an early 1960's story and Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Where was I? Oh, yeah. I won't give anything away for those who might care, but the scenery of Maui is awesome. It's my favorite place in the world and then there are the girls. Hey, I'm human, they're also awesome. Three of them in particular go to zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Well, no sense going there. See it if you have nothing to do for two hours. At least it's better than Master of Disguise and not as pointless as Attack of the Clones. RATING: 5 out of 10. Marginal.",Null,0,0,17 August 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," What a mess
","How much I looked forward to this film I can't say. I read the book and found it to be not as good as Jurassic Park. (Nothing could have been as good as the Jurassic Park novel is.) I still think a terrific film could have been made. Unfortunately, nothing is terrific in this film except the dinosaurs. Everything else is lousy, including the direction. Spielberg has lost his edge as a director. No longer is he interested in making daring, logical films. This comes off as a live action PC game. No one thinks rationally. No one acts rationally. Characters exist solely to use some talent they possess later on (the daughter). 'Experts' in their field can't do a bloody thing out in the field. Things happen for no reason that it's 'Cool,' such as the crew of the Venture getting their hands bitten off by something on board (and it wasn't the T-Rex.) I could go on and on, but I'll let an expert get his two cents in. Please copy and go to this link:  http://www.jabootu.com/lostworldnugget.htmThis is an hilarious and accurate review that brought tears to my eyes as I read it. Something bothered me about this whole film, but after reading this, I come to realize that at least 85 things bothered me. Have a good read.",5,9,20,8 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Again, words cannot do justice to this trilogy.
",I was stunned as this film ended. My wife and daughter said that I hadn't moved a muscle from the edge of my chair the entire time. I was drawn into this world once again and found it amazing. It's as if a camera were placed into Middle Earth and filmed the saga as it unfolded. Mere words cannot do justice to what is being shown in the theaters. Just go see it and let it take you on perhaps the greatest journey ever brought to the screen. Bring on Return of the King. Rating: 10 out of 10.,8,0,0,27 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Down the toilet we go one last time...
","I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck. It finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas' career. He wants us to swallow the Annakin is Vader nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film vindicates those feelings. The story hasn't worked since Phantom Moron, and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade. I have to go. I know where some new rocks to throw are. You want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is NOT their Father. Duke Countoo should have switched sides while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been any good to anybody. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin didn't build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his Mom about putting him together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of Annie, but she had told do what George Lucas wrote for her. What a dope!",1,18,35,27 May 2005
Raging Bull," It was okay, but not a Keeper.
","I've seen this twice. The first time it didn't impress me at all. I hated all of the characters, and why watch a film if you are not pulling for at least 1 person? I saw this in a theater, with good sound and a big screen. This is the best viewing experience that can be had, and usually this sometimes makes the film better than it really is. The setting did not help. I was underwhelmed. It was well made, but that only takes you so far. Platoon and Titanic are well made, but are Garbage. I need more than fancy cinematography and good acting. I need a good story and something to hang my interest in. I found nothing here of interest. I waited 4 years before sitting down to watch this again. This time it was on a big screen TV on VHS, with a good sound system and comfy chairs. I was even less impressed this time. DeNiro was still a jerk. The other characters were no better. It was very well crafted, but hollow inside. This second viewing was an ordeal. Not quite torture, but very difficult to sit through. I would not watch it again.On my scale, with 10 being the Ultimate in Cinema, I would give Raging Bull a 5. It's merely Above Average, and that's being very kind to it. The rating is for the excellent creation of the period and for the black and white cinematography. There's nothing else to see here.",5,4,14,19 January 2009
Signs," If Hitchcock had directed Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind
","Newsweek called Shyamalan the next Spielberg. I'll go them one better. He's the next Alfred Hitchcock, a much better fit and a much better director to be compared with. Shyamalan doesn't seem to be the type who would hide a script so that only he could get his hands on it (as with Jaws). Nor would he lie about characters in his film (the origin of Indy's name). Nor would he blame others for the failure of one of his films (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Hook, Goonies). Spielberg has done all of these things, and has lost any credibility he ever had, along with his story telling ability. No, Shyamalan will be more like Hitchcock, someone who knows how to weave an excellent tale without smarminess, pretentiousness or pointless screenplays. This is what CE3K should have been, rich in details that mean something. While Encounters was all pretty pictures and hollow characters, every scene in Signs added a layer to the climax, with people we could know. I won't spoil this wonderful film with any details. It covered a lot of different subjects while scaring me into silence during the last half. Like the best of Hitchcock's films, it will leave you a bit disturbed as you walk out of the theater. Very well done. RATING: 7 out of 10 on first look. Probably higher next time.",7,0,1,11 August 2002
Jurassic Park," One of the best of the 90's. (Faint praise)
","When I first read the book in '89, I was stunned. I read it four more times in a month. I heard that spielberg was going to make the film version and I thought: Will this be the spielberg of 'Raiders' or the spielberg of 'Hook'? We got a bit of both, I'm afraid. Half of the book was chucked, with new stuff slapped in. I felt the heart of the book was gone, replaced by scenes for people with short attention spans. What was left of the book was fabulous, I'll admit. This is heads above the sequel, which was like a filmed video game. 'Run this way!' 'Run back!' The less said about it the better. I'll do a seperate review on it. The best films of the '90's were: Toy Story, Braveheart, Jurassic Park, Michael Collins, Iron Giant & Beauty and the Beast. The rest were a pretty sorry lot, indicative of the sad trend that films have been following since the inception of the MPAA ratings. That's another story. It could have been better. It could have been like the book. Rating: 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,19 October 2000
