Skyfall," A bad remake of earlier Bond movies that fails miserably
","This move features a flash back to the past. In fact most of the movie is a flashback. The first quarter of the movie reminded me a lot of Tomorrow Never Dies. Just swap a mad news mogul with a mad computer genius. Terror! Terror! Terror! After that the move travels farther back into the earlier Bond movies, where Bond fought against an unknown enemy - SPECTRE. Lots of disposable henchmen and cheesy lines. The villain is some sort of a resurrection of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (SPECTRE #1). I am just surprised the new villain didn't own a cat. This super villain is supposed to be super scary, more scary than anyone else in the world! Except this is according to the bond girl who's been terrorized by him since she was 12. As it turns during the movie, he really fails to live up to that standard. In fact, compared to the other Bond villains, he is bellow average. The scariest thing he does is smile in a creepy way, not very scary if you ask me. And speaking of the Bond girl. We see her for a few minutes here, a few minutes there and then she is gone out of the picture. I have trouble even calling her a Bond girl. Really, this is the first Bond movie with no Bond girl. Way to go and experiment! There are about 10000 polls on the internet that try to ascertain who the sexiest Bond girl is. Meanwhile, the movie producers and writers decided to create a Bond movie without a Bond girl.Oh well. I guess it could have been worse, I didn't actually get up and leave the theater, so that's a little something.",3,8,18,25 December 2012
500 Days of Summer," Super boring, couldn't stand watching it.
",The movie is super boring. I got this movie because Zooey Deschanel in a romantic comedy can't possibly go wrong... WRONG! Turns out it can go wrong... Very wrong... Have I mentioned wrong? There is a very annoying and boring voice narrating events that sets the tone for the movie. Rare laughs are drowned in long periods of melancholy and depressing love longing. In the end I couldn't take more than 20 minutes of this movie. As a last resort I tried to skip ahead in hopes that it will pick up. All I got was 2 more minutes of lame dialog. I've watched some bad movies before. I've watched some boring movies before. It's really rare that I can't finish watching a movie.,2,2,5,24 July 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Might be the worst monster movie of alltime.
","This maybe the worst monster movie of all time.
Wait... is Sharknado a monster movie?
Well, it doesn't really matter, cause this is probably worse than Sharknado.The story is absolutely ridiculous. It started of ok, somewhat plausible but as the movie went on, it quickly deteriorated into more and more absurd.There is a female lead, a photographer. She is clearly there to be the female heroine and save save the day. But there is absolutely no thought as to how she should do it. This makes her role, her lines stupid to the extreme.
Three people walk onto a wild island and see a giant monkey.
The military guy says 'lets kill it'.
The scientist guy says 'lets study it'.
The female photographer heroine says 'this is crazy, stop'.
Somehow, everyone listens to the photographer who has no survival skills, no military skills and no scientific knowledge. She didn't even say anything, didn't even give any instruction on what to do but everybody stops arguing, after all 'it's crazy'.
Now, since the argument is over and she didn't propose any farther topics of discussion, what does the movie do? Well, why not just cut to the next scene with a shot of the giant monkey.Oh yeah, lets not forget that Kong is indestructible. It can not be killed by bullets, nor explosives, nor burn in fire. Even it's fur doesn't burn in fire, much less skin.Listen, and understand! That Kong is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until this movie is awful!",1,1,3,24 December 2017
Lucy," Lucy is really a comic book hero movie with mediocre action.
","First of, this move has ZERO scientific basis. There are so many things scientifically wrong with the story that it's practically anti-science. Here are some of the obvious wrongs: Apparently 'unlocking' parts of the brain that we consider dormant can give us ability to fly, control time and move like the Flash. Lucy gets control of the electro-magnetic waves, she can therefore appear on a TV screen or a phone and chat. Even if she did have an ability to emit electro-magnetic signals, the TV picture is actually digitally encoded and it's more than just 'waves'. It means her brain would actually have to encode a picture of herself pixel by pixel, then convert this bit stream into an electronic signal that would be understood by the TV according to the encoding transmission that is specific to that region and then she'd have to do the next frame and the next, at about 30 frames per second. OK, I guess if she really had super intelligence it may be possible. But I tend to think anyone with super intelligence wouldn't waste time encoding 5 minutes * 30 frames/second * 921600 pixels (HD resolution) = 8,294,400,000 total pixels. Yep, for a 5 minute conversation Lucy would encode over 8 billion pixels. I'd think even a person of regular intelligence would realize she just needs to pick up the phone or computer and just let the computer do it. Oh and by the way, she is transmitting her TV signal from Taiwan to a TV in the US. One would think distance still matters. At the end of the movie Lucy develops a super computer that produces a USB stick and dissolves. With all the super intelligence, the best she can do is a USB stick... WTF?!? Lucy is now 'everywhere' or is it nowhere? Cliché. Also Lucy has some strange religious undertones. Basically, she is a human that becomes god. So, it's both anti-science and anti-religion as well. Since, pretty much every religion would consider such a thing blasphemy.Secondly, This movie is actually more of a comic book hero fantasy genre. A woman (Lucy) gets accidentally injected with experimental drugs which causes here to rapidly develop super hero powers. OK, now the story seems more plausible. Not in the sense that it may actually happen but at least my brain can stop searching for an explanation and just accept that blue powder gives humans super strength, speed, intelligence, time control, ability to fly, etc... Unfortunately, for a super hero movie the action is kinda lame and attempts to inject pseudo-science to try and explain what's going on make it worse and worse.Thirdly, here are some notable quotes: 'One plus one equals two. That's all we've learned, but one plus one has never equaled two. ... We've created a scale so that we can forget its unfathomable scale. ' Sorry Lucy and writers, directors. 1+1 has always equaled 2 and always will. A time may come when we start thinking of ones differently, perhaps multi-dimensionally but it will still be equal to a multi-dimension 2.'I am everywhere.' Can it get more cliché than that? And by the way if she is everywhere, why is she bothering to type in a cell phone? Can't she just speak out loud? Better yet, can't she just think it to their brains?'Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist.' That is actually kinda scientific. Although is it time that defines matter or matter that defines time or do both of them mutually define each other?'I don't feel pain, fear, desire. It's like all things that make us human are fading away. It's like the less human I feel, all this knowledge about everything, quantum physics, applied mathematics, the infinite capacity of a cell's nucleus. They're all exploding inside my brain, all this knowledge.' The informational capacity of the cell is big in a sense that it contains the entire human DNA, immensely complex. But the capacity of a cell to contain abstract data is actually relatively low. Let say of argument sake, that we did 'unlock' the cell's 'capacity', we'd find out things like human DNA, human origins, etc... It would tell us zero about things like earthquakes, radios, or black holes.'we must break through to the nucleus' That sounds so funny! I just was laughing and laughing! Still smile whenever I remember it.I think I've broken to the nucleus of this movie. What's inside the nucleus? - Waste of time.",3,0,4,30 April 2015
V for Vendetta," Glorified terrorism
","The movie presents a version of evens that feature: Government conspiracy to subjugate it's people into complete submission and establish a dictatorship. Followed by prosecution of the people that is reminiscent of the church burnings during dark ages. Of course mixed in are secret genetic experiments. And finally we have a lunatic anarchist who was a subject to the genetic experiments and turned super human, turned terrorist bent on annihilating the institution of order. How glorious is his cause of blowing up the London parliament. According to this movie, we should all be worshiping Osama Bin Laden as the best thing that ever happened to the free world.I am giving this 2 of 10 because of the movie completely bent on scaring people into revolting against 'the man'. It would be 1 of 10 but the play acting is actually somewhat good. So, I've added 1 star for the actors doing their job at least.",2,5,14,23 February 2012
