The Incredible Hulk," Better as the first one. I was really surprised.
",I entered the cinema without great expectations. I have to say it's really better as the first one.I am not a great fan of Hulk (the comic etc.) but i think this move is more like the TV series and not so over'comiced' like the first one.--------------------- CONTAIN S P O I L E R S-------------------------OK it has some shadows (turning off a kerosene fire with clapping into the hands LOOOOL i've laughed so loud at this moment) and as he stand in a fire with his girlfriend in his arms...sorry but there are more than 30Â° Celsius its not a tanning bed Jesus!!!No scratch nothing...OK to argument with realism in a comic based movie is not really necessary but some things are to funny and nothing i can blind out. whatever....Best part of the movie (that comes first into my mind) was the 'Pants buying' scene. At last a man who think of it that he need Pants with bungee!! (2 points for this masterpiece) Always wearing a Jeans....Maaaaan you know if you change into Hulk normal pants are to small for you! ^^ For a boring evening this movie was good enough to watch it.,7,4,6,27 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Surprise surprise
","Yeah what a luck, my friends and I went to an OV sneak and awaiting a boring love 'sucks' film like Romeo and Julia or something similar.So we were 2 minutes to late.First surprise : UIIII an action movie bank robbery 'n'stuff, no 'love boat'.Second surprise : Hey its kinda stupid and brutal enough to entertain me for this evening.third and last surprise : why did the bank robber face looks like..... JOKER o0 ?!?!?!?!Wonderful 5 Euros paid for a movie i booked(and paid) cards weeks ago for 8,50 euro.I saved 3,50 Euros WOOOHAAAA!!... wait a minute???? Aaaah who cares enjoy the movie!OK what could i say to it?Its really good. For me its the best movie i saw this Year and its more as i expected. After the great first try with Batman begins i wonder if they can top this.I like Ledger and how he act as Joker. Bad, psycho and funny! Alone for this, the movie was not worse the money. And i like how he gets his scars, not because of a crappy acid bath or something similar. Thats the kind of realism why i like the new batman movies more as the old ones (except one and two).Even that Batman try to mask his real voice is something i find really good. OK it won't help much in real world but alone the idea behind it is good. And its funny i must always laugh when Batman is speaking.Dark parts of the movie : This sonar UBER thing...sorry but....a way to UBER. and this crappy Motorbike and the wall scene....no sorry a NO GO. My greatest misgiving was, that they try to overload it with Batman 'Toys'. Batman Bike, Batman Spaceshuttle, Batman self destruction super mini atom 'only in a 50 meter radius' bomb or things like that but they didn't thanks god.But down to this two things it was a great movie for fans and freaks a must, for semi fans like me a nice enjoyable movie.P.S.: Don't cheat yourself with the German translated version!! Watch it FIRST as original at an OV Cinema near you. Ledger and his original voice as Joker is great. This mood(feeling) cannot be translated.",9,3,13,12 August 2008
War of the Worlds," 5 points for the special effects
",I hate this foolish girl every time she is screaming and not ever usable for anything. If i was the father i have sold the child for some cents or drown them into water. Jesus she is always screaming if you see her on the screen.and then the SonI hate his son of a what ever. I dislike them all. He is so dump at all.....UAH the whole movie i wanted to press a hole into my head with my finger to kill myself. YEAH thats funnier as this crap of ....OK the special effects are fine but thats all! The original is much better.Fine,5,0,0,28 July 2008
