The Incredible Hulk," Really?
","God damnit. I wanted to like this film so much! Sadly i didn't.. Here's a plot of the movie in a nutshell:
A guy turns into a monster and kills a lot of people. He runs away. People find him. He runs away. People find him again. He runs away again. A fight happens. The end. This film was two hours long but it didn't even felt like it... WAS. This film is so.. little. It gives you nothing. I didn't even understand what was going on the entire time. I regret not skipping this movie.",5,0,0,26 July 2019
Iron Man 2," Underrated, solid movie.
","Iron man 2 is a great sequel to iron man. It has once again, simple plot but great characters. War machine was a great edition and i still don't understand why didn't he became an avenger instead of Hawkeye. The main Villan, whiplash has a simple but understandable motivation. We also got to see more of nick fury, wcich is fantastic. Black widow was a nice character too. The main problem with this movie is waaaaay too many sub-plots and honestly..some of the jokes. Preety much every marvel movie is hilarious but this one just.. isn't. Over- all tho, it's a great second part to iron man.",8,1,1,27 July 2019
Iron Man," A great begging.
","Iron man is a great movie. It's a start to the Marvel cinematic universe and it's a good one! The plot is simple but good. The characters are the best part of this movie. The main character tony stark is extremely likeable and has great character development. Yinsen although has little screen time has an amazing death scene. Pepper Potts is also very likable, underrated character. The main Villan- iron monger is fine. He's not amazing, but he's ok. Although the finale is great, my favourite scene is when tony builds his final iron man suit and kills some terrorists. Defenatly a good film.",7,0,0,26 July 2019
