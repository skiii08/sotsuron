Skyfall," The Best of Bond!
","'Skyfall' is unlike any James Bond movie you've seen before. While the film pays homage to the previous installments, first-time Bond director Sam Mendes reinvents the superspy's story, taking him into far darker territory. The result? Arguably the most well-crafted and thrilling film in the franchise's 50 years.This time around, Bond -- who has been publicly pronounced dead but remains in hiding after a botched mission -- is brought back to 'life' to recover a hard drive from a cyber terrorist named Silva (Javier Bardem). While his mission seems simple, loyalties are questioned between Bond (Daniel Craig) and his superior M (Dame Judi Dench), for she might be responsible for the previous near-fatal mission. And while M is hiding secrets of her own, she's also the target of Silva, who will stop at nothing to bring her and MI6 to their demise.When 'Casino Royale' was released, Craig immediately jumped to top of everyone's favorite Bond actor list for his grounded, man's man portrayal. He's got the chops with his physicality, sexual machismo, and cool demeanor. So what's left to develop? 'Skyfall' presents Bond as an aging and wounded soldier, who doesn't blame the organization for his pain but rather accepts it as part of the job. Revealed to be an orphan, Bond seemingly continues to function as if MI6 is his family and M as his mother.Dench paves the way as the true Bond girl of the film. Strong-willed and determined to get the job done, M's quip-filled scenes with Bond explore their professional yet symbiotic relationship that's based on trust and mutual respect. For Bond, it's not about his service to her Majesty, but rather filling the void in his otherwise empty soul. For M, she may come across as cold and manipulative, but like Bond knows the stakes of the game they are playing.It's hard to discuss 'Skyfall' without mention of its memorable villain, Silva. After delivering a chilling, award-winning turn in 'No Country for Old Men,' Bardem gives another standout performance as the bleached blonde, impeccably dressed terrorist. Like every Bond villain, quirky mannerisms and odd physical traits are present. He's playful at times and whimsically sadistic at others. Like the rest of the film, Silva's motivation feels more believable than previous villains as he simply wants revenge on those who wronged him rather than being hell bent on world destruction.The man responsible for delivering us such a thrilling entry to the series is none other than Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty). I was shocked to see that his new approach to the material isn't necessarily out with the old and in with the new. Mendes gives plenty of winks and nods to all the Bond classics: the cars, the girls, the gadgets, the exotic locations, the dry one-liners and the occasional over-the-top stunts are all present. He even resurrects the old but familiar character of Q (Ben Whishaw), to provide some comedic relief and self deprecating humor to the series.But what Mendes does differently is that he presents the story as if it were actually a real world scenario. The atmosphere is dark, the drama is amped up and the characters feel real. The icing on the cake is cinematography. The action sequences are crisp and coherent and will literally have you jumping out of your chair. And whether it's the neon skylines of Shanghai or the grey skies of London, the shadowy landscapes set the stage for a bleak espionage-filled world. And also worth noting is the obligatory opening credit sequence that visually arresting and equally haunting with Adele providing vocals.Mendes' approach to Bond will be undoubtedly compared to Christopher Nolan's Batman redux, both humanizing established material and presenting it in a sleek and stylish way. It's just a shame for future entries because the bar has just been raised high. Not only is this new Bond entry the most thrilling and emotional to date, but it is responsible for bringing new energy and excitement into a franchise that doesn't seem to quit ... just like the central character.",10,19,40,9 November 2012
Lincoln," Lincoln is a Revealing, Captivating Look at U.S. History
","Just give them the damn Oscars already! That was my reaction when word first went around that Steven Spielberg was making an Abraham Lincoln biopic, with Daniel Day-Lewis playing the ill-fated 16th president. With a top-notch cast, 'Lincoln' lives up to expectations and delivers a revealing look at arguably the most important figure in American History.If you're expecting to see large-scale, graphic depictions of Civil War battles, you may be disappointed. The film is loosely based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln.' It covers Lincoln's final months as he juggles the seemingly impossible task of passing the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery and trying to end the Civil War.Though nicknamed 'Honest Abe,' the film portrays Lincoln less as a saint and more as a tactful politician. With 20 Democratic votes needed to pass the 13th Amendment, Lincoln enlists the help of Republican radical Thaddeus Steven (Tommy Lee Jones) and W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), whose back-door politicking and shady deals are necessary to help sway the votes of the opposition and change the course of history forever.Irishman Day-Lewis immerses himself into the role of an American icon. Sure, he's got the towering gaunt looks, but this isn't your gruff-voiced and stoic Lincoln in prior portrayals. Day-Lewis' high tenor vocal projection (often noted by historians) commands your attention during his (obligatory) philosophical and expertly worded stories and speeches. His steely gazes and moments of silence illustrate the melancholia and vulnerability of a rational man deep in struggle to find peace in an irrational, divided country.The supporting cast (Spader, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Michael Stuhlbarg) is equally captivating. The standout performances belong to Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Jones' energetic portrayal of Republican radical and Lincoln ally Thaddeus Stevens is one of his best roles. On the exterior he is a wig-covered, rickety old man, but once he opens his mouth do we see a powerful, passionate, and often hilarious freedom fighter who's as wily as he is cunning in the courtroom. Sally Field delivers a maddening performance as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Clad in lavish costumes, Field depicts the complexities of Lincoln's home life as she copes with the loss of a son and neglect of a husband trying to restore a nation.As a lifelong Spielberg fan, I'm once again impressed by the direction he took with the film. Spielberg and his longtime collaborator/cinematographer Janusz Kaminski downplays large CGI settings and go for detailed on-locations that seamlessly transport the audience to that time in history. The filmmakers also downplay the depiction of the war on the battlefield (which we have seen countless times) and lean toward the verbal skirmishes in the House of the Representatives. In some ways, one could argue that 'Lincoln' is like Aaron Sorkin's 'The West Wing' by way of 'Amistad,' as the fiery quip-filled debates and desperate solutions are taken from the pages of history and presented intimately behind the doors of the dimly candlelit places of power.The film's Achilles heel is the running time. While there is little action or brief depictions of violence, it's Tony Kushner's witty screenplay that keeps viewers from looking at their watches and stirring in their seats. With the help and execution of the stellar cast, the movie never feels dull as some of the long dialogue sequences ooze with a sense of theatricality that makes every line feel as much as alive as it is thrilling.Lincoln needs to be seen by all not just for the outstanding performances and craftsmanship, but as a reminder of sacrifice and great lengths taken by one man to repair a shattered nation and forever alter the course of history for the greater good. Having said that Â…give it a damn Oscar already!",9,16,37,9 November 2012
Flight," Welcome back Zemeckis!
","It's been ten years since Robert Zemeckis made a live-action film, and it's good to have him back! Along with a brilliant performance from Denzel Washington, 'Flight' is a departure from the director's sugarcoated sentimentality in films like 'Forrest Gump,' and is an arresting morality tale that explores faith in the darkest corners of the human soul.Denzel's character Whip Whitaker is an alcoholic airline pilot who miraculously saves a doomed airplane from crashing. While initially hailed as a hero, there's more to be revealed as Whip's personal demons may or may not be responsible for the catastrophe.Zemeckis goes for a polished yet subdued approach and places the weight of the film on Washington -- who proves why he's one the greatest living actors today. His nuanced performance channels the intensity of Sidney Poitier and the haunting madness of Nic Cage in 'Leaving Las Vegas.' He's very much an anti-hero, and his choices generate the suspense that leaves the audience guessing.What 'Jaws' did for the water is what 'Flight' will do for flying -- and while the crash is a horrifying visual spectacle in itself, the two-punch combo of Washington's performance and Zemeckis' balanced direction keeps this film exciting, awe-inspiring, and a sure thing for awards season.",9,2,5,2 November 2012
