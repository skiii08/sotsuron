Howl's Moving Castle," Totally Engrossing: If you liked Sprited Away, you'll love this!
","I drove for three hours to reach a theater that was playing this film, and it was worth it! The English cast was amazing, and I normally shun all dubbed films. It really seemed like they were the original voices. I never once wished I could hear the Japanese like I usually do, even on Spirited Away. Now that is settled!This film deals mostly with the character of Sophie. I won't sum up the plot, you've seen that already. The heart of the film is at Sophie accepting herself, and accepting the affection of other people. That's pretty much the moral. The most winning character by far is Howl himself, at least for a girl like me. He is a really complex character, beautiful drawn, and voiced with precision by Christian Bale. He sounds really similar to his Batman voice in this, so get ready for that. Billy Crystal's Calcifer is refreshingly muted. I had worried about him being too flamboyant, but he is really a charming character. The entire cast of characters are so real, as is the world they inhabit, that it just draws you in. I smiled through the first half of the movie! I saw the film with friends in their mid-twenties, one of which is not into anime, and we all enjoyed it. Many of the folks at the theatre brought children, but it seemed like the adults enjoyed it far more than the children. It is probably too dark for kids under 8, in my opinion. There is a lot of bombing in the second half, and it can be startling. I all this is a really good film. The plot gets a little complicated in the second half, where it starts to greatly deviate from the book and become more Miyazaki, but there is plenty of action, comedy, romance, and fun to please every age group. I plan on taking my grandma to see it; I think older people would really get a kick out of 'Grandma Sophie.' Best Animated Film of the year, for sure!",9,5,7,21 June 2005
Sleepy Hollow," While not the scare you expect, it pleases in a childish way.(Might spoil a bit)
","If you are a Burton buff, don't see this movie! It is,in my opinion, totally out of character for him. If you are looking for a pee your pants freak out film, don't see this movie! It didn't scare me in the least. If you are looking for depth and soul-searching, or tormented and deep characters, don't see this movie! Not quite as campy as Clue, this movie delighted that part of me who hates a complicated movie. It is a bit of a who-dun-it mystery, one that if you pay close attention to you can figure out, but you really have to watch, in the way of Mission Impossible. The characters are admittedly two diminsional and the humor admittedly juvenile.  What makes it acceptable is that, with the exception of that misleading trailer we saw tagged to Blair Witch, the film doesn't take itself seriously. It has a cute little beginning, with jokes that made me roll my eyes, and a cute little end (is that a spoiler? I don't think so..), with blood and fainting jokes splattered(no pun intended!) through the middle. Johnny Depp's accent isn't that great; you can't tell if Christina Ricci is even supposed to have one (why would she?) or not.  All in all, I loved it.  I want to take my family back to see it. Not for the small though, bloooooddy. Hey, they knew it wasn't going to win an Oscar when they made it, so why expect it to be that kind of movie. If you want a trip to fantasy world, this is your show. Wasn't that why we started making movies in the first place?",9,0,0,23 December 1999
