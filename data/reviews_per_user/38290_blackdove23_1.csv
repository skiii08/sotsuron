The Blair Witch Project," The worst movie of ALL time!!!!
","I absolutely HATED this film, it was grossly overated and a complete disappointment. Scary?  You have to be kidding, NOTHING in this movie was scary in the least, and I was actually pleased when the characters met their fate, at least the movie was finally over!  I can not even image why anyone with a mind could consider this a 'good' movie let alone a masterpiece of some kind, it was completely pointless and a waste of my time.After I watched the film I just assumed that everyone considered this movie an absolute joke and a complete rip off but much to my chagrin this movie became adored by millions.  I was totally flabber-gasted and sickened when I heard others  say that they consider this film as one of the best of all time.  How can this be? But of course I just try to consider the source and realize that they wouldn't know a 'good' movie if it slapped them in the face. I hope that I never have to see this film again & hope that the Blair Witch Project can be buried now after it's sequel. A pile of rocks scary?  A bundle of twigs terrifying?  Yeah, maybe if your twelve!",1,10,18,12 July 2001
