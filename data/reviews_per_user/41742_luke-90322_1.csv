Blade Runner 2049," A technically well done film within a bit of a mess
","I really enjoyed this film and I thought it was a well done and well produced film. But, the film was a bit of a mess. Let's talk about the bad first shall we. I felt as if there was a lot in this movie that shouldn't be there, for example, the scene where he got attacked in San Diego. This scene felt unnecessary and out of place where instead we could of had more time developing the villain or the underground replicant army (I don't think they were actually given a name). Secondly there was not enough action. I went in expecting to see some decent action but I left feeling a little short changed. For a slow movie you need to support that slow pace with some decent action scenes. Okay now for the good stuff. This movie look AMAZING. Gosh damm this movie looks incredible because it captured that cyberpunk essence perfectly with these dashes of colour in a world that is mostly black and grey. Also the sound design was really good. I could hear footsteps when people walked and it sounded are you ready ... GOOD. Also every time there was a machine or a gun it sounded awesome. Blade Runner 2049 dealt with complicated issues like if you have a soul and racism and I love how in detail it went into with that. Good job.",8,3,12,6 October 2017
