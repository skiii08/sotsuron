The Ring," Very clever horror flick
","I haven't seen the original film 'Ringu' from which this movie was based but I would have to say that Hollywood did an OK job on this film.  The plot is not Hollywood's, thank heavens, because in recent years any horror movie with any plot coming out of Hollywood seems to need to conform to the Scooby Doo format.  By that I mean by the end every little mystery has been explained in full detail.... unfortunately at the expense of the real ingredients, fear, suspense, etc, etc.The idea of this film is very clever, if you didn't know anything about it then you would be surprised at what is going on and you would not be able to predict the ending even if you were convinced you had it right, you'd be wrong.  Having read reviews to other Japanese horror movies it seems that many of them have intelligent and curious causes to the supernatural phenomenon as well.  An influx of American remakes may follow The Ring.To give some sort of review I would have to say that it is for the most part one of the very best horror movies of the last 5 years.  There is a deep and disturbing atmosphere, although I will see Ringu next and compare to see if it comes close.  There is an excellent score of music to set the mood and tone of what the director wants you to feel during the scenes and the sound effects are used well to develop the tension.  The storyline itself is by far the movie's strongest point and compares with any horror I can think of.In short I would definately say watch this movie if you like supernatural horrors, or maybe you should see the original 'Ringu' first though??",7,0,0,12 February 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Very decent remake
","I understand that the UK version has been cut because apparently we have to get a worse deal than other countries. I'm sure that's not it but I was disappointed to find out that there were scenes cut from the version I saw because what I did see I thought was very good.The things that made the original so brilliant were not touched on at great length in this movie but this version is more about action. Good action scenes they were too, well paced, well acted and the tension was well developed by the direction. The zombies were scarier than in the original, they looked scarier and posed a bigger threat than the zombies in the original movie, which were slow moving and easier to escape from. I was pleased they didn't over gore the film as was the case in Day of the Dead.All in all a very good horror film that doesn't require too much thought. Just sit back and enjoy the scares.",8,0,0,4 April 2005
The Others," One of the greatest horror films ever made.
","I cannot even come close to describing how good this film is.  It has everything and is genuinely one of the most atmospheric and chilling horror films ever made.  It doesn't have all the Hollywood gloss and special effects, instead it has first rate acting, from all the characters, first rate direction. Most importantly of all it lets you use your own imagination to fill out what you can't see. The plot also is important to this film and is much cleverer than you expect it to be.  You have to watch it carefully and to the very end to fully find out what has been going on.This is a truly gripping and scary film and unless you are Mr Spock you will have goose bumps at times and will jump out of your skin at other times. What you must do to really appreciate it is to watch it from start to finish without being distracted.  During the film you will get totally absorbed into the story and to have to finish the ironing for the last half hour of the movie simply won't do.If you like horror films you must see this movie. 10/10",10,0,0,24 April 2002
Elf," Wonderful Christmas movie!
","There are some Christmas songs that are just right and will be on every Christmas compilation album for 30 years. They'll be played on the radio every year for 30 years and people will listen to them/sing to them/dance to them at their work Christmas parties for 30 years. Well this is that but in a movie. The ingredients are right and like Home Alone, A Miracle on 34th Street and The Santa Clause it will be a long running favourite Christmas movie in my house for......probably 30 years. Why is everything 30 years? I don't know it's just an approximate number.The story follows Buddy the elf who after discovering he's actually a human but was adopted by elves travels to New York to find his real father. He fits in New York like a Terminator would fit in at a tea party, which makes for a lot of the laughs. Of course eventually the film moves on to being heartwarming, touching and even a little exciting. There's even a chance for Buddy to save Christmas before the movie is finished.This is another film where the acting is good allround and as I said earlier it has the right ingredients to make you feel good at Christmas time. Kids will love this film and most adults will enjoy it too.Definitely needs to be in your Christams movies collection.",8,2,5,26 December 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The funniest film in recent years
","Quite definitely this is the funniest film I have seen in a long time. There were small parts of The Anchoman and Kicking and Screaming that made me laugh out loud but this movie has by far the most laugh out loud moments of any film I can remember since first seeing The Life of Brian.This is a well scripted film which is then developed further by a great cast who deliver the script perfectly. Add to that a few quirky bits, like the musical ending and you have a film you will remember when all the other 'comedy(s) of the year' have long been forgotten.You get the impression that the cast really enjoyed being in this movie and wanted it to be as good as it could be. It certainly proves Hollywood can make a good film still.I would say this is definitely not the film to put on when the village vicar is coming round for scones and tea and is rightly a 15 certificate in the UK. It's adult themed of course and there is some brief nudity but the film doesn't rely upon a little titillation to keep the attention of the viewer.At the time I made this report IMDb had this film scored at 7.7 out of 10, not many films get that sort of score. I think this speaks for itself and is as good a reason as any to rent this.Enjoy!",10,2,4,3 May 2006
The Incredibles," Very enjoyable family film
","This was a good film for all the family. Once again Pixar and those people at Disney have put in enough humour for the grown ups along with all of the good clean wholesome fun that you want your kids to see. There were no moaning kids during this film, even though the popcorn had run out well before the trailers started. It's quite long, 2 hours, which is long for younger children but they sat still throughout the entire film. In fact the kids were so impressed my older two took themselves off to the cinema with their pocket money to see it 3 days later. I wonder, did other adults notice how they'd modelled the older daughter on Sadako from Ringu? It was just something some adults might spot and would have one over on the kids when it came to one film fact.The story follows the lives of two superheroes who after getting married are forced to settle down in the wake of public opinion no longer wanting superheroes. The kids they have, also become super-powered and soon enough the world needs superheroes again. The film is great fun with good effects, a fun soundtrack and likable characters. There are plenty of laughs and kids will be comparing who is the most powerful or has the best powers after it's over.I'd have to rate this up there with or possibly above similar types of films such as Shrek and Toy Story. I'd say it was a better film than Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.Definitely a good movie to see.",8,1,3,26 December 2004
Event Horizon," Atmospheric, disturbing, chilling......
",This is a truly original film and an excellent one at that.  A dark and disturbing piece of film where you are afraid of more than mere death. You are made to be frightened of the engine room in particular and you get that 'don't go in there' feel as the characters are bit by bit tormented by unseen forces and eventually disposed of. Excellent camera work and direction adds to the eerie and dark nature of the film and the acting is good. For those that like films with evil forces taking the very souls of people in quite gory ways this is a must see.,10,0,2,3 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Like Windows 8, Star Wars 8 was a complete mess. Only they have to make another movie based on 8.
","I've read a lot of reviews and pretty much everyone has said it all. For me this is one of the biggest mistakes ever in film. Badly written, massive inconsistencies, plot holes, terrible character and story development and badly.........everything.I watched a number of YouTube videos by fans who were predicting the story for 8 and even put some artwork together to represent some of the key scenes. Every single fan idea was better than the movie. Everything I guessed would happen myself, was a better idea than what actually happened in 8.They (Disney) need to recognise they've got to make a 9th film based on what happened in this one. I don't think it can be done, even with the best story line in the history of film and TV.I actually think they'd be better off scrapping this movie and remaking it with a different plot, different story, different scenes, different outcomes and different.......everything. They could draw in some of the loose ends from 7 and have a great project in 9 to look forward to.As things stand I think fans will simply not bother seeing 9.Not sure how this film scored 7.3 out of 10 at the time I wrote my review.As I was finishing my review my 19 year old son asked me 'are you really giving it two stars?'. I think that sums it up. He thinks I am being too generous.",2,9,11,13 May 2018
8 Mile," Modern day Saturday Night Fever......kind of
","I'd heard good things about this movie and then eventually I saw Scary Movie 3(what was I thinking renting that?), in which there is a brief parody of 8 Mile. It intrigued me enough to rent this. I certainly enjoyed this movie, which was good on many levels.The story is set in the mid 90s in the poorer districts of Detroit. It follows a white rapper trying to succeed in an almost completely black music style. The similarities between Saturday Night Fever and 8 Mile represent themselves in the main character's families, their work, their friends and in their one real talent. In the case of Saturday Night Fever it was dancing, in this movie it's rap music.This was a good movie to watch and the performances from all the main characters were excellent. It's difficult for me to relate to the environment in which the movie was set and the prejudices a 'white trailer trash' rapper would face, not having experienced anything like it. But the movie did a good job of making me feel a part of it all.",7,0,1,19 February 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," There's no 11 out of 10 score.
","Wonderful and charming classic movie that makes you feel good to the very end.The story is based a great deal on A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, only in this case it's a guardian angel and not 3 ghosts and it's a good man he comes to visit. The guardian angel shows our hero George Bailey how life would have been without him. When George realises how much he has and how much he's done for others and on Christmas Eve no less, he understands what's really important again. It's inspiring to see George swimming most of his life against the current but always in the pursuit of doing what's right. His selflessness and understanding of others is something in modern society we don't seem to even aspire to emulate any more.If you haven't seen this film you will find scenes you've come across in other movies and never knew where they came from. The film contains so many memorable scenes and wonderful moments that I really can't do it justice. You simply have to see it for yourself.Make sure you have a full 2.5 hours free to watch it because it's a long movie. In fact leave 5 hours free so you can watch it again straight after.",10,0,4,4 April 2005
A Night at the Roxbury," Catchy and Fun
","This is a film that is better than you expect it to be.  It's sort of Last Days of Disco meets Wayne's World.  It is based on an idea that came from Saturday Night Live about three guys who are trying to get into discos/parties and are so uncool.  They all bob their heads to the music in a funny fashion and try to pick up women, which of course they are useless at but think they are excellent at.  The third person from this original skit was Jim Carrey.  For whatever reason Jim Carrey was not in this movie but the other two are and despite Carrey's absence the comedy has his distinct style in many ways, particularly with visual comedy.The music, if you like European 90s disco/house is very good and the support actors are excellent.  There are more than a couple of people from the original Clueless film if you can spot them all.To give you a basic plot, which in this type of movie isn't really important anyway, you have two sons of a rich LA shop owner.  They live for parties and think they are well into the scene but their dad thinks they are a waste of space.  They try to get into a club called the Roxbury which is more exclusive and through a series of events, mistaken identities and so on move into the partying fast-lane.  There are some ups and downs for our two guys though but in true tradition there is a happy ending.If you liked Wayne's World and Dumb and Dumber there is enough similar humour for you.  It's worth seeing in my opinion, I gave it 7 out of 10 and I'm normally quite tight.",7,12,14,23 April 2002
