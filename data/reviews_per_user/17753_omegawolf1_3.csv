Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 3 of E.T.'s species can be seen chanting along with the no confidence vote against Chancellor Valoren
","At the 1:29:09 mark, bottom left of screen.I would've thought E.T. would've been a more iNCLUSIVE type alien:(",7,0,1,7 January 2020
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Probably the most important film I've seen.
","It teaches us, and reminds us of the importance of tolerance and compassion towards others different from us; as important in today's world as it probably ever has been.Watching this film, it was hard to believe these were kids acting with an occasionally malfunctioning puppet.E.T. deserved the Oscar for best picture more than Gandhi if for no other reason than it was an ORIGINAL movie that taught essentially the same lesson, only better, and more indirectly.E.T.'s: Beautifully written; masterfully directed; wonderfully acted; majestically scored and eternally important.This film, probably more than any other, can make you a better human being... if you let it.",10,1,2,24 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Can't ANYONE write one of these movies properly?!!!
","They should've just handed the movie to Lawrence Kasden, you know, the guy who wrote the BEST Star Wars movie - Empire Strikes Back, and just LIVED with his result. At least he would have structured some kind of great story. SW:TROS feels forced, mashed together, contrived and gratuitous. And if anyone's 'earned' the right to F-up a Star Wars movie, it's KASDEN!The Tran and Fin love story that was developing was a nice little 'add' by Johnson, from TLJ.And, Po and Finn shouldn't be fighting. I mean didn't Fin save Po's life?! That kindda means he owes him forever.The gratuitous medal given to Chewie....... I mean REALLY?!!! And no one else getting a medal was just the same mistake made to different people.JJ, go back to producing, Bud. You haven't written anything good since your calling card, Forever Young. The demands of writing a weekly series Felicity and Alias screwed up your ability to really fine tune something.And Forever Young ALMOST doesn't work at times. And I loved that movie.",4,9,18,25 December 2019
