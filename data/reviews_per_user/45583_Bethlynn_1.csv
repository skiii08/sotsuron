The Blair Witch Project," Too Much Hype
","This movie could have been a great movie, but it was hyped too much and too often as 'The scariest thing you'll ever see.'  I thought 'Blair Witch' was a eerie creepy movie, but not at all frightening until the last scene.  The filming was all very bouncy, and so much of it was just black and voices cursing in the background.  This movie was okay, but it does not deserve the praise it has been receiving in newspapers and on television.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
