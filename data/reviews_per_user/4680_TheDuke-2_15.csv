Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A stink bomb!
","After 16 years of waiting, boy was I ever disappointed.  I saw the first Star Wars when I was 6 years old and it always holds a special place in my heart.  This new Star Wars movie was in my opinion a 'fundamentally' bad piece of film making.  Special effects...Yatta yatta...In 1999 they should be good.  If you go into this movie as I did, with the love of classic movies in mind (Story, script, acting) you will be very disappointed.  If on the other hand you are say from the 'MTV' generation, you may love the flashy 'Muppet show' it has become.  I work for a company that does special effects, so I appreciate nice graphics like everyone else. However when the integrity of a movie goes down, and you lose a certain human element, that's where I draw the line.  To close, I left the theatre very angry with a feeling of being cheated.  I had to go buy myself a nice dinner at Tony Romas, just to get the taste of the movie out of my mouth.Anyway at least your kids will enjoy it.",2,0,1,7 June 1999
Casablanca," One of the top ten of all-time
","They don't make movies like this anymore.  The look and feel of the sets, and the acting are unmatched in today's movies.  This is a movie that anyone who cares anything about movies should see.",10,0,0,9 June 1999
Erin Brockovich," This was the real Best Picture
","Now that I have gone through the awful wake of the oscars, and wake up realizing that no it was not a dream, I can now give my opinion of this movie.  Erin Brockovich was out of the five movies nominated, the best picture period!  It had all of the intangibles needed for a quality picture; Good lead acting, good story, good supporting actors, and finally a quality Director.  This movie was about the 'Little guy' or 'girl' in this case taking down the big fish.  Not only was it a feel good movie, but it was based on a true story and if you can pull off making this type of movie and make an audience think after seeing it, then it did the job.  At least Julia Roberts got an Oscar :)",10,3,5,26 March 2001
Unbreakable," Simply Brilliant
","M Night pulls off another wonderful picture with Unbreakable.  In a time when movies have been less-than quality, he shines through again with another excellent movie.  I won't give away any secrets, but this is a movie about people, emotions, and get visuals and sound.  If you're a fan of quality movies, then don't miss this one!",10,1,1,30 November 2000
Memento," Best Picture
","This is a fantastic movie.  One that is edited with precision and a wonderful touch.  There are Dvd's out there that can allow you to watch this movie the 'traditional way' but if you want to enjoy this movie for it's originality and creativity, then watch it the way the Director wants you to see it.  Excellent, thoughtful and deserving of an Oscar.",10,0,1,22 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Visually Beautiful...Lucas' Directing Stinks!
","Your Kids will love this movie, beautiful colors, sound, and cool aliens. Film makers beware, Lucas is Not a good filmmaker, Spielberg is. Let's be honest, the movie was 'busy' from the get-go with CG and more CG.  There were a few cool scenes at the beginning (Although rip-off of 5th Element and of course Blade Runner)  How about the love story no one wants to see but Lucas, and how he can stretch out bad love dialogue between 2 people everyone already knows are going to be together anyway.  Now to Jengo Fett, who is the original clone and father to everyone's favorite Bounty Hunter, Boba Fett.  'Little Fett' as I call him, is there for the kids (Ok no problem)  However Jengo is there for us Big kids, who have waited over 20 years to see him kick butt.  Unfortunately you get 1 cool fight at the beginning, then he gets the AX toward the end. (When you see the arena scene...think Gladiator rip-off)  Finally for the main reason this movie is awful, is because 'who really is the bad guy?'  Not Jengo, not the Senator, but I guess...Count Duuko (Played well by Sir Christopher Lee) So why then do you as the audience have to sit through 1 hour of the movie before finding out anything about this 'Villian'?  Aren't these movies suppose to be about Good vs Evil?  You will leave this movie with 1 of 2 responses, either 'Boy the graphics were neato!' or like me and other die hard fans, 'What the hell was that? And why do I still not know how the Emperor got his powers after 2 new installments?'Lucas has 1 more movie to make, and guess what folks, you have to wait 3 more years to see it.*Oh well folks, just remember that the 'Two Towers' will be out in November and Lucas will all be forgotten :)end of line..................",1,0,1,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Breathtaking! - George Lucas Who?
","I felt like a kid in a candy store.  This movie was beautiful in presentation and performance.  To top it off he even stayed true to the original stories.  I haven't felt this good about a movie since I was 6 years old and watching Star Wars for this first, second, third, etc.God Bless Peter Jackson!  He has restored my faith in filmaking again :)",10,0,0,20 December 2001
Spider-Man," Very well done
","It's refreshing to see quality film making done today.  This was a very enjoyable movie, based on my favorite Super Hero.  I've waiting over 8 years for this picture and now I get to enjoy it.  The graphics are done wonderfully and look flawless as they blend in with the rest of the picture. This is not the 'Busy' movie Star Wars episode 2 will be when you see it. The story is done well, and the performances are superb by both Toby Maguire (Spiderman) and William Dafoe (Goblin).Forget Ebert's comments and go see it, you'll enjoy it :)",9,0,0,9 May 2002
The Incredibles," If Babe can be nominated...then why not this?
","I've decided years ago that Hollywood is way out of touch with America.With that being said, can you tell me why this movie isn't every bit as good as...Million Dollar Baby? Please, there should be no restriction on genre when deciding Best Pictures...NONE! Basically this is a fun parody of a superhero family that has to face evil once again. It allows people to enjoy a 'Simpsons' style family that fights crime.So if you haven't seen this, see it and enjoy a clean, fun movie.p.s. Memo to Hollywood...In 1977 Star Wars was better then Annie Hall :)",9,0,0,22 March 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not as good as original...
","Let me say first that I'm spoiled to have had the pleasure of watching the original with Gene Wilder (who was hands down better then Depp...sorry Burton fans) This movie is indeed a good children's movie and one I would recommend you take your kids to. However for the fans of the original, you will be very disappointed, unless of course you are one of the 'Burton Coolaid drinkers' The visuals are wonderful in the movie as is the musical score by the always great Danny Elfman, but the two things that made the original fun and a classic was Gene Wilder and the Ompa Loopas with their respective musical numbers. The songs are what made the magic happen for me and that was very much missing from this version. Depp's performance as Wonka was cold and off track the entire movie which for me ruined the picture.Gene Wilder's charming and eccentric performance could have only been equaled today by the likes of Robin Williams, Steve Martin, or Jim Carrey. Depp is by all accounts a great actor and I enjoy him in almost everything he does, except here.",5,1,4,20 July 2005
Life Is Beautiful," This picture is beautiful
","In a time of special effects craziness, this movie shined with a beauty that you would have to see to believe.  Making light of the horrors of the Nazi war camps, was a suttle but very convicing twist that Roberto Benigni did so well.  The love between a family in a the middle of the crisis of WW2 was very touching.  I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age, for it is truly one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking to come out in a long time.",10,2,3,7 June 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Simply Brilliant!
","Peter Jackson has restored my faith in filmmaking once again, and has officially removed George Lucas from my memory :)While I could nitpick about a few minor issues of choice in his final editing for the movie, the 'Epic' battle scenes and closure to this grand literary work more then make up for it.I sat through all three movies at the all-day 'geek fest' so I could soak them all in to get a sense of scope for the movies.  As a student of film, I had minor issues with some of his choices, but the fact that he made me love my cinematic experience again was shades of Lucas 77' when I was 6 years old seeing Star Wars for the first time.He deserves an Oscar for director at least, if not also for Picture.  If we learned anything from the Annie Hall vs Star Wars issue of 77, then the Academy will allow Peter Jackson to go into the History books with a Trilogy that not only surpasses Star Wars, but that will inevitably become legendary for all-time.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
Sin City," Visually Stunning!
","As expected this movie was as beautifully shot as I expect from Mr Rodriguez. He and Spielberg are probably the best Cameramen in the business today. Sin City was by far the 'best looking' comic book movie to date. Mickey Rourke's performance as Marv was worth the price of admission all by it self. Now for the negative side. My only big beef with the movie is how the 3 separate stories are placed together on screen. I didn't feel the connection with the other characters like I did Marv, and I blame Frank Miller for that. He had the entire movie storyboarded out and Rodriguez followed it to the letter. As a comic book this story works, but on screen people are owed better story structure and placement. He did tie all 3 stories into the main one, but only in a cheap way. Instead of a beginning, middle and end, he worked it similarly to the 'pulp fiction' format. Now I'll be the first one to say the Rodriguez knows more about Directing then Tarrantino ever will, however Mr T is still the dialog and story teller master which is why pulp fiction worked.Overall this movie has all the visuals and violence that serious comic book movies need to get the point across. Just don't go into it hoping to get a resolution that you will be looking for.",7,1,3,2 April 2005
Gladiator," Can't Hold up Braveheart's Jockstrap!
","One word, overrated.  This movie was a good movie, but best picture nominated?  No.  Winner of the Best picture?  Disgusting. Oh and Russell Crowe the best actor?  Ridiculous!  Now we have finally arrived at an all-time low in movies and the oscars.  This has made me wish that I was born in another time, when the likes of Clark Gable, Bogart, and other legends graced the screen.  We today have all but lost the brilliance and epic quality that we once had at the movies.  Here's to the next Spielberg or Hitchcock whoever you are, because we need you in the worst way.For those of you about to vomit from the oscars, I salute you!",5,0,0,26 March 2001
V for Vendetta," Hollywood's GAY Agenda continues>>>
","Other then the two GAY characters in the movie and the use of the KORAN as a symbol of things being suppressed, this movie was excellent! I've read the graphic novel years ago and loved it, as I have most of Alan Moore's work. Hugo Weaving is fantastic and so is Natlie Portman. The only reason for not giving the movie a 10, is because the GAY and Anti-Christian messages are all fabricated by the Producers of the movie. Yes they also portray the Fascist leader as George W Bush and that if you read between the lines, he ultimately was responsible for 9/11.It doesn't really matter that Bush was used, since this novel was written during the 80's. The story and message are so good that you could put 'ANY' face on the leaders.Memo to Hollywierd: NOT everyone is GAY and needs to have your agenda driven down our throat! I for one I'm going to choose to see very few movies in the theater any more, and watch as the movie sales continue to drop (As they have for the last 3 years and counting).",7,3,9,20 March 2006
