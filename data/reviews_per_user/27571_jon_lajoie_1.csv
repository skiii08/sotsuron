Requiem for a Dream," a pain to the eyes, but...
","an interesting form of filming. In my time, watching many drug films, I've found they either show self destruction (The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting) or just trippy experiences (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.) This film shows both. The film moves at a rather fast pace to emphasise how quickly the effects of drugs take a hold on people. Each story is separated by a short scene, which show essentially what they are addicted to, be it pills, shooting up or money. The films generally dark nature shows each person spiraling into oblivion and although conflicts seem to be resolved, the scenario left to us is not one of hope, but defeat, that although they have survived the worst, nothing will be the same, and it never gets better. If you have never seen a drug film before, make this one your first.",6,0,1,1 October 2005
