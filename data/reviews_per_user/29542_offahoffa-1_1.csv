Deja Vu," The best,by far, bar none.
","This is by far the best movie i have ever seen,and i have seen them all. I think so much off this movie i have gone out of my way to comment on it,it is the first. Tony Scott,and Denzel Washington you are the masters. I never thought i would even comment on a movie before ,but after seeing this i absolutely had to this movie moved me in a way i cannot describe. If i thought this movie was as good as it is i would have payed double and bought it twice,but as the movie shows time is a river,and i am on a raft without a paddle. This movie makes The Matrix look like a cartoon,and it makes Titanic look like a sitcom. If i was robbed by gunpoint for all my DVD's they would only get Deja Vu over my dead body.",10,3,5,28 April 2007
