Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More Soul But Not A Stand-Alone Movie
","This should have been a single movie rather than two truncated mini-movies. It seems Q agrees because he places the credits with all of the actors at the end (including mini-clips from part I), and we realize how very, very many things aren't in this second part. It's a shame, because Kill Bill 2 is more thoughtful and fleshes out the plot, with backstories on The Bride and Bill and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) characters, as well as meaningful dialogue explaining the bloodbath of the first movie. But it needed an editor to chop down the words. Just as the first movie needed an editor to chop down the fight sequences. THE MATRIX 2 and 3 taught us that more Agent Smiths and bigger, louder, longer fight sequences don't improve things. But if Kill Bill vol. 1 suffers from Matrix 2/3 excesses, Volume 2 suffers from an excess of verbiage and overdone dialogue along the lines of...I dunno, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE? There is too much self-indulgence at work here, and I fear the box office of these two movies is just going to make 'Q''s next effort that much more baggy and undisciplined.Q has said splitting the movie in two allowed him to keep all the little bits he otherwise would have had to cut, but the truth is, there's a good half hour from part one that should have excised and a good twenty minutes more from part two. The result would have been a roughly three hour standalone movie that would have been tight and eminently watchable in one sitting. Kind of like the Beatles White Album, which would have been their all-time best had it been a single epic-length platter, but because they decided to indulge themselves and throw everything they came up with on the two discs, it's full of classics and crap side by side. Even Kill Bill's music screams of lengthy epics, with Ennio Morricone sprinkled throughout the trailer sequence evoking THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY's monumental breadth. It would have worked as homage and humor in a single movie, but feels out of place and strangely wrong in this split up movie thanks to Miramax's quest for the dollars. To Q's credit, though, the overall music is wonderfully reminiscent of the seventies and chopsocky movies; I suspect he spent a long time putting it together and it is generally effective. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is okay, but is lessened by being separated from Vol. 1. This is the rare movie where the 'Director's Cut' DVD should have LESS footage and Q + U and HW and M should return KB V I and II into one film, the way it should have been from the start.",8,2,4,31 May 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Sly and Winning Change of Pace for Spielberg
","Fleeing the dark tone which has permeated his movies for the past five or more years, Spielberg chose this light-hearted character piece from the mile high stack of scripts available and what a great choice it was. This is easily the most entertaining and purely enjoyable effort from Steven in at least a decade and a real comeback for a director whose work, while still respectable, was beginning to wear. All the elements are there. The cast is outstanding from Hanks to DiCaprio to Sheen to Walken and they are all game. The script is sensational; from dialogue to organization of events this is probably the most focused and sly screenplays Spielberg has had to work with in many years and was probably the best script of the year. The music and cinematography are solid (one of Williams' better 'jazzy' soundtracks. In particular, DiCaprio shines as the fresh-faced con artist and Hanks is dependable as the long-suffering and dedicated federal agent after him. Walken makes the most of his limited screen time. One wishes Walken's character (and the genesis of DiCaprio's con mentality) had been better defined but there is the great substitute teacher scene which is transcendent and hilarious. Just the mere proud smirk on Walken's face when he realizes his son has pulled a fast one on the faculty for a week is enough to explain much of Abignale's childhood and influences. Ironically, this movie relies on close personal relationships and almost no action, which makes it the most atypical Spielberg movie ever. There are no big chases or explosions but a great many heart to heart conversations. Incredibly, it all comes together and the result is a staggeringly witty and great movie. To be honest, I didn't think Spielberg had it in him anymore. But then, he had a lot of great help. Fans of cons and coming of age movies should definitely check this out. Hanks is his reliable self and DiCaprio steals some scenes and is entirely convincing in a challenging role. Give it a try!",10,1,2,21 June 2003
Spider-Man 2," Fidelity
","This is the most faithful (not entirely accurate, but faithful) adaptation of a comic book I've ever seen. Doc Ock is as powerful and slithery as I always imagined him (and those tentacles) being. Peter Parker is far more nerdy and snakebitten than in the first movie and while unpleasant, this is a much truer interpretation than the first watered down approach. The actor who portrays JJJ steals many scenes, and Alfred Molina is also remarkably spot-on. But bouquets all around...the direction is tight and other than the occasional cutesy wootsy humor, this is a classic popcorn movie that delivers thrills, spills, emotions, angst, character development and action galore. The Spider-Man Doctor Octopus battle harkens back to Superman 2 but far outshines it. A great movie all the way around, but particularly for comic book fans. 9/10.",Null,0,0,4 July 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," As Inferior to Two as Two Was Inferior To One
","As bad as Reloaded was in comparison to the original Matrix, many (including myself) gave the Brothers Wachowski the benefit of the doubt that part three would bring everything together and cleverly resolve things. Instead, we got this disaster. As a local reviewer aptly put it, 'how did something that began so cool (in the original) wind up so dorky?'For starters, many subplots left dangling in the second MATRIX are totally ignored in part three. What happened to the pair of albino rastafarians so prominent (and of seemingly uncertain alliance) in RELOADED? They don't have a second in part three. What the hell happened to the Emperor-like Anthony Zerbe from part two, who also had tons of screen time and was clearly positioned as a key influence on events (and a potential Judas to Zion)? Where the hell did the comely girlfriend of the Frenchman go? They stuffed her into a ridiculously cleavage-enhancing little number in part three, but whatever became of her vampiric soul kiss with Neo from part two? Nothing. Many setups for characters including the Keymaster and the Architect also saw no fruition in part three, particularly disappointing in light of the five minute soliloquy from The Architect in II which professed to open doorways to Neo (and us). In III The Architect appears for a total of four minutes on screen and only at the very end, to typically ambiguous effect.Worse than these plot point 101 errors and omissions, there is no emotion or connection to the characters anymore. Neo comes closest to feeling human, but Reeves' cold reading is off-putting. Trinity is particularly ineffective; by the time an impaled Carrie Anne Moss lies down to die, the audience I sat with was essentially admonishing her to hurry up and get on with it. Morpheus, the mentor and father figure of the first movie, is reduced to window dressing in this release, playing a glorified assistant to the grating and annoying Jada Pinkett Smith.The special effects take over even more than they did in the loud second installment, which makes for a second hour of sumptuous imagery but a first hour so deadly, I wish Agent Smith would have taken me before the plot less FX-fest ensued. One saving grace is Hugo Weaving, whose entertaining and committed performance as Agt. Smith momentarily harks back to the first movie. Overall, however, this lone bright spot is overshadowed by a wretched script rife with overwrought dialogue, unmotivated (or flat-out wrong) characterization and more questions than answers. The special effects are eye popping but they can't save this surprisingly weak finale. 5 / 10.",5,0,1,12 November 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of the great relationship movies
","ETERNAL SUNSHINE restores uber-hyped Charlie Kaufman's lofty position in the upper echelon of quirky modern screenwriters which began with BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, continued in CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, faltered a tad with HUMAN NATURE, came back with ADAPTATION, and returns full force with this effort.  Arty, jarring, striking, unorthodox and touching, ETERNAL SUNSHINE is a treatise on the joys, heartaches and tenuous nature of romantic love which is full of knowing observations and insights.  Add in Jim Carrey's most straightforward and likably subdued effort, a winningly quirky turn from Winslet, and solid ensemble work from Big Names Wilkinson, Wood and Dunst and the result is a genuinely appealing non-linear ride which combines MEMENTO with PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.  One of the most original and enjoyable rides of the year, and one of the better relationship movies I've ever seen. Don't miss it.  10 / 10.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Visual feast but a bit empty; clearly inferior to the first
","First the plaudits: this movie looks incredible. The cinematography, production values and CGI effects raise the bar previously set by the first Matrix. Fans of the eye bending wire-enhanced fight sequences from the first will not be disappointed as this movie features no less than three extended sequences which trump the first movie's already incredible fisticuffs. Unfortunately, that's about all the movie has to offer. One of the biggest advantages of the first movie was that it had the Big Secret of the manufactured universe which was artfully mounted and logically explained and justified. The Matrix constantly messed with our expectations about the real and the unreal and found creative ways to interweave the two. The second movie adds a little bit to the first Big Secret and ponders the reality and motivations of some of the unreal characters (like the oracle and Agent Smith) but we spend most of the second movie feeling like we're already in on the joke. MINOR SPOILERS AHOYThe Wachowskis have added some new characters and subplots to Reloaded, including the Morpheus - Jada Pinkett - Zion leader love triangle, the plotting Anthony Zerbe (very Star Wars Emporeresque), the ghostly twin albino Rastafarians, the mysterious Architect, the Locksmith and the posturing dealer and his lusty wife who leads Neo to the Locksmith. While I enjoyed the Locksmith, I found most of the other characters not only uninspiring but actually somewhat annoying. The subplots in Reloaded clearly seem designed to bring us to the third movie, but there is little plot development for us to see here, other than inroducting the characters. Whereas the first movie was economical in introducing characters and gave each an organic function in the story, in Reloaded we seem to be given a hodgepodge of new folk to watch, but little for them to do.One of the stranger sequences is the extended and utterly non-sequitur bumping and grinding orgy where we get Neo and Trinity going at it as the entire Zion community also entwines and fornicates like they are in Milton's ninth circle of hell and being broadcast live on MTV After Dark. One suspects the Wachowski brothers may be acknowledging the asexuality of the first Matrix and decided to frontload the second one with an extended gratuitous orgy. No problem there, except it is entirely unrelated to the rest of the movie and this four minute sequence brings the proceedings to a halt in a movie which is already nearly two and a half hours. Another complaint is the juxtaposition of extended dialogue sequences (and not just the ridiculously long dialogue between Neo and the architect, which many have already complained about) followed by extended fight sequences and then a repeat in the cycle. There is a lot of talk and a lot of fighting in this movie but they seem to exist in mutually exclusive universes, which is a bit jarring and stilted.Matrix Reloaded is not a bad movie. It probably mainly suffers from comparisons to the first, which was a great movie. Reloaded is sumptuous and full of rich imagery but lacks the zap and shock of its predecessor and relies on many of the same tricks of the first, which is never a good sign. One can only hope that Reloaded is merely a bridge to the third installment, which will bring back surprises and original revelations. I know I'm rooting for #3 and will still see it, based on the first Matrix. But while Matrix Reloaded isn't awful, it was ultimately disappointing and even felt derivative, which is the first Wachowski brother movie to feel that way for me.",7,0,0,30 May 2003
Identity," Decent, but less than the sum of its parts
","Blessed with an intriguing hook, escalating suspense and a game ensemble cast, IDENTITY is ultimately more style than substance. This is not to say it is not diverting and largely entertaining. It's just also a bit of a cop out. Coming on the heels of no less than five recent movies featuring the same modus operandi of the cagey or otherwise unreliable narrator / narrative (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, FIGHT CLUB, THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE and even CUBE 2), IDENTITY is probably the least successful of the group in logically / cleverly integrating the gimmick. Coming so late in this plot device's cycle, one would have hoped for more than mostly nonsensical pseudo-psychological mumbo jumbo. Still, this is not to say that the movie isn't an enjoyable ride. It just doesn't go very far after promising a much greater journey.SPOILERSLike too many X-Files episodes, the movie sets up a clever challenge and hook which the climax and conclusion is never able to satisfyingly explain or resolve. A movie which owes a tremendous debt to PSYCHO, IDENTITY ultimately suffers the same anti-climactic letdown inflicted on us by Hitchcock. PSCYHO's five minute pop psychological soapbox soliloquy on cross dressing by Simon Oakland is matched by IDENTITY's similarly laughable lip service dissertation by the defense psychologist on how the entire movie we've been watching is the schizophrenic delusions of a sybillic patient. This longwinded and patronizing lecture on split personalities is almost as dated as Leslie Nielsen's 'Monsters of the Id' deus ex machina from FORBIDDEN PLANET.Much like FIGHT CLUB, another movie which relies heavily on the POV of an insane (in this case schizophrenic) protagonist, IDENTITY begins to lose steam just as it strains hardest to impress us with its twists. The problem is not that the story isn't ambitious. The problem is that the split personality twist is from out in left field and we are left bushwhacked, sidetracked and disappointed. It's a twist that we don't want to be true because it ruins the mystery that we hope will have a much better explanation.Obviously the creators give a lot of thought to structuring the reveal and choreograph individuals' locations at the time of each murder such that any number of red herrings and solid suspects are available. At first Busey seems a great suspect. Then the motel manager. Then Ray Liotta. Then ghosts from the 'Indian Burial Ground.' There is much to admire in the first half hour, where we meet the ten characters efficiently and unpredictably. We see in nicely non-linear fashion how each player's actions contribute to the others' arrival at the remote motel where they will all ultimately die.IDENTITY has plenty of jolts and some smartness. While it outsmarts itself at the end and gives in to a gimmicky finale, up to that point it is a divertingly creepy and intriguing road to nowhere.",6,0,1,29 April 2003
The Wizard of Oz," Magical And Timeless
","I don't care how jaded you are about the moviegoing experience; this simple fairy tale is a must-see for kids from six to a hundred and six.  Unmatched visuals, a great archetypal story and solid ensemble acting make this movie peculiarly invulnerable to criticism.  If you can, see it in a big theatre (revival houses seem to run it during the holidays around Thanksgiving to X-mas) because the technicolor is truly amazing on the full size screen.  A DVD copy on a big tv will also yield things you may not have seen before, like the wacky flowers growing out of the munchkins' shoes, which I'd never previously noticed.   It's sixty four years old but still wonderful, especially for children.  10 / 10.",10,1,3,18 November 2003
