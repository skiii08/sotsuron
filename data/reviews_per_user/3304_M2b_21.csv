The Blair Witch Project," The lamest movie not of this year but of the last ten years
","It's scary how really lame-brain movies such as American Pie and this awful Blair Witch film find audiences. I can only guess that 'lame' is in at the turn of the millenium. Look at the recent Woodstock music festival.There is no scariness or terror whatsoever in this flick. The lame script is perfect for three lamebrains taking awalk in the woods. I was rooting for the witch, hoping that the characters would be killed off. An alternate title for this joke would be 'Mercy Killing.' I hope the co-producers, directors, writers of this claptrap take a weekend camp out trip in the deep woods of Maryland.  Go get em Blair-baby.I want my money back!The worst movie released in America since 'Play It As It Lays' with Tuesday Weld.  In that picture, two thirds of the audience left before the end.  We waited out Blair Witch for no good reason.  The cinema did have comfortable seats.  That must be it.",1,1,3,27 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," If you like this movie, you are likely a threat to humanity
","I have spent my 48 years searching for the one thing, the one single indicator by which we can decide, by which we find out who are the truly dangerous people amongst us.  The Pol Pots, the Slobodan Milosevic's of the future. And here I have finally found the answer.People who like Blair Witch Project are a threat to society. They will accuse the nice, normal non-malevolent humans they share this earth with of not being as intelligent as they are. They will accuse them of lacking imagination. They will decide that all others are hopelessly brainwashed by the merciless manipulators of Hollywood.  They, their glorious selves, are ofcourse of sufficient mentality to be free of these pernicious horrors that afflict all others.It is only a matter of time until they try to obtain the power to decide who shall live and who shall die. And who shall be sent to re-education camps until they LIKE the Blair Witch Project. If you are one of these miserable people (such as Heather, Josh and Mike), please do all humankind a favor. Live your life, but make no attempt to obtain power of anykind. Love your families. Do not choose politics as a career.  Be kind to your parents as they age.  Do not become a teacher, a cop, a prison guard or a soldier.  Get a non-descript gentle job that aids society but generally is non-threatening, such as working for the Post Office.  Love your spouses, raise your children but try not to influence them too much.If you violate these simple rules, the world will become a worse place. Unless the Blair Witch catches you first. The rest of us can only hope.",1,0,2,30 August 1999
Se7en," another film about a super serial killer with powers far beyond those of mortal men....zzzzzzzz.....
","How does Hollywood keep turning out these awful flicks? I guess it's because Jonathan Demme did it right in Silence of The Lambs and came up with a truly terrifying extreme character in Hopkin's Hannibal Lector.  But the 'Seven',s the 'Kiss the Girls',s ad nauseum flicks that repeat the inane theme of the cops chasing the super-killer who has unlimited resources in both time and finance and can do ANYTHING he wants with no problems that real life throws at everybody else when they try and do SIMPLE things, well, forgive the run on sentence, but if Hollywood never makes another super-killer flick again it will still be too soon.  These guys do not exist. There has NEVER been a psycho-killer with an involved 'relationship' with any police officer of any police force, and finally, real life serial killers are losers who choose very vulnerable victims at random. The only pattern to pattern killers are that they find victims because many people are nice and trusting and so they become prey to the wolves occasionally, sort of a reverse lottery where unlucky people cross paths with these swine. Why Hollywood glamorizes these creepoids is beyond me. It doesn't surprise me that the same director who annihilated the Aliens series with the inane Aliens-3, directed this flick. I can't wait until he kills 'Rendezvous with Rama', one of Arthur Clarke's most enjoyable tomes.",Null,1,3,27 December 1999
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Don't get mad at Madden, this boy tries hard....
","to do the impossible; make a European movie with an American film style, wide screen, special effects, major musical score, stars chosen over actors.  Nevertheless, he should be commended for this enjoyable cinema story- telling.  Nick Cage is an Amercian of Italian ancestry, and his trained accent may be forced, but how can anyone NOT like Nick Cage.  He has screen charisma.  He's not really beautiful but he lights up the screen in all of his work. Penelope Cruz is another matter.  Who cast her as the salutable Bella Bambina??  She's cute.  Yes, I'll give you that, she's cute and has nice curves for a 98 pound wonder.  She's a competent actress. But she cannotbe mistaken for a young Sofia Loren, not even a young Laura Antonelli.  This part screamed out for the type of heart stopping screen beauty that really stands out.  It doesn't matter if she's a bedroom wizard (which she very likely is) because that only helps Tom Cruise, John Madden and the other lucky stars and producers. It doesn't come across on screen and it even costs money to the filmakers.  That's what makes me think she's THAT good.  Even in Captain Correlli, the gal playing the executed girlfriend (Vicky Moragaki??) of the German captain outshone Ms. Cruz on screen. That was a salutable bella bambina, not Penelope.But Mr. Madden should be commended for making this flick which will surely lose money in America but may do well in Europe (I hear they like Amercian movies which is why the French keep trying to outlaw them), and I hope his close times with Cruz were worth the losses entailed in the miscasting. See you at the chalkboard Monday, John!",Null,1,3,27 August 2001
Lost in Translation," Why do you guys like (care) about these cloying losers?
","whatever the film's merits, and the Unemployed Critic gave this a surprising 10, it's very hard to feel any sympathy for people living great lives, such as Murray's character, his new gorgeous (no other way to describe her at all) young friend, or for that matter Sofia or Francis Coppola who manage to find ways to be depressed and all upset about life's imperfections.  Does that include you?  This film was a major disappointment and I suspect is sung from Sofia to her chorus. Lesser people living lesser lives but finding more out of it than these compulsive depressives will not find this film enlightening or entertaining.  It's a failure, not a success.  Like the characters.  They should go away.and BTW, the casting for the young photographer was pathetic with acapital 'P'. His character was never believable for one single second. No way a gorgeous woman falls for an undisguised nerd like that. That part required a handsome, charismatic young man who, absorbed with himself, distances himself from his beautiful wife, unaware because of his self-absorption.  This nerd was unspeakable. No credible way thismarriage ever happened in the first place.  My guess is Sofia, who although Hollywood royalty, dated many nerds in her time precisely because her talent exceeds her looks by miles and miles, just thinks that other women are also attracted to this kind of guy.  Oh yeah, sure.",Null,0,0,6 October 2003
21," How much did Mezrich get paid to sell his soul?
","This movie may or may not be entertaining to the viewer, depending on your taste. But it in no way shape or form even resembles Mezrich's Bringing Down the House. Anyone saying this politically corrected script created for this film from scratch even RESEMBLES Mezrich's Bringing Down the House, NEVER read the book. Where's Monaco? Where's the Russian leader of the pack? Where are the OTHER casinos they gambled in? The film also is based on the preposterous rationality (NO WHERE IN THE BOOK) that a poor student can't go to Harvard Med without joining a card reading Blackjack team. Right. That's because Stuident Loans have not been invented. And they don't give Student Loans to Harvard Med students. And Harvard Med grads never earn enough money to pay back their student loans, because a Harvard degree is so worthless on the market. RIGHT!!! Only rich kids go to Harvard or MIT. Right! Not one poor kid to be found on their campus. Right. Well, if your gullible, stupid, politically correct, and proud of all that, you'll buy into the stupid script. I wonder how much Mezrich was paid. I wonder if he retains the right to someday make a movie out of his book. I love the idiotic contributors to IMDb.com calling this film 'fact based'. Losers.",3,0,2,7 August 2008
American Psycho," Hollywood Will Never Begin (or try) To Know...
","how happy I am that this film is losing money......big time. If Hollywood never makes another psycho killer film again, ever, it will be way too soon.  Seven and Kiss the Girls are two stellar examples of this pathetic Hollywood genre. Both failed the cable test.  The cable test is: 'will you stay with a movie you have never seen before, start to end, with 57 other channels to change to?'  I am absolutely certain A-P will fail this test.  Because of the success of Silence of the Lambs, which I admit was an excellent film, this genre will not die the merciful death it so gloriously deserves.  But it is wonderful when the producers of this drivel lose money.  The original Psycho and Silence are enough. All other films in this despicable genre are not worth the time and effort to either participate in the making of, or to actually watch.  To all those who like this excrement, I truly hope you are never faced with a really difficult problem to solve in your own lives. If you do, find a different solution, OK?",Null,0,1,6 September 2000

","The English!  Boy does he hate the English!First, we get Braveheart.  Scotsmen good. Irishmen good. Englishmen bad bad bad.

I can't wait until Mel makes his first film about World War Two, that should be a pip!  It's time the world learns who were the bad guys in that one too!P.S. This film runs the gamut on gratuitous violence and historical inaccuracy.  Leslie Nielsen, the REAL Swamp Fox (Francis Marion), is not yet dead.

Ocean's Eleven," Beautiful Men, Un-Pretty Woman, Hmmmmmmm
","Hollywood's great gay casting directors have done it again and they must be proud.  Clooney and Pitt couldn't possibly be better looking.  Julia Roberts for the female lead? Maybe ten years ago. What's the one thing that all pop video's, black or white, have in commom.  The men are all butt ugly and the women are drop dead gorgeous.  I guess out of all those staggerring beauties, none of them can act, or, Hollywood film directors and pop video directors use different casting agencies.  Very different.At least Julia's a name star. But it's just impossible to believe that two super studs like Clooney and Garcia go to war over Roberts (maybe Eric instead).  Oh, yes,she's still pretty by real life standards.  But in a film close-up?  Puhlleassse.  Robert Redford can't play college kids no more nor can Marlon Brando be cast as the Thin Man.  No matter how great the actor, you can't be the part if you don't look the part.This is an Okay film at best.  The lack of a real Hollywood beauty in the only female part hurts badly.  And they'll pay for this at the box office.  When the credits said, 'and introducing Julia Roberts', well, that was a cute touch at the end.",Null,0,1,13 December 2001

Good Will Hunting," The Barroom Debate Scene
","Thank God for Jay Mohr and the short lived series Action. At least they had the courage to directly, on-the-air, from other Hollywood players, lambaste this monstrosity of ascript that went all the way to the Oscar's!Bad scripts come and go. Just part of life. Giving them Oscars as Best Screenplay is criminal.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are fine human beings and good looking guys living great lives.  They just can't write to save them, that's all.The barroom debate scene between the snooty student and the self educated Damon is merely the most pretentious and stupid scene EVER to portray itself as having any connection to reality whatsoever. Why didn't it get THAT Oscar?This awful film was a top ten grossing movie in 1997. That's the really scary part.  This bad a film does that well. And it's not an action flick, it pretends to be an intellectual flick with an important message!  As you read this, if you didn't see the gruesome falseness of the barroom debate scene, just remember that your really dwelling some place far out, but nowhere in the real world.  I bet you liked Blair Witch.A very distant second in the removed-from-reality category could be Jason Robarbs in the 'senior partners take a shower together scene' in Philadelphia.  But that's not really close to this masterwork.  One can also think of the Happy Days episode where Fonzie and Richie go to a snooty rich people's party and are treated so badly.  Another worthy contender. Several episodes of The White Shadow perhaps? James At Sixteen? I'll wager young Matt and Damon loved those shows!The bar is set. That barroom debate scene may not be the worst thing ever filmed.  But it is certainly the most intellectually pretentious and cloyingly stupid scene ever made.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," These Ork-things ain't so tough after all
","All they ever do is lose. Every single trained human soldier in these films beats the ork-things as the flash of a bow. Fifty ronin led by a renegade prince come across some Orks. Bye bye orks. The soldiers from the other kingdom travelling stealthily overthe land meets an ork Army. Guess who looses. Easily. You guessing? Yup, the Orks get kicked again.  And then finally Helms-Keep. Old men are holding them off and they out number the human-elf army by about 500 to one or so. Mighty tough Orks, aren't they? When White Wizard (much much tougher than gray wizards) arrives with a few thousand horseman, it's Ork-Stew for everyone!It's a good thing they shot this movie in New Zealand because Middle Earth is just about that big and no more. Ten thousand baddie Orks? Whoppee.  I seem to remember civil wars around this earth where ten thousand casulties was more a skirmish than a battle.  And this was suppossed to be round one between ultimate evil and whatever on the other side.Can someone explain to me what Solon wants? More sex? How about a body?

Puhhleeease.The first film had some intrigue into it, the fellowship, the quest, the characters, the bonding etc. Oh yeah, one prince in the fellowship was actually defeated by Orks. He killed about 25 of them first, but was defeated by odds of about 200 Orks to one. Boy those Orks sure are tough.The Two Towers was interminable.  Let there be closure in the the third episode.

The Mummy Returns," They finally got the comic book movie right
","It sure took Hollywood enough tries to get it. Mummy-1 was just such a failure, all special effects but with an unengrossing storyline that passed outside the borders of even comic book credibility.In Mummy Returns, they nailed it just right and gave us a thoroughly enjoyable summer popcorn movie.  But don't bring the little ones, too much gore and scariness forthe six and unders. The scene where Neela fails to find the courage to rescue her man, when Nefertirri has just rescued hers, so that doom falls to the selfish and victory to the courageous, well, if that isn't old Stan Lee at his best, then what is? You could just see the panels when Patricia Velasquez chooses poorly!Batman (the 1989 Original) was much more than a comic book movie. Tim Burton took his Magna Opus all the way up toart film.  And the enjoyable Superman-1 was a successful flick but director Donner took the camp route to entertainment. It worked but it was no longer a real comic book film.  AndNight Shamalayan's Unbreakable was also much more than a mere comic book movie.Think of all the failures.  The Batman and Superman sequels. The Conan films.  The 'B' movies with 'B' stars.Here they got it right.  It flows like a comic book, has the action, the characters, the plot, the moral at the end.

What other film has ever given us a scene like that? I dare anyone to name one!I always respected DePalma as a great director.  I always thought Robert Towne was a superior writer. Tom Cruise is a fine movie-star of an actor and Jean Reno and Ving Raymes are superb character actors, no matter how bad the parts they sometimes have to do bring home those Hollywood paychecks.  I like these guys.  Well, old John Voight is hard to like.  Our Past-Midnight Cowboy should have an enriching career as a bad guy as he ages.

Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Epitaph: 'Was Lincoln Right?'
","'Can you fool some of the people all of the time?'The first IMDB comment is illuminating.  This Gazzer-guy is clearly taken in by the name Kubrick and has checked his objectivity at the door on the way in.  I would love to read his comments if Kevin Costner was labelled as the director, just to fool him.How bad is Eyes Wide Shut?  A porn ripoff called 'Thighs Wide Open' is a considerably better film with more to say. Porno's that try (and fail) to put in some sort of socially redeeming material are often quite a hoot. But in 'Thighs', they have a why-don't-we-all-take-off-these- stupid-masks' scene that is just exquisite in it's irony.Yes, take off the stupid masks!  There is a underworld in New York City (and many other cities) of sexual promiscuity and multiple partners and whatever can be imagined but there is certainly NO SEX MAFIA in New York or likely anywhere else. If there's one in London, then why didn't the old stiff place his film there! Why defame New York City?Kubrick lost it before he died. This is not an art film. This is a bad film.  It has nothing to say and none of the characters in the film even begin to approach reality. Approach!Last, I would love to see the sales figures for the film's sound track.  It will likely take the grammy award for best single-note-piano-recital category. I often find myself humming that unforgettable tune in the elevator.Kubrick's real epitaph: 'Died Dumb.

Crazy Heart," My eagerly awaited review of Crazy Heart
","Huh?When does the movie start? The film is formulaic, predictable, pleasant. That's the good news, it won't kill you to sit thru it. Wait for Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter to go see when you're in a mood to end your own life.I don't understand the raves for Jeff Bridges' performance, and I like him, always have. I think that's how he's winning awards for Crazy Heart, people like him. His performance is professional. He does the job. It's not in any way a stand out job of acting, really. He's good, that's it. Maggie Gyllenthal is also OK as his younger lover interest. She looks great from the neck up and Bridges' Bad Blake keeps yapping about how gorgeous she is. But they don't keep the camera away from her skinny body and flat bottom, and frankly, she didn't look that hot to me. They could have cast this part better. The best thing in the film was a big star's unadvertised part as Bad Blake's super successful protégé. It's not a secret if you look it up, like they did with Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, but this guy's performance was the best in the film, so I won't ruin the surprise and name the star here.In the film, they keep raving about how great the song that Bad Blake writes for Maggie is, called (surprise) Crazy Heart. Huh? (again). The song is truly truly ordinary, far less as songs than the ones supposed to be Bad Blake's old hits. In the film, I think they briefly mention some famous-not so famous country song writer/singer who the Bad Blake character is supposed to be based on. I never heard of him before, and likely won't ever again.The cinematography of the Southwest is excellent, breathtaking at times. The film is not. It is being badly overrated by the jackal pack that reviews films nowadays. They sniff out what the consensus is saying, and write accordingly.If you wait for DVD-rental, unless you're a country music fan, you won't make it thru the two hours without falling asleep or hitting pause to go surf the channels.

Do you care about Tom Cruise's personal nightmare? That he looses his face?  His nightmare, not mine.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," The Woodman hits a home run, finally (some mild spoilers)
","Perhaps the oldest working director in films (at least that would seem to be so for a successful stand-up comic WHO STARTED IN THE FIFTIES!) has turned out a beaut. Woody Allen has penned an adult romantic comedy with ten times the laughs (at least for me) of Pineapple Express. Called 'Vicky And Christina Spend the Summer in Barcelona'.The star of the film is none other than the cold killer from No Country For Old Men, Oscar winner Javier Bardem proving his acting range goes way beyond scaring the s-word out of people. He plays a full of life, passionate Spanish painter-lover, and bless him for this. He nails a fine-wine getting hotter as she gets older Penelope Cruz, an equally desirable please-let-me-have-this Scarlett Johansen and a prissy uptight academic Rebecca Hall, who none of you ever heard of before (admit it). Sometimes more than one of them at the same time.The acting is flawless. That's why Penelope and Scarlett stand out from other cinema hotties....they can act, they both have their craft down perfectly. Sadly, none of them go nude in the flick, but guys, there is a scene between Penny and Scarlett that will make you want to stand up and cheer anyway. YAHOOOOOO !!!Woody's script shows two particular brilliancies, that seems to evade the rest of the hacks of Hollywood. He likes to insert his own film personnae into his films, and this time it's the Rebecca Hall character who does the Woodman's comedic pseudo-intellectual schtick. Really smart to switch himself to the woman, cause when he's used younger actors as himself, it becomes imitative parody and fails. And Woody himself it just too old for any make-up genius to make you think he is only 60, an age he passed a long long time ago. Rebecca is remarkable, holding her own against the two stellar screen beauties...and making her far less than super looks come out as still highly desirable.....in controlled passion coming out of it's containment at last.Secondly, Woody brilliantly uses a narrator to make his cinematic novel come alive. The dialogue you would read in a novel comes to life in the faces of this great crew of actors. And instead of adding 30+ minutes of extraneous films to set the scene, or making stupid dialogue just so the audience can be informed of the plot, a simple line or two or concise narration keeps the film moving at a perfect pace. And Woody uses a young actor, not his old self for the narrator, which would have detracted from the youth and exuberance of the film.Also, the musical score and the cinematography are great, simply great. Good job old guy. I loved the film. You made us old guys proud. And err, next time could you let us see Johannsen's goods. I KNOW she's shown you, you can't lie to M2b.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Sauron and the Orks...all they ever do is lose! (spoilers)
","Sauron, the evil eye, looses. He gets stronger. They keep telling us how he gets stronger and stronger and he just keeps losing. Imagine if he had won something? In Fellowship, the Orcs kill one Prince of Gondor. he kills about 50 of them first, but hey, who's keeping score? In Towers, some ronin riders of Rohan come upon an Orc battalion and guess what? Ork Stew! They do pretty well with 10,000 orkies in the battle of Helmskeep or Helmsdeep or whatever, until the newly whitened gray wizard shows up with a few thousand riders (Rohan-ians or Gondor-ians? I cannot remember) and, once again, 10,000 orcs are soon fit for the pot. At the same time, the large Tree-things retake the other tower city with the other white (bad) wizard, wipe out that army, destroy that tower and eliminate the Evil Eye's most loyal bad-white-wizard ally. I'd say at that point, that Sauron is doing very badly. Maybe Bagdad Bob would say he's just getting stronger, because that's exactly what Good-white-wizard says even as her surveys two massive battle victories. Imagine if they had lost? Now, in Rings, the evil eye sends another 10,000 orks against the capital city of Gondor: Minas Gerais. Well, some Minas, if not Gerais. How do they do? Well, okay until Aragon shows up with a new phantom army pledged to fight for the True King. That's 20,000 orks gone in two big battles, and just how many orks did the tree-things kill? Oh, and a GIRL kills his top flying magical warrior. This is not good for Evil Eyes! If I was the evil eye, I'd be worried at this point, wouldn't you? Nope, he's fine. So long as the Ring isn't melting in Mordor, he's just getting stronger. Yessirree. So, we take what's left of the Gondor-Rohan merged cavalry and ride out to the Doors of Doom to 'distract' the last remaining 10,000 orks. I guess Evil felt a 30,000 man ork army was enough to bring back evil to Middle Earth. The schmuck! So's his only fear is a melting ring, he stations ONE killer giant spider to protect the Mordor furnace, and just sends out his last 10,000 orkies into a diversionary battle. Evil personified? Maybe. As dumb as they come? No doubt.",Null,0,0,2 January 2004
