"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," funny and more affecting than I expected
","In Run, Fatboy, Run, Simon Pegg plays a shlub to tries to prove himself to a girl he wronged years before.While the movie was funny from the get go, at first I was skeptical about the whole proving himself angle. Pegg's character comes across as a loser with no redeeming values, and at first I had trouble sympathizing with him. But the movie is smart, slowly allowing you to warm up to Pegg and to begin to root for him, at least a little. The movie doesn't get carried away with itself; if I were to jump from the beginning to the end of the movie, I would think it was absurd, but the film does a good job of building slowly and somewhat unsteadily to its end.It is also very funny. Maybe not as funny as Hot Fuzz, but very funny all the same, and quite likable.",8,1,2,23 June 2012
Ford v Ferrari," Bale is great but the movie is tedious
","I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it's all been done better.The film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari's in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.This is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it's entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie 'Mine is Bigger.' And much of my problem with the movie was I didn't care whose was bigger.The best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It's a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.I am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I'm also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.There are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.Not recommended.",5,1,1,5 May 2020
The Lobster," Weird and unpleasant
","Wow, people love this movie. My girlfriend, a fan of dystopian fiction, had been told she would like this, and was actually very excited about it. I found the premise offputting and thought it would be inherently depressing. So we went into the movie with different expectations, but by the halfway point, we both agreed it wasn't worth continuing.This is a very odd movie. People speak in awkward sentences as though the dialogue was written by someone who specializes in English as a second language instructional audio tapes. The basic premise (single people must quickly become coupled or they will be turned into animals) is never explained, meaning it's not really dystopian fiction but just absurdist drama, and as that it's not that interesting.It's a very unpleasant movie. People do awful things, but no one is horrified; the movie is, perhaps, about how numb people are to the tragedies of the world, but for me, it was just a weird mix of disturbing, detached, and dull.From what I've read, some people find this movie really funny. I found almost nothing about it funny. Or interesting.After we gave up, we did check out the synopsis on wikipedia to find out how it all turned out. That convinced us we'd made the right decision.If you like dark, arty, abstract, emotionally distant satire, you might like this.",4,59,107,30 August 2016
Moneyball," I was just kinda bored
","Sometimes you hear about a movie and you say, well, that doesn't sound at all interesting, but so many people say it's great that you watch it anyways. That's what happened in the case of Moneyball, a movie that combines two things I have little interest in: sports and statistics.Unfortunately, while my instincts aren't always right, in this case they were dead on. While there are interesting moments in the movie, like Billy Beane doing some fancy horse trading, I just never connected with this movie. Brad Pitt was rather bland and even though the script was co-written by Aaron Sorkin, I found the dialog flat. The story is interesting, but it seems to move so slowly; I think I would have been better off reading the book.Sometimes a movie can be riveting even though its subject matter is unappealing, but this isn't one of those movies. If you love baseball and statistics then this movie may be great, but I could have done without it.",5,4,7,24 May 2012
The Avengers," I was expecting more
","Based on the hype, I expected The Avengers to be one of those classic comic book movies that leave you breathless and amazed. Helmed by Joss Whedon, lead up to by several other comic book movies, I really thought this would be amazing.But it's not amazing, it's good. It's about Iron Man good, which puts it a notch above Thor, a notch below Captain America, and several notches above Iron Man II and the Incredible Hulk.There's just not a lot to it. Captain America was a good movie because it delved into the character, but here the movie rarely goes deeper than the occasional witticism. The only character theme is some squabbling, but this comes across as kids on a playground (although it is entertaining to see the movie play the 'what superhero could beat what superhero game'), and resolves itself perfunctorily. This is not what I expect from Joss Whedon; it's what I would have expected from Whedon directly after he made the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie.This is not to say that the movie is not enjoyable. It does have some cool special effects here and there and it moves along at a quick pace. The performances are generally good; I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's laid-back Hulk. It's got some very cute moments sprinkled in, although they feel a little lost among the endless battles.It's a good movie, and if you want a fun popcorn flick this would be a good choice, but it's not a classic.",7,4,9,11 September 2012
Blade Runner 2049," everything Blade Runner did right, done wrong
","Imagine Blade Runner without a strong directorial vision, and interesting story, or engaging characters. If you find that impossible to imagine, just watch the forgettable sci-fi flick Blade Runner 2049.Instead of the distinct '40s-noir of the original, 2049 offers scale without purpose and a dusty color palette. Instead of riveting, distinct, excellently-acted characters, you've got sturdy but unforgettable people. Blade Runner was full of amazing moments and places, such as the room of living toys and Rutger Hauer's every word, but 2049 has nothing but a bland lead and a bunch of characters whose motives can't be looked at too closely.Scenes come not out of the story but out of a desire to have something happened, resulting in pointless interactions like the tormenting of a naked replicant. There aren't so much huge plot holes as poor motivations and small inconsistencies that make everything in the movie feel false.If you don't compare this to Blade Runner, it's a mediocre but almost-watchable movie with the occasional interesting idea (the talking, naked ad, the memory designer's creation of a birthday party), but as a sequel to a classic, this movie is a travesty.And how is it that a futuristic L.A. heavily influenced by Japanese culture has no Asians in the entire city? It's as though there's no detail so big or small that the filmmakers won't ignore it.",4,7,11,29 August 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," more successful than volume 1
","I had been fairly underwhelmed by Kill Bill Volume 1, which I thought was entertaining but shallow and rather pointless. But I still watched Volume 2, because I had only watched Volume 1 because I thought the trailer for Volume 2 looked good, and Volume 1 came to cable first.Since these movies apparently are really just two halves of one long movie, it is surprising that the second one feels somewhat more mature. Yes, it still has juvenile things in it that only an arrested 17-year-old would put in, like Pai Mei's playing with his mustache in that ridiculous way, but overall it feels meatier. It is also less gory, which is surprising.Much of the sense of maturity is due to David Carradine's first rate performance as Bill. It is tempting to say Bill has an undercurrent of menace, but the interesting thing is he virtually doesn't. Carradine is calm and quite likable and the sense of menace comes entirely from our knowledge of how dangerous he is. His thoughtful character makes the entire movie feel more thoughtful, although this isn't to say that it isn't usually still silly and over-the-top. There's also an excellent bit by Darryl Hannah.The question is, if you played these two as one movie, would I rate it an 8 star movie, like volume 2 or 7 star movie like 1? I can't really decide. Much of the problem with the first one is the hollow feeling one is left with at the end, so the second half could well elevate the whole movie. On the other hand, I don't if I could sit through a 4-hour Kill Bill. It is entertaining, but it is still very much a one-note movie.",8,0,1,20 March 2005
Vertigo," too long, too slow, but worth watching
","I'm not quite sure what I thought of Vertigo when I first saw it, which was a long time ago, but I recall being underwhelmed. Since it's generally considered one of Hitchcock's major works I decided I'd give it another chance.It is an odd duck.This is a prime example of Hitchcock confusing the audience by having charming, likable actors play awful people. Stewart's character is not a good guy at all, but Stewart essentially plays him as one. I could write a long list of the character's moral lapses, but Stewart doesn't play the character as a bad guy. It's an interesting approach.One thing I recall clearly from the first time I saw this movie is I thought it was very slow, and that was not a trick of the memory. Call it deliberately paced if you like, but this movie really takes its time. There is very little dialog and quite a lot of the camera watching Stewart staring at Novak.One of the oddities of the movie is that the intriguing central mystery is explained two-thirds of the way through. And yet, the film is at its most interesting in that final third. At this point the movie is simply a sad, disturbing character study powered by Novak's vulnerability.Vertigo is a very interesting movie. I imagine you could write a very long analysis of it - how its structured and character motivation and all that. But its entertainment value is iffier. Outside of Barbara Bel Geddes, whose sharp, subtle performance makes the film far more entertaining than it would otherwise be, the movie can feel a bit too vague and wandering.",7,2,4,3 July 2009
Black Swan," brilliant, intense movie that seems to encourage incredibly pretentious reviews here
","At the end of this movie I was about to turn to my girlfriend and say 'that was intense' when she turned to me and said 'that was intense.' The movie, and especially the last, absolutely stunning sequence, is incredibly intense. Natalie Portman as a driven perfectionist is amazing, giving a performance more about nervous, tense looks and bottled up emotions than about dialogue. Barbara Hershey is also incredible as her mother, ostensibly supportive but suffused with terrifying jealousy.The movie puts the viewer squarely in Portman's mind, and we have as much trouble as she does in understanding what is really happening and what is her vivid imagination.I think this movie has a lot in common with Roman Polanski's Repulsion, although I saw the latter so long ago that I can't say more about it than that, except that if you like one I'd recommend watching the other as well.I note an unusually large number of IMDb user reviews having a very pretentious tone to them. I understand why. At the end of the movie, I felt like I should have a lot to say about it, because it was such an intense experience, but I actually don't. And the reviews I've read here seem to be written by people who want to say something profound about the movie but instead just say kind of silly things. I think this movie is such a visceral experience that it is very difficult to talk about, but it is well worth watching.",9,4,7,7 March 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," just plain magical
","After Spirited Away I was very anxious to see Miyazaki's new movie, and I was not disappointed. Once again he has made a magical, lyrical work of art and entertainment. This movie makes me think of the Wizard of Oz, not for the story but just for the way in which everything is touched by magic. Everything is created by magic or cursed by magic so you just have to call the film magical. Characters are well drawn and the movie is very funny but with a thoughtful, melancholy quality that comes out now and again.Unfortunately, Miyazaki was little sloppy in terms of story. At the end of the movie, neither I nor my girlfriend understood what it was that happened to howl or what Madam Suliman's agenda was. The rumors about Howl are mentioned then dropped and there's a plot development at the end for which no groundwork has been laid at all.But Howl's Moving Castle is ultimately so engaging and directed with such assuredness that one can forgive its flaws.",8,1,2,19 July 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Dull Retread
","I liked Guy Ritchie's first Sherlock Holmes movie, even though it had so little to do with Sherlock Holmes that one suspects the writer learned everything about the original from half-listening to a friend describe a story he'd read 20 years ago. But if you took it as a movie about characters that just happen to have names like Holmes and Watson but are otherwise their own thing, it was pretty decent.That cannot, alas, be said for the sequel, which is just plain dull. The movie lacks, for the most part, the intriguing flirtation between Holmes and Irene Adler, instead bringing in some strikingly bland characters to populate its muddled story. The direction seems unnecessarily gimmicky even compared to other Ritchie films, and while I wouldn't describe the movie as a *huge* waste of two hours, it is certainly two hours I could have spent in a better fashion.",5,5,8,1 May 2012
Gremlins," Great Gremlins make an otherwise forgettable movie fun
","I just watched Gremlins for the first time in maybe 20 years, and while that's admittedly a long time, I'm still surprised by how much I didn't remember. Which is everything except the Gremlins.Didn't remember the main star was a teen boy, or that there was a nasty rich lady, or Phoebe Cates, but I sure remember those Gremlins.The movie patterns itself after 50s horror movies, with a pleasant small town overwhelmed by one or more monsters. And like most of those movies, the characters in that small town are bland and generic, with only Hoyt Axton seeming like a character you'd actually want to know better.So at first the movie is pretty much a watchable, vaguely comedic movie about some kid who works in a bank and gets a weird pet. But once things get crazy, the movie becomes a twisted horror-comedy that is terrific fun.This movie is very much one of those film-buff-boy films of the eighties. The movie is constantly referencing other movies, both specifically, as when someone is watching Invasion of the Body Snatchers on TV, and implicitly, as with the doesn't-she-seem-like- Margaret-Hamilton-in-the-Wizard-of-Oz character. This is perhaps why it's a bit more of a horror parody than an actual horror movie - more funny than scary.Anyway, it's not the world's greatest movie, but it is an 80s classic of sorts, and a good Christmas movie if you want something a bit non- traditional.",7,6,8,10 December 2016
The Incredible Hulk," At least it's not as bad as the Ang Lee version
","With only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in Bruce Banner, the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development, The Incredible Hulk really only has its special effects going for it. And while those are decent, a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie.Ed Norton doesn't really do much with the role. Yes, I know Ed Norton is a brilliant actor prone to giving amazing performances, but he just doesn't do that here; Mark Rufallo's laconic Bruce Banner in the Avengers is far more interesting than Norton's here.Frankly, I was just bored. Not so bored that I stopped watching, but consistently restless and never drawn in.",5,22,31,12 September 2012
Mission: Impossible III," noisy
","I haven't been interested in the Mission Impossible movies since I saw the first one, which traded in the wonderful con jobs of the original TV series for mindless action. But when I saw that J.J. Abrams had directed this one, I thought perhaps he had added something interesting to the mix. He hadn't.The film begins with a fairly intense scene with Cruise tied up watching the bad guy threaten to kill a woman. It's a well done scene that hopes to keep you interested once the movie flashes back.Then we see happy Cruise at a party getting sucked into the field after having left it. None of this is interesting or surprising, but after all, it's just setup up for what comes next.What comes next is guns and explosions, an air battle cleverly set on a wind farm, and an unfortunate outcome. Then there's Cruise getting yelled out for that outcome.And about a half hour into the film I said, I don't care. I like movies where people shoot guns and blow up stuff, but I need to care about something. I need to like the characters. I need to be interested in the story. I need to be engaged by the dialog. In MI3 I felt I was just being assaulted by unpleasant violence and then assaulted by tedious exposition and dreary romance before the next blow up.While I hoped Abrams would do something interested, what I saw of this movie is completely by the numbers, even including not one but two damsel-in-distress scenarios in the first quarter. I like a lot of big Hollywood blockbusters, but this movie is everything those who hate such movies complain about, a big, macho, noisy time waster. It will take someone more impressive than Abrams to lure me to anything else in this series, so unless Scorcese decides to take a stab at it, this will be my second, and last, MI film.",Null,0,2,20 August 2013
Requiem for a Dream," riveting, harrowing (spoiler at bottom)
","I've developed the habit of recording movies and watching them in bits, half an hour to wake me up in the morning, 20 minutes while I have lunch, but once I started watching this one there was no way I could stop in the middle.  Visually hyperkenetic and endlessly engrossing, with a typically brilliant performance by Ellen Burstyn, you can't stop watching, although as the movie gets darker and more difficult to watch you kind of want to.
This is one of those movies that speak of the dangers of drugs not from the outside, like those lame public service ads, but from the inside; you see both what fun they're having and how horribly wrong it can go.  The movie feels real and honest, but I did have a problem with something near the end:************* SPOILER *************The idea that a man would come into an emergency room with an arm that was clearly gangrenous and the doctor would have him arrested without treating him is utterly absurd.  That's just straight-out malpractice.********** END SPOILER ************",8,0,1,8 April 2004
Your Name.," Utterly amazing
","Makoto Shinkai is a director who I've always found intriguing. Even when I didn't care for his works I always felt there was a unique vision there, but it wasn't until 2013's Garden of Words that I felt he had truly been able to satisfactorily express that vision.Your Name, though, is the movie it was all leading up to. Once again Shinkai is concerned with distance and connection. Here, two young people keep switching bodies and living bits of one another's lives. Much of the first half of the film is a light comedy about the wackiness of such a life, but the story deepens and the movie becomes wonderfully suspenseful and touching.At this point, Shinkai has complete control of his craft. Visually the movie is utterly stunning, with absolutely breathtaking moments. The story draws you in slowly and believably. The characters are engaging, the pacing perfect, every moment just what it should be.Watch it.",10,0,2,3 October 2019
Sucker Punch," Wants to be clever but doesn't know how
","In spite of the bad reviews, the trailer made me think this would, at the least, have some fun action scenes that would make it worthwhile. It was a reasonable theory, yet by the halfway point I was completely bored.The premise seems clever. After a miserably grim sequence in which a young girl undergoes trauma and is unjustly institutionalized and slated for a terrible fate, she re-imagines her plight as a girl kidnapped to a brothel, and then, from the brothel, re-imagines her life as an action movie involving swords and guns, blimps, and a lot of gymnastic jumping.But there doesn't seem to be anything behind that cleverness, at least in the first half, which was all I watched. The three different realities have a few connectors - items and people - but they don't seem to have any narrative purpose. It's as though the writers saw Intercept and thought all they needed was to strew some intersecting plot elements about and they'd get the same thing. Having read the wikipedia plot summary, I'm glad I didn't finish this one, as the end strikes me as both unsatisfactory and another example of an idea unmoored from real purpose beyond trying to do something cool.That's what this movie is - a trying to do something cool. And yes, there are cool things, like steampunk soldiers that bleed steam and hot action girls in skimpy clothes. But any fun that might suggest is counteracted by a relentless, murky sourness that pervades the film. It feels as though the director was afraid people might enjoy this too much to appreciate its depth, but since it has no depth, that was a mistake. This is rather typical of Zack Snyder, who seems to be torn between a desire to make something pretentiously arty and a desire to make something full of popcorn action. Sometimes, as in Man of Steel, he balances the two, but sometimes, as in Sucker Punch or Batman vs. Superman, he creates films at war with themselves.",4,1,7,12 October 2016
Skyfall," disappointing and ridiculously plotted
","I really enjoyed the Bond reboot Casino Royale, and while it was less appreciated, my vague recollection is that I generally liked the follow up, but I was hugely disappointed with this film.There are a few good things. Javier Bardem does a great job as an unstable bad guy. Bond's flirtation with a fellow agent is kind of cute. The action scenes are pretty good; not mind blowing, but generally entertaining.Unfortunately, I was constantly frustrated by the plot, in which neither Bond nor anyone else (except the bad guy) ever does anything that makes the slightest bit of sense. The movie is just stupid, and the good in it never balanced the idiocy. I am actually amazed that a movie with such a terrible, terrible structure has gotten such rave reviews. For just some of the problems with the plot, read on:************** SPOILERS BELOW *****************First off, Bond twice waits until someone has died before fighting, even though in both cases his subsequent actions indicate he could have prevented the death. First, he calmly watches an assassination before attacking and killing the assassin. Even worse, he lets a woman he promised to help die (I knew she would from the moment he offered her help - I've seen Bond films before) and then takes out a bunch of bad guys even though nothing changes that makes it easier to take them out than when she was still alive.Then there's the moment when a supposed computer genius good guy (Q) hacks into the computer of the computer genius bad guy and takes zero precautions. He simply hooks the computer directly into the MI6 system. Who would do that who wasn't an idiot? The whole reason there are sandbox applications for running suspect software is because anyone who knows anything about computers knows you have to protect your system from threats.And when the bad guy escapes from a complex bristling with agents, how many people chase after him? One. Just Bond, by himself. No one tries to cover other exits, or chase at him from different directions. He really wouldn't have been that difficult to catch for any organization working together.The go-it-alone motif comes back at the end, where Bond lures the villain and his army to a remote location to take them out single- handedly. Why? Why not lure them into a trap made up of trained snipers. They're surrounded by flat land, it would actually be a pretty easy area to defend. I get angry all over again just writing all this down. There is no excuse for this much stupidity in one movie.",5,7,14,2 March 2014
50 First Dates," Pretty good, all in all
","In spite of some bad reviews I decided to watch this because I thought it would be more like Sandler's one good movie, The Wedding Singer, and my instincts were right. This does have much of the same tone as that movie, although it's marred by some of the cartooniness that makes most Sandler movies intolerable.I like the premise, which falls somewhere between Groundhog's Day and Clean Slate, as Sandler has to make a girl with short term memory loss re-fall in love with him every day. While I find it hard to accept Sandler as a lady's man (I also find it hard to accept him as a phenomenally successful actor, so I guess I'm out of sync with the American public), he and Barrymore have a good chemistry that makes it work.What keeps this film from working as well as Wedding Singer is the aforementioned cartooniness, represented by Ula, who seems to fall into the category of, 'if someone's really ugly and has a weird accent then they should be ridiculed' and pathetic bodybuilder Doug. These characters feel completely out of place amidst the movie's low-key charm, as though they wandered in from one of Sandler's low comedies.There is something generally unfocused about the movie. It can also be seen in an odd throwaway shot of the auto accent, which adds absolutely nothing to the movie, like the character of Ula. Wedding Singer had a very definite vision of what it was going for and Dates suffers from a lack of that vision. But it is moderately amusing and rather sweet, so all in all it's a good movie. 7/10",7,0,0,2 January 2005
The Hangover," Funnier than I expected
","I had only the vaguest impression of this movie when it came out. It was something about guys, and drinking, and hijinks, and whatever, or something. I thought it would be dumb and obnoxious. But after they made a couple of sequels I looked it up and saw that it had actually been well-received and was supposed to be quite funny. So I watched it.The movie is something about guys and drinking, it is pretty dumb, and it is very funny. The idea of a group of guys waking up after a night of boozing with no memory of what happened and having to retrace their steps is done well, following a certain logic for all its craziness. The performances are quite good, and in spite of its mix of booze, drugs, prostitutes, boxes, tigers, chickens, and tasers, there's actually something kind of sweet about this story, although I'm not quite sure why.Anyway, it's funny, watch it.",8,1,2,7 February 2014
The Ring," spooky, beautifully done
","Very effective movie, scary but not gross (I'm always afraid that a horror movie will have blood and guts, and always pleased if it gets its scares more honestly).  Stylish with lots of atmosphere, and did a good job of making sense, as I was expecting it to fall apart at the end as so many horror movies do.  Beautifully done from beginning to end.",8,0,1,28 October 2003
Deja Vu," entertaining but increasingly dumb
","There's a clever premise in Deja Vu but it's not really cleverly executed. Some things make sense, some don't. The chase scene, in which Denzel races down the road after a car that raced down the road 4 days ago, is really ingenious. But the movie gets shakier as it goes along. I can't help but think it would have been more interesting if Denzel had not been able to go back in time but had been able to ingeniously effect the time line as he tried to do with the note. But that's a more cerebral approach and this is not a cerebral movie.The little ending thing where it's implied they have some sort of connection is a perfect example of breaking the sci-fi premise. It's understandable that they would want to do that, but it doesn't make sense.The thing that actually bothered me the most was the way Denzel kept going on about saving the woman. I mean, 500 people were dead, but he never says, 'I have to go back in time to save all those people,' he just says, 'what about the girl.' For him, saving the rest of them is apparently just an afterthought.It's a generally entertaining movie, but there's just too much dumb in it to leave me satisfied.",6,0,1,26 February 2008
It," exciting although surprisingly un-scary
","Like the miniseries Stranger Things, It hearkens back to 80s filmmaking, falling somewhere between Stand By Me and Poltergeist. While ostensibly a horror movie, in spirit it is more a coming-of-age drama with a monster.The movie is not particularly scary, even by Poltergeist standards, but it is quite exciting, particularly in the final, thrilling confrontation. The movie also does a lovely job of reminding us that not all evil dwells in the sewer, with some of the most disturbing scenes being purely human; I was ultimately more scared of Bev's father than of Pennywise.The kid's are all excellent. I like how little they fit to typical stereotypes; the stuttering kid is the brave one, the kid with glasses is a sex hound rather than a nerd, and the chubby kid is a scholar.I don't have strong feelings about Pennywise. He is probably most effective in that first disturbing scene, but unfortunately I had already seen the SNL/Kellyanne Conway parody of that scene which was so dead-on that it impacted how seriously I could take the movie Pennywise (it's not the movie's fault, of course, that Kate MacKinnon captured the role so well). The actor doesn't have as strong a personality as Tim Curry did in the previous version of It, and ultimately seems like more a vehicle for evil rather than a distinct character.",8,1,1,29 August 2019
Casablanca," Amazing directing, script, acting
","It's been a few years since I last watched Casablanca, but it is as good as I remember. Curtiz's direction is remarkable. The beginning scenes set the movie up beautifully, and everything moves at an almost breathless pace. It is a movie that moves fast yet never exhausts, always able to slow down for a moment and let the audience breath. The script is one of the most quotable in Hollywood history, full of memorable lines and sharp, witty dialog. The plot is engaging, constantly moving and turning.The acting is uniformly excellent. Bogart is the center of the movie, offering that classic jaded white knight Bogie. Bergman gives one of her best performances as well. Even small roles are beautifully done; Peter Lorre makes every second of his time on screen count. As for Claude Raines, he is so utterly perfect that he would have stolen the movie entirely if he hadn't been up against Bogie.All that being said, I love some parts of Casablanca more than others. The early scenes are incredible, the finale is genius, but the Paris scenes, while necessary, feel a little slack, and Paul Henreid is a little bland for a charismatic resistance fighter. But those are minor quibbles. This is still one of the greatest movies of a great decade for movies.",10,2,3,19 November 2013
Finding Neverland," yeah, it's manipulative and contrived, but I really liked it (spoilers in second half)
","Movies all have flaws, and we all find some flaws acceptable in some circumstances. While it is very easy to pick apart Finding Neverland for its sentimentality and it's incredibly contrived structure, I found it quite touching. Performances were good and it had many lovely moments such as the living room performance of Peter Pan. I don't mind being manipulated as long as I enjoy myself./*********************** begin spoilers ************************/ That being said, this movie has a very typically Hollywood approach and is full of utterly ridiculous things that are far too pat to have actually happened as they do in the movie. Am I really expected to believe that Barried told his producer to leave some seats open and snuck in children without telling his producer what he was going to do? What sense would that make? And how likely is it that Sylvia would have this major attack on the very night of Peter Pan's opening. Isn't that just a little too convenient? It neatens the drama and heightens the effect, but it is also inherently false./************************ end spoilers *************************/ For all it's faults, I thought this movie was lovely and enjoyable. But I admit that it is utter nonsense.",8,0,1,19 March 2005
In Bruges," interesting, but feels more like an intellectual exercise than a story
","Do really awful people have a strict moral code and deep conscience? I'm going to guess no, but In Bruges suggests writer/director Martin McDonagh might disagree.In Bruges begins with two guys checking into a hotel in Bruges. They have come to wait an unspecified amount of time to speak to someone. They go sightseeing. One man loves Bruges, the other finds it tedious.This is maybe the first third of the movie, which is sometimes amusing but doesn't give you much to hold onto. Then a flurry of things happen and an elaborate, ingenious story kicks in. And that part involves terrible people being shockingly full of scruples.The film is very well acted and generally amusing with some dark and occasionally suspenseful moments, yet I was never fully drawn in. The ingenuity of the story and moral code of the protagonists felt like dramatic devices rather than something that comes from real life experience. A false clever plot and unlikely characters is not inherently unworkable, and I think the problem is less the script than that McDonagh can't quite figure out how to flesh that script with human complexity (something he successfully did in 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.')I enjoyed this well enough, but I wouldn't say it's something you should seek out.",7,0,1,4 August 2018
Gravity," Visually arresting sci-fi suspense with great 3D visuals
","When I saw Avatar in 3D, I thought, this 3D adds nothing to the movie at all. Since then I've avoided the more-expensive 3D films, but I wound up watching Gravity in 3D, and I have to admit that I find it difficult to imagine how it would be without it. Directed by Cuaron, this is an artist really thinking through the technology rather than simply tossing out cool effects. The opening space walk scene is amazing not because a bunch of things fly at the camera, but because you just have this amazing sense of floating in 3D space.The movie is stunningly filmed, and its suspenseful story of survival is consistently engrossing and well paced. It is so well written and filmed that it is probably quite good even in 2D, but if any movie makes the case for 3D as a tool for serious film making, it is this one.",9,1,3,5 January 2014
The Death of Stalin," funny, engaging, and very dark
","This dark comedy follows the devious machinations of various communist leaders after Stalin has a heart attack. This is political humor with bullets, as the plotting goes on amidst a backdrop of torture, assassination, and mass arrests.The cast is excellent, particularly Simon Russell Beale as a Dick-Cheney-like monster and Andrea Riseborough and Rupert Friend as Stalin's sharp-witted daughter and hilariously bonkers son. The series paints a portrait of a strange world where people are in awe of and terrified by Stalin; even people he unjustly arrested and tortured seem genuinely enamored of him. It's weird, but there's apparently an element of truth to it, perhaps because Russians so loved their revolution that they couldn't hate the part of Stalin they associated with it.But the series clearly isn't interested in historical accuracy. When I saw the 'historical accuracy' section in the wikipedia entry for this film I was surprised to think there was any at all (there's a *little*, although some Russian scholars seem to really hate the movie).Highly recommended.",8,0,4,20 June 2018
As Good as It Gets," Likable movie about an unlikable guy
","This is a very interesting movie in that it immediately establishes Jack Nicholson as a terrible person and then spends the rest of the movie trying to convince you he's better than you'd think. Nicholson is up to the challenge, being monstrous in the beginning and then slowly softening, but never flattening out, the rough edges. Hunt is equally excellent with his very convincing portrayal of a Brooklyn waitress, catching the spirit of someone leading a very ordinary life. Like most James L. Brooks movies, this one is quite amusing. It's also rather touching, so much so that I was willing to forgive it for its utter unlikeliness.",8,0,0,29 June 2013
Train to Busan," Beautifully done thrill ride
","After telling my girlfriend that Train to Busan was an amazing movie, I found I couldn't quite tell her why. It doesn't really have any of those moments you talk about after or anything; it's a movie that's simply really engrossing and exciting on a minute-by-minute basis rather than one with amazing set pieces.It starts slowly, setting up a bunch of characters in a way that reminds me of 70s disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure. A neglectful father and his young daughter, a couple of middle-aged ladies, a bunch of school kids, all taking a train trip. Then there's a sick passenger who comes back from the dead and suddenly a zombie virus is tearing through the train like wildfire.Trapped on a moving train, and seeing the outside world is also in the grip of zombies, a shrinking set of passengers fights for survival, beset by zombies as well as the worst of human nature.The movie is beautifully structured. There is a lovely compactness to the way characters are introduced; you quickly have a sense of who they are and become invested. The pace is fast and disasters come on on another like dominoes.It's not too gory, which is how I like my horror. It's really closer to something like The Birds or Jurassic Park, and is as much action and suspense as horror. You should watch it.",9,2,4,24 April 2019
Darkest Hour," A rather stodgy bit of history
","Darkest Hour makes me think of 2012's Lincoln, in that it appears aimed more at schoolchildren looking to learn history than in moviegoers looking to be moved and entertained. Gary Oldman is quite good as a Churchill. Rather than the sharp, sure, rather loud Churchill one often sees, Oldman offers a man torn between his beliefs and the possibility that he's about to make a horrible mistake.Apparently the movie does take some liberties with the historical facts, and unfortunately the movie seems to find it easier to make the false stuff, like a conspiracy to take Churchill down or an engaging subway ride, more entertaining than the real stuff.I'm torn between giving this a 6 and a 7. It's pretty decent, and Oldman is quite good, but it feels overall rather slight.",6,1,6,6 April 2018
Underworld," wants to be great, settles for mediocre
","With its leather-wearing heroine and eternal, blue-filtered night, it's obvious that Underwold is desperate to be cool. Sadly, desperate and cool never go together. Cool movies are those where the director wants to say something in an interesting way, and is enamored of a certain slick style. It's not that cool movies aren't consciously cool, but that they are interested in more than just being cool. In the Matrix the directors were desperate to be profound and say something about the human condition, whereas Tarentino's films are informed by his desire to keep himself amused. Not that I'm a fan of Tarentino by any means, but in his glib way he does have a sense of cool.But Underworld is just an empty vehicle for slick posturing. It's not just that the movie has nothing profound to say (The Matrix only wanted to be profound, it didn't actually succeed), it's that the movie has nothing to say at all. It exists entirely as a vehicle for the lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale to posture and snarl some forgettable dialog. Even the film's somewhat interesting revelation in the last quarter feels not like a result of deep conviction but simply like something clever the script could toss in.While the movie is weak in almost everything, it has a workmanlike competence that keeps it watchable. You never connect with the characters, you are never enthralled by the story and the fight scenes aren't especially good, but nothing is really bad enough to stop watching, and the movie is a perfectly acceptable way to kill a couple of hours.But what it is not is cool.",5,2,5,30 June 2005
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Dour
","A lot of my facebook friends were declaring this the best movie in the Star Wars series, so I was surprised when I saw on metacritic that critical reviews were mixed. But now I understand. Even the reviews of my girlfriend and myself were mixed; while she really liked this film, it left me cold.Rogue One is a surprisingly dour movie for a series that usually embraces a fun aesthetic. The empire and rebel leaders are almost equally unlikable, and the story is a grim slog.While my girlfriend spent the movie planning her Jyn Halloween costume, I found the character fairly bland; far less interesting than Force Awakens Rey or the original's Leia (or even, for that matter, Phantom Menace's princess). I cared for the rebel soldier in charge of the mission even less.The best characters were easily the blind Chirrut and K-2SO. These two characters had the humor and heart I expect from Star Wars characters.The basic idea of building a movie around something briefly mentioned in the original movie is a good one, and the story is pretty solid. But I never felt invested in the characters and little of the action actually excited me.I don't understand anyone who claims this is the best movie in the series. Even my girlfriend wouldn't go that far. For me it was a huge disappointment.",6,2,6,13 January 2017
Captain Marvel," Somewhat bland
","Since I knew there was a contingent of rabid fanboys downvoting this movie for having the temerity to have a female lead, I assumed the movie would be better than its average rating. Alas, Captain Marvel can best be described as an adequate superhero movie that can't match the best examples of the genre although it happily doesn't come near to being the worst.The movie stars Brie Larsen as Vers, a super-soldier on another planet who comes to earth while fighting her civilizations enemies. Set in the 80s or 90s, She meets a young Nick Fury (it's amazing how films can chop 20 years off a character's age with such ease) and runs around while having flashbacks that make it seem she had a prior life as an earthling.Larsen's heroine comes across as pleasant but unexceptional, and her pretty blondness makes her seem more like someone you would cast as a brokenhearted secretary who finds love on a vacation to Italy than as a tough action hero. At first I blamed Larsen (who I see won an Oscar a while back), but then I realized that I also found Jude Law and, most shockingly, Samuel L. Jackson, to be similarly humdrum. Which makes me think the problem is the writer and director, who simply failed to bring the characters to life.Still, the pace is pretty good, there's some good action and nice touches of humor, and it (mildly) pushes all the action picture buttons. The most entertaining part of the movie is the last, effects-driven section, even though one could reasonably object to the movie on over-powered superhero grounds.It's not trash, like Batman vs. Superman, and it's terrific, like Captain America: Civil War. It's a solid but lesser entry in the Marvel cinematic universe, and if you're in the mood for a superhero movie this is a reasonable choice.",7,0,5,24 June 2019
This Is the End," Amusing bit of fluff
","The premise of this movie is terrific: Celebrities play themselves in a comedy about the end of the world. It's fun to see celebrities mock themselves, particularly a coked up Michael Cera, and much of the charm of the first scenes is simply seeing actors play with the concept.I enjoyed the movie, but I can't say I loved it. It's funny, but it's not hilarious, and while the bits build and there is a sort of story, it's not fully developed because it's essentially a vehicle for the humor. Also, the frat boy humor just wears thin. This movie is inordinately fond of jokes involving bodily excretions and genitalia, and what can be outrageous and edge in the first ten minutes can feel like a dead horse as the second hour commences. It's nothing anyone really needs to watch, but it's a fairly enjoyable way to kill a couple of hours.",7,2,7,13 August 2014
World War Z," Exciting thrill ride
","Even though I feel zombies are overdone, I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps because it's more an action film than a horror movie. This is not a Romero-style horror movie, and those looking for that will be disappointed (as can be seen in some of the reviews here). Zombies do not shamble, but rather run pell-mell at anything that moves. They are terrifying in their heedless determination, stampeding down a street or flinging themselves off a roof in an attempt to reach a helicopter.The story is minimal, and is essentially just a delivery system for a series of elaborate set pieces, but the scenes of chaotic violence are utterly compelling, and what story there is is effective, as is a good, low key performance from Brad Pitt.If you're looking for a horror movie full of gore and dark passageways, this may not be the zombie movie for you, but if you want something truly thrilling (far more so than the overrated 28 Days Later) then this is an excellent choice.Also, if you're looking for an adaptation of the World War Z book, this isn't it; a real adaptation would be more like a Ken Burns documentary. While both the book and movie are incredibly entertaining, they are so radically different that comparing them doesn't even make sense.",9,2,3,18 February 2014
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Amusing comedy from Apatow-works
","Yet another Apatow produced movie about a schlub who is inexplicably able to attract women way too hot for him. (These movies always make me wonder about the lives of screenwriters; does the access to Hollywood starlets convince them that getting women is easy, or if they are simply writing the world they want.) And like most of the movies from the Apatow factory, this one is pretty funny.The plot is very simple, with a guy getting dumped, brooding then going on vacation where he has the misfortune to run into his ex. There is the predictable new love interest, the funny new beau of the ex, and the usual confusion displayed by people who were once in love.While the movie doesn't exactly explore new territory, it is quite funny. There are many amusing offbeat characters and silly gags. But what makes this work is that the movie genuinely cares about its characters, and even shows a little interest in their emotional underpinnings.It's still pure guy wish-fulfillment, and total nonsense, but it is also funny and likable. Just a warning to schlubs everywhere: you're not going to have this life.",7,0,2,15 October 2011
The Hunger Games," grim but absorbing
","I was hesitant to watch this movie because the premise - children being forced to compete to the death - seemed so unpleasant. It is unpleasant, and grim, but it's also fast moving and kept me interested throughout.Ultimately, though, I feel this movie didn't quite commit to anything. It's an action movie with some pretty good action scenes, but the dour concept keeps it from being a fun popcorn-style action movie. At the same time, the movie didn't really embrace the moral darkness of the tale; the lead character is put in a situation where there would seem to be no possibility of not doing monstrous things, but then she manages to go through the whole movie being flawlessly pure and noble, with any problematic moral choices neatly swept out of her way.It's a good movie, and I enjoyed it, for the most part, but honestly I feel I would have been better served to have followed my instincts and skipped it.",7,1,5,9 June 2013
Zootopia," Strong story and characters create something special
","I'll admit that a spunky hero pursuing her dreams in spite of the odds is pretty much half of the cartoons out there. And yet, this one seemed to do more with the story. I was engaged by Judy's seemingly ridiculous determination to overcome prejudice and biology to follow her dream. Using a world of animals to call out racism and suspicion of 'the other' was ingenious and well handled. And the central mystery was genuinely intriguing. Often spunky heroines and clue solving feel like simply a hanger off of which to hang the jokes, but it feels like more than that here.And the same time, the movie does have those jokes and clever concepts. There is in particularly a fabulous use of scale involved in a world in which giant giraffes and elephants life in the same city as mice, with different neighborhoods built for their occupants.I found this movie funny, touching, and intelligent, and yet there is also something rather slight about it. There is something about this movie that makes me somewhat articulate. I can't quite explain why I was more affected by the story than that of dozens of other overcoming-the-odds movies, and I also can't quite explain what subtle something was missing that prevents me from giving it a higher score (I was torn between 8 & 9). But it's a terrific movie.",8,1,5,8 September 2016
Shaun of the Dead," brilliant comedy, but a bit too zombieish for me
","Shaun of the Dead is an interesting creature. A movie as clever as it's title, the best part of this stylishly filmed movie is it's sly first half hour, in which the film makers taunt the audience with a series of goofy take-offs on standard zombie film making. The movie takes its time to get to the Zombies, starting by involving you in the lives of the characters, but while this was the flaw in The Birds and Jurasic Park, it works great here because the non-zombie scenes are lots of fun.The movie slides from relationship/buddy comedy to horror movie as it goes along. It's a nicely done slide that takes you deeper into the more suspenseful part of the movie without being jarring and it never loses its sense of humor, but one scene was way too gory for me (if one scene were toned down I would probably give this an 8) and the attempts at drama tended to be flat. But while I wouldn't call it a perfect movie, it was a movie of perfect moments, and well worth watching if you can deal with a little gore (very little by the standards of the Zombie genre, but a fair amount by the standards of the buddy picture.)",7,1,3,30 July 2005
Argo," tremendously entertaining Hollywood nonsense
","While based on a true story, perusing wikipedia revealed that pretty much every time you see something in this movie and think, 'that can't be true,' it's not. And you will constantly be thinking, 'that can't be true.' But while it's not much of a historical document, often, in Hollywood fashion, altering the truth even when the truth was interesting, on its own terms as a movie loosely based on a historic event, this is a whole lot of fun.The basic premise is terrific, combining spies and Hollywood. The script is witty and the ending layers one suspenseful last-minute crisis after another (none of them remotely true). I know there's an article in Wired that tells the real story, and I need to read that. But I suspect it's better to watch the movie first so you don't keep noticing how many liberties it's taken.",8,1,3,22 August 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," terrific movie made more terrific by Depp
","When a movie has an actor whose performance really stands out, especially in some mindless action pic, it's tempting to just give him all the credit for the movie, but I was surprised to find that there is a lot more to recommend the movie than just Depp's fascinating performance.  The movie as a whole is quite amusing, the action is well handled, especially the highly entertaining sword duel between Depp and Bloom and it's really pretty imaginative for something that was created just to capitalize on the success of an amusement park ride.A movie like this is clearly designed to have a great, flashy performance. Depp was hired for that role and did it beautifully, but if not Depp, the producers would have undoubtedly gone for another actor who could give an over-the-top comic performance.  You could actually have a pretty good movie if you replaced Depp with someone more generic, but the movie couldn't really work without a big performance here.The producers were very fortunate to get Depp, who is a wonderful and inventive actor.  His gives Jack Sparrow a loose-limbed charm that makes you suspect he's always slightly drunk, but while a quirky pirate he still gives you that Errol-Flynn sort of swashbuckle.  I wouldn't want to in any way diminish his credit, but I just wanted to point out that the movie is consistently well-acted and stylish in its own right.",8,0,2,27 June 2004
Star Trek Into Darkness," mindless fun, but should have been much better
","While I enjoyed the original Star Trek series, I never had the enthusiasm for it required to really hate this movie. I don't have a problem with anything in the movie based on how it differs from the series, but I do have problems with this movie as a big dumb action flick.First off, this is very much a blow-stuff-up movie. There is very little story and a bare minimum of character development. This is not a movie of ideas. The series took on various issues and explored mankind's place in the world, the movie hasn't a thought in its head.As a dumb action picture, Darkness succeeds pretty well. It's got some exciting action. It also has moments of humor, along with failed moments of pathos.But the movie can't be satisfied with being dumb, but instead insists on being aggressively stupid. For example, Kirk is repeatedly told he is too impetuous, trying crazy, dangerous things. All evidence is that this is true, yet the movie justifies every decision he makes, holding up impetuous recklessness as a higher calling. This is not untrue to the series - Kirk was always ludicrously perfect - but it's dumb.The really dumb stuff turns up at the end. There's a scene that's supposed to be touching (and is apparently a replay of a scene from an older ST movie I barely remember), but it fails, both because the nature of the movie excludes true tragedy and because the character work needed to make the scene work is never done. This is soon followed up by a plot hole so huge and obvious that one has to conclude the writers and director knew it was there and just decided to ignore it, because, HEY LOOK OVER THERE! WE'RE BLOWING STUFF UP!While not as bad as Abrams' Mission Impossible 3, a similarly dumb and explosive film, Darkness is still too CGI-obsessed to be really good. It's a disappointing follow-up to his first, better attempt at Star Trek, but considering its success, I expect Abrams will prove content to blow stuff up and let the money roll in.",7,0,2,13 September 2013
Public Enemies," Forgettable, with a surprisingly weak performance by Depp
","Watchable but unmemorable, the biggest problem with the movie is, surprisingly, the reason I watched it to begin with: Johnny Depp. While one gleans from the script that Dillinger was smart, charming, brutal and equipped with a strong sense of showmanship, Depp underplays the role, resulting in a Dillinger who is reasonably intelligent with a little flare. For someone who has portrayed so many quirky characters, it's surprising to see Depp so determined to make a famous gangster into someone who could as easily be a stockbroker. Dillinger turns out to be the least interesting thing in the movie.More interesting is Christian Bale's intense performance as Purvis and the portrayal of the FBI changing the way criminals are pursued. In fact, had this movie focused on the search for Dillinger and the FBI's search for publicity and made the mobster himself a minor figure this would have made for a much more interesting movie.",5,0,0,28 December 2010
Us," Effectively creepy but in the end you just want to talk about how little sense it makes
","Us creates a great atmosphere of creepiness and some memorable moments. It is well acted and exciting. It also has so many utterly nonsensical aspects to story, plotting, and world building, that everyone who writes a user review marks it as spoilered so they can list the ones that bug them the most. As someone elsewhere noted, Jordan Peele, who wrote the virtually perfect Get Out, was so focused on creating an allegory about class privilege that he couldn't bother to create a story that made even a tiny bit of sense.I still enjoyed this movie, but I'd rather talk about some of the things it got wrong that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere:**** SPOILERS BELOW ****First off, t makes no sense at all that, as it appears in the movie, the underground folk kill everyone in the world except this one family. It's not unusual for a horror film to have a final survivor, smarter or luckier than the rest, out of, say, 8 people. But seriously, EVERYONE IN THE WORLD?And apparently this one family lives because they have the only doppelgangers who aren't ruthlessly efficient. Why this cat-and-mouse game while with that white family it's over in 30 seconds?Even little things are done with an almost purposeful obliviousness to common sense, as when the mom is unable to drag the light wooden coffee table she's handcuffed to even one inch.Then there's the big twist (the mom is from the underground!) that makes no sense for an almost infinite number of reasons (you'll find many enumerations on this site). Again, one reason that I haven't seen mentioned is if the mom is from the underground, and, as is shown elsewhere, the underground people are stronger and faster, then why couldn't she easily vanquish her doppelganger? It's really as though the whole movie was filmed without the twist being intended, and then it was thrown in at the last minute. However, I don't think that's the case, because it's kind of an obvious twist. I think Peele just didn't care that it was BS.",7,0,3,24 September 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," blandly generic
","I only made it through the first half hour of this tedious action picture, so I can't say whether it picks up later on. But the characters were clichés, the story familiar, the action underwhelming (in spite of a couple of cool stunts).What this is definitely not is the story from the video game. Those who say this is typical of what happens when you adapt a game don't realize exactly how well the Sands of Time game told its story. The game had a wonderful, Arabian Knights quality and a wonderful ending.Of course, you can't just take the story from the game and make it into a movie. It's a very slight story filled out with a lot of action and puzzle solving, so the story would certainly have to be expanded. But rather than expanding the story, it was tossed out altogether, with nothing remaining except a few characters and locations and the time rewind gimmick. That in itself wouldn't be so bad if it had been replaced by something moderately interesting and original, but there doesn't seem to have been any good reason to toss out the original story in favor of this one.I can't say the half hour I spent watching this was agonizing. It was just dull, and felt like it was going to keep on being dull. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just wasn't worth wasting my time to find out.",5,0,1,10 February 2011
Ted," sweet, occasionally funny
","Ted is a movie that defies a couple of expectations. First off, it's a movie about a magical thing in which that magical thing is made ordinary. Normally, if a character starts talking to a ghost, or his computer develops sentience, or he adopts an alien, the movie focuses a lot on how difficult this is to hide. But in this movie, the magical Ted is just a fact of life that everyone accepts.The other surprise is that even though the movie is from the guy who does Family Guy, it's not just a crazed series of sick jokes. Instead, it's a genuinely sweet, though often outrageous, movie about a man's reluctance to grow up, with his attachment to childhood portrayed in an ingeniously literal way.But while Wahlberg and Kunis have terrific chemistry and the movie has some really funny scenes (notably a double date gone wrong), I never really got into it. The humor is mild, and once you understand that it will veer into sudden perverse jokes now and again, just a tiny bit predictable. I appreciate that the film's creator wanted to do something more than twisted Family Guy-style comedy, but I don't feel he nailed it. Without the sort of I-can't-believe-I-just-heard-that comedy of his series, this is just a cute take-off on a kid's movie that never quite catches fire. But it's so likable that I feel guilty for not liking it more.",6,2,4,31 December 2012
Coffee and Cigarettes," for those who find watching paint dry too exhilarating
","The problem with Jim Jarmusch is that, amidst the horrible tedious undrama that makes up the bulk of his work there are those occasional bits that are great. This keeps causing me to give his movies a try when they come to TV. Sometimes you get something cool, like Masatoshi Nagase's performance in Mystery Train or Roberto Benigni as a crazy cabbie in Night on Earth, but other times it's just a horrible waste of one's life. So it is with Coffee & Cigarettes, a series of painfully dull vignettes. Many of these look as though Jarmusch got two actors and told them, sit there, work coffee and cigarettes into the conversation and try not to say anything too interesting. If those were the instructions than the film is pretty successful. After the first few vignettes I just fast forwarded after a few minutes of each, trying to find something worthwhile. Cousins was interesting in a low-key way, the thing with The White Strips was most interesting because they were such abysmal actors, but was otherwise worthless, but the final sequence, Champagne, was actually sort of interesting, simply because of the low key but assured presence of the two actors.If you're a Jim Jarmusch fan I suppose you'll like this, for whatever mysterious reason people like his stuff, but this is for hardcore Jarmusch fans only.",3,3,6,6 September 2005
Knives Out," solid whodunit
","The whodunit is one of modern cinema's most underserved genres, and it's always exciting when someone decides to make one.The movie features an excellent performance by Daniel Craig as a laid back southern detective plus a bunch of other excellent performances by the suspects. The movie is mildy satiric of the wealthy, but mainly it's about the mystery and the characters.While I liked this movie, I didn't like it quite as much as I expected to considering I love whodunits and it got rave reviews. It's no Last of Sheila. But it is the best whodunit that's come out for years and very entertaining.",8,3,5,2 March 2020
Spider-Man 2," not great, but a step up from the first one
","I was very under-whelmed by the first Spider-Man movie, a tepid affair with a poorly constructed story and some ridiculous script inconsistencies. So my expectations for the sequel were pretty low. But this is really a pretty good movie. The script writing is still sloppy, but it doesn't have any of the glaring problems that plagued the original.The movie varies, but is notable for some truly shining moments. The best parts of the film are those that focus not on the action but on the humanity; there is a wonderful scene at the end of the subway sequence and a very affecting ending.The movie has a good pace and more convincingly combines action and human elements. It is by no means a great movie, but it is a good one.",7,5,10,8 July 2005
The Irishman," Well acted, thoughtfully crafted, painfully slow
","Martin Scorcese is not the first elderly director who decided to slow things down. It's not uncommon; age seems to cause some auteurs to become fascinated by the slow pace of real life and try and emulate it in film.Anyway, The Irishman is slow. It's a fairly interesting story with interesting very well-acted characters, but every scene plays out fully; you don't just get the basics, you get all the digressions and pauses and irrelevant asides. Any ten-minute scene in the film would be a five-minute scene in most movies.What happens in these slow scenes is sometimes very interesting. And at times there is a horror underneath that is underlined by the calm, leisurely attitude of the principles. But this all still requires a lot of patience. And I've always preferred Scorcese's fast-moving films (After Hours, Taxi Driver) to his slow ones (Raging Bull, Last Temptation of Christ).Maybe at 60 I'm just not old enough for this movie. Sure, it's interesting to watch a movie that follows gangsters from brutal youth to doddering age, but it's not *that* interesting. Maybe it will be in another 20 years.I know it's supposed to be a brilliant work of cinema, but personally I'd say skip it unless you really like slow-paced movies.",6,1,5,26 January 2020
Superbad," Inspired Lunacy
","This wildly funny movie about two teenagers trying to get alcohol for a party starts rather slowly - I was on the fence about it for the first 20 minutes or so - but once it gets started it never stops, supplying a steady stream of insane situations and wacky comedy.What makes this particularly successful is that the two central boys, as well as the two girls they want to hook up with, seem real, at least to the extent anyone can seem real is such an absurdly plotted film. The vulnerability of the leads counterbalances the utter insanity of a nerd and two cops whose scenes are the funniest in the movie.In a movie that is basically just really silly, it's nice to see how they created just enough human emotion to keep the movie from feeling hollow but not enough to clog up the joke machine. It is just a wonderfully made movie that everyone should see.",9,2,4,14 July 2008
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Half quite good, half truly awful
","This movie is based on a book you can read in about 15 minutes that is simply a funny list of things women can do to alienate guys.  That's not a lot to base a movie on, and I thought the movie's central idea - a woman writing an article on how to lose a guy dating a man with a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him - was fairly clever, although more clever in the telling than the execution.  The first half hour of this movie is quite dull, as the wheels are awkwardly set in motion.  Then the movie becomes very funny as Andie drags Benjamin to a Chick Flick marathon and destroys his poker game.  The getting-a-woman-to-fall-for-a-guy part is pretty much dropped; it seems to have just been there to give a reason for a guy to stay with a psycho chick other than the usual reason: sex.  The movie is funny for a good hour, until the movie decides it has to resolve its clunky set up.  The last half hour is truly, utterly painful: the 'You're So Vain' is possibly the most poorly conceived and badly executed thing to ever appear in any romantic movie in the last hundred years.  While most of the movie's failings can be laid at the feet of the writers and directors, it should be noted that, for all their efforts, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey fail to manage anything more than a sort of lukewarm chemistry.  Which would be fine in another sort of movie, but in something that wants to be a sparkling romantic comedy, chemistry is key.  Because an absurd romance only makes sense if the principals seem perfect together, which they don't.I would probably give the funny hour of this movie a 7, and the bad part a 2.  I'll give the overall effect a 5/10.",5,1,2,1 June 2004
Constantine," Film noir meets Catholic paganism
","I don't know why so many people hear are ragging on this movie, I thought it was tons of fun. Plenty of cool special effects action, a taciturn cool guy hero and all that silly demon and angel stuff the Catholics are so in love with. Also a couple of very good performances from Peter Stormare as Satan and especially Tilda Swinton as Gabriel.I'm wondering if the criticisms have anything to do with the odd way people react to religious themed movies. After all, the Exorcist was really dull but people loved that because somehow it clicked in the public mind, perhaps because it took demons more seriously than Constantine, which simply uses the excesses of Catholic belief as a hook for an action movie. I've also seen really dreadful, syrupy religious movies get rave reviews, once again I think because it just connects with people's spiritual needs. So maybe it helps to watch Constantine as an atheist. Anyway, I had a lot of fun.",8,4,7,23 April 2006
Rise of the Guardians," Stunning animation, entertaining situations
","The first thing I have to say is that the animation is stunning. When watching movies on TV, I often let my eyes wander, checking facebook for a minute, getting up to do some exercises while I watch, but I didn't do that for Rise of the Guardian, because every second of film was worth watching. Imagery is very densely packed and things happen very quickly.I also found the movie quite funny in that same quick, overstuffed way. And yet, there is something about the movie's story that kind of bothers me. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but then I read a review of it that described it as seeming like it was written by committee, and I thought, yeah, that could be it. There is something calculated and safe about the story that made me unable to entirely connect with it. But it was still a fantastic experience.",8,6,8,12 June 2013
Chicken Run," More suspense than humor
","I was rather disappointed in Chicken Run, hoping for a film as funny as Park's 'The Wrong Trousers.'  I actually think it worked better in its dramatic and suspenseful scenes than in it's rather mild humourous ones. It's the kind of movie one describes as 'cute.'",6,1,1,8 July 2000
Spotlight," Great movie on investigative journalism
","I couldn't get my girlfriend to watch this movie with me, and I think that's because of the subject matter, so I just want to say that this is not a movie full of searing, emotional moments with molested victims. There are a couple of moments like that, certainly, but this movie isn't about pedophilia, it's about investigative journalism, and the film is tightly focused on the investigatory elements, with just a seasoning of victims and of reporters anguish over knowing something they can't tell people (yet).This movie is very much in the vein of All the President's Men, to the point where I would expect everyone who likes one to like the other (although movie enthusiasm is never that one to one, so I'm sure I'm wrong). This movie is very interested in evidence and procedure, yet also explores the way in which terrible things can be protected by the status quo, and the way powerful interests try to control the debate.There are some sad moments, and there are many that will make you furious, but overall you will be riveted by the story and impressed by the acting and direction.",9,1,2,9 August 2016
Terminator Salvation," As big and soulless as a terminator
","Think about the original Terminator. Think about the clever premise, the emotional resonance, the humor, the suspense and the special effects. Now get rid of everything except the special effects and about half the suspense and you've got Terminator Salvation. This movie is a big-budget action picture that simply throws a lot of action sequences at you one after the other. This makes for a perfectly watchable action flick, but it is also easily the weakest entry in the series.It also should have been the last entry. Producers have been squeezing everything out of the Terminator franchise they can for years, but the only reason to jump into the future is to show you how the premise of the previous movies and the TV series pay off. Instead, you have what will probably be the first in a series of big soulless action flicks that continue this big, uninteresting war story.They would have been better off just making a movie version of the tragically short-lived TV series, but at this point I feel Terminator is just done. There is nothing left.",6,3,7,2 January 2011
Insomnia," hackneyed dialogue
","I watched about fifteen minutes of the beginning and was shocked at how wooden the dialogue was; typical Hollywood bad cop movie dialogue.  I gave up when Martin & Al were talking about the internal affairs stuff.  But I wanted to see Robin Williams (having just watched One Hour Photo) so I skipped forward an hour.  It's better at that point, with a low key performance by Williams compensating for Pacino's usual hamminess.  It moves pretty well in the second half, and there are some nice shots from the insomniac point of view.  Not good enough to go back and watch the part I skipped, but good enough to watch to the end.I saw the original a few years ago and know I didn't skip any of it.  I think I found it intriguing and good but not great.  Based on my recollection, I'd say it's preferable to the remake.",5,0,1,27 December 2003
Aquaman," Terrible script, looks like it might be fun to watch in 3D
","I was in the minority of IMDB reviewers who liked the underrated Justice League, and now, with the latest movie featuring Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I am in the minority again, this time having a far more negative reaction than most people.While the CGI action is *sometimes* fun, the dialogue is excruciatingly bad. Embarrassingly bad. This is particularly evident with Amber Heard, who hasn't developed the skill of more experienced actors like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction. Amber seems terrible in this, but I don't know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spew.People are going crazy for the muscly Momoa. I was underwhelmed by him in Justice League, and while he certainly has some amount of charm, he fails to make Aquaman particularly memorable.The story is predictable. Some of the action works, some doesn't. Everything that's not action is painful to sit through.I did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3D. Perhaps that's why I was underwhelmed by a lot of the action; it was more designed for effects than fun. I do suspect I would have enjoyed this more in 3D. I also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue.",5,1,3,26 March 2019
The Jungle Book," Cute little movie
","There's not a lot to this 75 minute movie. The plot is rambling, and in spite of its brevity, it drags a little in the middle. But overall it's quite entertaining. The best scene is Louis Prima singing I Want to Be Just Like You (I knew the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy version, and was surprised to learn it was a Disney song). The acting is very solid, except for whoever voices the kid. The animation is pretty good, although Disney wasn't at its best design-wise in the 60s (or 70s). It's amusing and has a couple of nice songs. I was a kid when this came out, so there's a chance I saw it at the time, but if so, it didn't stick with me. And it won't stick with me this time. But it's cute.",7,5,7,22 April 2014
Deadpool 2," Iffy start, but ultimately hugely entertaining
","I was a big fan of the first Deadpool, which was both hilarious and had a strong sense of character. So I was really looking forward to Deadpool 2. But if I hadn't seen the first movie, I probably would have given up on this one after 20 minutes.The movie begins with Deadpool traveling the world killing people. Who are these people? Why is he killing them? Do they deserve to die, and if so, do they deserve to die in such sadistic ways? The movie doesn't tell us; it's just fancily choreographed slaughter.Then Deadpool experiences tragedy, and after a really clever title sequence based on that, we get about 20 minutes of our hero being really depressed. Which isn't all that much fun.So after about a half hour of setup, the actual story kicks in and the movie -- finally! -- becomes fun. And once it starts being fun it never stops. It gets crazy, there's some sort of reason for all the violence, it is full of hilarious jokes, and it's more-or-less what I remember from the first movie.My favorite part of the movie is Domino, a superhero whose power is good luck. A scene based entirely on a series of fortunate coincidences is one of the best in the movie, and I really, really want to see Domino (played with kick-ass bravado by Zazie Beetz) get her own movie, although I assume she won't in spite of a lot of people wanting it because Hollywood won't be able to handle building a huge epic around a black woman (guaranteed some Hollywood exec is saying, 'we can't do it; Catwoman was a bomb').I can't agree with all the people saying Deadpool 2 is better than the first movie; the first movie was consistently good all the way through and had a better handle on the balance between spectacle and character. But 3/4ths of this movie is absolutely terrific.",8,2,5,6 March 2019
Spider-Man 3," poorly made movie with some good action scenes
","The first Spider-Man movie was a poorly considered mess, while the second one was sloppy but fairly satisfying. Apparently the mild heights the second one attained were too much for the filmmakers, who fell to abysmal lows in the third entry.What is good about Spider-Man 3 is the special effects. The first appearance of the sand man is pretty impressive. The action scenes are lively. There's also a cute bit when Peter turns into a smarmy egotist (over all the dual personality thing was less Jekyll & Hyde than it was The Nutty Professor).The rest of it is all terrible, tedious drawn out dramatic scenes detailing Peter Parker's soap opera-ish troubles. And like the first movie, the script completely falls apart in the end, with some really ludicrous contrivances.It's a super-hero movie with some good fights, and if you let your brain go blank that's all you need, but it is in no way good movie making.",5,0,1,11 June 2008
Thor: Ragnarok," best and funniest of the Thor movies
","With a breezy sense of humor and some great action scenes, Ragnarok is easily the best of the Thor movies, closer in its silly spirit to Guardians of the Galaxy than to the underwhelming first entry.The new characters introduced are excellent, especially Jeff Goldblum as a sleazy, genial dictator and Tessa Tompson as a hard-drinking bounty hunter who deserves her own movie. And the film's director is hilarious as a motion-captured boulder-man.The story is engaging and the director keeps things moving at a brisk pace. The Thor subfranchise has definitely upped its game.",8,2,11,3 October 2019
Match Point," Exactly the kind of Woody Allen movie I hate
","I never know what I'll get with Woody Allen. Sometimes it will be something terrific like Midnight in Paris, Sweet and Lowdown, Sleeper, or The Purple Rose of Cairo, and sometimes it will be something painfully dull and pretentious like Alice, Hannah and Her Sisters or Match Point.Match Point, like Hannah, is a movie about a bunch of people who all talk the same, have read the same authors, are familiar with the same music, and who are dull and lifeless and airless (except for Scarlett Johanson, who gets to play the role of the film's one non-boring person). I instantly disliked this movie, which seemed bland and unlikeable, but I struggled on through most of the first half hour in hopes that something would happen.I hear something does happen eventually, but when I asked my girlfriend about it she said it was a terrible movie with a terrible ending, so I saw no reason to give it more of a chance.",4,2,4,27 October 2012
Yes Man," Funny, charming and critically underrated
","I thought this looked cute when I saw the ads, so when I saw it was on HBO I decided to have a look. I had no idea if it was supposed to be any good, I hadn't read any reviews (which I learned afterward were generally negative so I approached it blind. And I loved it.This is a very funny, charming movie about a negative guy who tries to become a positive guy through the radical step of saying yes to everything. The results are arguably too good to be true, although I understand the true story this was based on turned out pretty good.I like the message of positivity of this movie. For most of my life I was purposely pessimistic and cynical and had a mildly negative view of the world. A few years ago I decided to try the other side, and with determination and some books on positive thinking I managed to turn myself mildly positive, and my life genuinely improved, even though the cynic in me would have said it couldn't be that easy. So not only is this a very funny movie, but I think if it makes people think about the benefits of being more positive and adventurous in life then it is a movie with real world benefits.",8,2,3,11 November 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," Another Entertaining RE Flick
","At its best, this movie has great style. Watch the first scenes, as the director poses Milla as a piece of angry candy in beautifully framed shots and lovely moments like a sliver of a dress sliced in slow motion, and you can't help but be impressed. The movie doesn't consistently maintain that supermodel-of-the-apocalypse quality, but when it hits it, as in another scene with Milla and a wall of flame, it's stupendous. While the scenes without Milla are never quite as visually striking, it is all pretty exciting, including a transparent rip off of Hitchcock's The Birds. For me, the Resident Evil series represents the best of movies pulled from video games, offering pure escapist fun that is fast paced and never tries to either mock nor run away from the game's sillier aspects. At the same time, the movies all kind of run together for me; they're all good, but they are all pretty forgettable. If you're looking for pure popcorn entertainment you can't go wrong with this one.",7,1,1,24 May 2012
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen, not succumbing to despair
","This movie is funny, charming and clever. But perhaps more surprisingly, it doesn't feel like it has to balance that charm with ponderous, grim, philosophy. Light and frivolous, although with an interesting central point, the movie is Woody Allen in a good mood. A friend of mine called the movie superficial, which I disagree with, but it is certainly not Woody Allen trying to be deep, and I think that's great, because for me, the more profound Allen tries to be the more we see the limits of his artistry. But here, he makes a funny movie with a clever premise, good performances, absolutely gorgeous cinematography and some wildly funny moments (the scene with the surrealists is so wonderful).Definitely worth seeing.",8,1,2,28 December 2011
Zodiac," Engrossing but overlong
","Zodiac is often compelling, with solid performances, a good sense of place, some really disturbing and suspenseful moments and a great soundtrack. It is also much too long, as though made by someone so enamored with its story that they couldn't bear to cut a single moment from it.While this movie recreates in distressing detail the killings of the serial killer known as The Zodiac, for the most part it is an investigative movie along the lines of All the President's Men, one fascinated by evidence and research. The difference is this movie is also heavily focused on obsession.The acting is good, particularly Jake Gyllenhaal as a jittery cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the case. The investigation itself is involving, although at times it can be hard to keep up with the steady stream of clues that lead investigators running around.Still, it's too long, and it doesn't feel like it's a movie that *needs* to be this long to tell the story. In fact, while I really liked Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, his character wasn't especially necessary to the story being told; he should have been a fairly minor character. That could have cut a half hour off the running time without losing anything essential to the story.Even though it's too long, though, it's worth seeing.",7,0,0,10 March 2014
Cloverfield," Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying
","Take the hand-held camera gimmick of The Blair Witch Project and marry it to a standard monster-destroys-city flick and you've got Cloverfield. It's an interesting way to tell a monster movie, seen closely through the eyes of a small, bland group of friends caught up in the disaster, yet while I found it interesting it never really pulled me in, and the ending did not make me happy.You can't talking about this movie without talking about Blair Witch, mainly because Blair Witch took the same gimmick and got so much more out of it. Even though that earlier movie had a fraction of the budget, it used the device so much more effectively; compare the final talking to the camera scenes from both films and tell me Cloverfield's is even a tenth as effective.It is also less convincing as a premise. The guy with the camera is oddly devoted to documenting the event, to the point where he will stand back and film when he should be helping. In the real world, one of his friends would have grabbed the camera and threw it against a wall. Because of the way it's done, you never forget that this is just a clever device. Blair Witch was more convincing because the camera was the whole point and you were dealing with someone who would think in those terms.Still, it does have it's good points. Because we see everything from one point of view, we get information in bits and pieces and never get anything like a real explanation of what's going on. There are individually effective scenes. The cameraman is vaguely likable, although everyone else is pretty forgettable.Ultimately though, the hand-held single view camera is not an effective way to film action or horror scenes, the story and characters fail to be interesting, and the ending is very disappointing. It's interesting enough to watch, but it could have been so much better.",6,1,2,18 October 2011
Silent Hill," thoroughly entertaining, but doesn't quite feel like the games
","This is an interesting movie, because the games have a very Japanese quality to them, full of creeping dread and weirdness, but the movie has more of an American feel, with straightforward action and scares. I think it probably would have been a more interesting film if it were done more along the line of The Ring, but taken on its own terms it's quite entertaining.I've played all the Silent Hill games except the first one, which is probably what this was based on, so it makes it difficult to know how closely the story was followed. I did read a synopsis of the first game and I think it was something like what was here. I suspect, based on the other games, that the movie took more pains to explain what was going on, although it apparently didn't help since I see a lot of complaints about not understanding the story. I followed it pretty well myself though, and was surprised people were having so much difficulty with it.All in all I liked this movie. While it doesn't quite have the tone of the games, it does have a lot of the look, keeps things moving and has a few nifty scares in it. I'd say it ties with Resident Evil for best game-based movie.",7,1,2,4 April 2007
Once," Forgettable songs, no story to speak of
","I know a lot of people love this little indie musical, and that it even has come to Broadway, but I found this terribly dull. In fact, I would have stopped watching early on if I hadn't been watching with my girlfriend, who had seen it before and inexplicably wanted to see it again.To me, there is very little to recommend this. There is little story, since most of the movie is made up of people singing, sometimes while sitting and sometimes while standing. The songs themselves are not especially interesting; the only one I liked at all was the first one sung together by the two leads, and even though it was nice enough, it's not like I would actually pursue listening to it again.Basically, people meet, write songs, sing songs, talk about writing songs, and that's about it. Yes, there's the occasional talk about something other than songs, like relationships, and there is some stuff unspoken that might appeal to people who like things that are unspoken, but you have to really want to see a movie where people sit around and sing bland songs to fully enjoy this.",4,1,5,17 July 2013
Ready Player One," Spielberg tries to do a Spielberg-tribute film and can't quite pull it off
","Like the TV series Stranger Things, Ready Player One is suffused with nostalgia for the sort of movies Steven Spielberg was making in the 80s; big fun movies with spunky kids and cool special effects.Set in a dystopian world where people escape the grim real world for an exciting virtual one, the movie resolves around a virtual-world search for keys that will grant ownership of the entire enterprise to the finder. The hunt is undertaken by amateurs like protagonist Wade and by a mega-corporation with hundreds of gamer employees. Who will win out win out, the plucky teen or the resource-heavy corporation? (Hint: it's a Spielberg movie.)The movie is full of 80s music and movie references, but the movie never makes clear why (it wasn't until I read a plot synopsis of the book that I understood it's because the virtual-world's creator was a big 80s geek) nor , with maybe one exception, makes the 80s integral to the plot. The script is frustratingly lazy. The first brilliant thing Wade does is the sort of thing someone would have done by then anyway. After a major crime, there's no investigation and no one even calls the police, yet the movie never establishes a world where people would react that way. While the competition between Wade and the corporation is portrayed as of great consequence, the reasons it's so important are vague, forcing the movie to rely on the CEO being horribly evil. In a scene that particularly aggravated me, Wade sends out a call for help to a world even though it's never been established that anyone understands the stakes or even that there are stakes. Spielberg is too experienced to make a movie that simply assumes everyone in the film knows everything the audience does.Yes, there are exciting special effects, and I probably would have enjoyed this more on a big screen where I could fully appreciate the crazy mix of avatars, but a movie has to be more than it's special effects. And outside of an intriguing performance by Mark Rylance, there's not a lot outside of the effects.Also, there's just a lack of ... something. One of the film's most notable set pieces takes place in a virtual Overlook Hotel, and while it's cute, it feels a bit wan. I think the actual 1980s Spielberg would have done it so much better.And that's a lot of the problem. Spielberg is an old man whose best recent movies like Bridge of Spies and War Horse are from a mature director. Spielberg is simply the wrong person to make a Spielberg tribute film.While I hate movie reviews that talk about the different movie that could have been made, I would have been more interested in a movie that considered the way in which escaping to a virtual world would cause people to let their own real world collapse. It's such an obvious take that it feels like the movie is purposely not pursuing it because they want to keep things light.And yes, they keep things light. This movie is as light as air. It is pure fluff. For all its grand scale, it is a very slight movie. But a perfectly watchable one.",6,0,5,11 July 2018
The Hateful Eight," A Western-Mystery through Tarantino's unique sensibility
","That Hateful Eight strikes me as fundamentally a gritty, '60s-style western with mystery elements, a lot of conversation, and a fair amount of nastiness.For maybe the first two-thirds, H8 is a talky Western populated by intriguing but unlikable people. There is clearly something going on beneath the service, but it's unclear what, or which characters might not be what they seem. Some here call this a murder mystery, which is wrong, or at least only right to the extent that you could describe this as a 'period drama.' You could call it that, and I could see why you would, but it's still ultimately wrong.The cast is excellent, particularly Samuel L. Jackson as a tough bounty hunter and Jennifer Jason Leigh (giving her best performance in years) as a decidedly ornery criminal.There is a lot of talking in this movie, and while it's generally interesting there's probably too much of it. Still, while the movie's pace is a bit slow, it never flags.The last part contains the brutality Tarantino is so enamored of. It's both gory and emotionally disturbing, which I guess is what people want from his films, or, at least, what he wants to give them, most of the time.I've never cared for hyper violence, I'm not generally into Westerns, and Tarantino is a director I sometimes like but have yet to love. With all that said, the movie of the first two-thirds I would probably give an 8 but the increasing unpleasantness often felt both a bit gratuitous and, more importantly, not entirely in keeping with most of the movie. It's as thought Tarantino was torn between wanting to create a character study and wanting to create a Tarantino gore fest and finally decided to just go ahead and do them both.Overall, I'd recommend this if you can deal with the gore and unpleasantness, because it is well written, directed, and acted.",7,0,1,17 June 2020
"I, Tonya"," fun movie about abuse and idiots
","While I, Tonya offers a sympathetic portrayal of the disgraced Olympian, one should note that it is *her* sympathetic portrayal. The movie is based on interviews with Tonya and her ex and plays with the unreliable narrator; at one point Tonya shoots at her hubby, then turns to the camera and says she never did such a thing.In spite of those moments, overall the movie does take Tonya's side, chiding her for never taking responsibility yet ultimately portraying her as caught in a cycle of abuse. While this abuse is often gasp-inducing, for the most part the movie has a breezy, humorous tone, taking great delight in its idiot-rogues.Victim Nancy Kerrigan gets short shrift here. I read an article suggesting she should be rehabilitated as well from her undeserved 'ice princess' reputation, but that's unlikely to happen. Whatever her level of complicity, Tonya is a fascinating character, and this movie offers an intriguing look at figure skating's bad girl.",8,0,1,3 October 2019
Molly's Game," brilliant
","Molly's Game tells the story of a woman who runs a celebrity poker game until the cops nab her. But director Aaron Sorkin's focus is not nearly that narrow. While he shows the glitter and the seaminess of high-stakes poker, he offers up Molly, brilliantly played by Jessica Chastain, as a complex and multifaceted character, starting not with poker but with her attempt to make the Olympics.Molly is fascinating; smart, prickly, and fiercely ethical. And, since this is a Sorkin script, she's also incredibly sharp and witty, especially when she spares with her lawyer, terrifically played by Idris Elba.This is Sorkin's first film as a director and he hits it out of the park. The movie is stylish and riveting, and he does a beautiful job of explaining Molly's world, even putting graphs and arrows on screen to make sure you get it.Funny, touching and engaging, Molly's Game makes it clear that Sorkin should direct all his scripts from now on.",9,3,7,15 September 2018
Moana," Fun follow-your-dreams-empowerment Disney adventure flick
","Disney princesses have changed a lot since the company started pumping them out. In the case of Moana, the daughter of a village chieftain is strong, brave, athletic, and determined to save the world. She also denies being a princess altogether, although in one of the film's occasional Disney in-jokes she is told that if you've got a dress and an animal sidekick, you're a princess.The movie fits very much in the girl-empowerment ethos that has replaced Disney's original waiting-for-the-princess trope. This is very much a heroic, mythic adventure story. It's also quite funny, with a brash demigod, a cheeky ocean, and the world's dumbest rooster all doing their shtick. The songs are decent. There's a nice please-nominate-me-for-an-Oscar empowerment song that's kind of catchy, a rousing number involving sailing ships, and the best, a David Bowiesque thing called Shiny. It's not the best Disney soundtrack, but it's a pretty good one.The animation is gorgeous. At least on television, a good deal of the scenery looked photo-realistic, and the island setting allowed for a lot of natural beauty. There are also notable sequences involving living tattoos that were apparently hand drawn.Well worth watching.",9,4,10,15 March 2017
Scary Movie 2," tasteless, stupid, but really funny
","When the first Scary Movie came out, I thought it looked really funny in the trailers but put off seeing it because I read it was so horrible.  Then I saw it and thought it was hysterical.  When Scary Movie 2 came out I was going to go but read all these comments that it was just so bad, the first one was much better, blah blah blah, so I only saw it now.  And you know what, it was hysterical.  It is more tasteless and lowbrow than the first one, and it felt a little sloppier, but it's still really, really funny.  I would see I'll go see the sequel regardless of what anyone says, but Wayans isn't doing the sequel so now I'm not sure.  But the first two are great, no matter what anyone else says.",7,0,2,8 October 2003
The Flowers of War," I understand the objections, but still find this powerful and well filmed
","The movies I've seen by the brilliant Yimou Zhang tend to fall roughly into two categories; big epics like Hero or smaller dramas like The Road Home. Flowers of War is an attempt to straddle these two styles, with a mix of bravura action and small, intense dramatic moments. It's difficult to pull off, and I wouldn't say it always works, but for the most part, this is a brilliant movie.Flowers of War has received a lot of 'The Color Purple'-style criticism along the lines of, 'some things are too ugly to be made so beautiful.' And while I disagreed with that analysis of Purple, I do, to some extent, agree here.The movie immediately shows typical Zhang flourishes, like a small but marvelous moment where a cart full of fleeing people cuts the strings of a musical instrument as Japanese soldiers are hunting down and killing Chinese civilians in the famous Rape of Nanking.The opening scenes are intense and disturbing. I had no familiarity with the Nanking massacre, and I would have thought it was exaggerated if I didn't spend a couple of hours reading about it. It represents the heights of human depravity. Imagine the horrific events of the movie repeated hundreds of thousands of times over a six-week period.The movie focuses on a white mortician who comes to a girl's school which also winds up being sanctuary for some prostitutes. This leads to a lot of conflict and, in spite of the horrors, a certain amount of humor. There is also a thread running through of the last of the city's Chinese soldiers vainly attempting to stop the Japanese.There is something disconcerting about Zhang's bravura filmmaking in the context of the horrors of this massacre. A rape scene centered around the school's gorgeous stained-glass window is electrifying, but one's enthusiasm for its stylistic grace conflicts with the grim horrors of the scene. There is also a wonderful scene with the final soldier, played brilliantly by Dawei Tong, taking out a slew of enemy soldiers. It's an exciting action sequence full of intense moments, but it feels a little unrealistic and out of place, as though it belongs in a different film altogether.So yes, it's often unrealistic, leans too much on clichés, and is filmed in a way that often seems more about the art of filmmaking than about the content of the movie. On the other hand, there is much to recommend it. First off, the filmmaking really is incredible. Even if you object that it's the wrong style for the subject, there are a lot of moments where you have to be in awe of the artistic vision.The movie also has some terrific performances. Besides Tong's tight- lipped soldier, Christian Bale is excellent, bringing a mix of macho obnoxiousness and genuine feeling to the clichéd role of a cynic finding his soul. Above all is Ni Ni as prostitute Yu Mo, a mix of brains, beauty, bravery, and flirtatious mastery that made me think of Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not.The movie is touching, and funny, and stylish, and thoroughly absorbing, for all its flaws.It's also painful to watch. I know there are movies that are said to handle the Nanking Massacre better than this one, but it's such an overwhelmingly grim subject that I just cannot bear to delve into it again.",8,0,0,7 February 2014
Blade II," generally acceptable way to blow a couple of hours
","Blade II is basically decent.  It's got a few cool and/or effective moments, it keeps moving, and everything about it says 'basically adequate though uninspired action flick.'  Snipes makes an acceptable b-movie sort of action figure, with less presence than Vin Diesel but more talent than Chuck Norris.  Kristofferson is blandly adequate in his very generic role.  Ron Perlman is, of course, quite good, although the movie's characters let several good chances to kill him go by just so they can keep him around longer.  The minimal story is pretty much okay.  Some of the fight scenes are well-choreographed, although the finale is a bit too along the lines of a wrestling match.  I watched it to the end and didn't feel overly restless, so if you just kind of like action pictures and it's on TV it's worth at least looking at.  But that's about the best I can say for it.",5,2,5,11 August 2004
Knocked Up," seemed mildly amusing, but pretty dumb
","To be fair, I only watched about a half an hour or so of this, so maybe it gets really funny afterward. I stuck with it even though a friend had told me it wasn't especially funny because other people claim it is, but I just lost hope that it was ever going to be more than fitfully amusing.I also thought the plot and the direction the movie appeared to be going was ludicrous. My friend tells me all my fears were confirmed, as she watched it all, so I feel justified in having bailed on the thing.Director Apatow did 40 Year-Old Virgin and was involved with Freaks and Geeks, so he's clearly a talented guy, but in spite of its success this one looks like a mild misfire.",5,0,1,14 July 2008
Megamind," cute
","I saw a commercial for Megamind just after seeing Despicable Me and was quite confused; wait, are they making the same movie twice in the same year? It was unfortunate for Megamind, which was both not as funny as Despicable Me and came out later, creating a been-there-done-that impression.But putting aside that other supervillain movie, Megamind is pretty good. It's an amusing little film with good performances, particularly from Tina Fey and David Cross, some nice action, and a charming but implausible premise. While it would have been better to have had a little more space between them, there is room in this world for both movies.",7,0,1,10 June 2013
Closer," the difficult lives of good-looking people
","I find it kind of difficult to tell friends what this movie is about. I generally say it's about a few people who screw each other over. To me this movie seems to suggest that good-looking people all just want to seduce each other. I wonder what this movie would be like with the same script but ugly actors? Anyway, I found this movie interesting throughout, with excellent performances and some riveting scenes, but I also found all the people unlikeable and felt less like I was involved in the personal lives of the characters and more like I was watching them under a microscope. I didn't really care about any of these people. Maybe Portman's character a little, since she was the most naive, but really, they aren't likable or sympathetic in the least. But I'd say it's worth seeing, and for what it's worth, my girlfriend seemed to love it.",7,1,1,19 March 2005
Elf," Funny and sweet Xmas flick
","Ingenious, very funny movie about a human adopted by Santa who travels to New York. This very sweet little movie is powered by Will Farrell as the goofy almost-elf; Zooey Deschanel gives a rare non-manic-pixie performance as a suspicious store worker. Perfect Christmas fare.",8,2,3,29 August 2019
Shutter Island," Lesser Scorcese film fails to satisfy
","Before I get into the spoilers, I'll just say this is an initially intriguing movie with a great performance by Michelle Williams and a great, brief performance by Ted Levine. It is beautifully filmed but overlong and predictable.********** SPOILERS BELOW ************** Shutter Island begins well. It has an eerie quality to it that at first suggests it will be some sort of horror movie. In fact, it is filmed as such all the way through, with spooky whispering and dark places and dripping blood. But it is not a horror movie, and much of the problem with Shutter Island is that the tone does not fit well with what the movie actually is.The movie starts out as detectives Teddy and Chuck come to an asylum for the criminally insane to find a missing patient. How did she escape, why didn't she take her shoes, why are the doctors uncooperative? Interesting questions, but it soon seems there is something more than this going on. Doctors make odd comments and give odd looks. Teddy has weird dreams and headaches. Doctors or patients sometimes say something that oddly suggests they know something about Teddy's life they shouldn't know. Early on, you realize that there is either some conspiracy involving the asylum or that Teddy is perhaps insane.At a certain point in the movie, it is clear that it is the latter. When Teddy tells his partner that HUAC, the anti-communist organization, is funding medical experiments, it was clear to me that Teddy was a paranoid-schizophrenic. And almost everything in the movie past that point fit with that being the case.The problem is, the movie keeps playing along with Teddy long after it's obvious he's crazy. There have been very good movies, like A Beautiful Mind and Repulsion, that gave the audience a peak into mental illness, but they didn't try to toy with the audience as long as Shutter Island does. By the time it becomes clear that Teddy is insane, the movie needed to have ready a twist to reframe everything we saw. Instead, Teddy continues with his investigation. It is not until the very end that the reveal happens, and while it adds some interesting details and offers alternate interpretations of previous events, it is too little too late.A twist only works if you're not expecting it. If you're waiting for it, and waiting for it, and it doesn't come, it's just kind of boring.I was surprised to discover when I came to this site that a small number of people take Teddy's story at face value, insisting he was sane and driven crazy by the doctors. This makes absolutely no sense, but perhaps it's a result of people not being able to accept that genius Martin Scorcese made a rather obvious, unexceptional movie.Visually impressive, with some nice scenes and good performances (Williams is awesome as the dead wife), Shutter Island is still overlong and underwhelming. I wish Scorcese had just gone ahead and made the simple thriller I thought was coming instead of this psychological muddle.",6,4,7,13 January 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A fun follow-up
","Of the many Marvel superhero movies that have come out in the past few years, the first Captain America was my favorite. While this sequel lacks the Indiana Jones-ish vibe of the first one, it still has that human-scaled quality that is missing from the other movies, which often emphasize spectacle over quiet, human moments.This is not to say the movie doesn't have some absolutely terrific action sequences, but rather to say that, unlike something like The Avengers, this movie takes time to breathe, let's us get to know the characters, and seems more like a movie than a special effects sizzle reel.There are some issues. Sometimes the bad guys don't do things in the most logical way. More notably, they are a level of evil that comes across as cartoonish and ludicrous. But it's a silly movie no matter which way you slice it, so you can't complain too much about the particular quality of the silliness.The cast is quite good, it has a solid number of jaw-dropping moments, and while I might not like it quite so much as the first one I do like it better than the non-Captain America films in this series.",8,0,0,13 December 2014
Lost in Translation," so-so movie with a good performance by Japan
","First off, I can't figure out why all the reviews I read called this movie a comedy, since it's not very funny and doesn't seem to be trying to be a comedy.  Second, it's just as overrated as Sofia's last movie.  She seems to be one of these mediocre talents who for some incomprehensible reason become critical darlings (i.e. Robert Altman).  The movie is perfectly watchable but is really only notable for its wander-tourist-eye's-view of Japan.  Monks and weird videogames, flashy lights and flower arranging, it's an interesting place, so the movie's not a total loss.  But it's only fair.",6,0,1,30 September 2003
Doctor Strange," Enjoyable but unexceptional
","Although I did read a single Dr. Strange comic book something like 50 years ago, it's fair to say I don't really know anything about the comic book. So I don't know how true it is to its source material. But divorced from that material, I found this a reasonably entertaining piece of nonsense that felt like it could have been better.The movie begins with a terrific opening scene in which people fight on the side of a building which is turning in on itself. Weird stuff happening with architecture is a common theme in the movie and is consistently entertaining.Then we meet Cumberbatch as a brilliant, arrogant surgeon whose golden hands are destroyed in an accident. Soon he discovers a temple in Katmandu that he believes can help him. It is headed by Tilda Swinton, and my response to that was, immediately, why is this white lady in charge of an Asian temple? This turns out to have been part of the Asian whitewashing complaints, but ignoring that entirely, it just seems weird, and goes totally unaddressed in the film.It is one of various small things that added together weaken the film. Another is the magical cape that makes an appearance. Again, I'm not familiar with the original comic books, but the cape in the movie seems like the silliest superweapon ever. It's played for laughs, which is perhaps the only option with something like this, but the cape slapstick felt out of place with the movie overall.The story itself feels a bit rushed. I got little sense of the villains or the actual stakes, and various ideas and twists were just kind of tossed out and never adequately pursued. Strange goes from jerk to hero without much actual character development.What saves the movie from its many flaws are some terrific set pieces, including a fight that takes place while time is reversing, and those crazy architecture battles. The action and special effects are quite good, Cumberthatch does a solid job, and the movie has a sprightly sense of humor. So overall I did like it. But I feel like there was potential for something better. Maybe they'll do better for the sequel?",7,2,3,24 March 2017
Interstellar," Some interesting ideas, but overall unsatisfying
","I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.) The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments. Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others.",6,4,7,13 March 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," complex and fascinating, with a brilliant lead performance
","Fascinating drama about the complexities of the life and the way in which people deal with tragedy and pain. Frances McDormand is absolutely brilliant as the flinty protagonist.While this comparison will put some off, because of the unjust hate the movie gets from a lot of people, this reminded me a bit of Crash in the way it portrayed people as complex, confused messes of bad and good. The movie has no real answers about the human condition, it just points at it and says, well, ain't that something.",9,0,2,3 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Solid though familiar end to the series
","It seems that with every sequel to a film, the odds of infuriating series fans grows exponentially. Episode VII was lambasted for being a retread, Episode VIII was slammed for going too far astray from Star Wars' mythology, and IX has been eviscerated for going back to the VII retread approach. So you could say Star Wars sequels are a lose-lose proposition if not that they all make tons of money and are thus, ultimately, a win-win.IX continues on with the story of conflicted chosen one Rey and conflicted evil one Kylo Ren against the backdrop of the approach of a final, obliterating Sith attack. The characters wander here and there seeking this and that and fighting this one and that one until they reach the big finish. Which is pretty much the description for every Star Wars movie.The path of the conflicted duo is interesting, as are their long-distance battles. There are some nifty action scenes and the last half hour is big and exciting and dramatic.On the downside, the movie's determination to include all the iconic characters from the original trilogy is nothing but strained and awkward fan service. And using cast-off footage of Leia to shoehorn her into the film doesn't work that well, since her responses are controlled not by the logic of the story or the character but by what footage they had on hand.While I would have preferred the fresher approach of VIII, I understand the appeal of ending the series as mindlessly as it started, and of erring on the side of sentimentality; this series has been a big part of a lot of people's lives, after all.While there were weak moments, overall I enjoyed this movie, and thought it was a solid ending for a series that has gone on forever. And with that story finally done, offshoots like The Mandalorian TV series can take the Star Wars world in all sorts of interesting directions.",7,7,19,30 March 2020
Pacific Rim," interesting monsters, boring people
","Robots versus monsters is a very Japanese thing, but that didn't stop an Italian director from making an English language version of one. The result is unfortunately closer in spirit to those old Godzilla movies than to the anime take on the genre. That is, there is little psychology or philosophy, even though the concept of two people working as one would seem to suit such things, and it takes itself quite seriously, with only a tiny bit of humor from some minor characters.The thing that makes this movie worth watching is the action, with some really cool monsters having big, fairly entertaining battles with giant robots. Unfortunately, the movie drags whenever it gets back to the human beings who control those robots. The square-jawed hero, the eager newbie, the cocky jerk, the tough commander, all feel like characters you create when you're too lazy to think. Two weird scientists bring a little humor to their scenes, but only Ron Perlman manages to really stand out in a small but entertaining role.Perhaps Del Toro should stick to Hellboy movies and leave the robot/monster fights to the Japanese",6,0,3,9 October 2013
Corpse Bride," Starts well but doesn't entirely maintain the momentum
","I was not a big fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is why many years went by before I watched this movie. I was instantly taken by the film, which has a surprisingly quiet start for a Burton film. When things take a turn for the weird it is in a clever and entertaining way, and the three principals are all such nice, likable people.As the movie progresses, it gets more and more like what I remember of Nightmare, kind of noisy with an overload of ghoul-themed jokes. I began to just get a little bored. The film picks up for the last 20 minutes, but there's a chunk in the middle that felt overblown and directionless.There's more about the movie I like than don't like, but I wish it was more like its beginning than like Nightmare.",7,0,0,23 June 2013
The Passion of Joan of Arc," over-rated but interesting
","It is often said that Maria Falconetti gave the greatest performance in the history of film acting in this movie. That's nonsense. First off, I don't believe anyone can be said to be the single best artist in any pursuit. Shakespeare is not really the greatest playwright to ever live. But now that people keep saying he's the greatest playwright ever no one has the nerve to suggest perhaps he's just one of many brilliant playwrights.As for Falconetti, she gives a rather stylized performance in a very stylized, visually striking, very artsy movie. Her performance consists of a couple of looks, suffering and rapture, and in both she looks a little nuts, although I was never clear if she was supposed to seem nuts.The main power of her performance comes from a sense of pure exhaustion, and from what I hear the directory did everything he could to wear her down, so it may be less a great performance than just watching someone suffer on screen.The movie itself is cool looking but artificial and not that convincing. Those looking to see a truly great performance in a truly great silent movie should check out Emil Jannings in The Last Laugh.",7,18,38,30 May 2005
Gone Baby Gone," engrossing and entertaining
","There's an interesting though flawed story in Gone Baby Gone, but what is most notable about the film is actually its fascinating view of the underside of a working class Boston neighborhood. There is a very authentic feel to the characters and situations. You can't call it a love letter to Boston, since it deals with the seedier parts, but there is a genuine affection for this world.In structure this is a detective movie. At times it made me think of Raymond Chandler's novels, not for the style, which is decidedly different, but for the distinct, interesting characters and the rather convoluted and unlikely story.Performances are terrific across the board, particularly from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris.The weakest element in the movie is the character of Patrick's wife Angie. The problem is not the acting (although the actress does come across as a little too stylish for her working class neighborhood), the problem is that the character seems superfluous. She is said to be Patrick's partner in the detective business, yet she acts simply as a tag along. She really doesn't do anything, take any actions, come up with any ideas; she mainly just tells Patrick everything he's thinking of doing is a mistake. If they'd just made her his wife this would have been fine, but it just seems weird to make her his partner since she seems to bring nothing to the partnership.Still, it's beautifully directed and acted and the plot has some interesting ideas, although not much one could actually call a surprise. It is overall an excellent film.",8,0,0,28 September 2008
Ant-Man," Dumb but reasonably entertaining
","One of the problems with many superhero movies is there seems to be a philosophy from the producers that as long as you hit the clichés - evil mastermind, likable-but-flawed hero, a little conflict, a little comedy relief - then you don't need to worry about whether anything makes sense, or whether the characters are more than paper cutouts.Ant-Man is a classic example of group-think, special-effects driven Hollywood entertainment. The villain does inexplicably horrible things - kill a guy for raising mild objections to his plan, experiment on cute lambs instead of mice (even though this would be prohibitively expensive) - and yet isn't played as a true sadist. A family conflict is exacerbated by senselessly not offering the perfectly reasonable explanation until late in the movie (an explanation refuted in a coda). The choice of a hero is weirdly arbitrary (considering the film's requirements, a gymnast would have been a better choice).It's not as bad as 2002's Spider-man - the story and characters roughly make sense, at least - but everything is lazy and by-the-book.The movie also has some rather unfortunate 'comedy relief' in the form of a trio of borderline inept criminals. The weakness of the humor is surprising in a movie directed not by a director who has previously specialized in comedy; with the director and star, it's surprising how mildly comic this film is, although it does have its humorous moments, mainly involving the ants.The special effects are decent. Not great, but perfectly serviceable.The action is pretty good. Once again, not great, but there are some solid scenes and a nicely paced ending.Neither the best nor the worst of the Marvel superhero films, Ant-Man is perfectly watchable. And that's about it.",6,2,5,9 May 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Fun old-fashioned comic book brought to life
","This is what I want from my comic book movie adaptations. Captain America is fun, amusing, lively and well paced, with solid character development and a lot of nice action. This movie completely captures the comic book vibe, and has a 1940s movie-serial quality reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark. (My appreciation of it was increased by having watched the rather soggy Thor the previous day.) The funny thing is, I never liked Captain America when I was a kid. He was so stodgy and bland and square-chinned and All-American. I normally prefer angsty X-Men-style superheroes, so I wasn't really that hopeful that I would enjoy this. But I enjoyed it tremendously.",8,0,1,18 July 2012
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Cute comedy
","This silly, guest-star-laden comedy follows a former boy-band star turned solo star turned failing solo star. Andy Samberg plays the self- involved, narcissistic star as he lets a big head eat away at his career.The song parodies are wonderfully accurate parodies of banal, pretentious pop music, and there are some very funny scenes, particularly one involving wolves. But the movie always feels rather slight. Samberg's character has little depth, so his fall from grace feels less like the tragedy of hubris and more like a jerk getting his comeuppance, which means you never really care about the story. It's a very jokey, superficial film, so when it's funny you enjoy it but every time the humor weakens you think, why was I watching this again.While not as funny as Samberg's series, Brooklyn Nine-nine, it's definitely fun.",7,0,2,15 October 2017
Oblivion," Fun, well paced
","This Philip K. Dick-influenced movie offers some surprises, some exciting action, and excellent special effects. I was in the mood for a big, actiony sci-fi film and that's what I got, so I'm happy about it.I will acknowledge that, as is mentioned in the many negative reviews here, that there are issues. Cruise is the only fleshed out character, and that only slightly. You have very little sense of anyone else as a person; I felt particularly bad for Andrea Riseborough, stuck in the role of the bland and obedient wife.Some moments ring false, notably in Cruise's first encounter with Freeman, in which everything is done in a very stupid way. And while the movie aims to create some mystery and ambiguity, at times it feels too pat, with moments that seem to just unrealistically to underline a point.But I don't care; I had fun.",8,2,3,13 August 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," standard celebrity biopic
","Bohemian Rhapsody follows the well-worn groove of celebrity bio-pics, as a brilliant artist pushes his vision into the world while dealing with personal travails before ultimately doing a triumphant celebratory something (the other path, not taken, is similar but with a downbeat ending).Rami Malek makes a persuasive rock star; theatrical, intense, egotistical, driven, his oversized personality masking the lonely, unconfident inner man.But Malek's Freddie Mercury is also pretty annoying, self-centered and arrogant, and ultimately he struck me as someone I wouldn't want to meet. And while at first I found the movie generally entertaining, fueled by Queen's music and Mercury's drive, my attention began to flag as the film became increasingly soap operish, and the final recreation of the 20-minute LiveAid concert was something only a concert-movie fan (I am not one) could love.For me the movie was most notable for the trivia I learned along the way. We Will Rock you was conceived as an audience participation song. Zoroastrianism is still practiced. The filmmakers have no idea when Fat Bottomed Girls came out (judging by where the put it in the movie).Admittedly I am in the minority on IMDB, where almost everyone is raving about this film. And while I was increasingly bored, at the end I looked over at my girlfriend and she was weeping, which I wouldn't have even guessed as a possible reaction to the film. So I guess if you like music-heavy, somewhat fictionalized, thoroughly manipulative biopics, you might love this.",5,3,5,6 March 2019
Burn After Reading," Irredeemably bad movie about irredeemably stupid people
","Coen Brothers comedies at their best, like The Hudsucker Proxy or Raising Arizona, are brilliant, and up until today I would have said that Coen Brothers comedies at their worst are at least mild fun, but this is one is utterly wretched. The movie's plot relies entirely on the stupidity of its unlikeable characters: the cascade of calamity could have been stopped had anyone in it had half a brain. From the half wit who is shocked her insurance won't pay for her cosmetic surgery on, this is a movie about people with no clue. The movie is pointless and dull. Ostensibly a comedy, it fails to be funny in spite of some good performances. Brad Pitt gives it his all as a dopey personal trainer, but like all the other performers he is done in by a script that gives him nothing to work with.This is a terrible, terrible movie, easily the Coen's worst film, and I find the good reviews it has received inexplicable. I can't help but feel that the Coen pedigree is causing people to give it more consideration than it deserves.",2,4,9,10 May 2010
Watchmen," faithful, interesting adaptation
","I wasn't too impressed by ads for this movie, so I decided to check out the original graphic novel instead, which turned out to be quite compelling. Then, of course, I was more curious about the movie, so eventually I got around to watching it, and I thought it did justice to the source material.First off, this looks better than I expected from the ads I saw. I wasn't blown away, but it looked decent, at least on HDTV.But what makes it a good movie is simply that it sticks to the graphic novel, making only minor changes and relatively minor deletions. The movie is what the book is, a revisionist take on both superheroes and hard boiled detectives.I did feel they softened Rorschach a little in the book; he was more the nut-job right wing vigilante in the original book, and leaving out a lot of his most odious thoughts took away a little of the moral complexity. But its still an excellent story, filmed and acted well.",8,0,2,27 November 2009
The Italian Job," acceptable caper film
","This film is one of those that gets such a slow start that I considered giving up on it. In spite of the presence of Donald Sutherland, the first half hour is a rather dull setup for what follows.Fortunately, the movie picks up as planning starts for the caper that is the centerpiece of the film. I developed some hope for the movie during a series of vignettes introducing members of the gang. From then on things were pretty good, and the extended caper sequence itself was quite entertaining.Still, the movie feels hollow. Theron is unconvincing, simply because she looks like she just stepped out of a shampoo commercial. The cars in the movie all have that shiny look of something in a car commercial. It's not that I object to glossy caper films; the 1960s was very good at those, but this movie lacks the overall polish so the glossy slick elements don't feel integrated into the whole. Generating little feeling for its protagonists, the film is somewhat entertaining for the most part but completely insubstantial.",6,1,2,8 July 2005
Justice League," Well, I liked it
","It's amazing Zack Snyder was allowed to direct another superhero movie after the travesty of Batman v Superman, but he did, and while Justice League didn't get the best reviews, I liked it as well as Snyder's Man of Steel (which also got rather mixed reviews, as I recall).In Justice League, Superman is dead and Batman thinks the other superheroes need to join forces, a scheme given urgency by a super-powered supernatural creature after three magical boxes.This leads to a bunch of fun action and entertaining, often amusing interactions between superheroes. Of the heroes, my favorite is Ezra Miller, who plays a very funny, very geeky Flash. And Gal Gadot is still a terrific Wonder Woman. I'm less enthralled by the rest of the cast - I found Affleck pretty bland after Bale's Batman and I can't get excited about Aquaman.There's plenty of solid action, fancy special effects, and witty dialogue. The pace is quick, although sometimes rushed, and the story is solid even if bits of it feel a little tacked on.It's not a perfect movie, but it's a decidedly enjoyable one, and a huge leap up from BvS. So ignore the fact that IMDB gives JL and BvS the same score, because that's ridiculous!",8,1,4,7 May 2018
Man of Steel," Darker, more mythic Superman
","While the dark tone of Man of Steel is clearly influenced by the most recent Batman series, the first thing I thought of was Excalibur. This film is Superman as legend. Here, we get little of Clark Kent on the farm, and only a second of Clark Kent reporter; this movie is all about the epic mythology of Superman.The result is quite intense. There is a more elaborate than usual portrayal of the end of Krypton, with Russel Crowe offering an action hero interpretation of Jor-el that is far removed from Marlon Brando. It's an exciting opening with terrific special effects. Kent's childhood is mainly viewed as an alien trying to cope, and the adult Kent is an angsty hero in hiding.It's a seriously different approach to the character, but I think it's quite enjoyable. No, it's not a 'fun' Superman battling a cartoonish Lex Luthor, nor an 'all-American' Superman defined by his farmer parents, but I thoroughly enjoyed this. The action is terrific; much of it is basically elaborate fist fights between all-powerful beings, which is more entertaining than one might expect.The story is involving, the special effects are impressive, the acting is solid, and even though I like the Chris Reeves Superman, I'm happy to see a different approach to this well-worn material.",8,3,5,2 October 2016
Cast Away," Admirable, but couldn't get into it
","I had trouble getting into Cast Away right from the start. A lot of that has to do with Hanks, who I'm just not a big fan of. And that long FedEx speech, while somewhat interesting, was just not anything that would really happen.I was feeling bored and restless, but I knew the real movie was to come, and the plane scene was pretty stunning and very intense, so that gave me hope.Once he made it to the castaway section, well, I really respect the movie for it's gritty, almost wordless portrayal of a man with no camping skills grimly pushing himself to survive. It's very brave to offer so little dialog. But I just didn't feel it. I saw what the film was doing, I appreciated what it was doing, but I did not connect viscerally with the story. I'm not sure if this is because of my feelings about Hanks or because of the direction, which to me seems a little too Hollywood to really capture the pain and struggle. People love this movie, and I can see appealing things about it, but I gave up after an hour of just not caring.",5,1,2,2 June 2013
The Thing," underwhelming
","The Thing has an interesting start as a man makes a determined effort to kill a dog. It's a disquieting scene, creating a sense of mystery. The movie continues its sense of disquiet for a while, letting you worry without quite knowing why.Unfortunately, after that the movie becomes focused on special effects and explosions. The characters are generic, the story is a little muddled, and some of the most effective scenes are also the least realistic. For me, the most interesting thing about the movie was how much Kurt Russel looked like someone from the band the Bee Gees. I always think of his as Snake Pliskin, but here, in spite of an authoritative role and bushy beard, his baby face and blow-dried hair make him look like a Hollywood actor pretending to be a tough guy. I wish they'd made him a little scragglier. To be fair. I didn't care much for the original movie from the 1950s either. So perhaps this is just not the story for me.",5,5,10,4 September 2013
The Village," unsurprising and slow
","It must be tough being director M. Night Shyamalan. He has built a career off of movies with unexpected turns, and I imagine with each movie it must get harder to come up with something. So while The Village only has two real twists, one of which is surprising but no more so than many other movies by more obscure filmmakers and the other of which I fully expected from the beginning of the film, I have to be fair and say, well, you can't get those great twists every time.The problem with the movie isn't the lack of twists but the fact that it's just rather dull. The stilted speaking style is sort of interesting but also a bit annoying and the story never grabs me. Judy Greer and Adrien Brody are both quite good and there are a couple of effective scenes of suspense, but for the most part the movie is so measured as to feel static.I think much of the problem is Shyamalan uses his twists to make the audience forgive him for any film-making faults. Signs wasn't a great movie, and without the surprising finale I would have walked away disappointed, but because it had a strong pay off it made everything alright. If Shyamalan has run out of clever twists then he is going to have to work on making his movies pay off not with a stunning denouement but with engaging and engrossing film making throughout. Hopefully he'll learn to do that, and won't even need the clever tricks that have endeared him to me.",5,0,1,30 July 2005
Bridge of Spies," Solid historical drama
","Bridge of Spies tells the story of lawyer James B Donovan's defense of a Russian spy and subsequent role as a negotiator in the trade of that spy for U.S. pilot Gary Powers.It didn't strike me as that intriguing a story, honestly, but I like director Stephen Spielberg so I thought I'd take a look.The result is surprisingly engaging. The story is simple but interesting, the movie deftly sketches out cold war tensions, and there are solid doses of humor and drama. While I often find Tom Hanks a little too noble, he nicely underplays Donovan, who comes across not, like a lot of Hanks' roles, as a man so noble that he is on the verge of tears at his own nobility, but rather a smart lawyer with a great deal of integrity. There are no speeches, no tearful moments, but you wind up really admiring the guy.Even better is Mark Rylance as the Russian spy, an odd, phlegmatic little guy with his own kind of integrity.While the movie is entertaining and absorbing, it is a movie that, like Spielberg's Lincoln, feels a little too careful and educational to really bring history to life the way a movie like Spotlight does. Spielberg seems to have lost interest in taking chances (I really think he should break out of his mold and make a Dogme 95-style film), and that can make his films seem a touch stodgy, but he still has that remarkable directorial expertise, and certainly knows how to make a movie.",8,0,1,31 January 2017
Split," dark and suspenseful, but ignore people who claim there's a twist ending
","Split is possibly the most creepy and suspenseful movie of director Shymalan's career. This dark film follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities, brilliantly played by James McAvoy, whose transitions from one personality to another are seamless and who maintains a disturbed, threatening quality through all of them.The movie was, however, slightly wrecked for me because I was trying to guess the 'twist' that some critics claim the movie has. And here's the thing to know: no one would be saying this movie had a twist if it wasn't directed by someone famous for his twists.A twist is when you are lead to believe something and then your perspective is shifted. It's something Twilight Zone did a lot. Split certainly has plot turns, some of them interesting, some rather unconvincing, but none all that surprising. This is a movie about suspense and character, not brilliant plotting. If you spend the movie, as I did, trying to figure out how Shyamalan is going to flip everything on its head, it will take you out of the movie and lead nowhere. But if you just appreciate the beautifully constructed shots and the flow of action, you'll be impressed.There is something very surprising in the last second of the movie, but it's not a plot twist because it doesn't come out of the story. Most people will have to google the ending to understand what it means.This twist distraction is not Shyamalan's fault, but that of critics determined to talk about the director in twist terms regardless of the movie. I just wanted to let people know that, as a public service, so that they can enjoy the movie without false expectations. Because it's well worth watching.",8,3,9,20 October 2017
Kung Fu Panda 2," Excellent follow-up
","I always seem to underestimate the Kung Fu Panda movies. I wasn't that excited to see the first one, because I expected it to be too dopey and silly, but it was an excellent film. But when the sequel came out, I didn't have much interest in seeing it because so often sequels aren't very good. Once again, I was wrong. Since the plot of the first movie was, klutz who learns to be spectacular, the writers had a choice between trying to recreate that, as some writers do (either by introducing a new klutz character or by somehow reducing the star), but this movie takes the more intelligent approach of continuing the character arc. Po is still a goofy panda, but he is also a fantastic fighter who along with his fellow animals is immediately shown in impressive, exciting action. The animation is terrific, with humorous fights and foreboding enemy strongholds. The bad guy is appropriately nasty and quick, and the movie tosses in quick, never soggy moments of emotion. I will be less hesitant to watch the next film in the series.",8,0,1,10 June 2013
Hugo," Excellent movie, especially in the second half
","I liked this movie from the start, although I did have issues with it. The basic idea of a kid living in the infrastructure of a train station is really cool, and his home, with a million gears, is extraordinary. At the same time, I was put off by an early chase scene in which a rather cartoonish villain chases after Hugo. It felt very much like something you'd see in a kid's movie, and while Hugo is very kid friendly, for the most part it does not fall into kid movie clichés. But there are a few, and the chase is one of them.While the whole living in a clock thing is cool, I felt the movie really took off when it started focusing on the second part of the story, which I won't give away. My girlfriend thought this might be where it would lose kids, but I don't think so. The movie becomes better and better, and is really fascinating and touching by the end.",8,2,4,2 December 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," lots of fun, though no T2
","If you go into this expecting a fun action picture that is not going to be at the level of the first two movies, you'll probably have a good time. There are some fun action scenes, a fair amount of amusing jokes referring to the previous movie and a really hot evil robot played by a model whose vacuous model stare works perfectly in the role.But no, it's not as good as the first two. Those movies moved like lightning, offering a breakneck speed that kept you from catching your breath. T2 was a thrill ride from beginning to end, and T3 never works up that sort of momentum. Its holes are easier to pick at than the previous movies (although not terrible by action movie standards) and the ending is downright disappointing. But if rather than comparing it with two of the best action films ever made, you compare it with more typical action flicks, it's superior to many, a good but not great movie that is energetic fun most of the time with some terrific moments here and there. Yes, it would have been better directed by James Cameron rather than some director so obscure that I don't know how he finagled the job, but it's still effectively directed. Just lower your expectations a little bit and watch it.",7,0,1,18 June 2004
"I, Robot"," fun action flick, but far dumber than its source (spoilers at end)
","Back in 1950, Isaac Asimov did something very interesting. He decided to explore all the ways robots could effect society outside of taking it over and killing everyone, creating fiction based on the premise that robots are programmed to be inherently incapable of harming humans. I, Robot begins with Asimov's three rules of robotics and takes its title from his collection of short stories, but that's about it.In the movie, Will Smith plays a detective deeply distrustful of robots all the world considers safe, and when an scientist commits suicide he quickly becomes convinced that something is robotically fishy.Smith apparently has run out of charm, because he has none in this movie. His wise cracks are so poor that when scientist foil Bridget Moynahan doesn't laugh you don't laugh right along with her. His character is actually rather unpleasant, obtuse and unlikeable. I don't know what the point is of hiring Will Smith if you're not going to give him a charming character to play.The movie, however, is pretty fun, with good special effects and a lot of running around and shooting things and big actiony events and all that. And for those looking for a mindless action flick with occasional moments of cleverness, this is a good bet. But my main objection can only be raised with .../************************ SPOILERS *************************/.My main objection to this movie is actually calling it I,Robot, because that made me expect it would actually challenge itself to avoid the usual robot clichés by keeping within Asimov's three laws of robotics. And the weird thing is, the authors don't even seem to be willing to admit that they don't, even a character state near the end that the three rules are 'perfect.' But they're not perfect, they are broken, so that makes no sense.My objection is that Asimov was forcing himself to think outside the box by cutting himself off from the predictable robot threat, and the movie, in spite of its source material, jumps right back into the usual robot clichés with both feet. Honestly, if the movie had just said 'based on a concept by Isaac Asimov' and titled itself something else I would have no objections - there has been some good sci-fi that acknowledged and then broke Asimov's three rules - but by trying to align itself so closely with Asimov's book it just points out how trite this movie is. It's really a minor complaint, but it bugs me./************************ END SPOILERS *********************/.",7,0,0,30 July 2005
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Wow
","Into the Spider-Verse has everything. I mean, it is stuffed to the gills with everything. The animation combines graffiti art, anime, and Warner Bros. cartoons. The story is a crazy kaleidoscope. So much happens on screen simultaneously that you can't possibly see it all. Characters are varied and engaging, ideas come at you like popping corn.You would think it would all be too much, and yet, it's just not. The movie ties all this together with strong characters and a strong narrative thread. It's funny and engaging and thoroughly remarkable. You should really watch it right away.",9,0,2,17 March 2019
BASEketball," more laughs in one episode of South Park
","Baseketball starts out pretty well, with some funny gags, and I had high hopes for it for perhaps the first 10 minutes.  But 20 minutes in I was just feeling bored.  It would get a few good laughs in, then there'd be a dead spot for a few minutes, then some other funny stuff.  After half an hour I thought I'd see what people had said here, and people said it was sick and hilarious and outrageous, so I thought, maybe the sick outrageous stuff is just around the corner, and watched another 40 unexceptional minutes.  Then I gave up, even though there was less than half an hour left.  I just felt I was wasting my time.Besides not being especially funny, this is also a very poorly conceived movie.  The baseketball premise isn't especially bad, but after showing the amusing process of creating it there's not really any place to go except the lame, purposely cliched plot that unfolds.  The movie is also a little too enamored of its stars.  Why are they the only ones able to do really creative psyche-outs?  There are no other clever practical jokers in the entire world except these two guys?  This attempt at Airplane-style humour has about 40 minutes of material stretched out to an hour and a half.  A lot of people seem to like it, but it's really pretty tepid.",5,3,10,11 June 2004
Salt," draggy
","From the commercials, this looked like a fast paced action film, but it's more along the lines of a slow-paced action film. For the first 25 minutes there's all setup with no action, which I could have accepted if once the bullets started flying I found it entertaining. But somehow even the action sequences felt sluggish, and the are intercut with flashbacks and terse discussions that belie the trailer's promise of non-stop action. Instead this is stop and start action, and even during the most hectic parts it feels labored and dreary.Perhaps the problem is how seriously the movie takes itself. It's a ridiculous story with unconvincing plot elements and unsurprising twists, but the film acts like it's very grim and important, as though the director simply couldn't accept that at best his movie could be a fun piece of fluff. Alas, the movie is flufless.",4,2,4,6 May 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," Overrated but fairly typical indie drama
","Over the years, indie films have become, in many ways, as formulaic as the Hollywood blockbusters that are their supposed opposites. Silver Linings Playbook is such a film. It is a standard misfit romance that tries to combine quirk with pathos(as is often the case, its fence straddling between the two means it does neither well), and the ending is pat even by Hollywood standards.It's also a movie that rings false throughout. This is not mental illness, this is movie-mental illness, in which a set of symptoms are chosen based on what the director wants the characters to do and feel. My social-worker girlfriend said the guy really struck her as more developmentally disabled than mentally ill, and while that would never have occurred to me, I can see her point. He's really more badly behaved than anything else, and it's hard to tell if his main problem is mental illness or just a streak of stupidity. His emotional evolution makes no sense as well; the change is too fast, radical and complete to be considered remotely real, and we don't really see it happening.Even the dance contest in the end doesn't seem real; it is as though two separate contests are overlapped.There are good moments in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence, while probably not really deserving of her Oscar, does a nice job of creating someone both tough and emotionally fragile. There are also bad moments, like a surprisingly off-key 'emotional' scene with De Niro. There was a time, back in the 1990s, when an indie movie promised something that was in some way different. I miss those days.",6,5,8,5 January 2014
Van Helsing," equal parts exciting and absurd
","I love director Stephen Sommers because of his apparent love for 40s B-movie thrillers, and perhaps that's why other people don't like him. It seems that a bad action movie with a modern sensibility like Spider-Man is always better received than a fun, distinctly old-fashioned picture like The Mummy. I don't know what to make of it.Like The Mummy, Van Helsing got more bad reviews than it deserved, although admittedly it does have problems. The movie is best at the very beginning in a black and white sequence evoking the old Frankenstein/Dracula movies of the 40s while tossing in 21st century special effects. This is classic Sommers. It then changes to color, for no discernible reason except you can't make a whole movie in black and white in 2004.Action scenes are incredibly exciting. The movie is big and fast and monster transformations happen with a tremendous speed that makes them at times startling. Hugh Jackman is great and Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous.But while Van Helsing is exciting, it fails miserably at being scary. This is the movie's weak point. The vampire's hover between scary and camp, not quite landing at either point. So what should be eerie or terrifying just comes across as silly. It feels as though Sommers realized he couldn't get scary and so played some scenes for laughs, but he couldn't give up the idea of making things scary so he kept trying, basically fighting against himself.One also has pretty much no feeling for the characters. This is perhaps the main difference between Van Helsing and those old horror movies, which mixed a sense of tragedy and loss into the thrills. But for all its flaws, the movie has that roller-coaster thrill ride sensibility that keeps a smile on your face.",7,6,11,16 April 2005
Monsters vs. Aliens," Cute and often very funny
","After a rather slow beginning in which a girl gets proposed to, the movie picks up when she gets turned into a giant on her wedding day and from that on the film is frenetically comic. Like most Dreamworks cartoons, this one can feel like it's trying too hard (Dreamworks has a Looney-Tunes-on-speed approach that can be a little exhausting), but at its best the movie is wildly funny.The story and characters are admittedly generic, but pleasantly so. But there is a certain annoying laziness to the plotting. The death of one character is treated as sad even though the audience is given no reason to care, and the female empowerment angle is a bit on the silly side. The plot is at a kid's movie level, even though the humor is funniest enough for this adult.Not a great cartoon, but a very enjoyable one.",7,6,8,13 January 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," dark and absorbing
","I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie at the beginning. The film was gray and had a murky quality, and the first characters I saw were too understated and a little mumbly. I was also a little unclear as to what was happening at first.As the movie progressed, it became a little more interesting. It became darker. Then it introduced a mystery, which made somewhat centered it. Then it got much darker still. As the movie moved along, I was increasingly drawn in. Many of the things that had initially put me off - Daniel Craig's understated performance, the deliberate pacing, the oppressive, almost monochromatic style - started to fit together nicely.The movie winds up working for a number of different reasons. The dragon-tattoo girl is an intriguing character who has most of the best scenes in the movie. The mystery is well done (although it follows a not-unusual mystery-book path) and the movie does a nice job of making slogging through old documents interesting, mainly by focusing on photographic evidence. The movie extends in both directions past the mystery itself, which makes the characters more than just detectives.While it probably took me a half hour before I was sure I was going to stick with the movie, by the end I was ready for the sequel.",8,2,6,16 June 2012
Spider-Man," Terrible, terrible script
","I just watched 2012's Amazing Spider-Man, and it reminded me of how hugely disappointed I was by this 2002 movie. And I just feel like ranting about it, because ten years later, it still really bugs me.It's funny what I remember from this movie. For example, I remember Peter practicing with his web by shooting it at a soda can. I remember that because I remember how the can was placed to perfectly display the brand name in a way that shouted out THIS IS PRODUCT PLACEMENT! If they had set the can down so the brand name was slightly off center I probably wouldn't remember that now.But that wasn't the problem with the movie. That was fine. I recall it being a cute scene. The problem with the movie was the script seemed to have been written by a bunch of people who weren't reading each other's contributions. The best example of this involved Peter and Mary Jane. Early in the film, Peter is either practicing saying something to MJ or writing something to her - I don't recall which - along the lines of, 'you don't really know me even though we live next door blah blah blah.' At the end of the movie, MJ makes this speech to Peter about how she realizes he was always there for her. It really aggravated me, because those two tiny segments are opposites that don't belong in the same movie. How can you make a huge, big-budget film and not catch that contradiction?The real problem with this movie, though, is the bad guy. I don't really remember the story, I just remember there really wasn't much of one. The bad guy was lame and it all went nowhere.Overall, this was a terrible series, with only Spider-Man 2 worth watching (and that one was not as good as The Amazing Spider-Man). But what bugs me most of all is how so few people seemed to have noticed what a terrible script this movie had. What's up with that?",5,0,3,15 December 2012
Dunkirk," War as survival
","Most war movies are about fighting the enemy, but this is a movie about escaping overwhelming forces. Many of the soldiers are desperate, broken men who just want to live.The movie follows a number of people, including a soldier constantly scrambling to escape the beach, a ship owner determined to do his part, and some fighter pilots. We don't learn much about these people; while many horror movies celebrate the individual, Dunkirk looks at its characters more as representative types of a massive group.The filmmaking is extraordinary from the first, striking scene of soldiers under a hail of leaflets. The score, low and droning, expresses the constant edgy, suspenseful feel of war.This movie is also unafraid of the quiet moments in war. The times pilots aren't in a firefight, or soldiers are simply waiting for the next crisis.I'm not especially into war movies, and I was disappointed when I heard Christopher Nolan's latest fell into that overworked genre, but it's still a very impressive film.",9,1,5,1 April 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The difference between a workmanlike adaptation and cinema art
","The first two Harry Potter movies were faithful, efficient adaptations of their respective books. I enjoyed them, although since I had read the books and they just retold the story of those books I felt they would have been more fun for someone who did not already know the story.This third movie is something entirely different. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who helmed the brilliant, magical A Little Princess, Cuaron adds a lyrical quality to the magic and brings Hogswart alive in a way Chris Columbus, the competent but unimaginative director of movies Like Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire, failed to do in his movies. Columbus brought the sort of magic you get from a stage magician, Cuaron makes magic come alive.Skimming the other reviews I get the impression a lot of people were put of by the darkness of this film. Having read all the Potter books I am ahead of the movies in terms of grimness: I am so used to the darkness of later books that it didn't even occur to me this one was dark. I must warn those who don't read the books that things are going to get much, much grimmer in the succeeding movies. Honestly I wish the books weren't getting so brutally tragic, but I still find them fascinating.Sadly, none of the future Potter movies are to be directed by Cuaron, and I won't be surprised if this is the most artful of the series.",8,0,1,5 June 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," A much more promising start than the last Spider-Man
","2002's Spider-Man was an awful movie, mainly due to an incompetent script. It was followed by the decent Spider-Man 2 but returned to form with another bad one, Spider-Man 3. That series was not the right way to do Spider-Man; this movie is the right way. While the 2002 film felt like it had been written by a committee who were neither familiar with the original material nor reading one another's work, this movie appears to have been written by people who repeatedly asked the question no one ever asked during the first series: 'does this make sense?'For the most part, Amazing Spider-Man does make sense, with a fairly convincing origin story (except for a lack of explanation as to why what happened to Peter couldn't be used to create millions of Spider-Mans). The movie takes its time as Peter transitions from dweeb to super hero, then it gets into a super-villain story that also makes sense, and (again unlike the earlier film) is exciting and well paced.The surprising thing about this movie is how serious Peter is. The tradition of the series is a wise-cracking good guy, but while Spidey does get some witty lines, the movie is better represented by the way Peter removes his mask in one scene to calm a child; it's more about the Spider-Man with a deep compassion and a need to make the world better than the Spider-Man who likes to swing through the air and beat up mutant creatures. I would have liked more wise cracking, but I appreciate the approach.Far better than the overrated The Avengers, this is a superhero movie done right. It is not the most memorable movie, and it doesn't have anything as notable as the famous upside-down kiss from the 2002 film, but it is very solid. And while in the week since I saw it most of the details have faded away, that's much better than that 2002 film, which created so many bad memories that I can still, all these years later, reel off a list of all the movie's problems.Watch this.",8,26,39,15 December 2012
The Lego Movie," Really funny, increasingly amazing
","This is a really good movie that becomes an incredibly great one in the last half hour.What's nice about this movie is how well it dives into the essence of child's play. While the game has its characters and its sets, it's goofy story and surprise characters seem very much like the creation of a child unbound by concepts of what is right and wrong in storytelling.At the same time, the story holds together in a way a kid's story wouldn't. For all its craziness, it's very well thought out.Most of the way through this movie I would have given it 8 stars, but the final sequences are so utterly brilliant and unexpected that I had to give it 9.",9,1,5,12 May 2014
Now You See Me," Tremendously entertaining and completely absurd
","There is so much to complain about in this movie. The approach to hypnosis is patently absurd, the plot is full of holes, the denouement makes little sense, and in spite of all its twisty twists, much of it is predictable (oh look, the police are stupidly doing the obvious thing!) and clichéd, and character motivation seems beyond the grasp of the writers.I don't care, I love it.This movie is pure showmanship, starting with a card trick that shows exactly how amazing magic tricks can be. The stars are playful and relaxed (Harrelson and Fisher are particularly good), the constant twists are fun, and the movie moves like lightning and plays like opening a series of Christmas presents.But yeah, it's stupid. The stupidest thing is probably Morgan Freeman's character, who exposes magician's secrets. It's an odd premise, in that he acts like he's on a mission (think The Amazing Randi's attacks on psychic fakery), when no one thinks magicians are terrible tricksters who must be exposed. It's just bizarre. And while Freeman is, of course, great, he cannot make his character's actions or attitude make any real sense.So yeah, dumb, stupid, irretrievably ridiculous movie. I loved it.",8,1,2,9 August 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Terrifically entertaining
","Tieing with X-Men First Class for best movie of the series, DOFP is a blast from the insanely exciting opening battle. The action scenes are all well done, and there is a scene with Quicksilver taking on a roomful of armed men that is absolutely brilliant.I often feel modern action films are a little too desperate to keep BIG THINGS happening all the time (it was my objection The Avengers), but DOFP is nicely paced, focusing more on character than special effects, even though the special effects are terrific. It's a relatively thoughtful take on the comic book movie.There is one plot point that I felt was weak. Basically, a decision is made in the beginning that results in trouble later on, and it's something anyone with half a brain would have foreseen. And the case for that decision seemed severely under-developed. It's a flaw I can live with, but I wish it weren't there.",9,0,2,2 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Best of the Marvel series so far
","If you didn't know the title, you might not guess that this is a Captain America movie. It has most of the Avengers in it and seems very much like a direct sequel to Ultron with a bit more focus on Captain America. But since I really liked Ultron, and feel the Captain America movies are the best of the Marvel series, I'm okay with whatever they want to title this.The movie begins with a big superhero vs. supervillain fight that results in civilian carnage. This isn't unusual in the superhero movie world, but what is unusual is that rather than glossing over this, this movie shows both the distress of the superheroes involved and the trauma of those who lost people in that fight. And that trauma leads to a request that the Avengers register with the United Nations and act under their authority. Some of the Avengers agree to this, like Iron Man, while others, like Captain America, prefer to remain free agents. What's interesting is that rather than doing something simple, like having this be a plot by bad guys or by putting the superheroes into a bureaucratic nightmare, the movie raises the idea but throws in a big attack before the new agreement can really be implemented. And while for much of the movie it looks like the writers are more on the side of the Libertarian faction, by the end the audience is left to decide for themselves which side is right (I suspect the division line will be a political one involving how you feel about the U.N. in general).This all sounds pretty weighty, but the movie is actually tremendously fun with a lot of great action. There's a long, amazing superhero vs. superhero fight that absolutely amazing, and the movie has a good sense of humor even as it considers very serious topics.This is not just good for a Marvel universe movie, this would be good for an X-Men movie.",9,1,7,25 September 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," What I saw left me underwhelmed
","This is basically a placeholder review, which is why I'm not rating it. I saw it on a plane and missed maybe the first half hour, so I should see that before I come to any final conclusions.The creatures are imaginative and probably look pretty cool on the big screen, and the acting is pretty good, but there doesn't seem to be much story. The movie - and this may in part be simply because of where I started watching it - seemed more an excuse to show off a bunch of crazy creatures than anything else.I'm surprised that something written by JK Rowling is so simply plotted; perhaps she needs the space of a novel to create her magic.",Null,0,0,30 March 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," funny, very offbeat combo of kung fu movies, comic books and hipster attitude
","What to make of this movie? I really liked it, it's fun and funny and stylishly made. But what on earth is it? A love story? A martial arts parody? A living comic book? It's all of those, really. And a movie about nerdy hipsters (I know hipsters are supposed to be 'cool,' but they all seem like nerds to me) playing indie music and coping an attitude. The movie is sweet and silly, but outside of that it's tough to categorize, because it just comes from some weird place I've never been.Which is fine, except it kept me a little out of the movie. None of it makes any sense, the male lead is a bit of a jerk, even if his nebishy persona makes that seem less objectionable, and The Girl is just some girl with colored hair who acts mysterious but doesn't come *across* as mysterious. And of course, that's much of the point, that these ordinary people are involved in this bizarre alternate world that's not really an alternate world but just this world with fights the way musicals are this world with song and dance. But part of me wanted to care about these characters and I often felt the movie was getting in the way of that.So I enjoyed it, and appreciated its cleverness, and would recommend it, and yet, part of me found it opaque, perhaps because I'm a middle-aged guy who isn't the right generation to have absorbed these varied influences to the point where they make sense together.Worth watching.",8,2,8,1 December 2011
Enchanted," Fun movie that treads a fine line between embracing and mocking Disney princesses
","This is a very enjoyable movie, with some great laughs (the scene with the rats and pigeons is brilliant), engaging performances, fun musical numbers, and a general feel-good sweetness.It's also a movie that manages to make fun of Disney movies (of which it is one) and still embrace the sugary sweetness at their center. The movie lightly mocks love at first sight and a Pollyanna-ish world view, but ultimately it winds up simply replacing the Disney cartoon versions of these tropes with the Rom-Com versions. Honestly, I feel one could sit down and write an essay about that sleight of hand, but I won't, because a) I'm lazy, and b) it's a very fun movie that doesn't ask you to think, so I won't.",8,0,0,14 March 2015
Inside Out," One of Pixar's Best Films
","Such a wonderful movie, very funny, exciting and affecting. The movie portrays a young girls emotions as competing creatures in her head, and it's wonderful how much it all makes sense. It's apparent that the movie took the premise very seriously and wanted to get it right - this is no Herman's Head (not that I have any problem with Herman's Head).The movie does a beautiful job both in its simple framing story of a girl dealing with the disruption of her life and in the tale of her inner emotions and how they relate and sometimes misunderstand one another. This is of the standard of the best of Pixar, along with Up and Wall-E. A number of people have posted that this movie is more for adults than kids - my girlfriend said the same thing - but I'm not sure if that's true. While it has a sophisticated view of emotion, it's not one that's hard to understand. The characters are relatable and the movie is fast and fun. And kids aren't quite as obtuse as people think. I don't have any kids though, so I'm just guessing that they might like it after all. Having had a traumatic move at age 6, I certainly would have related.",10,9,37,2 August 2015
Yesterday," A slight but ingenious comedy
","Yesterday has a terrific premise: a failed musician wakes up one morning to discover that no one but him remembers The Beatles (or, for that matter, Coca-Cola). Realizing that he is sitting on a trove containing some of the greatest pop songs ever written, he passes them off as his own and heads towards stardom.There's not a lot of story to this, but what there is flows along breezily, keeping you interested in what's coming next. It's a light, old-fashioned, feel-good fantasy comedy that is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for after seeing the trailer.While I am able to suspend disbelief over the whole no-Beatles thing, I find the relationship between the singer and his manager less believable. For it to work out as he did he would have had to be far stupider and more awkward than he was. It's not a huge thing, but it does bug me.(The idea that having a lot of brilliant songs is enough to make you succeed in music is also a bit doubtful, but I'll let that one slide.)The cast is excellent. Himesh Patel has a nice voice, Lily James is charming, and Kate McKinnon brings her usual comic intensity to the role of a snarky manager.Also, it's got a ton of really nice Beatles covers.",8,1,2,14 October 2019
Resident Evil," Finally, a video game adaption done right
","This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.",7,96,164,8 October 2003
Avengers: Endgame," entertaining and at times exhausting
","This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, 'oh yeah, them.'The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious 'wow' moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before.",8,12,23,17 August 2019
No Country for Old Men," interesting yet boring
","I love the Coen Brothers for their Quirky comedies like Raising Arizona and Hudsucker Proxy, but I am always underwhelmed by their pulp dramas, like Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing and, most recently, No Country for Old Men.I could tell early on I wasn't going to like this, but got sucked in by a brilliant, menacing performance by Javier Bardem. Like John Turturo in Miller's crossing, Bardem is an electrifying presence in a sea of blandness. Bardem's scenes are gripping and mesmerizing, but that leaves the 60% to 70% without him quite dull.Structurally the movie is interesting. The movie relies on the audiences' familiarity with film structure to raise certain expectations and then thwarts those expectations one by one. It's an interesting idea, but while arguably what happens is more likely than what usually happens in movies, it's also less interesting and less clever. And since the movie as a whole still isn't realistic (and is also decidedly mannered), there doesn't seem to be much point in throwing in some realistic events to try and add some irony.As mentioned above though, I never like Coen Brothers pulp dramas, so if you like the others, you ought to like this one too.",5,1,3,20 September 2008
District 9," Not much subtlety, but lots of style
","All I knew about District 9 going in was that the shaky camera made some people ill and it was an allegory about racism. I did not realize how exciting and entertaining the film was.District 9 is unusual in its approach to special effects. Most sci-fi films look very slick and really show off, but its docu-drama, handicam look is very different, and lends a certain sense of realism to the aliens and the technology. The aliens themselves are really impressive creations.The story is a variation on the everyman-caught-up-in-extraordinary-circumstances trope. Its most interesting aspect is that while everymen in movies tend to be a little better than the average man, District 9's protagonist is neither especially nice nor especially smart, and is a rather pathetic specimen. The story itself isn't especially surprising or original, but it's done well and keeps moving.The allegory is anything but subtle, but the movie certainly makes its point, and does so fairly quickly to leave lots of room for blowing up stuff.I feel there are a few plot holes that I would like filled, but all-in-all this is a very entertaining, well-filmed movie.",9,0,1,26 December 2009
Mamma Mia!," The most disturbing horror film of 2008: Mamma Mia!
","I hated this movie from the first scene. As a trio of young women, lead by Amanda Seyfried's remarkably stupid character, giggled and sang, I felt like I was being bludgeoned by stupid sticks, or smothered in pillows made of idiocy. I should have stopped watching immediately, but like a car accident, I just had to get a closer look.After further establishing its remarkably moronic plot (a scheme as dumb as that in The Parent Trap; Seyfried's stupidity would make more sense were she 12 years old), the movie introduces a second trio of giggly women, only this time middle-aged, who also run and jump and romp and make funny faces.There are a lot of issues with this movie, from being a musical beset by a casting process where singing ability was irrelevant (it seems purely accidental that Christine Baranski and Seyfried have decent voices) to having a terrible story, but I think this might have worked, or at least been tolerable, if not for the terrible, terrible direction. While I'm sure the goal was to create something bubbly and fun, the constant running and jumping and dancing and face-making feels frenetic and often borders on hysteria. It is like being seated in a restaurant next to a large group of drunk women laughing and getting drunker.I made it through about forty minutes, and while, to be fair, nothing was as agonizing as the first 10 minutes, nothing was worth watching.If you want to have mindless fun, listen to an ABBA album. If you want to be beaten by stupid sticks, this is the movie for you.",3,1,4,22 August 2013
Toy Story 4," Another good one
","The Toy Story movies have been consistently good, and in spite of taking a while to get started, this one is no exception. The beginning is mild, as Woody frets about the happiness of his latest owner who creates her own very peculiar doll, but once it gets going with a wonderfully funny and creepy scene in an antique store it never stops, is wonderfully inventive, and in the new tradition of kick-ass heroines gives us a rogue Bo Peep.Like Toy Story 3, the movie's finale is an elaborate caper type of thing, and while I wouldn't say it was quite as perfect as the equivalent bit of Toy Story 3 (my favorite film in the series), it is very well done.This is also possibly the most touching movie in the series, perhaps because it looks like it may be the last. But if they decide to make another one in spite of an ending that would seem to preclude that, I'm totally on board.",8,0,6,14 October 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Not quite what I imagined
","I read The Hobbit almost 40 years ago. I don't recall it that well, but I do remember a small, charming adventure story with an appealingly unsure protagonist and a really cool creature called Gollum.Perhaps my impression of the book is wrong, because it bears very little resemblance to the CGI-fueled spectacle I just witnessed.The movie begins with a long explanation of how the dwarfs lost their kingdom, and then a sequence with an elderly Bilbo Baggins writing his memoirs, and this surprised me, because I thought the book just got right into it. Since I have a copy (I'm thinking of reading it again at some point), I checked, and sure enough, the 13 minutes that begin the film have nothing to do with the beginning of the book.It was a short book, but for reasons I presume have to do with making money it has been divided into three parts, the first of which is almost 3 hours long. But it all feels pretty padded; most scenes in the movie could be edited to half the length without any loss of sense. It as though they didn't want one dollar they spent on special effects to go for naught.At an hour and a half, this would actually have been a pretty entertaining movie. It would begin well if you cut out that first unnecessary 13 minutes, the Gollum scene is fun, and while scenes of a small band of dwarfs taking on thousands of enemies struck me as ludicrous even in the confines of a fantasy story, I did really like those big birds that show up later. And it is nice to see Bilbo's personal evolution.Here I must admit that I don't like the LOTR trilogy. I find them as slow and full of excess as I do this version of the Hobbit. But then, I feel the same way about the books, so I can accept that the movies reflect accurately what Tolkein was doing. Not so with The Hobbit. The Hobbit could have been turned into one entertaining two-hour movie, but I will leave it to others to slog through the rest of this newest trilogy.",6,1,3,13 June 2013
The Princess Bride," Clever and so much fun
","Both a tribute to and parody of fairy tales, The Princess Bride is a rollicking adventure centered around a troubled romance.The leads are attractive and likable, but it's the goofy supporting characters that are most memorable. The story is self-consciously absurd in a good way, the actors are excellent, the pace never flags, and the script is one of those that manages to come up with several lines that have planted themselves firmly in popular culture.This is also very much a boys movie, by which I mean everyone in it is a boy except the titular princess, who is pleasant but kind of dumb. This makes sense; the frame is a man telling a story to his grandson, but I wish the princess had been a little smarter and had a smidge more personality.Still, hugely entertaining fluff.",8,0,1,5 October 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," I've just got to stop watching Wes Anderson movies
","My fondness for Royal Tennenbaums combined with the critical acclaim and distinct look of Wes Anderson's movies always sucks me in, but I've regretted every Anderson film I've watched from Darjeeling Limited on, and Budapest Hotel is no exception.I can't say a lot about the plot because I saw the movie on a red-eye and slept through the middle. From what I saw it's about a man who inherits a painting and has some trouble about it.The man is played by Ralph Fiennes and he is terrific as a cool, quick-witted, unflappable character. His dialogue is sharp and funny. The movie overall is pleasantly goofy.,So why didn't I like it? Well ...Some movies engage and draw in the viewer. Some movies try to do that a fail. But Budapest Hotel strives to distance the viewer as much as possible. Characters are filmed at a distance and speak in rapid-fire patter that never achieves the warm quirky charm you get from patter-classics like The Front Page or Bringing Up Baby. The movie feels like a clever experimental short built around the concept of people in a dollhouse and stretches it out forever. Everything in this screams out FORMAL EXPERIEMENT; nothing screams out CARE ABOUT THIS.Would I have enjoyed this movie more if I'd not been so sleepy? Maybe a little. I might have found this a more almost-fun movie like Fantastic Mr. Fox rather than an increasingly annoying one like Moonrise Kingdom. But ultimately I find all of Anderson's later films are quirk-heavy stylistic exercises that leave me cold, and there was nothing in what I saw of Hotel to make me believe my reaction wide awake would have differed much from my reaction half asleep.So this is it. No matter how the critics rave, Budapest will be my last Anderson movie. For those of you who like this sort of thing, ENJOY!",4,5,11,5 October 2018
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Brilliant idea for a short comedy sketch
","The premise of this movie, in which a couple of helpful hillbillies are mistaken by panicked college kids for serial killers, is absolutely brilliant, and I was very excited when I saw the trailer. But alas, the movie itself wasn't really particularly funny, and after about a third of it I got bored and started skipping through looking for funny bits I never found.Once you've got the idea of this movie it doesn't really have any place to go. People will die in predictable ways and the film will offer up all sorts of genre-appropriate clichés. The most interesting idea involves an attempt at conflict resolution, but once again the execution fails a good idea. My feeling is this movie chose a center ground when it would have been better at one of the extremes. Tucker and Dale don't quite seem like real people, but they aren't that broadly drawn either, and the kids are too generic to be interesting. I think the movie either should have gone full Scary Movie, with the silliness ramped up to 11, or it should have made Tucker and Dale feel like genuine backwoods types caught in a bad situation and explored the way we make assumptions about one another. Of those two choices, I'm inclined to prefer the former, but either would be better than the actual movie.",5,2,8,22 May 2017
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Enjoy the workings of the mechanism
","Watching Ghost Protocol is a bit look opening up a wind-up watch and observing all the little parts working away. There is a beauty to the structure that is interesting even though there's really nothing beyond that.I hadn't meant to watch any more MI films after being underwhelmed by the first two, and only watched this because director Brad Bird has made some interesting movies (although he's written his best movies, and did not write this one).Like the previous movies, the movie is visually monochromatic (even the Indian scenes use a limited color palette) and the characters are bland and muted. There are a lot of very popular action series I would describe this way (like the Bourne movies) so it's clearly something some people really like, but I like my action more colorful (i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark or something by Jackie Chan).What made the movie enjoyable was it's intricate action scenes, like a chase through a sandstorm and a fight in an automobile factory. Scenes like these were enjoyable pieces of clockwork, as is the script itself, which is a tightly constructed series of plans turning to disasters.There is also a solid non-action sequence in a hotel that is the truest thing I've seen to the original TV series, which was not about action but was more of a series of fancy cons.It's certainly not a great movie, but it is a mindlessly enjoyable one.",7,0,2,3 November 2019
28 Days Later...," by-the-numbers Armageddon
","Take Day of the Triffids, Omega Man and bits and pieces of other horror flicks, stir them all together and you've got 28 Days Later, a painfully predictable and only occasionally exciting movie. I wouldn't object to the fact that the movie doesn't have a thought in its head if it was scarier, and I would mind the rather mild thrills if the movie were original and clever, but this movie is so utterly insubstantial in all ways (except for the rather stylish look) that it felt like a complete waste of my time. I thought the cast was good and some of the early scenes were actually quite effective, but by the half way point the movie had completely wore out its welcome as it became increasingly unlikely and unpleasant. The whole thing was just plain dumb.",4,2,4,19 May 2004
Avengers: Infinity War," terrific movie except for the 'ending'
","Infinity War does a truly amazing job of stuffing as many superheroes into a single movie as possible and keeping track of most of them. Sure, some get lost in the shuffle, little more than cameos, but a remarkable number are given emotional depth, which makes it light years ahead of the overrated first Avengers movie, in which the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts designed to support the action.The movie is witty, likable, and engaging, establishing huge odds and placing it's full bet on crazy, leave-no-man-behind heroism. It goes on a little long, and towards the end the action becomes a little bombastic, but overall it's tremendous fun.The movie also, like The Empire Strikes back, ends in the middle. I really hate that. I also feel it telegraphs the next movie. I mean, you really can't engage in such wholesale slaughter without the assumption that in spite of all odds something will be done, and this blunts the emotional impact of the whole thing.Is the resolution to this movie really so elaborate that it requires it's own movie? Couldn't the bloat and some of the nonsensical plot extenders (like a blindingly stupid and unlikely moment from Starlord) have been removed to make a single zippy film? Probably, but that's not what happened. Alas.",8,1,8,24 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Entertaining and surprisingly genial movie
","I'd been hesitant to watch this film because I'd heard there was extreme violence and so the first thing I want to mention is all the violence in this movie is in one 10-minute scene and outside of that's it's pretty much a shambling goof of a movie.Basically it creates a fictional duo, an actor and his stuntman/driver, and puts them in the midst of a famous historical moment. It's a weird idea, and very much true to the title, but it works. It's basically an amusing buddy picture.There are some terrific things in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is the way Tarantino shot Cliff's visit to the Hollywood set taken over by the Manson family as though it were an old-school western. And there's an absolutely lovely scene that is simply Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate enjoying her movie.Of the films I've seen by Tarantino this is the one that's closest to a feel-good movie. It starts a little slow, but overall it's just very enjoyable. I'd recommend it.",8,7,9,2 June 2020
Behind The Candelabra," Depressing but well done
","This movie about Liberace's relationship with Thorson is wonderfully acted by Douglas and Damon, effectively filmed, well written, and, for me, not especially enjoyable. I found Damon's powerlessness in the relationship depressing, and while Douglas makes Liberace seem pretty likable, his actions are insufferably egocentric and inconsiderate. Since the book this was based on was written by a jilted lover, it may or may not reflect much truth, but it's still a depressing story.It's hard to know how real any of this is. The plastic surgeon is so disturbing looking that it's hard to believe anyone would go under his knife (the single image I could find of him through google did not look nearly as freakish) and even though Douglas does a great job of nuancing Liberace into a real person in spite of his quirky voice and mannerisms, parts of the movie seem rather cartoonish. It's nice we've reached a point where major Hollywood actors will take a chance on material like this; it's a movie that doesn't shy away from sex the way earlier movies about gay people did. But I just never could get into it.",5,7,14,3 June 2013
Django Unchained," violent and entertaining
","I saw this a few months ago and didn't get around to writing a review at the time, so now it's only a vague memory. But here are my impressions:Christoph Waltz is absolutely terrific. Best thing in the movie.I'm not a big Tarantino fan, so it took me a long time to get around to seeing this one. But this is one of the few of his film's I've liked.It's crazy, over-the-top violent. At times that seems excessive, but overall I was okay with it.The movie is very much in the vein of big westerns, only it's not in the west and it is centered on slavery. The movie has a gut-punch approach and aims for a Peckinpah nastiness. I like it better than Peckinpah, who I never liked.The movie is not trying to be realistic. You can see this in the language; black characters speak in the same basic dialect as white actors, even though as uneducated people only a generation or two from Africa that couldn't possibly be the case. But it's a useful way to establish the humanity of slaves; we tend to relate more to people who speak as we do.I read some interesting analysis of this movie regarding whether the language is appropriate or racism porn. I can see both sides.The only other western I've seen that directly dealt with racism was the 70s comedy Skin Game, starring James Garner and Louis Gossett. Of the two, I prefer Skin Game which is very pointed without the excesses of Django. Very funny movie I highly recommend.",8,0,3,22 December 2018
Get Out," brilliant suspense thriller that is way too real
","I avoided this brilliant movie for some time simply because people kept referring to it as a horror film, and when I think horror films I think gouged out eyes and chopped off limbs and intestines on the floor. So the first thing I want to say is, this is really more of a suspense movie and there's very little gore.Once I finally watched it I was blown away. This is one of those times when a movie really is as good as people say. The movie does a beautiful job of oh-so-slowly ramping up the strangeness, letting each event build on the other in order to build something wonderfully convincing. The suspense always builds slowly, but by the end the movie is soooooo intense that, half an hour after watching it, I still feel jittery as hell.The filmmaking is sparse and economical, telling a lot with every little movement, every shot, every comment. Daniel Kaluuya is pitch perfect in the lead, offering the sort of deep, nuanced performance more common in searing dramas than thrillers.The story is fascinating and beautifully constructed, with surprises that never come out of left field.This is also a very political movie. It brought to mind a movie from my youth, The Stepford Wives, which also used suspense to highlight society's dark side. The early parts of the movie are almost a treatise on micro-aggressions, explaining them to white folk like me better than any of the million articles you can read on the subject.An amazing film from a first-time director. I can't wait to see what Jordan Peele comes up with next.",10,1,6,29 August 2019
Aladdin," painfully mediocre, except for the dance numbers
","Aladdin was, as best I can recall after all these years, a movie that didn't really get going until the genie appeared. The same can more-or-less be said for the sequel, although I'm inclined to say the movie never really gets going at all.The first half hour is pretty bad. The young leads, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott, seem like solid touring company actors who aren't notable but can sing a little and dance a little and deliver their lines with a semblance of attitude. Marwan Kenzari is another dinner theater actor who imbues Jafar with all the ominous power of a testy assistant manager at The Gap.There are also several new songs in that first half hour; they are all drab and mildly irritating.And then the genie comes, and the songs from the original movie come, and it's ... mildly entertaining. Will Smith is okay as the genie, but neither he nor filmmakers manage to create the manic hilarity Robin Williams supplied.The movie is surprisingly workmanlike coming from director Guy Ritchie, who one would have expected to at least shake things up a little. But while generally watchable, the only thing that really stands out is the dancing in several musical numbers. Choreographed by Leah Hill, they deserve to be in a much better movie.",5,3,5,30 August 2019
The Theory of Everything," Affecting story
","For many of us, Stephen Hawking is that old guy in the wheelchair, and has always been that old guy in a wheelchair, but it turns out he was once a young guy on a bicycle who fell in love and got married. And he's British, which one never realizes from his computer voice. Theory of Everything shows Hawking's brutal physical deterioration in the context of his marriage. Eddie Redmayne is impressive in expressing that deterioration while still showing the man trapped in an increasingly uncooperative body. Eventually he has little to work with as an actor besides his eyes and lips, but he does a lot with those.It's the sort of performance that always wins Oscars (Hollywood loves a good disability acting job) but honestly I was more impressed by Felicity Jones, who expressed a steely, quiet determination and, as the movie progressed, increasing frustration. Often she isn't given much more to work with than Redmayne, being asked to tell the story with her eyes, and she does so marvelously. Even though the movie is ostensibly about Hawking, it feels like it's at least as much her story as his (not surprising, since much of it is based on her book).While the story is often touching and absorbing, the writers ultimately couldn't figure out how to end it. The movie has two scenes that feel like endings, one at a Q&A and the actual ending, but both feel like they're struggling to create a profound moment out of fairly ordinary moments. For me the lackluster ending lessens the overall impact of the movie; a good ending would have made this an 8 instead of a 7. After watching the movie I read an interesting article on Slate on how accurate this was. Overall reasonably accurate, although it sounds like the real Hawkings was a bit more of a pain than the fluffy fictional one.",7,0,0,22 September 2016
Frozen," Wonderful and somewhat subversive Disney movie
","It's easy to get caught up in the toying with classic Disney tropes and strong female characters, but before I talk about that, I just want to point out that this is an incredibly entertaining movie. The animation is terrific (such as the creation of the ice castle), the characters are interesting, and the movie does a good job of balancing some very serious themes with some really funny moments, particularly those involving a hilarious snowman.Having said that, the most striking thing about the movie is the way in which its creators purposely play with classic Snow-White concepts like True Love and Prince Charming, and even play with lesser animated stock concepts like talking animals (one human likes to give voice to his pet).For decades, Disney essentially gold little girls to be nice and sweet and complacent and eventually a nice man would come and save them from the evil in their lives (often represented by strong women).As society has changed, Disney has been making their women stronger. Frozen does that as well, but it does so in a more in-your-face way, not just making a stronger princess but essentially mocking classic plot points of earlier movies.Frozen's messages of empowerment, sisterly love, and being true to yourself aren't necessarily radical, yet in the context of Disney they feel a little radical.The movie contains two princesses; Anna, who is tough and adventurous and wakes up looking very unprincessy, and Elsa, whose fear of her powers gives way in the anthemic Let It Go, a song I thought was catchy on its on but that in the context of the movie is exhilarating.In terms of emotional resonance and subverting tropes, Frozen is perfect, but the story has some practical issues. Most notably, the film's concept of how government works in a kingdom makes no sense, starting with the moment when a visiting diplomat orders the towns guards to grab the queen, which I cannot see happening. There are a number of places, all involving governance, where the movie just makes no sense at all. Of course, Disney films are never realistic, but you've got to draw a line of sense somewhere.I'm torn between giving this movie an 8 and a 9. It's very good, and I left the film with a feeling of elation that made me think it deserved a 9. But if I think about it rationally, beyond my admiration for its feminist message, taking into account plot weaknesses, I'm inclined to give it an 8.But 8 or 9, it should be seen. It's a lot of fun.",8,3,7,17 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Surprisingly good, yet too trapped in Hollywood conventions (and product placement) to be great
","I hadn't heard much good about this movie and wasn't planning to watch it, but then my girlfriend saw it on a plane and said it was great, so I decided to check it out. It is a much better movie than I'd been lead to expect, a thoughtful movie with a nuanced performance by Ben Stiller as someone who has settled into a rut and spends his time dreaming of the adventurous life he'd like to be living. There are fun fantasy sequences, an engaging story, and a lot of nice scenery, and overall I enjoyed this movie, which is funny and heartfelt.*** SPOILERS BELOW ***That being said, I felt the movie could have been a little braver. There was a moment, when Mitty is climbing the mountain and all that, when I thought, maybe this movie won't do the Hollywood thing. Maybe Mitty will realize that by taking control of his life, he can move beyond his obsession with the cute co-worker. That she, nice as she was, was nothing but another fantasy. I would have liked to see him start fresh. It's the sort of thing that could happen in a European film, but not in a mainstream American one. To me, this cheapens a tale of self discovery; was it all just to get some girl?I also felt that sometimes the movie was a little too in love with itself, as in the getting-on-the-helicopter scene, which seems to go on *forever*. But then, someone else who reviewed the movie here specifically mentioned that as one of the best scenes in the film, so I guess some people consider it a soaring moment rather than a point hammered into the ground.I could have also done without the sometimes relentless product placement. It's not so much an objection to seeing products in movies as to how perfectly framed they are in a way that just screams out, 'THIS IS AN AD.' Can't these things just be off to the side in a less obvious manner? I'm sure the corporations demand this sort of prominence, but it's hugely distracting to me.Still, it was enjoyable and I'm glad I watched it. I just wish it had been a little braver and a little less pat and predictable.",7,2,3,20 July 2014
The Incredibles," hate to go the obvious route, but yeah, it's incredible
","I have a lot more trouble enjoying movies than I used to. I blame video games, which give me an expectation that entertainment will completely absorb me. So when I see a movie that completely immerses me, entertains me and even, in spite of being a comedy, can be moving and just a touch insightful, I have to jump up and shout bravo (at least figuratively: I did not actually jump up in the theatre and say bravo). A very funny and imaginative film, The Incredibles takes a clever premise and follows it through to the end with precision. The basic action story outline is fairly predictable and by the numbers - I was ahead of it every step of the way - but it's all done with a wonderful sense of humanity and humor that feels organic to the story rather than forced and slapsticky (as can happen with many animated films). The best thing in the movie is the fashion designer, surprisingly voiced by director Byrd. She's just hysterical. Really a must-see movie.ADDENDUM: Watched this movie again 14 years later on TV. If I were writing a review now I would give it 8 rather than 9, but I'll leave the original rating. This time I thought it was a cute, fun movie, but only the last third was really full out terrific, a just amazing mix of action and comedy.Still, highly recommended.",9,0,0,27 November 2004
Stardust," Loved this charming fairy tale the first time, liked it the second
","When I saw this movie 15-20 years ago I fell totally and completely in love with it and gave it 10 stars. I just watched it and the current me would give it 8 stars so I'm gonna split the difference.Maybe I loved this movie so much back then in part because I'd been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect.While less enthralled this time, it's still a very engaging movie with an interesting story and some terrific stuff. I was perhaps more aware of plot holes, found Charlie Cox slightly bland, and thought it was weird that Claire Danes had an English accent for no discernible reason, but it's a really fun movie and well worth watching.Now I'll let the me of 20 years ago talk about it:This is a very funny and clever movie. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I've been for a while. The running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic affects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. That's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairy tale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.",9,2,4,20 June 2009
School of Rock," as good as people say
","When I first saw the ads for School of Rock I had no interest in seeing it. It looked like some dumb formulaic comedy.  I was surprised when I saw the good reviews and when I saw Linklatter was the director.  I haven't always liked Linklatter's films, but he's certainly got enough indie cred to force you to take him seriously.  Then my friends started telling me they saw it and it was really good, so I went and it was.  Funny, quick moving with the requisite amount of heart, it doesn't take itself too seriously but treats its premise in a surprisingly intelligent manner.  I suppose there are people who don't like this movie, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to my mom, but in terms of this year's comedies this is as close to a sure bet as you're going to find (and who knows, even my mom might like it).",7,1,2,28 October 2003
Kick-Ass," creepy, dull, and dumb
","There is so much wrong with this movie on so many levels that it is hard to know where to begin. So I'll walk you through it.It begins with a dweeb who takes it into his mind to be a superhero. Why? Well, the movie goes out of its way to deny there's a reason; he's not avenging anything, he doesn't seem to have a strong feeling about crime, he's not remotely physically capable of being a superhero. But he tries it. And he gets badly hurt. And even though he is badly hurt for something he seems to have little passion for, he keeps doing it.So early on in the film, I'm feeling a disconnect. I don't understand the protagonist's motivation, and I don't find him particularly likable. And the movie itself is a rather middling, unfunny comedy that can't decide if it's going for realism (his lame costume, the way he gets beat up) or dumb comedy (the way he pretends to be a gay to befriend a girl he likes).20 minutes or so in, I was feeling like giving up on the movie, but I just kind of wanted to see where they were going with the whole premise, because so far the movie had a wandering, confused feel to it.Then comes the scene where the kid confronts a room full of criminals, even though if he had a brain in his head he would understand that would get him killed. And it would have if an 11-year-old girl who, it has been established, has been trained in weapons by her unstable but loving father, didn't come in and kill the 8 or 9 people in the room.This marks a real shift in the movie. All pretense to reality is tossed out, as the little girl, wearing a superhero costume, slices and dices everyone in the room. It's a horrific scene, since many of the people she gleefully murders just want to run away. It is psychotic vigilante justice.A normal teens reaction to seeing mass murder would be one of horror and lifelong trauma, but instead the kid just envies these people for being the 'real deal.' And even though he considers doing the only intelligent thing and quitting, he doesn't do that.The problem, I think, is that this movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be. It's not an over-the-top comic-book comedy, it's not an adrenaline-rush action picture, it's not a drama about trying to find your place in the world, but a weird, completely unsuccessful attempt to veer wildly from one to the other.I kept watching for a while, still curious as to where on earth they were going with this, but as I watched the little girl murder another man in a car crusher and saw the mob boss's son's silly plan to entrap the hero, the fact that I was both completely bored and rather disturbed became too much for me. So I read the plot synopsis in wikipedia, and nothing I read in it made me regret stopping where I did.Perhaps this all worked in the comic book the movie was based on. The very unreality inherent in comic books might make this weird mish-mash come together. But the movie, or at least the first half of it, is a train wreck.",3,5,13,22 May 2012
Ghostbusters," Funny ghost movie with a hilarious Murray
","I watched Ghostbusters for the first time since it's original release, and it has worn well. The story of supernatural exterminators is clever, the pace is quick, the special effects are fun, and much of the movie is very, very funny.The main reason the movie is funny is Bill Murray as a smarmy professor who inexplicably wins over the resistant Sigourney Weaver with his oily charm. Murray's performance reminds me of meaner version of 1940s Bob Hope; they both specialize in the 'that looks really dangerous; you go first' style of humor to great effect.Aykroyd and Ramis are generally overshadowed by Murray. Outside of Murray the most entertaining performance is Rick Moranis as a creepy accountant.The special effects are for the most part quite good, with silly ghosts and a tremendous and ridiculous final monster. Some of the other effects are pretty bad, most notably those bear-like creatures. The blue-screen edges are actually visible in places. I watch them and think, how is it possible that critics of the reboot actually claimed the original had better special effects? Are they *blind*? Anyway, very entertaining movie that I found almost as enjoyable as much as the much-defamed reboot. Well worth seeing.",8,2,4,9 December 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Tedious slice-of-life
","Wow, people really like this movie about a sullen teenager who falls in lust with an arrogant adult. I mean, really love it!For me, this is a very slow movie about a couple of bland, unengaging people. While I generally like coming of age films, I like them for the romance and the sense of changing and growing, but I felt there was little of any of that. There's also very little in the way of plot or conflict. It's basically a slow-moving lust-mance. I am not a fan of slice-of-life film making; I like stories. There isn't one here.I will admit that some of the issue might be I'm straight. I think it's easier to relate to a relationship movie if you understand the attraction, and I don't know why either of those two would want the other one. I mean, the older guy is generically attractive even if he's obnoxious, but is the teenager even attractive? He doesn't look like much to me, but he's also got a really hot girlfriend so maybe he's a very attractive young man? Who knows?But I don't think the issue is *just* that I'm straight. I didn't *love* Moonlight, the critically-lauded film about a gay black guy, but I did find it generally interesting. But the only reason I watched this movie to the end was because my girlfriend really liked it, and I spent the last third reading twitter on my phone (apparently missing a couple of moving moments, but I'm okay with that because I just don't care if the characters live or die).The most I can say for the movie is it's a great ad for Italy, very pretty and idyllic. And there's a good soundtrack. My girlfriend, FWIW, found this movie moving and profound. It also made her desperate to visit Italy.",3,5,21,22 March 2018
Hero," wow wow wow wow wow
","Hero is a movie of wow moments. In fact, the movie seems to have been designed with the goal of making the viewer go 'wow' about once a minute. Much of this is achieved through the film's amazing visuals. While ostensibly a martial arts movie, this is really closer to a dance film, with whirling, colorful principals leaping and soaring in impossible ways. The movie is cinematic in a way few movies are, and is basically the movie I was expecting to see after hearing about the disappointing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The film shows the sort of mastery of pure cinematic film making of someone like Kubrick or Kurosawa, although the style is dissimilar to both. The director has an unerring feel for both pure visual composition and for the beauty of movement.Wow moments come both from stunning sights like a woman spinning so quickly that arrows are pushed away and cool ideas like two opponents facing each other as they quietly imagine the fight they will have as a musician plays. The movie elicits a pure visceral wonder, the sort that makes people shout out, 'Awesome dude, that is way cool!' There's not much actual story and the film certainly never pulls you in the way Roshomon does (a film some have compared with Hero, although it's a very superficial similarity). But the film is so stunning from one moment to the next that I really don't care about any deficiencies of plot. This is a work of art and a piece of entertainment that has rarely been matched.",9,3,5,5 January 2006
X-Men: Apocalypse," Solid but not the best of the series
","The X-Men film series has been the most consistent of the superhero franchises. The best movies, like Days of Future Past and First Class, are wonderful, and overall I've enjoyed everything in the series.Apocalypse is a good entry in the series, but it didn't keep me as riveted as some of the others. There are some good scenes - a cage match between two mutants, a bloody massacre by a guest star, and a phenomenal rescue by Quicksilver that is easily the best thing in the movie - and it's fun to see characters like Storm in earlier times.But as I watched, I found my attention wandering off and on. The story was interesting enough, there was a little character development, and the action was solid and well-filmed, but there were too few of those jaw-dropping moments that mark the best of the series.This was, in fact, the problem with that Quicksilver scene; it was in the middle of the movie, and nothing after it was as good. It's not a good sign When during the final battle you're still thinking about the great scene you saw an hour ago.Absolutely worth seeing, and still better than most comic-book movies, but still a lesser entry in a great series.",7,0,1,7 November 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A big drop in quality over the last movie
","I really enjoyed the 2012 Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot that was far more satisfying than the Spider-Man right before it. So in spite of hearing negative things, I had to watch this.The first scene in it, which doesn't have Spidey in it, is pretty decent, with a bit of mystery and an exciting take on uploading a file. Alas, the movie lost me as Spider-Man appeared. First off - and I know this isn't an easy task - the special effects looked unconvincing. Spider-Man's movements were too fluid, as though he were fully animated (which he probably was).The movie starts with a chase scene, with a wise-cracking Spidey taunting the bad guys and rescuing a bunch of people. It was just okay, and there was a bit on Spidey trying to corral some dangerous test-tubes that was too close to slapstick.I watched almost an hour of the movie, and while that included a couple of action scenes, some banter, a character introduction, and the oddly serious, Montgomery Clift style Peter Parker, none of it caught my interest.In fact, the only really good scene was Peter and his girlfriend flirting and making rules for each other. It was a nice little scene that suggested the producers should have just cast the principals in a little romantic comedy. When the best thing about a big action movie is the love interest, it's not a good action movie. So I gave up on it.",4,2,5,12 November 2015
Ex Machina," absorbing and ingenious
","This clever, thoughtful movie follows Caleb, a computer programmer whose boss hires him to spend a week evaluating the A.I. of a robot. The robot has an exceptionally beautiful face on top of a weird robot body, and the two chat while the brilliant, obnoxious, arrogant boss watches on camera.Throughout the movie there is the feeling that things aren't as they appear, and the series of reveals at the end are satisfying. They're not so much plot twists and perspective changes, so even though there are surprises they are nicely organic.The performances and direction are excellent. The script is also, for the most part, although I feel the minor character Kyoko does things that don't make any sense and is essentially a lazy plot device the author uses to get the movie where he wants it. To say more would move into spoilers though, so I'll leave it at that.I had some trepidation about watching this movie, because I had the feeling it would be depressing, and at times it is. But mainly it's fascinating and involving. Definitely worth checking out.",8,0,3,3 November 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," aims for greatness, but ultimately this is a slight tale blown up
","Benjamin Button is a moderately interesting idea for a movie with a few very good scenes and a lot of forgettable ones. The central idea of a man whose body becomes younger as he ages is presented pretty well, and Pitt is quite good in the title role. The movie is occasionally effecting.But there's really not much to this. Take away the central gimmick, and this is just a story about a guy living a fairly ordinary life, growing up, falling in love, getting old, losing his mind. The central gimmick is often irrelevant to the story.Clearly the filmmakers think they have something truly profound; why else would they make it so damn long? But while the odd aging of Button offers a slightly different way to think about growing old, it's not *that* different.This movie reminded me of Forest Gump (which turned out to share the same screenwriter), in that it was just sort of a guy living his life, and in that I found it dull. I liked Benjamin Button better than Gump (in spite of all its admirers I found it quite dull) but I still just never felt there was much to it. While it's perfectly watchable, I wish I'd spent that 2 hours and 45 minutes on a better film.",6,1,2,20 July 2011
Transformers," cars, robots, hot girls and explosions: the ultimate boys movie
","I wasn't expecting a lot of a movie based on a TV show (which I've never seen) based on some toy. But Transformers look cool in advertisements so when it came to TV I decided to check it out, and it's actually a pretty decent movie. The action scenes are well done, the movie has a fast, consistent pace and I found myself surprisingly interested in what was happening.At the same time, this is not a great movie. The robots themselves are just silly stereotype caricatures, and the dopey humor doesn't jibe with the cleverer humor earlier in the movie (i.e. the car that plays songs appropriate to the situation. The robots fail to generate any real personality, so Shea LeBouf's emotional attachment to them doesn't make any sense. Although it might make sense to undemanding 10 year olds, who are probably this movie's primary target audience.Oddly enough, I found the movie less interesting as it proceeded from a cute action-comedy to a big action spectacular. The final scenes of mayhem were competently filmed, but there are none of those 'wow' moments you get from really good big budget action pix. In fact, the most impressive thing in battles is the smooth transformation of robots from one form to the other, and by movie's end you've seen that enough to no longer be impressed.Overall the movie is a bit of a hack job, but it's a very entertaining hack job, and sometimes that's all you really need.",7,1,2,5 September 2008
Pawn Sacrifice," The intersection of celebrity, politics, mental illness, and chess
","When I was a kid, Bobby Fischer was a big deal. He was a brilliant chess player known for his eccentricities. And I was perplexed as to how chess had become a big deal.Turns out it was another cold war proxy fight in which the U.S. and Russia were trying to prove their inherent superiority. This was not Bobby Fischer's idea; he just wanted to be a chess champ. In the movie, he's fairly oblivious to the tides of history, at least until he gets caught up in paranoid theories.This is a very interesting movie with a terrific performance by Tobey Maguire that manages to make chess riveting even if, like me, you have to real idea what's going on. The story it tells is clear and concise, as a mercurial Fischer descends into paranoia while those around him push him forward at any cost.In fact, the story is a little too neat. The movie feels very much like the movie you'd expect to see if you remember Bobby's weird demands and celebrity. But usually life is a little more complicated than a movie. Reading about Fischer on wikipedia, I saw things that didn't fit in with the movie's view. For example, Fischer was unusually athletic for a chess player, working out regularly during the World Championship, and his love life went beyond hooking up with a prostitute; he later married, which is hard to imagine of Maguire's version.Still, this is a fascinating, well paced movie that is constantly engaging. This is one of these movies, like All the President's Men, that has figured out how to bring intense drama to hard work and tedious thoroughness.It also makes me wish I'd actually read some of those chess books my dad bought me; I always just sort of stumbled through without ever understanding the complexities of the game.",8,5,6,26 August 2016
Hidden Figures," Entertaining, very Hollywood-ized version of history
","When watching a movie based on true events, there are certain moments where one wonders, did that *really* happen? Then you look it up and find that, often, it did not. But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.As a movie, Hidden Figures is very entertaining. The movie follows the fortunes of NASA mathematician Katherine G Johnson and her friends as they deal with the challenges of being black women in a world run by white men. This is very much a feel-good movie, with adversity to overcome, crusty authority figures to win over, a great mission to accomplish, and a little romance for seasoning. The movie hits hard on the awfulness of the Jim Crow south and the merit of its leads. I'd say the only problematic dramatic weakness is that Johnson's role basically runs out before the end and she becomes a bit of a bystander.As for that question, did this really happen, well, the website informationisbeautiful.net answer is, more-or-less. The movie compresses time enormously, so that, for example, it shows a segregated NASA in 1961, three years after the agency stopped segregating facilities. Many of the events of the movie did happen to some extent, but most of them happened in the 1950s. And the real Katherine said she never felt oppressed at work, meaning the big scene of her going off about it is pure fiction.And like most movies, the title characters are portrayed as being far more important than they were. Katherine was a prodigy who graduated college when she was 18, but she was working amongst hundreds of geniuses. The movie does a service in highlighting the forgotten contributions of black women to the space program, but Hollywood hates the idea that history is pushed forward by large teams working together more often than by lone geniuses bucking the system.How much of a problem this is will depend on the individual. I'm disappointed by the facile Hollywood approach to history, but it rarely ruins the movie for me. I did, for example, enjoy The Imitation Game, even though it was obvious that some of it pretty much had to be nonsense. Hidden Figures is a feel-good movie that made me feel good. So it's worth watching.",8,0,6,15 May 2017
Coco," lesser pixar is still a lot of fun
","Entertaining, beautifully animated, and at times very affecting, Coco is a very good movie but falls short of great Pixar films like Inside Out and Up.My big issue is the script, which is predictable and runs on rails.

1917," intense and immediate
","1917 is a powerful, riveting film about two soldiers undertaking a brutal mission to prevent a massacre. From what I've read it's historically unrealistic, but it feels real in its portrayal of heroism that less about being a hero and more about doing the job you're expected to do (although yes, it gets pretty hero-y as it goes along.The movie is shot as though it's one continuous take, and while this is distracting in that my ex-film-student brain couldn't stop looking for the seams (basically the places where there are no people on screen), it also keeps things very immediate.",9,1,4,12 April 2020
Lincoln," absorbing but a little bloodless
","This drama of political intrigue has much to recommend it. The story of the passage of the 13th amendment in the house involves a surprising amount of chicanery and political fixing, and it is refreshing to see politics shown as both a devious profession while showing it as one that can do good. And Tommy Lee Jones gives a first rate performance as a Republican radical (back when that was a good thing).Jones is also notable for creating a sense of a flesh and blood person, which cannot be said for Daniel Day Lewis' Lincoln. It's a good performance, giving you a shrewd but folksy man determined to strike a blow for history, but Spielberg films Lewis much in the way a biblical epic films Jesus. This, and Lewis' careful, overly perfect delivery, make Lincoln more icon than man, and at times he comes across as a Disney animatronic Lincoln.The movie feels very much like it wants to be the movie about Lincoln school kids see, and so it works hard to be faithful to history. But it also takes pains to be firmly on the right side of history. The few black people in the movie are better spoken than the white people; every one of them speaks like a Yale graduate. I'm not saying there weren't many well-spoken, educated black people at the time, but I cannot help but suspect they weren't *all* like that. Lincoln is given a halo, but I can't help but believe - and perhaps this is simply my own cynicism - that his motives were more complex, his temper less even, his movements less assured, than what you see here. Jones, Lee Pace as a fiery Democrat, and the lead fixer seemed far more interesting as characters than Lincoln, because they seemed far more like real people.But then, that's how Lincoln is always portrayed. Lincoln as human being is rare, although Hal Holbrooke, one of the many effective stars in this film, played a more flesh and blood version of the man many years ago.While this could have been better as a movie, it makes for an excellent history lesson, both informative and consistently engaging. It is not a great film, but it's a great thing to show to high school kids.",7,1,1,16 June 2013
Sing Street," Lovely, engaging musical
","In spite of my strong dislike of the director's inexplicably beloved Once, I decided to watch his most recent musical, Sing Street, and found it better in every way, with an engaging story, interesting characters, and first rate songs.The story, which takes place in the 1980s, follows a boy who falls for a preternaturally composed girl and starts a band just to impress her (and get her to perform in his videos). After a shaky start, he begins to absorb the musical influences of the age (dressing in emulation of a series of rock stars) and creates genuinely entertaining music. My only real objection to anything in the film is the weirdly quick improvement in the band. In something like the second or third rehearsal the protagonist suddenly develops a much better singing voice and the ability to play guitar. It's as though the movie just cut a month out of the story, and it's a bit aggravating. But everything else about this is terrific.",8,1,2,30 December 2016
Children of Men," awesome awesome awesome awesome
","An amazing bit of social commentary, Children of Men has the 1984 approach to science fiction in which the goal is not to portray the future but to comment on the present. England in chaos: fear of immigration has been built into a frenzy of blood lust and the poor live in violent squalor while the rich hide in pleasant enclaves. The movie references the Iraq war directly and uses strong visual imagery reminiscent of Abu Ghraib and the Holocaust.At the same time, Children is an tense, exciting action movie, and it is remarkable how it manages to sacrifice neither its message or its entertainment value.This is a very cinematic movie. There is almost no exposition, and those who want explanations will be disappointed; the movie asks the viewer to figure out a lot themselves.The weakest aspect of the film is that the reason for the road trip/chase at the heart of the movie isn't convincingly set up. Everyone in the film is making assumptions about what will happen when it is revealed that after two decades of mysterious infertility, a woman is pregnant, but none of them seem to have really thought anything through, and the ultimate goal of the trip is decidedly fuzzy; exactly what are the expecting to happen? Fortunately, that only lightly mars the movie; it's a basic MacGuffin that is dropped in as an excuse for the action but not hammered upon enough to crack it.The movie is also visually compelling. In wikipedia I read that there are several single-shot sequences in the movie, but I wasn't aware of them at the time, because I was too caught up in what was happening to be aware of the film's technical aspects. The single-shot approach is used not to show off but to heighten the intensity, and it works wonderfully.A must see movie.",9,2,7,13 July 2008
Garden State," sharply observed and funny
","Zach Braff's first feature is quite impressive, funny, original and surely directed. The film is especially impressive in the early scenes that establish Ancrew's distanced isolation from the rest of the world. The movie manages to shift from comedy to drama easily. And Portman gives one of her patented charming performances as one of those sweet, quirky but only mildly neurotic girls who are so much easier to find in movies than in real life.But while it is a very good movie, I felt it lost emotional resonance towards the end. This is most striking in the final scene between Andrew and his dad, which should feel like a summation of emotional themes in the movie but instead feels like something that just wasn't sufficiently set up. The problem may be that I liked Andrew but never felt that strongly invested in his life. I can't really point to anything specific and say, this should have been done different, I just should have felt more in the last 15 minutes of this movie than I did. Still, well worth watching.",7,0,1,22 July 2005
Big Hero 6," Enjoyable kids movie
","There is a fuzzy dividing line between cartoons for kids and cartoons for all ages and Big Hero 6 trends a little ways into cartoons for kids, although not so much it's not fun for adults. The animation is quite well done, there are plenty of fun moments, and Baymax is a pretty solid creation.At the same time, the story isn't especially original, the film has cookie-cutter characters, there are small plot issues throughout, and the animation has that too-big too-quick style that I often see in kids-focused movies.It seems strange this won an Oscar; if the animated films I saw that year I would have given it to How to Train Your Dragon 2. But it's fun, overall.",7,0,0,5 August 2016
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," a little weaker than the first, but fun
","Another efficient little thriller based on the Resident Evil games. This one isn't quite as fast and focused as the last, but it's got a number of very good moments in it that get your attention and it does have a good pace and good performances, to the extent one can be said to perform in a movie that is almost entirely about running around shooting things.Some people complained that the first movie wasn't much like the games. I would say this movie is a little more like the games, at least in places, and I think that's part of the problem. Games are structured in a very meandering way in which you just wander around exploring and fighting and occasionally get a little exposition, which is why I never considered the complaints about the first movie not being enough like the video games valid.Still, I had a good time. I'm giving this movie the same score as the first, even though I didn't think it was quite as good, perhaps just because I'm just in a mellow and generous frame of mind.",7,0,1,3 July 2005
Mulholland Drive," Fascinating puzzle box of a movie
","I enter any David Lynch movie with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. Most of his movies challenge the viewer to make sense of them, but sometimes that challenge is much too steep (Lost Highway, Inland Empire) and sometimes Lynch just seems to be seeing what he can get away with.But when he gets the mix just right, he creates something that wonderfully balances storytelling and madness. And that's what happens in Mulholland Drive.The movie starts as a beautiful LA woman escapes from an attempted assassination. She soon finds assistance from a wholesome blonde newly arrived in hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. They start a Nancy Drew- style investigation and occasionally cross paths with a Hollywood director being forced to recast his movie.At first this seems, in spite of a few really odd moments, as a straightforward mystery, but it's Lynch, so of course, it keeps getting weirder, eventually becoming surreal and disorienting.The last third of the movie is extremely peculiar, but by the end it's clear that this is David Lynch's version of a Shyamalan film, with all the parts connecting at the end.Well, more or less. While Shyamalan likes to cross all his 't's and dot all his 'i's, that is something Lynch hates. He doesn't spoon feed the audience with answers, and even once you figure out what has happened, there are all sorts of oddities and loose ends that can't be fit into the total narrative. In some cases I think it's simply because Lynch is using parts of the original failed TV pilot this is an extension of; how else to explain an early diner scene? Other directors would have pared most of this away, but Lynch *wants* the messiness and the hanging threads. And much of the fun of Lynch is that you can't make total sense of his stories and are forced to look beyond sense to understand his mysterious world.As puzzling as Mulholland Drive sometimes is, it ranks as one of the more accessible of his artier films. The movie expects the viewer to put a little work in, but that work will be rewarded.And if you're still puzzled, seek out the Salon article that attempts to explain it all. But first think about it for a while. Pondering Mulholland Drive is a fun thing to do.",8,0,1,10 September 2017
Grave of the Fireflies," Well done and very depressing
","I loved depressing movies when I was in college, but generally avoid them now; the heartbreak of a movie like La Strada just seems more than I can bear. I knew Grave of the Fireflies was pretty serious, but I did not realize how utterly grim it would be.Still, I'm glad I saw it. It's a very well-made movie. It's also an example of an animated movie that makes a case for animation in drama. I often feel that if there is nothing in a film that can't easily be shown with live action then it's a waste to use animation, which loses the nuances of human acting. But this film allows for scenes you wouldn't get in a live action movie; the use of fireflies would never be as lyrical and striking in a live drama.There are a few issues with the movie. One is those weird red, raggedy-anne circles on the little girl's cheeks, which I found endlessly distracting. More importantly, there are places where the boy's actions don't make sense. This is not to say that there weren't good reasons for what happened (the movie is based on an autobiographical book, so it may be true to life), just that the movie fails to make things clear.It was a good movie, but it has not convinced me to watch more depressing films.",8,1,2,7 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Everything everyone says about this movie is right
","I was very curious about Last Jedi due to the weirdly polarized reactions. Some described it as just more of the same, some as brilliantly subversive, some as a betrayal. All of these views are legitimate.The beginning is very Star Wars-ish. A cocky young guy ignores his commanders and takes initiative to take down a prize target. It is a thrilling scene, and the movie soon raises the possibility that going half-cocked is, in fact, a bad thing, thus contradicting pretty much the entire history of action films, particularly those in the Star Wars family.And so it goes, big exciting set pieces interspersed with moments that muddy the clean, black-and-white morality that has been a hallmark of the series. At times, Last Jedi is pure Star Wars, and at time it is almost a bitter satire of movies like Star Wars.As someone who really likes moral complexity and is often put off by movies that celebrate macho postering, I really like all this, but I understand it's a little off brand.I've seen some reviews say that while they appreciate some of the directorial decisions, ultimately the movie didn't connect with them emotionally. I feel the same way about a lot of the criticism of this film; I can't argue that it's wrong - there are plot holes, unlikely changes to the underlying mythos, unlikely side quests, the cavalier dropping of threads - but viscerally most of the objections don't connect with me.I really like this movie, because it is dark, and questions the series' precepts, and offers some really jolting surprises. And I'm not enough of a fan of the series to have spent the last two years theorizing on questions that don't get answered here. The criticism I most object to is the idea that the movie is too jokey. Yes, some of the humor is a little more Guardians of the Galaxy than what one expects from Star Wars, but it's always been pretty silly. If Last Jedi is too jokey, why isn't the banter between C3PO and R2D2 too jokey? I really enjoyed the previous movie, The Force Awakens, but it felt a bit too much like a retread. I appreciate that this movie avoids that, even while giving me a lot of what I have enjoyed about the best Star Wars films. But if you disagree, you're probably right.",8,4,12,5 April 2018
Brave," Pixar creates a decent Disney Princess
","Apparently Pixar decided they needed a princess of their own, and came up with a feisty Scottish redhead. She's a pretty likable princess, which is good because she's the only significant character in the movie, and her rather predictable emotional journey is meant to keep things in motion.Overall, the movie's copious humor is far less successful than its occasional action. The comedy is very mild, and I rarely laughed out loud, but the sudden appearance of an angry bear and a final urgent forest ride are genuinely exciting. While likable, the movie has to be considered a lesser Pixar film. But it's pleasant enough.",7,0,2,6 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Terrifically fun
","Having seen most of the recent movies in the 'Marvel Universe' series, of which this is purported to be a part, I was surprised by how little it has to do with Captain America or Iron Man. It is actually a very different movie, close in effect to making a movie about Hans Solo before he got involved with all that good guy stuff, told at the lightning pace of animated films like The Incredibles.The performances are terrific, especially the lead, who is a revelation for those who only knew him for his amusingly shaggy TV role. The movie is incredibly funny, yet occasionally slows down just enough to offer a moment of character insight that prevents it from falling into the noisy-special-effects trap of a lot of big-budget action flicks.While I rarely read comic books, and thus am not familiar with the source material, I would have expected this wacky story and structure to come from some weird indie graphic novel rather than a big publisher like Marvel. I like some of the other Marvel movies, but this one, which stands on its own little island far away from Samuel Jackson, is the best of the bunch.",9,0,3,28 December 2014
The Imitation Game," Good movie, but I would have liked a little more truth in the telling
","The danger of an interesting movie based on true events is that one is likely to run to wikipedia to discover the whole story, only to discover that the whole story has very little to do with the movie.Such is the case with The Imitation Game. While there was, in fact, a genius named Alan Turing who worked on breaking the Nazi's enigma machine, but while the film was entertaining, liberties were taken that to me seem both unnecessary and disappointing. I'd say the biggest issue was the creation of an antagonist for Turing (which apparently really upset the family of the antagonist). The obtuse, hard-headed boss is nothing but a cliché, and while the writer may have felt it created a nice dramatic tension, for me it was a little annoying in the movie and very annoying when I found out it was fiction.When asked about the way the script strayed from the truth, the screenwriter compared himself with Monet. Besides being wildly egotistical, it's a false analogy. Monet was not using waterlilies to make a greater statement about politics or gay oppression, he was experimenting with colors. He wasn't touting the fact that waterlilies exist in the real world to raise interest in his paintings; he used them as a vehicle for his art. The screenwriter said that, like Monet, he wanted to give the feeling of Turing's life, but his changes seem more designed for creating a pat but effective conventional narrative rather than to create a feel.I can understand not following anyone's life exactly - life is too messy for a movie - but to me it seems if you're going to veer this much from truth you are better off just writing fiction.My advice; if you watch this movie, which is quite engrossing and well worth watching, don't look it up on wikipedia if you care about truthfulness. It will drive you nuts.",7,1,2,3 April 2015
The Evil Dead," Not as much fun as the sequels
","I wound up watching the Evil Dead series backwards, starting with Army of Darkness, which I loved, then Evil Dead II, which I barely remember but recall liking and finally Evil Dead, which I stopped watching 30 or 40 minutes in.Evil Dead is known as the movie with the least humor, and that is true to the extent that it lacks of the slapstick of the others, but at the same time I can't help but suspect that the whole movie is a goof, because it is so dumb. It begins very well, squeezing a lot of atmosphere out of a minimal budget, but when the horror starts the effects and makeup are laughable and the whole thing is very over-the-top and campy. I don't feel like anyone was taking this movie too seriously.I'm not a horror movie aficionado. I liked Army of Darkness because it was really funny, but as a general rule I do not watch horror movies. This is in many ways well-done for what it is, but it isn't something I'm interested in.",4,1,4,5 September 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Entertaining but insubstantial
","First off, I generally enjoyed KB1. It's got some very entertaining fight sequences and strong visual style, and while the blood was excessive I found it more comical than gross, even though I normally have a low threshold for gore.But I'm left with the same feeling I get from any Tarantino film: so what? Tarentino could be described as a pop artist like Andy Warhol, who made his fame making replicas of Campbell soup labels and putting them in art galleries. Tarantino made a very stylish, slick, high budget homage/pastiche of shlocky action films. It is convincingly like those movies. But it doesn't bring anything new to the formula. Tarantino's films seem to exist entirely on the surface, lacking any subtext beyond, gee, weren't these movies really cool? Isn't lots of blood funny? Tarantino's consciousness seems to have gelled when he was about 17 and not gone anywhere since, and his style serves only itself. He has nothing to say about revenge, or violence, or the moral code of the warrior, he just throws it all up on screen because he thinks it's really neato.Which would be fine if he were making a cheap action picture, but Tarantino imbues his films with the sense that he's doing something really special when he's just recreating formative films from his childhood. And the feeling that the movie means to be bigger and better than its inspirations but really isn't makes the experience somehow hollow and unsatisfying, like a cake that is so airy you feel you haven't eaten. This so what feeling has kept me from enjoying previous Tarantino films. Tarantino's scripts would work best with more straightforward direction, which is why True Romance worked better than any of the scripts he has directed himself. Still, I did enjoy this movie overall, I did give it 7/10, and it is the first Tarantino-directed movie I have genuinely enjoyed.I just feel it's a shame that someone with obvious skill seems to have so little depth.",7,0,2,30 October 2004
Ip Man," highly entertaining with great performance from lead
","Ip Man starts off as a light, rather humorous movie about martial arts expert Mast Ip, wonderfully played by Donnie Yen with quiet grace and a twinkling eye, who spends his time wowing the town with his amazing (and beautifully choreographed) fights.About a third of the way through there is a marked shift in tone as the Japanese invade China and subjugate everyone, with martial arts masters forced to work in factories and perform in tournaments with the Japanese in exchange for bags of rice to feed their starving children.The darkened mood seems a little odd but works pretty well, and Ip continues to battle for good in some very cool fights. But to me there is a certain disconnect in the earnestness of the movie's hatred of the Japanese (who are portrayed pretty much the way American movies portray Nazis) versus the flashy combat.The story itself is apparently based on a real martial arts teacher but doesn't portray anything that actually happened to him, making it the same sort of nonsensical biopic you get in the U.S. But it is a lot of fun.",7,0,1,5 February 2011
From Dusk Till Dawn," Eeech
","I saw this film knowing nothing about it except the director and cast.  I'd been warned it was awful, and I and my wife would periodically say, 'how could she have hated such a fun movie?' It was a zippy. violent action flick.Then, half-way through: vampires!  I mean, if you'd seen the trailer and knew it was a vampire flick you're reaction could have been 'at last, vampires,' but my reaction was 'huh?'  This is not a plot twist, this is a derailment.That was my first shock.  My second shock was coming to imdb and finding all these favorable reviews.  The movie looks to be two separate movies of Tarentino's, one good action flick and one bad vampire movie stuck together because he couldn't finish either one.  In spite of being a terrific film for the first hour, the second part was so bad that I would tell anyone who asked that the movie sucked, pure and simple.  It was stupid with a capitol STU.Eeech.",3,2,6,5 January 1999
Jurassic World," Exciting, and more consistently entertaining than the original, though less subtle
","Jurassic Park was a terrific movie once it got going, but people comparing it with the Jurassic World reboot seem to have forgotten the tedious, soap-operish story that dragged down the original. JP followed a pattern I always associate with The Birds; throw us into the tedious entanglements of uninteresting people until we're almost asleep, then start the mayhem. There is very little soap opera in Jurassic World, and most of that comes in brief spurts later in the movie. The film begins by establishing how incredibly cool Jurassic World actually is, with charming scenes at a dinosaur petting zoo and a dramatic giant-fish feeding that made me feel like I would really, really like to go there. One also sees where things are going to go awry, although the score never telegraphs those moments, sounding perpetually chipper even when you're thinking, that's not going to turn out well.While JW doesn't subject viewers to the degree of pure tedium that JP did, it's still a movie that doesn't really take off until things go wrong. Once they do, the movie becomes a series of big, wild dinosaur disasters that keep getting bigger as more and more people die. While this is exciting, by the end it feels as though the movie is a bit too focused on making things big. JW has a lot of excitement, but the original JP had more suspense. JP was a movie that understood waiting for the right moment; JW believes the moment is RIGHT NOW.There's also some sort of story with Chris Pratt as the guy with sense and a bunch of other people without any, including a greedy owner, a military guy whose ideas are so ridiculously poorly thought out that even a cartoon villain would say, 'maybe you should take a minute to think this through,' and an executive who gets to run around the jungle in high heels. Her character has been called sexist, and I can see why, but I would say that this comes as much out of a lazy reliance on character clichés than anything else. But what I like about this movie over JP is that it has far less interest in its characters. It knows that all anyone cares about are the dinosaurs, and it delivers those beautifully.",8,16,30,14 November 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Am I the only person who knows what Willie Wonka is supposed to be like?
","This version of Roald Dahl's brilliant book begins beautifully. It does a wonderful job of creating a sense of wonder and excitement about the chocolate factory and Charlie and his family are quite appealing. And like all Tim Burton films, there is a great visual sensibility.Then Willy Wonka shows up.There have been two film adaptations of the book, and both have radically altered the character of Willy Wonka, who in the books is an affable elderly man. In the first movie, Gene Wilder played Wonka as sinister and hostile, while Johnny Depp plays him like a children's show host who has lost his mind (or, as many people have pointed out, as Michael Jackson).Both of these portrayals were completely off the mark. Dahl underplays Wonka, and that makes him very funny. He simply acts like nothing particularly odd is happening and genially goes on with things as a series of disasters strike. But for some reasons, film makers want a more malevolent take on the guy.Burton compounds this by making the movie more about Wonka than about Charlie. He gives Wonka a tortured past and drags out the story's ending, giving it a fairly absurd last minute and also making Charlie the only character who is not tempted by anything during this tour, which I'm sure Dahl would have considered an unacceptable change.Still, the movie is really good looking, the acting is generally good (even Depp, I suspect, if you aren't familiar with the book), there's a lot of clever stuff in there and the original Oompa Loompa lyrics are used, and are musically quite good. The movie moves fast and it's generally entertaining. It just happens to be a movie made by someone who has decided to replace Dahl's sensibility with his own, and while Burton has made a few great movies among a bunch of overrated ones, he is not in the same class as Dahl.Dahl's book is so descriptive and straightforward that really, all a director needs to do is take what's there and make that movie. I hope someday someone who really understands the source material takes a shot at this.",7,0,1,4 September 2006
The Adjustment Bureau," Intriguing premise but move never gels
","Adjustment Bureau begins quite well, with Damon persuasive as a charismatic politician having a seemingly chance encounter with a charming Emily Blunt. After this politico-romantic start, the movie shifts into fantasy territory when Damon discovers that mankind is living based on a plan by 'The Chairman,' and implemented by men in suits who are probably angels.So far so good. Damon is told he can't tell people about the Adjustment Bureau, but only told he won't meet Blunt again, and there the angels are wrong, and the film is essentially a cat and mouse game between Damon and his heavenly kibitzers. It's a cute idea, and the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is phenomenal; you really believe the whole meant-for-each-other thing.Unfortunately, after setting up the premise the movie doesn't seem to have any idea where to take it. It's a short movie, and yet it feels listless and slow, lacking dramatic tension or serious plotting and just sort of wandering along to a rather predictable end after a few predictable turns.It's watchable.",6,0,1,20 August 2012
Logan," A good example of why X-Men is consistently the best comic-to-movie series
","I can't say Logan is my favorite movie in the X-Men series - it's too darn depressing - but this gritty meditation on heroism and mortality represents why the X-Men movies are so consistently good; the focus on character and psychology.In the age of modern comic-book adaptations, I'm not sure anything else is quiet as pared-down is this. The leads are sick and dying, and the fights throw out flying and weather control in favor of what is basically a series of violent martial arts blade fights. This is a very dark movie with a high death toll and a consistent bleak sense of place. It is emotionally powerful and surprisingly uncompromising within the movie superhero world, although it's still full of exciting action sequences.At the same time, I think it's easy to be overly impressed with this movie because it's so different from a typical superhero movie. Some viewers are responding to Logan as though director Mangold has created a movie for the ages. I think that's pushing it a bit. But it is an absolutely terrific movie.",8,4,11,31 May 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A marked improvement over the overrated first one
","I was disappointed by the original Avengers. After hearing it lauded as the most awesome movie ever, what I got was empty spectacle, a movie that summed up everything I don't like about films that sacrifice character development in favor of big battles you never really care about.Still, as empty spectacles go, The Avengers was pretty fun, so eventually, about a year after it came out, I equipped my low expectations and watched Ultron.Ultron surprised me though, because it has what the last one lacked; personality. This movie has far more interest in its characters and ideas. It even has some angsty and rather touching romance.Even better, the movie has a really great villain, beautifully voiced by James Spader to be both dangerously psychopathic and quite funny. This movie has somewhat less action than the previous one, as it takes time out to get to know its people, but that action is put in context this time, so I actually care about what's going on. The final action scene is a bit overlong, but overall the action is great.There are some issues with the special effects though, particularly in the case of the Hulk. It's something I noticed in the first sequence, which looked, especially in long shots, rather fake; it looked like something from a video game. It's not terrible, but it's not always believable.Overall though this was one of the better Marvel movies.",8,0,5,26 September 2016
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," brilliant
","Remarkable musical of German transvestite star telling her life star while on an unsuccessful US tour.  Director/writer/star Mitchell is terrific as Hedwig, managing to emote real feeling through about five pounds of makeup. Also quite a good singer, with excellent songs.Sometimes a movie comes out that is described as being one long MTV video, and this is justifiably portrayed as a bad thing, but Hedwig proves that an MTV video movie can be a very good thing indeed.  Songs are filmed in a variety of ways, some animated, some straightforward, but all are entertaining.  Like the musicals of yore, the songs progress the plot, or at least the back story that makes up the bulk of the plot, so unlike in most rock songs the lyrics are even more important than the music.  Funny and fascinating, this is something you shouldn't miss.",9,1,3,12 April 2004
Hotel Transylvania," Mildly amusing
","There are a few very funny moments in Hotel Transylvania, which takes place at a monster-only hotel invaded by a human doofus and deals with an over-protective Dracula and his adventurous daughter, but there is a lot of dead time in between.Overall it feels comfortable and familiar; if you can't predict every turn in the story way before it happens then you just haven't seen very many movies. There is an adequate story, solid animation, and good voice acting, which is enough for something generally watchable.The laughs pick up a bit in the movie's second half, so if you're mildly enjoying yourself, go ahead and watch it all. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this one.",6,1,2,1 December 2017
Blood Diamond," intense
","An amoral adventurer in search of a fabulous treasure is a common theme in film, but Blood Diamond isn't interested in mindless fun, instead attempting to create a truer version of that Hollywood fantasy set in a world of horrible brutality.The result can be upsetting and hard to watch, as gun-toting rebels or soldiers mow down people indiscriminately. Even in a scene where 30 people die, the movie does a good job of making you feel each death, showing you individual humans desperately trying to escape rather than the standard extras falling down of so many movies.Blood Diamond does not take a simplistic view of the violence. The blame is placed on both rich diamond merchants and on the Africans themselves, but more than that the blame is on people who simply accept the situation, represented in the movie by the phrase 'This is Africa' to consign the madness to the status quo.But the movie also says something can be done, and while the main do-gooder is a rather clichéd role - an idealistic American journalist trying to expose corruption and save the world - the message that there is hope keeps Blood Diamond from being too depressing.In spite of a fairly uncompromising portrayal of violence and a strong political viewpoint, this is still very much a Hollywood movie, with big name stars and personalities far less complex than the situation they find themselves in. I could see people objecting to this, but I think it works, both because it gives the viewer something to hold onto in a sea of madness and because it fits in nicely with the movie as a through-the-looking-glass version of old Hollywood treasure-adventure films.I avoid really depressing movies, and I don't know if I read what I just wrote before seeing Blood Diamond if I could have brought myself to watch it, but it is well worth watching, a powerful, moving experience. Hopefully it did some good in terms of bringing these problems to light.",9,0,0,9 July 2008
Singin' in the Rain," A movie where came together perfectly
","Singing in the Rain is one of the movies in which everything is virtually perfect. The screenplay is one of Green and Comden's best. The direction by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen is perfect. The musical numbers are fantastic, especially Make 'Em Laugh and Kelly's all-time best number (no, not the title number, which honestly I've never loved the way other people do, but the brilliant, balletic Broadway Melody). Kelly is charming, Donald O'Conner is breezily funny, Debbie Reynold's is a perfect girl-next door, and Jean Hagen is wildly funny as an awful person with a voice to match.This is not to say that there is nothing to criticize. There is a tedious fashion show number that I wish could be retroactively excised and Hagen, as funny as she is, tends to look a bit too much like a comedic actress to be 100% believable as a screen goddess (she's very pretty but has the overly-expressive face of a comic). But these are such minor quibbles that for practical purposes, this is a perfect movie.",10,0,1,26 April 2016
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," fascinating exploration of memory
","Having loved the other two Charlie Kaufman movies I'd seen, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, I was eagerly looking forward to this one, which may be part of the reason that at first I was a bit underwhelmed.  The early part of the film is pretty much all set up for the later part, and while it's not bad, it's not exceptional.  But once the movie gets going, it goes all the one, creating an exhilarating and utterly fascinating experience that is funny, touching and wildly imaginative.  I can't help but feel the movie probably would have been better had it been directed by Spike Jonez, whose sensibility seems to perfectly compliment Kaufman's, and as much as I enjoyed the film, overall I felt the two Jonez movies were better.  I don't think Jonez could have improved the movie's second half much, as it was wonderful, but I think he would have made the early scenes more compelling.  But that's just a theory, and the fault may like in the writing rather than the direction.  Overall though, a great movie, brilliantly conceived and with a wonderful and telling end.",8,0,2,26 May 2004
Elysium," entertaining though unlikely plea for universal healthcare
","Neil Bloomkamp is clearly a director who believes sci-fi should convey ideas, not just throw around big special effects. He also, though, likes big special effects. With Elysium, the big idea is that rich people have created an idyllic world for themselves in outer space after trashing earth, leaving billions on earth to live in grinding poverty and work in their dangerous factories. There is a brisk trade in the equivalent of border running; Elysium is particularly alluring because it contains machines that will repair any illness. A fatal disease on earth is a quick fix on Elysium.The desire of earthers for health is mixed in with right winger xenophobe Jodie Foster's desire for power. The result is exploding space ships, battles with advanced weaponry, and android fights, all used both to entertain and to further the message.While entertaining, Elysium isn't especially convincing. The movie has a very black and white view of the dynamic between earth and Elysium, dividing the world a little too neatly into purely evil bad guys and noble folk. There is also a moment at the end that, while effective, doesn't really make sense if you think about it. Still, this is a movie with its heart in the right place, and performances are quite good, especially Sharlto Coopley as a disturbingly scary enforcer. I like the message, which in essence I believe in (i.e., the Koch brothers would totally do this if they could), and even if you don't like the message, there's lots of fun running around and explosions.",8,2,3,10 March 2014
Avatar," King Kong meets Dances With Wolves
","Avatar isn't by any means a great movie, but it is a stunningly beautiful one. The design of the alien creatures and alien landscape is superb, a fully realized world of great beauty.Take away that stunning beauty and you've got an okay but unexceptional action flick. The story is by-the-numbers, a clichéd noble-savage vs. evil empire script that is well-intentioned but unoriginal. Still, the movie moves quickly, the action is engaging and the experience is ultimately shallow but satisfying.I'm not sure how I feel about the 3D aspect. Sure, it's the best I've seen in terms of 3D technology (I haven't seen a 3D movie in many years), but I'm not sold on 3D yet. I kind of feel this movie would be just as pretty flat, and that often the 3D effect was a little distracting. But it may just be something I'm not used to.",7,1,4,22 January 2010
Frank," good indie flick
","This dramedy follows a callow young man's experience as keyboardist in an avant-garde band headed by a guy who never removes the big puppet-head that covers his face. In spite of what some people say, it's not really all that weird by indie-film standards, but it is quite entertaining, with a deservedly praised performance by Fassbender and an excellent, overlooked one by Maggie Gyllenhaal as his fierce theremin player.While a lot of people complain about a shift in tone as the movie progresses, describing it as a wacky comedy that inexplicably turns dark, to me the movie feels all of a piece. It's not all *that* funny in the first part and not all *that* dark in the last, and really, if you are surprised that the movie delves into mental illness then I feel you weren't really paying attention to the story.The movie has a lot to say about art and artists, but what it's saying isn't explicit, and the movie leaves the viewer with questions. Not questions you need to answer, but questions to ponder.",8,0,1,16 September 2019
Drag Me to Hell," well done for what it is
","I am not, as a general rule, a horror movie person, and I decided to watch this one only because I'm a big fan of Raimi's Army of Darkness. But of course, that was a comedy in a horror-movie context, which is something quite different.Drag Me to Hell falls somewhere between Army of Darkness and The Evil Dead, a movie I did not like at all (I can't remember what I thought of Evil Dead 2, but my vague recollection would be DMTH is closer to that).The movie is a fairly standard horror movie story with some solid scares and some of the comical yet still creepy horror scenes Raimi is known for. It's not my type of movie, as I say, but it is entertaining.However, the ending is incredibly lame. You know, if you've ever seen a horror movie before in your life, that the ending is coming near a half hour before it arrives, and because it's a stupid, predictable, unoriginal ending, it is extra frustrating to not only have to sit through it but to also have to sit through so much time expecting it. I realize this movie wasn't aiming for an original story, and was content to just deliver cheap scares and comedic horror, but I still just dislike it.But then, I'm not a horror movie person.",7,0,1,22 January 2011
Selma," Affecting movie with a strong focus on strategy
","This drama about MLK and the fight for voting rights in the south is notable for a few things. One is how well it establishes the stakes. Violence is a small part of the film but every violent moment is a gut punch that tells you how real and often indiscriminate the danger was. The forces of darkness gave no quarter.It also gets into the strategy. This is less MLK the inspirational leader than it is Martin the strategist. His strategy includes putting people in danger and playing hardball, and at times he shrinks from the necessity of what must be done, but you see how effective that strategy is. (Oddly the movie doesn't explain the strategy of a certain retreat, although I found an explanation online).While movies of real events often try and shrink participants into one or two, Selma isn't afraid to show how many people were a part of the movement. Many characters don't have much to do, but they're all in there, giving you a sense of a movement that's more than just one great man.At the same time, David Oyelowo is good at the thoughtful part of MLK but falls short on the charisma, failing to capture that preacher cadence and that soaring rhetoric. I appreciate the egalitarian view, but still, MLK was often electric and Oyelowo just doesn't have that electricity.Overall, this is an engrossing movie that offers a lot of historical information yet never falls into the educational-film trap of movie's like 'Lincoln.' It is effective both as history and drama. I recommend it for both.",8,0,0,15 June 2020
The Artist," Joyful valentine to the Silent Era
","When I heard there was a new, silent movie called 'The Artist,' I figured it would be one of these super-arty concept movies of the sort Guy Maddin makes, but it turned out to be pretty much the opposite, a fun, clever, sprightly valentine to the silent days.The filmmakers are clearly in love with those old movies, and this is a joyfully movie-obsessed movie, with a story about movie makers and a lot of clever ideas that toy with or extend the tricks of the silent film. The movie is full of wonderfully ingenious scenes; a starlet making love to a coat, an audience reacting to an unseen film scene, a sound-driven dream sequence.This is also a movie that simple wants to be a fun old-fashioned movie, hokey plot at all. The movie is French, and it's hard to imagine an American filmmaker creating something as un-ironic as this.The stars are wonderful. The male lead has a Douglas Fairbanks meets William Powell quality. The female lead completely captures the quality of stars like 'It girl' Clara Bow, although she's too skinny for the period. The score is fantastic. The movie starts well and gets better and better as it progresses. Well worth seeing.",8,0,3,29 February 2012
La La Land," Solid musical slightly let down by the musical numbers
","La La Land clearly wants to evoke classic movie musicals like Singing in the Rain or the Band Wagon, but it's casting is closer to later star- driven musicals like My Fair Lady. The difference is that the former starred people known for their dancing or singing, while the latter cast non-musical stars likely to carry the movie with their star power.In terms of star power, La La Land does pretty well, with a good performance by Ryan Gosling as a jerky musician and an amazing one by Emma Stone, who is every bit as good as she was in Birdland. The stars have good chemistry as the follow the traditional Holllywood trajectory from sniping to googly eyes.In My Fair Lady, Rex Harrison didn't try to sing (he just talked through the numbers) and Audrey Hepburn was redubbed, but in La La Land the stars are singing and dancing as best they can, and the movie bows to their weaknesses with songs that aren't difficult to sing and dance numbers that stay pretty simple. Because of this, there are no great musical numbers. There are some cute ones, with songs that are almost memorable and dance numbers that replace impressive performance with cute ideas, but there is no Astaire dancing on the ceiling, and there is no Minelli telling us that life is a cabaret. The sort of performers whose singing or dancing could power an amazing number - Gene Kelly, Ann Powell, Jennifer Hudson, Donald O'Conner, Tommy Tune - are in short supply nowadays. The choreographer may also simply have lacked the adventuress spirit. The first, non-star number is fun but non-musical Malcolm X's one musical number was more memorable.My girlfriend liked this slightly amateur-hour approach, and felt it was unfair to contrast the film with something like Singin' in the Rain, but I disagree, because La La Land really goes out of its way to say, 'look, this is just like those old movies with a slightly more complex view of relationships!' I feel like La La Land really does want to have an amazing dance number but knows it doesn't have the stars to pull it off, which may be why the film's most striking set piece, which comes right at the end, isn't a musical number at all even though it references a few.I liked the movie. It's fun, escapist musical entertainment. But I find the critical raves a little puzzling. It is a good, solid movie, but it pales in comparison with truly great musicals like An America in Paris, Cabaret, Sweet Charity, or West Side Story.",8,2,10,30 March 2017
Super 8," Familiar but very entertaining
","As a producer, Stephen Spielberg tends to leave his mark on films in a way other producers don't. Movies like Poltergeist and Back to the Future were so Spielbergian that one could assume he directed them.Super 8 is very much a Spielberg production. Even more, it is a 1980s Spielberg production, with the radiant light, sweeping orchestral score and plucky but fairly realistic children that distinguished many of his 80s films.Pure popcorn entertainment, Super 8 efficiently delivers excitement, adventure and a smidgen of romance amidst aliens and untrustworthy military men. Emotions are touched lightly, but never deeply enough to halt the smooth flow of the movie.The result is pleasantly familiar. It is a movie that I would have liked if I were still a teenager, but that I still totally connect with today (unlike a lot of movies about kids that are too flashy and modern to connect with an old fogey like me).Is it a great movie? No. I wouldn't even say it was particularly memorable, and it certainly has all sorts of plot holes and inconsistencies. And yet, while I was watching it I was completely enjoying myself.",8,2,3,9 September 2011
The Last Samurai," grand epic, with flaws
","The Last Samurai is a big, old fashioned sweeping entertainment with big scenery and battles and strong acting and a thoughtful script.  Yet, it suffers from typical Hollywood flaws and one can't help but have some reservations about the story.  First off, I can't take a movie seriously when it makes some American a guiding force in the history of Japan.  I mean, come on.  And the ending drags out a bit; it's the, why-have-one-moving-ending-if-you-can-have-three philosophy of filmmaking.  
Some things are great though.  Ken Watanabe is excellent as the Samurai. While the movie insists on using an American as an entry into this world, in typical Hollywood fashion, the film is mainly acted by Japanese (although oddly enough if you watch the end credits all the top billing except for Watanabe goes to western names).  And you've got to love a movie that avoids the seemingly obligatory sex scene and replaces it with a weirdly-erotic getting dressed scene; that was cool.Fun movie, plenty to criticize but still lots of fun to watch.  I give it 7 1/2 out of 10.",7,0,1,24 December 2003
3 Idiots," This inspires me to watch more Bollywood movies
","Until recently my only exposure to Indian cinema was Satyajit Ray. Like a lot of Americans, my knowledge of Bollywood was based entirely on film clips and American take-offs of lavish musical numbers.I looked on a few lists of top Bollywood films and settled on 3 Idiots, which turned out to be a wonderful decision. The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.The story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark movies, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?When I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time. Still, they are tremendous fun.To sum up, I saw a Bollywood movie, I laughed, I cried, and now I want to see more.",9,2,5,20 September 2017
Up," Moves beyond entertainment to art
","Pixar has made a lot of wonderful movies, and a couple of less wonderful ones, but nothing has impressed me as much as Up, which has the humor and heart of a Hayao Miyazaki film. The beginning is typically Pixar-cute, as a little boy meets a little girl with similar interests. This is followed by a remarkable sequence of these two over the next 50 years, which could be taken from the movie and turned into a popular animated short in animation shows.The movie moves easily from wildly, amazingly funny to non-maudlin touching. There are incredible ideas in the film that I won't spoil for you, and wonderful visuals, most notably a scene in which a mass of balloons throws brightly colored shadows. This film is both one of Pixar's funniest movies, and the one that feels most like true art. It is a movie everyone should see.",10,0,0,7 June 2010
Rio," Cute and forgettable
","While not as good as Ice Age, done by the same people, Rio has enough fun moments to make for a cute though inconsequential little cartoon. It makes Brazil look like a lot of fun (even the rickety shacks of the poor people look like fun).This is, however, very much a by-the-books cartoon using a fish-out-of- water theme and various elements of peril, romance and wacky characters. There is little you haven't seen before.The highlights are performances by Jermaine Clement as the bad guy, who even sings a very entertaining 'Flight of the Conchords'-style song, and Tracy Morgan, quite amusing as a crazy dog. Not great, but good.",7,0,0,23 August 2013
Eyes Wide Shut," Lesser Kubrick
","Not much happens in Eyes Wide Shut, yet somehow the movie kept my attention. It's weirdly interesting, but not necessarily good. Because of that, it seems much shorter than its almost three-hour length.While Nicole Kidman got better reviews than husband Tom Cruise, they really gave basically the same performance, which is mainly comprised of talking really slowly. I give no credit or blame to either of them for that, since it's clearly what Kubrick wanted.But that's Kubrick for you. He knew what he wanted, he got what he wanted, and then the audience liked it or didn't. He was an uncompromising visionary, and while I would have liked his final movie to be something I actually enjoyed, I do admire his lack of compromise.Still, for me the most entertaining moment of the movie was when Cruise groped Kidman and my girlfriend whispered ('probably the first time that's ever happened.')",6,1,5,24 August 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Good except for the auto-tuning
","This visually splendid live-action remake of the Disney animated classic is for the most part, an excellent film. It's a little darker than the original, the CGI is first-rate, and Dan Stevens is a terrific Beast.The songs are still fun (although the title song is used like a club to repeatedly beat the audience into submission) and the magic is still there (although I would still give the edge to the original). And Be Our Guest is still tremendous fun (also, it's about 95% animated). There is comedy, tragedy, romance; all that good stuff.Unfortunately, Emma Watson can't sing.Once upon a time when Hollywood insisted on casting non-singing stars for their box office appeal they dubbed the singing. It was a good system. Alas, B&B's producers made a much worse choice; they auto-tuned Watson. And it is painful.My fear is that a generation is coming of age who will consider auto-tuning perfectly acceptable. Perhaps musicals will eventually be entirely made up of famous non-singers. But for those of us who grew up before autotuning started earworming it's way into popular entertainment, this is pretty painful.As for her acting, Watson isn't a bad Belle, but I wouldn't say she was the perfect actress for the part. She's kind of forgettable here. And that just adds insult to injury. Audrey Hepburn was dubbed in My Fair Lady, but at least she really nailed the part.There are also a few lapses in logic that I'm not sure were in the original. And I can't help but feel that if the Beast was being taught a lesson for judging people by their looks, wouldn't that lesson be more effective without the most beautiful girl in the village being part of the equation?",8,0,7,25 September 2017
Inside Man," Terrific movie for the first two thirds, then ... (spoiler at bottom)
","For most of its length, Inside Man looks to be a great crime movie. The movie is efficient and stylish. Even the smallest characters are given real personalities and the movie has a wonderful sense of New York attitude. Denzel gives a thoughtful performance and Plummer is excellent. The script is smart.But then, about two thirds of the way through, problems with the script begin to show up. The movie begins to seem unfocused and some of it is unconvincing and even tending towards the ludicrous. One begins to realize that Jodie's character serves no use in the story and the story itself wanders off in an odd and unconvincing direction. The final idea behind the story isn't bad so much as the execution; there is no proper setup in terms of plot or character. It really feels like the scriptwriter had an idea that he was determined to use even though he couldn't completely get a handle on it.Still, it's fun for the most part and even though it loses a lot of momentum at the end it's still reasonably entertaining. And it's certainly worth watching.****************SPOILER*************** Here's a small but telling example of a script problem. After this big hostage thing and standoff the cops finally get into the bank and discover nothing has actually been stolen. Then Denzel's boss tells him, just forget about the case; no one really cares. But 50 people were taken hostage, which is kidnapping and thus is a very serious offense, and it was a big news story, and just because no money was lost no one is going to be demanding police action? WTF? The movie seems to have this idea that the robbers really didn't do much wrong because they didn't steal any money (this is reinforced at the end), but that's just nuts. ****************END SPOILER***********",7,7,10,28 April 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Loved this movie, even the sad parts
","Guardians of the Galaxy is, for me, the best of the Marvel Universe films, so I had high hopes for the sequel, which happily maintains the wild humor, well-drawn characters, and over-the-top effects of the first movie.A lot of the user reviews like the comedy and action but express less interest in the movies more emotional moments. This is very much a movie about family, and it doesn't shy away from the emotional nature of love and connection. I found this surprisingly affecting, although I can understand why some would prefer less tugging of the heart strings and more explosions. Still, there are an awful lot of explosions, so I'm good. Is it as good as the original? It's hard to say. The first movie benefited lack of expectations - it was nothing like the other Marvel movies so I wasn't expecting a comedy. The second movie, on the other hand, benefits from the fondness I have for the first one. So I can't say which is actually better. I can say both are great.",9,4,9,30 August 2017
Thor," watchable
","After a slow start, with lots of actors speaking in stiff, we-are-an- ancient-peoples voices, Thor picks up as the vain, arrogant god comes to earth and hooks up with some scientists. But while the movie does get better, it never moves past the mark of a Saturday afternoon time killer. There is some pretty scenery and some nice effects (the fire-shooting armor giant is particularly nicely done), but nothing that raises this above the ordinary.The acting is decent, although Thor's romance with the scientist feels less like true love than like two good-looking people who have fallen in lust, and there's not an ounce of real emotion anywhere in the spectacle. But it's perfectly fine for what it is.",6,2,4,17 July 2012
The Happening," poor, misunderstood The Happening
","I went into this movie knowing all the negative reviews it had received, but I watched it anyway because I find general reactions to Shyamalan's films don't always coincide with mine. I liked the Lady in the Water a good deal, and while I thought Unbreakable was overrated, the only one of his film's I would have been better off not watching was The Village.While it's certainly not his best movie (which is, and probably always will be, The Sixth Sense), I liked this from the freaky beginning scenes in which people inexplicably begin killing themselves. There's something wonderfully low key about it all, as though people are too confused to even freak out. That's one of the things some of the other people here have criticized - people not freaking out - and I think that's because people have come to believe movies are reality and if people don't act like people do in other movies then they're acting unrealistically. I wouldn't presume to predict how a situation like this would play out.Another thing that I like is the lack of certainty about what's going on. Many of the reviews here ignore that, just describing this as a man versus plant movie, but that's just one of the suggestions made during the film, and while the movie clearly has an environmental point (and regretfully sheds some ambiguity at the very end), it is not as simple- minded and clear cut as critics suggest. It would be more accurate to call this a man against wind movie, since it is something unknown in the air that is causing this, and I like the fact that the threat is unseen and unknown.The approach is clearly lifted from Hitchcock's The Birds, and it's interesting how everyone was willing to accept the vagaries and poor science of that movie yet lambastes this one. As with Lady in the Water, there is something notably non-Hollywood about the way people react in this film. No one knows what to do, no one knows what's going on, people constantly make bad decisions and there is a distinct lack of heroism. And I like that. In a way, I feel Shyamalan is an indie filmmaker who engenders Hollywood expectations. I feel that many of the film's critics want both this film and Lady in the Water to feature Tom Cruise jumping off of buildings and blowing stuff up.I also quite like the odd minor characters. It's interesting that the most helpful people in the movie are kind of disturbing. I've seen movies where the hero was helped by someone great, or helped by someone who turned out to be dangerous, but I've never the hero helped by people who were just the sort of peculiar people you would inch away from if you didn't need their help.While I don't understand the hatred of the script, I can see some point in complaints about the acting. Zooey is like someone with a piece missing, almost sleepwalking through the film, and the movie either needs her more engaged or needs to make us understand what's behind that. And while Mark seems fine in the lead role, I will admit that I was not strongly invested in the characters. But then, that was also true in The Birds.I think what keeps getting Shyamalan in trouble is people don't understand what movie he's making. Both this movie and Lady in the Water were accused of not being scary enough, and if Shyamalan was trying to make them really scary, he failed. But I don't think he was doing that. I think he is more interested in Hitchcockian suspense than in pure horror, and I think the Sixth Sense is, in a way, his curse, because everyone says, 'do that again,' and that's clearly not his goal.This is not to say the film had no flaws. There were definitely moments that were unrealistic. The suicides were sometimes too imaginative to be likely, and at times behavior seemed designed specifically to get the characters to a particular point rather than because it made sense (i.e. the train drivers' actions).In spite of some issues though, I found this movie very entertaining, and enjoyed it seemingly for many of the aspects that others found so unlikable. My takeaway is this: I can never listen to anyone else when it comes to Shyamalan. Now that I realize that, I guess I should even go ahead and watch The Last Airbender.(FYI, Were I to order the Shyamalan movies from best to worse, I would say The Sixth Sense, The Visit, Signs, Lady in the Water, The Happening, Unbreakable, The Last Airbender, The Village.)",7,4,8,20 August 2013
Castle in the Sky," Didn't love it as much as other Miyazaki films, but that might not be the movie
","At his best, Miyazaki makes me indescribably happy with wonder. That's why I love his movies. I consider movies like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away to be, in essence, bottled happiness.But as with most great artists, different people will appreciate different things. One of Miyazaki's most popular films, Princess Mononoke, is my least favorite, because it's more about violence and drama than mystery and ethereal splendor.Castle in the Sky falls more in the Mononoke action adventure category, and as that, it's a pretty good move, exciting, well paced and visually imaginative and generally fun. I was less excited by this movie than others by Miyazaki,and that might be because it is very actiony, with lots of shooting and things blowing up, and that's not what I love by Miyazaki. But it might be something else.I started watching this movie with my girlfriend late at night, and for the first hour I thought it was terrific. But we got sleepy, and didn't watch the rest of the movie for a few days. Which means the problem might not be anything more than a loss of dramatic momentum owing to my seeing the movie broken up. Or it could be that the second hour really is weaker. I don't know. I did see this movie once before, and it didn't stick with me the way other Miyazaki films have, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked it better this time had I seen it in a single sitting.In other words, you can't put too much stock in this review, except to the extent that I can stand by my belief that this is an enjoyable movie. I just can't say if I would have enjoyed it more in different circumstances.",7,0,2,31 August 2013
The Shape of Water," fun cross-genre flick
","This lovely adult fairy tale mixes genres with wild abandon, ranging from monster movies to romances to musicals to caper films. The central character is intriguing, and the story is engaging.The direction is impressive, though in a rather showoff-y way. There is a constant theme of water echoed in the aqua colors of the sets, and the sound editing has fantastic segues, but I'm not convinced this actually means anything. It's just kind of cool.This is why I tend to feel that the director may well deserve his Oscar, but Get Out would have been a better choice for Best Picture. The Shape of Water is lovely but slight, hugely enjoyable but not that important.Still, definitely worth watching.",8,3,8,3 October 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," a real mixed bag
","The Wachowski Brothers must believe everyone in the world has seen The Matrix, because this sequel makes absolutely no attempt whatsoever to tell you what is going on. None. Fortunately, pretty much everyone *has* seen The Matrix, so we all had a general idea of what was going on, I just mention it as an example of bad film-making.Muddle and self important, reloaded takes about an hour to get going. That first hour is remarkably lame, often seeming like some stodgy gladiator epic from the '50s, and containing a remarkable stupid and unnecessary bacchanal.But although it is vastly inferior to the original, with a story that never draws you in and has neither an ending nor a good cliffhanger (the end just left me scratching my head, unclear as to why that last shot is worthy of portentous music), the movie isn't completely worthless. While the fight scenes feel more like dance scenes, with no sense that a real fight is going on, they are fun, well choreographed, and at times quite ingenious, most notably in that short fight inside a car. And while there's a lot of sophomoric crap about free will and predetermination, the explanation near the end on the structure of the Matrix and The One's purpose was a surprisingly smart sci-fi concept in a movie that for the most part was more chopsocky than sci-fi. If you've seen the first one and approach this with low expectations (or, like some of the people at this site, consider all that blather deep) you might enjoy yourself, but if you're expecting a worthy sequel to The Matrix, forget it.",6,1,2,26 May 2004
The Disaster Artist," intentionally funny > unintentionally funny
","The Disaster Artist falls in the genre of films in which an unsure individual meets a charismatic, free-spirited dynamo who opens him up to the possibilities of the world. Only this time that guru character is a delusional no-talent.This is the hilarious story of the world's worst film director, and the movie gives you pretty much the guy as he displayed himself in his terrible movie The Room. James Franco perfectly captures the character, offering someone weird and clueless but also sometimes likable and insanely self-confident (his confidence and pathological lying would make him a great addition to the Trump administration).The film seems targeted at those who have seen The Room; an end-credits sequence shows that they worked very hard to make their recreations exactly like the original, which will be appreciated by those who have gone to many midnight showings. I have seen The Room (painfully inept), but I feel even if you haven't you'll find this very funny.The story is told from the viewpoint of his friend Greg. Dave Franco's performance is pretty good, but while the mysterious weirdness of Tommy is a lot of the movie's appeal, ultimately I felt I didn't know much more about Greg. He isn't as crazy as Tommy, but what is he? Is he just kind of dumb? There's an opaqueness to Dave's performance that keeps the movie from moving beyond superficiality.So it's not deep, it doesn't have much to say, and the character of Greg never goes much beyond - guy who wants to be an actor. But it's freaking hilarious. I don't understand people who watch The Room over and over, but I would definitely watch this again.",9,0,3,3 October 2019
A Beautiful Mind," stop reading these reviews and watch the movie
","I hadn't read any reviews of this movie, I just heard it was really good, and I'm glad, because I think it would be difficult to talk about without saying too much.  So I'm not going to say a thing about the story.  I'm just going to say that this is a fascinating story beautiful told and acted. It's funny, dramatic and touching but it never feels manipulative (well, maybe once near the end), letting the emotional effects come naturally from the actions (unlike other Ron Howard movies).  It is a movie that starts good and gets better and better as it progresses.  The story is told simply; the director doesn't let himself get in the way of the material.  So trust me, stop reading these little reviews and watch it.  I rate it 9/10.",9,1,3,8 December 2003
American Made," Often interesting yet never completely grabbed me
","This fictionalized account of smuggler Barry Seal has much to recommend it. Cruise is his usual charming self, the film is interspersed with these interesting montage moments, and there is breezy humor and an intriguing story of criminals working hand in hand with the U.S. government.But by the midpoint I was just feeling kind of disengaged. I wasn't quite sure what the point was. And Cruise felt slightly off in a role that would make more sense to me if he seemed a bit stupider and trashier; it seemed the equivalent of casting George Clooney to play Lyndon Johnson.In the end, I would say American Made was perfectly fine, but it's the sort of movie I will have completely forgotten in a month.",6,1,2,19 July 2018
The Holiday," Funny, but some casting issues
","This somewhat odd but distinctly likable film involves two women, one in L.A. and one in London, both unhappy in love, who switch homes to shake up their lives.The movie is often funny and sometimes touching, with solid performances from all. Perhaps the biggest issue is the absence of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jack Black, which gives the movie a false note that could have been avoided if it wasn't so determined to follow the standard romantic comedy path. Winslet has much better chemistry with Eli Wallach, wonderful as an aged scriptwriter.One interesting thing to note is Jude Law, whose handsome, empathetic, nurturing, understanding character could best be described as lady porn, plays the sort of role usually played by a woman: the perfect person, wonderful in every way, whose main role in the story is to allow the main character to transition to a new phase in their life.It's not a great movie, and I don't love the structure, which simply involves cutting back and forth between two unrelated stories, but it's a nice feel-good chick flick thing that is perfect for days you don't want your brain to work too hard.",7,7,8,29 August 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," engrossing, entertaining propaganda
","I saw this movie in a rather strange form. I watched the first hour, but by the end of that my girlfriend was so freaked out by all the very convincing torture scenes and general sense of gritty violence that she couldn't watch anymore. A year later, she decided it was time to watch the rest. Oddly enough, it turns out by the time she had stopped, the torture was over.In fact, the movie has at least three distinct parts, an early section devoted to interrogation, then a section devoted to analysis and lobbying Washington, and then an infiltration section.The first section is gritty and well done, but it's also where all the controversy lies. The movie takes the position that torture is how we got our actionable intelligence, something a later congressional report suggested was not true. The movie hues very closely to how the military wants this mission to be portrayed, from its effective interrogation to its brilliant analysis to its artful infiltration. Of course, lots of movies portray torture as magically effective, even though historically, torture is anything but. The problem is, this movie claims historical accuracy.Beyond that, it's an interesting movie, especially the final section, which goes against pretty much everything you'll see in a typical war movie. The soldiers are methodical, gunplay is over almost before it begins, and the body count is kept to a minimum. It feels very realistic and completely devoid of Hollywood flash.While well made and engrossing, I never found this movie as thrilling as the critics did. It is a good movie, but I wouldn't call it a must-see movie, even if I didn't have issues with its politics.",7,0,1,21 February 2015
Steve Jobs," As beautifully constructed as an iPhone
","Steve Jobs is a terrific movie with terrific acting, especially from Michael Fassbender as the title character. It is thoroughly entertaining and engaging, Danny Boyle sets a quick pace that never lets down, and the dialogue is a perfect example of Aaron Sorkin's ear for witty, intense patter.But what I found most striking about the movie was the ingenuity of its design, which managed to take a very loose collection of incidents and turn it into a coherent whole.The movie has three acts, each one devoted to a single product launch by Jobs. People are running around trying to finalize things, Jobs is making demands, but all through preparation his friends and relatives are importuning him on this and that. The movie is best summed up by Job when he says 'It's like five minutes before every launch everyone goes to the bar and then tells me what they really think of me.'The amazing thing is how nicely this works. Certain themes keep reappearing, so that even though these events are years apart they flow neatly into one another.The ending is a neat trick, taking one of the film's threads and making it feel like that's what the movie was really all about, even though it was probably 20% of the movie, so that you have a satisfying ending.There are some minor issues, such as Kate Winslet's accent, which inexplicably gets stronger as the years progress. Also, there is little interest here in historical accuracy, so you probably shouldn't take much of anything here as gospel. But as storytelling this is absolutely terrific.",9,0,2,5 October 2016
Hercules," very funny
","Sprightly, wacky take on Greek mythology, with gospel-singing muses, excellent acting and the same sort of slapstick comedy that is so much fun in Lilo & Stitch.  I can't help but wish the big monsters weren't so computer-animated looking, but they were still impressive even if they looked a little too slick and machine-like compared with the rest of the animation.  Very funny, and one of those rare Disney cartoons where I actually enjoyed some of the songs, notably I Won't Say I'm in Love, although I could have done without the boy Hercules' pining song.",7,1,3,29 November 2003
Love Actually," Infatuation, Actually
","Well, I finally saw Love, Actually. I hadn't planned to. I've read a number of articles on why it's awful - most notably Lindy West's hilariously savage takedown - so I figured I could skip it. But I was with my girlfriend's family and it was on so there you are.It's hard to be objective after so much anti-anticipation, but I'm inclined to say that, if you accept that this is manipulative and nonsensical, it's a reasonably effective bit of Hollywood Christmas entertainment. Just ignore that romance is reserved for young women without a lot to say and that this movie is not about love at all but instead is about becoming infatuated with people you don't know and may have nothing in common with and it's all fine.The structure is unusual, in that's it's a series of little intertwined vignettes about a group of interconnected people. A little boy is in love with a girl he hasn't spoken to, a guy falls in love with a woman who doesn't speak English, a Prime Minister has the hots for an attractive woman everyone in the movie inexplicably describes as fat (as though the part was written for a heavier woman and then some producer shouted 'WE CAN'T HAVE A FAT CHICK IN THIS MOVIE!').Many of the characters are likable in general, and some of the scenes, taken by themselves, are kind of brilliant. Yes, that guy putting his emotional baggage on a newlywed is screwed up, but IT'S DONE IN SIGNS! No, it makes no sense those two people who couldn't converse and barely interacted fell in love, but the culminating scene is funny and rather touching. There is no movie that requires stand ins for a series of nothing but sex scenes, but those scenes are funny and the low-key relationship that develops is the most likable and believable thing in the movie.What Love, Actually is, above all else, is *clever.* The exhausting, sometimes annoying structure is clever. There are ingenious scenes and situations and some sharp dialogue. But the cleverness seems to exist for its own sake rather than in the service of saying something about love or lust or the human condition, so the whole thing is kind of empty.Would I have rated this movie higher if I had no information going in? Probably. I probably would have given it a 7 and said it was dumb but entertaining even though I found jumping from story to story a little annoying. I can't imagine rating it higher than 7, though, and definitely don't see this as a particularly good example of the romantic comedy.It's not really as bad as I thought it might be. If you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, go ahead and take a look.",6,1,3,8 December 2019
Sausage Party," Deviant Pixar
","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, this looks so twisted I'm not sure if I want to watch it. But by the end, I thought, this looks so twisted I'm going to have to watch it.The movie is styled after typical animated kid's movies like Toy Story, with anthropomorphized foodstuffs in a grocery store chatting and singing. Their song describes the joy of the moment when the 'gods' will take them to the 'great beyond,' and the movie is mainly concerned with the horrific truth that the great beyond is where food goes to be sliced, boiled, and eaten.Deaths are both clever and horrific, as when a jar of jelly lies on the floor, its life-jelly oozing out, while a jar of peanut butter weeps. I mean, the people who made this movie are really sick.There's also a lot of jokes about sex. It's possible that sex jokes make up 50% of this film.Surprisingly, even though the movie is full of sick humor and cheap sex jokes, this is a surprisingly smart movie. The story is well designed, the characters are relatable, and the movie has interesting takes on religious belief and approaches Mid-East tensions . It's well animated and voiced and often really, really funny. This really is the movie Pixar would make if they decided to make a really tasteless movie about sex between hot dogs and buns. Seriously.I would expect a lot of people to hate this movie. It's basically a movie of foul-mouthed food telling sex jokes and dying horribly. But for a certain sort of twisted individual, this movie is a blast.",8,6,12,22 November 2016
Joker," Superficial and often tedious but what a performance!
","In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized 'woke' culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it.",5,7,15,5 January 2020
A Hard Day's Night," often brilliant comedy with great songs
","A Hard Day's Night is a largely plotless romp with the Beatles telling jokes and running around. It's also a hugely influential work by Richard Lester that brought New Wave ideas into a more entertaining framework and created much of the grammar for future music videos. The film represents one of the few times a rock band movie had a genuinely talented director in charge, and it's a must-see for anyone who likes the Beatles or is interested in film history.Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style, not much happens. Paul's uncle gets in trouble, Ringo gets out of sorts, and girls scream. The Beatles' Liverpool accents and breezy personas were unusual in films of the time, and while you can't necessarily say any of them can act except Ringo, they are utterly charming.A youth-against-the-man theme runs throughout the movie, starting with an encounter with an obnoxious train passenger (who is probably in the right) and reaching its apex in the movie's best scene, where George gently mocks a corporate trend manipulator.The songs are, of course, wonderful. Some musical numbers are little more than the Beatles sitting and playing, but the opening of Hard Day's Night is an extended chase and Can't Buy Me Love is a lot of joyful hijinks that is a classic of its kind.The weakest part of the movie is the last section, in which the Beatles perform in a studio before an audience of screaming girls. The hysteria is somewhat entertaining, but for the most part this is just the Beatles performing songs that were already played earlier in the movie.If you like this movie, check out other Richard Lester films like The Knack and How to Get It.",8,1,1,16 September 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Fun sci-fi take on Groundhog Day
","Ever since Groundhog day, time-loops have had a consistent presence in movies. Edge of Tomorrow gives the premise a sci-fi twist, as an unwilling soldier finds himself battling through the same day over and over.This is first time-loop movie I've ever seen that offered an explanation beyond magic or wishes, and while I'm not entirely convinced it all makes sense, it all seems to make sense while you're watching, which is the important thing.You won't have much time to think about the story anyway, because this movie never stops moving. It handles its premise very well, giving us the highlights of what would be a grueling, years-long experience for the protagonist.Action scenes are fun, the acting is solid, and the movie manages to squeeze tiny moments of human contact in between moments of alien destruction. The movie never lags, and even though it's all about reliving a day, it's good at not repeating its own ideas.The movie does get a little unfocused towards the end (but only a little) and the ending isn't especially convincing, but the overall experience is terrific.",8,0,1,13 August 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great movie with a fantastic performance by DiCaprio
","This is a terrifically fun movie. Martin Scorcese offers pitch perfect direction in which nothing is just for show even though for the title character, everything is for show. Jonah Hill is surprisingly good as a jittery stockbroker, although it's hard to believe the guy on which he was based was that odd.Above everything else there is an absolutely amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. He is clearly taking great delight in portraying the psychopathic fabulist who build wall street firm out of a bunch of penny-ante drug dealers. Of particular note is a wonderful sequence where he attempts to function in a state of complete drug-induced collapse. He is funny, charming, and disturbing.This is essentially one of Scorcese's crime dramas, albeit with less violent criminals. Here the bad guys get on the covers of financial magazines, and when they go to jail, it's at cushy white-collar prisons where they play tennis all day. The culture and the people and the lifestyle horrify me, yet I'm sure many will look at a life of hookers, blow, and stealing everything that isn't nailed down and imagining that life for themselves. That's the sad thing about this movie; for some people it's pretty much the American dream.",9,0,3,28 January 2015
It Chapter Two," Fun followup
","I enjoyed 2017's It, an exciting though not scary horror movie with good special effects and an interesting cast of characters, and to me, It 2 is very much in keeping with the first one. It's got a lot of fun, exciting, clever moments and keeps your interest.I was surprised when I read the user reviews and found a notable consensus that the movie wasn't as good as the first. But I do see their points, now that I think about it. Separating the characters to go on their episodic journeys of discover does keep the movie from flowing as smoothly. And I did find the ending somehow anticlimactic, even as it strived to be otherwise.That being said, I still thought it was, generally speaking, as fun as I remember the first one being. The cast is quite good, particularly Bill Hader, and it's interesting to see how they've changed and not changed from childhood.I'd say the best way to watch this is immediatly after watching the last one. I had years between them, but now people don't have to watch one then wait. So have at it!",8,2,5,8 December 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Some interesting scenes strung together
","At the end of watching Hail Caesar, I turned to my girlfriend and said, 'that was not a movie.'And yet, it does have much in common with movies. There is a story, kind of. There are characters. There are some entertaining scenes. And yet...I wasn't actually thinking 'this wasn't a movie' while I watched it. There was a basic story involving a studio executive handling various emergencies and secondary stories involving a kidnapped actor and a miscast cowboy. There was an excellent cast (although so many actors that few get much screen time), including a wonderful Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists. While it started slow, the movie had entertaining moments, including a fun Busby Berkley-style swim number, an amusing attempt to get the cowboy to deliver a single line correctly, and a first-rate tap/swing number.But at the end, it just felt like there was nothing there. The movie is built on the very slight scaffold of the executive's decision on whether to move to a different industry, and because you never care about him (he's a classically generic, faceless character), you don't really care what he decides.Much of the movie is simply scenes from fictional movies, including a Ben Hur variant. I say variant rather than take-off or parody because the attempts seems more to mimic the style of these films than to burlesque them. The result is not quite parody and not quite tribute.If the Coen Brothers wanted to make a bunch of old-Hollywood style scenes, they would have been better served to simply make their version of an old-Hollywood movie (as they did with Hudsucker Proxy) than to make this odd pastiche.",6,1,2,10 September 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," underwhelming
","Another mild comedy starring the genial, semi-talented Will Ferrel, this time playing a 70s news anchor. I heard this was a very funny movie but I can't figure out why anyone would believe that. It's sort of amusing in its extended-Saturday-Night-Live-Skit kind of way, but after 15 or 20 minutes of being reasonably amused I had seen every basic comedy idea the movie was going to present, and it just kept repeating itself. Ferrel's Ron Burgundy would be an acceptable character for a sketch but there's not enough of him to make a whole movie. The movie would have to be far funnier to sustain its one-dimensional lead. The 1970s references strike me as odd; the movie doesn't really seem to commit to a 70s period identity but throws in 70s period stuff, leading to a feeling of disinterest in its setting.There were some funny moments in the movie, and I particularly liked Carrel's idiot weather guy. And Applegate was good, although her more intelligent performance clashed with Ferrel's cartoony one. Watchable if you've got nothing better to do, but that's about it.",5,2,4,22 July 2005
Dark Shadows," Cute Trifle
","I was a kid when Dark Shadows started, and it was never on my radar. When I heard about it later I was very curious, and when it finally was syndicated on TV I watched a couple of episodes and found it painfully tedious. A 70s daytime soap with vampires is still a 70s daytime soap.The movie version is decidedly faster paced, aiming for campy, silly comedy and cute special effects. While it's not as fun as Burton's Ed Wood nor as deep as his Big Fish, it is a generally amusing burlesque of 70s television.I felt the last part of the movie was the weakest. Dark Shadows owes its success to not taking itself seriously, but towards the end, as the various dramatic threads come awkwardly together, the movie tries to both give viewers some flashy special effects and pull some emotion out of them, and it just doesn't work, both because it's not in keeping with the rest of the film and because the movie doesn't try hard enough to create that emotion. But overall I thought this was quite fun.",7,1,3,5 November 2012
Kingpin," I have no idea why people like this unpleasant pseudo-comedy
","I didn't like this movie from very early on. The usually reliable Bill Murray was more creepy than funny, and after an early, fairly unpleasant sequence, we move years into the future where Woody Harrelson is almost as creepy.The comedy comes in bits and starts. Some of it is pretty conventional humor, some is close to Airplane levels of silliness, but much of the movie isn't especially funny at all. I seem reviews here that say this movie is hilarious, and honestly, I couldn't even guess at the parts people found hilarious.The brightest spot was Randy Quaid, who had a pleasant goofiness and general likability. I kept thinking, maybe if I stick with this it will get funny eventually, but about two-thirds of the way through I decided to give up.I would never have guess the guys who made this would go on to make something as good as There's Something About Mary.",3,2,7,20 April 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Best of the Kong remakes
","The original 1933 film King Kong was such a hit that studios have been reviving the big ape ever since. There were sequels, there were a couple of Japanese things, and in the 70s there was a painfully slow and tedious movie only notable for containing Jessica Lange's all- time worst performance.More recently Peter Jackson attempted to turn the story into a LOTR- style epic, resulting in a few good scenes drowned in sheer bulk.Skull Island is in some ways a return to the simplicity of the original. There's a giant ape on an island of monsters, there's a bunch of people getting killed, and there's a lot of action. The shortest Kong movie in some time, coming in at well under two hours, the film gets in a lot of action and even has room for a madness-of-war, Vietnam-inspired undercurrent (which feels a little random but basically works).The best action scene is Kong versus the helicopters. It's a very intense sequence that, like many scenes in the movie, is a sort of call-back to something in the original. It's unfortunate that the movie can't match that scene elsewhere, but it's generally quite entertaining all the same. I do think it's possible that if you edited the Jackson film from 3 hours to the length of this one it might be the better movie, but based on what was released, Skull Island is easily the best Kong reboot.Skull Island isn't too attached to the original story, which is fine by me. It even virtually ditches the whole ape/girl romance, which went from obsessive love in the original to weirdly sexual in the 70s to girl-as-pet from Jackson to a sort of mutual respect thing in this one. The movie also stays on the island - no empire state building this time around. There's room for a sequel, but I hope this franchise continues to do its own thing.",7,0,2,20 July 2017
Hitch," great first half, then falls apart
","For the first hour, this is a very funny movie, fueled almost entirely by WIll Smith's inexhaustible supplies of charm. And Kevin James is quite amusing as a klutzy guy who seeks his help in winning the girl of his dreams. There are things that could have been better - there's no explanation of why Hitch targets Mendes and works it so hard or anything to indicate James' 'love' is anything more than an infatuation with a girl because she's pretty, but the movie bounces along with minimal plot and much humor for a good while.The movie dies when the story kicks in as Smith's romance begins to clash with James. The moment I saw that open, I knew exactly the pedestrian path the movie would follow, and I found it painfully to watch it tritely and predictably play out. The complete lack of originality was downright insulting to the audience, as though the writers couldn't be bothered to even try for anything different from a million other mediocre romantic comedies.",6,0,0,26 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," quite entertaining, although lacks the personality of the originals
","After the previous two turkeys I wasn't expecting much out of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a genuinely exciting action movie with some very cool sequences. It looks very good and has a great sense of massiveness in the sets.It is also a lot of fun to see how nicely the ending of this movie dovetails with the original Star Wars. It makes me want to re-watch that one just to see how it ties in. They really make a nice transition. I did not, unfortunately, get any of the in-jokes relating to what would happen in the future movies because I haven't watched them all a dozen times like some people in the theater had, but it's nice they are there.This is an odd series, because if you actually watch it in numerical order then a lot of the big surprises in episodes 4-6 wouldn't be surprises at all. Even though events fit well together, the films are best viewed as they were made. Of course, if you started watching from Episode 1 you would just stop and never watch the others, but I would say the correct order to watch the films is Episode 4, 5, 6 and 3. Ignore the other two altogether.While this is a very enjoyable movie, it does fall flat in terms of character. Obiwan and Anakin are both personality-deprived, and Natalie Portman seems to have been drained of character since the first movie, in which I recall she was at least kind of interesting. What the movie really lacks is the star power of actors like Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, and Billy Dee Williams. This is a movie about a bunch of stiffs, and CGI actors Yoda and Grievous are more intriguing than the humans (and neither of them is half as interesting as Harrison Ford).I could quibble with other stuff, but all in all it's quite entertaining, very good looking and, if not as good as the original trilogy, at least - unlike the previous two - worthy of being mentioned in the same breath with them.",8,11,22,6 May 2005
Ray," you'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll tap your toes
","You really can't find a biopic much better than Ray. Beautifully written, beautifully directed, beautifully acted. Of course one hears the most about Jamie Fox's amazing performance. He does an incredible job of capturing Ray Charles. It's not just that he has Charles' movements down, but that rather than imitating them, he seem to feel them, to actually understand who Ray is and how he feels at his core. Charles is a complex man and Foxx shows you a complex figure; one tends to forget it's a performance and just think it is Charles. The rest of the cast is also uniformly excellent.But this is not just a Foxx vehicle, the whole movie is beautifully crafted. The cinematography is gorgeous. The direction is flawless. THere are scenes that I thought were brilliant, like one in which the young Ray focuses on the sounds around him. It's pure craftsmanship, as you feel just what is happening. Charles' music is also used to wonderful effect. All-in-all, an amazing work.",8,1,2,6 September 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Impressively Animated
","Snow White was Disney's first feature-length cartoon, and it's clear he wanted something that would wow audiences. The animation is ambitious and wonderfully detailed. Of particular note is the scene of Snow White running through the forest and the scenes involving the forest animals. Those forest animals are the single most impressive thing in the movie, flowing and swirling like leaves in the air, almost constantly in motion yet never unpleasantly chaotic. At the same time, these scenes have been so well parodied in other movies that at times they seem a bit absurd. Even before the parodies, there is something over the top about the dainty, domestic princess with a way with animals.For me, the movie lost a little momentum with the entry of the dwarfs, whose broad humor interested me less than the more serious earlier animation. This is not to say that the dwarfs weren't funny, in that mild, Disney way (both now and as a child I preferred the sharp, sarcastic style of Warner Brothers cartoons to the genial Disney style), but the focus on comedy meant less of a focus on pure artistry. The movie is also very much of its time. Snow White is the small-town girl ideal, a sweet and trusting princess who wanders into an empty house and immediately starts cleaning it. She has the girlish voice of Betty Boop without the attitude, and I found her a bit bland (although less so than Sleeping Beauty, many years later.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie with moments of greatness.",8,5,6,28 April 2014
Bring It On," The popularity of this movie is inexplicable
","When Bring it On came out I figured it was some dumb teen comedy full of bare teen flesh and bland humor, but then I heard all the critics loved it and I thought, well, maybe it's more.  It's not.  It's awful.  It is inexplicable to me why people are raving about this movie.  It's not funny at all. The story is lame and slapdash, dialogue is poorly written, and most importantly it's not remotely funny.  Me and my friends watched in stunned amazement, occassionally laughing at the ineptitude of the film but otherwise just staring in puzzlement.  The only respite was Ian Roberts riotously funny turn as a choreographer.  For about five minutes the movie was just hysterical, and then it was back to dumb again.  I am so confused: not only is this site full of rave comments, but most people felt motivated to write really, really long commentaries outlining the entire dull story. 
The same day I saw this movie I saw a documentary on high school cheerleaders on MTV's True Life.  It was far more interesting.",Null,0,0,4 July 2001
Inception," Brilliant, original movie mixes action, suspense and existentialism
","It took me a while to get around to seeing this movie, and when I started watching it I realized that I had no idea what it was about. I had never read a review of any sort. I'd just heard it was a mind trip from the guy who did Memento, and that was the reason I wanted to watch it.While this isn't a movie where not knowing what it's about would really heighten the experience the way it would with something like The Truman Show, I would say the ideal way to watch it is to stop reading reviews and just watch it. I'm also not going to say a thing about the story.That being said, this is an amazing movie. It has a fairly original premise, it is exciting and suspenseful and intricately plotted. The special effects are amazing. The characters are well thought out (except, perhaps for one characters inexplicable decision to get more immersed than necessary or advisable) and its mix of psychology and pondering on the nature of reality is fascinating.It's the sort of movie that, at the end, makes you wonder, 'did that really all make sense?' Fortunately the website screenrant has a wonderful analysis that makes it clear that yes, this really does all hold together pretty well.A beautifully designed, extravagantly clever, wildly entertaining movie. Watch it.",9,1,6,8 June 2011
Murder on the Orient Express," Pretty good, really
","Murder on the Orient Express is Kenneth Branaugh's comfortable but generally somewhat uninspired take on the traditional star-studded, handsomely-mounted Christie adaptation.Some things are very good. I really like Branaugh's version of Poirot. While not quite as perfect as David Suchet, Branaugh is appealing and thoughtful, and it's wonderful that there is finally a Poirot with the sort of over-the-top mustache one always imagined from the book's descriptions. I prefer him to Albert Finney, who was never my concept of the character.I also really liked the final reveal, which got a fair amount of drama out of the traditional detective-explains-it-all scene.The cast was quite good, particulary Johnny Depp as something other than a cartoon character.Some things put me off a bit. Giving Poirot some OCD seems both unnecessary and a rip-off of the TV series Monk. And putting Poirot in a couple of action scenes was just odd. These sorts of attempts to add flash to Christie rarely work out; the woman knew how to construct a story.Overall, the movie was enjoyable but never quite riveting. I knew the solution, so for me it was about watching the way it was all done, and it felt generally a little muted. I was interested, but rarely fully engaged.At the end of the movie there's a reference to the book that was used as a sequel to the last MOE. Are they going to try that one again? It didn't work out very well last time, and Christie has a lot of books to choose from, but I guess I'm okay with that.I recall enjoying the 70s MOE more, although I don't know what I would think of it now. As recent Christie adaptations go, it's not as good as the minseries of And Then There Were Done but it's much better than the dreary Crooked House. I do hope they do a sequel, but I also hope they get a little more life into any future productions.",7,1,4,24 March 2018
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," flawed but effective portrayal of the corrosive effects of war
","There are a fair number of movies out there about the horrors of war, but they often portray war as a necessary evil.  That's why a movie like Saving Private Ryan isn't an anti-war film; they are presumably fighting the good fight.  But Taegukgi portrays war as an evil that poisons everything it touches.  War is not noble, both sides do awful things.  War twists soldiers into monsters and leaves only the peace of death.  While often searing, with jittery, suspenseful scenes of battle, the movie can be a little hokey.  The two brothers fighting together is a bit too pat. The swelling orchestral score is a bit too emotional.  Worst, towards the end both brothers have the sort of superhero fighting skills common in old war movies, where someone like John Wayne could singlehandedly take out a regiment.  This is so utterly ridiculous that I found myself growing impatient with the movie by the end, and a little puzzled by the lack of criticism at this site for such obvious flaws.  It's an effective, absorbing, powerful movie, although there's nothing in it as stunning as the opening sequence of Private Ryan, but even though it is Korean, it is too found of hokey Hollywood devices to be a truly great film.",7,4,10,2 September 2004
The Secret Life of Pets," So much fun
","I heard good things about this movie, but then I read some of the IMDb reviews and got worried that this would be too much of a kiddy movie. But nope, this is absolutely great.It's made by the same people who did the terrific Despicable Me films, and like those, it's very funny and pumps out one gag after another in quick succession. The movie manages to both catch real qualities of animals, like cats that will bite then lick you, and goofy nonsensical things like an angry bunny leading a stray revolution.The cast is excellent, particularly Kevin Hart as the aforementioned bunny and Ellie Kemper and Lake Bell as two of the protagonists' friends.The story is little more than an excuse for a lot of gags, but it works.Some people are complaining this movie is too violent for kids. When I was a kid, Bugs Bunny would hand Daffy Duck a bomb that caused his bill to come off, so I have trouble taking the violence complaint seriously. It's got some action-movie fisticuffs and a bit of suspense, but I see nothing wrong with that. It's fun.",8,2,3,27 November 2016
Finding Dory," A movie for the special needs fish in your life
","Finding Dory centers around Dory, a fish with a memory disorder on the search for her parents.Dory is a rather pitiable character, and honestly, at first I found the storyline a tad depressing. But ultimately the movie follows the Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer concept of triumph over adversity.While the movie starts off slowly, it hits its stride around the halfway mark as the plot picks up and a chameleon squid comes along to goose the comedy. Overall the movie is quite fun, offering some clever ideas, solid humor, and touching moments that emphasize the strength's that allow Dory to overcome her weaknesses. While not as good as Finding Nemo, Finding Dory is a cute little movie that is well worth watching.",8,0,4,5 February 2017
Arrival," A Thinking Person's sci-fi film
","It would be unfair to neatly divide sci-fi cinema into mindless action flicks and intellectual futurist dramas - many movies have elements of both - but if you did make that division, Arrival would be very far into the latter category. This is, after all, a movie about a linguist learning to communicate with aliens, and if that sounds boring to you then you probably will be bored by this movie, because that's very much what you get. But as I say, sci-fi doesn't categorize that neatly, so you also get some suspense and a good deal of deep emotional content.I thought this movie was terrific. It is a movie that tries to create aliens who communicate in a unique, powerful way. I felt it did a pretty decent job of showing the challenges and possible ways to approach learning to communicate with an alien species (although the film acts as though linguists don't already have set protocols to learn new languages, which annoyed me). I can understand people not liking this, because it is pretty slow moving. On the other hand, the one-star user reviews here usually raised all sorts of dumb objections that suggest they just didn't understand the movie. I'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons for an intelligent, thoughtful person to dislike this movie, I'm just saying that there are a lot of hostile reviews here by half-wits. So you should ignore those.Amy Adams is excellent, the special effects are well done, the way the arrival effects the world is persuasive, and the movie is clear without spoonfeeding the audience. All in all, an excellent, thoughtful movie.",8,2,9,21 May 2017
Parasite," Income Inequality: The Movie
","This fascinating South Korean film starts with a poor family scheming to get jobs with a rich family but eventually becomes something much darker and weirder. A very pointed exploration of the class/wealth divide, the movie is not just about personal tragedy but about societal tragedy.At the same time, it's also at times quite funny and exciting, and it's beautifully shot and acted.Thought-provoking and compelling, it's that rare movie that actually deserved all the awards it won.",9,2,4,2 March 2020
Rango," A peyote dream masquerading as a kid's movie
","For the first five minutes, I was worried that Rango was going to be some innocuous kids movie about a lonely lizard. And then, in a crazy moment of shattered glass and slow motion spilling water, Rango revealed itself as a movie of stunning animation and a willingness to get kinda weird. Ten minutes later, it showed itself as a movie that was willing to get really, really weird.While the whole animated cartoon characters would seem to make this a kid's movie, such things as evil looking trees and a quick shot of Hunter S. Thompson tell a different tale. The movie is bizarre and trippy.It is also fast-paced, stylish and at times quite funny, although it's not the funniest of animated features and is really more memorable for some of the best animation I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie and a huge cast of bizarre and creepy characters.Is this a kid's movie? Well, it's dark and twisted and very strange, but then, so is Alice in Wonderland. While adults often forget this, kids are dark, twisted individuals. But since I don't have any, I won't say whether it's a good movie to take kids to. But it's a great movie to take yourself to.",8,0,0,24 June 2012
Music and Lyrics," first rate romantic comedy
","I approached this movie with some trepidation. The reviews had been rather mixed and romantic comedies often go wrong. And I don't really trust the opinion of the friend who recommended it.But it's actually excellent. It's funny and charming. The songs are some of the best written-for-some-romantic-comedy songs I've ever heard. The opening mock video is great and Grant and Barrymore are both utterly charming. There's also a very nice performance by Haley Bennett as a spacey pop star (I actually came across a review by someone who said Bennett stole the movie from Barrymore, which is fairly insane since it's a very small part. My guess is the reviewer either just doesn't like Barrymore or fell in love with Haley because she's utterly gorgeous).It's not a perfect movie. Like a lot of romantic comedies, it begins to lose some steam when it tries to actually have a story and teach lessons and all that. I was worried it would turn out like Hitch, which is really funny for the first plot less half and then becomes really lame. But Music & Lyrics wisely keeps the plot to a minimum, staying as much as possible to a simple story about two people with a connection being charming and saying funny things.",8,0,0,28 April 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Probably More Clever than Profound, but Certainly Fun
","When I saw Rope, which Alfred Hitchcock famously filmed as though it were one continuous take, I was disappointed, because the continuous take effect wasn't nearly as cool as I expected. Decades later, Birdman does it right. The entire movie is filmed as one long take, with the camera swooping and gliding and wandering about. Not only is it cool, but it doesn't feel like a pure cinematic trick, but rather a technique to create a sense of claustrophobia and chaos, and to allow actors long, intimate, intense scenes. The basic story is straightforward enough - has been Hollywood Star Michael Keaton attempt to storm Broadway and experiences various disasters and personality conflicts - but the movie asks you to question everything you see from the beginning, when Keaton is seen floating in mid-air. The question of whether Keaton is supernatural is soon joined by questions of whether this movie is seriously presenting worn out tropes like a brilliant, destructive actor or a vindictive, all-powerful theater critic or whether everything in the movie is actually a mental projection. While the plot lives in a strange reality, it is counter-balanced with very grounded performances. The cast is excellent, particularly Ed Norton as the brilliant destructive actor and even more so Emma Stone as Keaton's angry daughter.The is this real or not vibe is most reminiscent of the brilliant TV series Wilfred, but overall the movie seems like a mix of Living in Oblivion and Black Swan, two entertainment-industry movies that toy with reality. It's not, for me, quite as good as either of those. Yes, it's brilliantly acted and clever as all get-out, but I'm not sure the movie really has much to say; it feels like it just wants to impress you with its cleverness, and while it does, I wish I felt there was something more to it.All the same, it's a really interesting movie, and a must-see for fans of cinematography, for which it deservedly won an Oscar.",8,1,3,21 September 2016
Prometheus," Unwieldy movie, full of plot holes and unlikely scenes
","I had high hopes for a Ridley Scott movie that was a return to the style of Alien, but alas, Ridley seems to have forgotten how to make a tight, exciting, suspenseful film. Instead, Prometheus is ponderous and pretentious, with a poorly thought-out script that makes no sense from one moment to another. Whether it's David's impossibly quick way with alien technology, fearful crewmen inexplicably becoming fearless and foolhardy, or the changeable nature of an alien goo, little in this movie makes any real sense (although if you check the forums you will see fans desperately trying to prove that the movie is a paragon of logic).Beyond that, it really isn't all that exciting. I never felt especially scared and only found one scene genuinely suspenseful. I generally had a strong sense of what would happen next. Underneath its pretentious, search-for-meaning-in-the-universe theme, it's a very by-the-book sci-fi flick that offers few surprises.It's good looking, David is an intriguing, well-acted character and there are a few nice special effects. But this is an overblown mess, in almost every way the antithesis of Alien. While watchable, it was a huge disappointment.",5,2,4,1 October 2012
Wonder Woman," solid superhero flick
","While not quite the be-all end-all some friends and critics lead me to expect, Wonder Woman is a first rate, character-driven action movie with a terrific performance by Gail Gadot, who previously supplied the only enjoyable moments of Superman vs. Batman.Action scenes are exciting and fun, although director Jenkins is perhaps a bit too fond of that trick where you slow down the action for effect; it doesn't have to be done for *every* *move*.I heard a few people say that the film really captures how super-women would fight, but this really shows more how Cirque du Soleil performers would fight. It's basic martial arts fighting with a little more flexibility in the joints. It's very cool.The movie works hard to create moments that look to come out of a comic book, like a strikingly iconic moment of WW walking towards the camera or, in the film's best scene, her crouched behind her shield against a bullet barrage.While some superhero movies are just noisy action sequences strung together by a skeleton plot and cartoon characters (such as the overrated Avengers), Wonder Woman takes its story seriously, with WW's idealism butting up against humanity's awfulness.For a movie set in WWI there isn't really that much period flavor. There is, however, a terrific sense of WW's otherness in a world where women are not taken seriously.Overall one of the better superhero movies, and well worth watching.",8,1,4,29 August 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Middling sequel, although I liked it the first time I saw it
","I recall liking this pretty well when I saw it a quarter of a century ago, but this time, watching it on the heels of watching the original Back to the Future, I was pretty disappointed.The sequel has several notable differences from the original. For one thing, it's much more sci-fi-ish. The first movie took a sci-fi principle and built around it a movie whose charm was based on human interaction. The sequel is a bit more interested in it's sci-fi elements, and a little less interested in people.But the real problem is that this movie is much less well constructed than the original. In BTTF, everything is neatly set up. Everything that happens flows logically from a previous event. But BTTF2 is much more of a mishmosh, with a rambling story and loose threads. Even the way the movie begins is antithetical to the first one. The first time around, Doc is keenly aware of the dangers of fooling with history; in this movie, he chooses to change things around.It's also also just not nearly as funny as the first one.BTTF2 picks up towards the end. The last half hour or so has Marty returning to the scenes of the original movie, and it's cute to see the way he has to change events without letting the first time traveling Marty see him. It is in fact references to the first movie that are the best part of the second. Which just proves how good the first one was, and how idea- poor the sequel is.",6,12,20,14 December 2011
Marriage Story," not that interesting
","About halfway through Marriage Story I turned to my girlfriend and said, 'you know, I totally don't care about these people or what happens to them.' And she said 'me too!' And I said, 'and you're friend was right when she said this was just the problems of privileged white people,' and she said 'totally!' And I said, 'you want to bag it, or keep going?' and she said, 'let's just stop.'I liked the first scene, the acting was good, but these are uninteresting people in a depressing situation and while I appreciate the rather nuanced approach to the subject matter, I can think of no earthly reason to care if either of them lives or dies.",5,1,7,1 April 2020
X-Men: First Class," My favorite x-men movie
","I've have really liked the other X-Men movies, but somehow I never felt as excited as I thought I should feel. But I found this movie incredibly exciting. I love the ingenuity of the back story. I love the cool special effects, especially the way Mystique's scales ripple as she changes and the way Azazel appears and disappears (an effect that is used in some really exciting ways). I love the speed and the wit and the performances.The movie is not perfect. One character switches sides with absolutely no insight from the script as to why, and I thought that was an unfortunate and lazy choice. But overall this is a terrific movie that is everything I wanted it to be.",9,0,2,2 December 2011
The Wolverine," Decent, unexceptional, kind of falls apart at the end
","The Wolverine is a generally competent comic book movie. In the comic-book movie landscape overall, that's not a bad thing, but as an offshoot of the X-Men series, which is arguably the best of the comic-book movie series, it's rather disappointing.The movie begins pretty well, with Logan, traumatized by the events of The Last Stand, hiding out in the forest having dreams about Jean and his time at Nagasaki, he gets into a fight, meets a young, hot woman with a way with a sword, and winds up in Japan fighting the Yakuza and meeting more young hot women.The fight scenes are fairly entertaining, overall (there's a pretty good one on top of a bullet train), and Logan is given a handicap that makes things tougher for him, which is a nice touch.The writing tends to laziness, particularly at the end, which includes non-sequiturs like one character changing her appearance for no apparent reason other than someone decided it would look cool (eh) and a twist that probably surprised no one.The acting is mixed, although Jackman is good as always.It's all perfectly watchable and completely forgettable. If you want mindless action and some sword play, it's a decent enough choice.",7,0,1,3 August 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," well made
","I love Batman Begins best of the trilogy that culminates in Dark Knight Rises, but I'm not sure if that is because it's the best of the trilogy, because it was such a striking departure from the awful Michael Keaton films, or because it was the only one of the three I saw on the big screen. Unlike most people, I felt a bit let down by the second movie, but I quite enjoyed the third. I didn't get the same visceral thrill from it that I got from Begins, but I did find it had a lot of interesting ideas.First off, I appreciate the concept of a Batman who is too bitter and broken to go on. Superheroes are often a bit too super, but Batman has been hit hard by the previous films and the movie does a good job of showing what a tough job he's taken on. It's pretty brutal.Another interesting thing is the casting of Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. Catwoman has always been the sexy seductress (for me, she will always be Julie Newmar), but Hathaway doesn't really do sexy, and instead plays a tough, cynical anti-hero. It's a little disorienting to see such a different version of the character, but ultimately I liked it, and Marian Cotillard as a philanthropist supplies the sexy that Anne lacks.Generally, this is a dark, gritty, sometimes disturbingly violent action movie that doesn't let its intelligence get in the way of its thrills or vice versa. But while I liked it, I wouldn't say it blew me away. It sometimes felt a bit unfocused, as though the movie bit off just slightly more than it could chew. Perhaps that's why I liked the first movie best; I recall it's focus being laser sharp.Still, it's a very enjoyable film.",8,2,9,2 January 2013
Black Panther," impressive world building and solid action
","Black Panther is a superhero movie that, for the most part, isn't about superhero stuff like saving the world. In a way it's a movie that makes the case for a superhero ethic.Black Panther is a king of Wakanda, an advanced technological nation that tells the world it's a third-world African country in order to stay under the radar. Because of the charade, Wakanda does little for earth, hoarding its technology and resources and leaving the rest of the world to manage without it. Much of the film isn't about being a hero; it's about the hunt for a criminal.For a good chunk of the time, the movie focuses more on interpersonal drama and world-building than action. This world-building is impressive; Wakanda seems like a very real place, offering an African nation that combines, like other high tech countries like Japan, ancient traditions with modernity. It's a country that shows little influence from the west.This is also a movie that, like Mad Max: Fury Road, has a ton of strong women. Outside of the star, the heroes are women, and with a minor exception, all the bad guys are men (including a terrific Andy Serkis).Outside of a wonderful chase scene, all the really great action comes in the end, with a massive, lengthy battle on multiple fronts that is electrifying throughout.",8,0,3,3 October 2019
Iron Man," Entertaining but dumb
","This slick superhero movie is fast-paced and has brisk, often witty dialog, and I did enjoy it, but it's a pretty dumb piece of work. There are both the little things - the stated purpose of the gizmo in Stark's chest contradicts its implied purpose based on what happens when it's removed, the villain is far too skilled based on his experience - and the overall premise of the film. The movie's naive take on war seems to be that the problem is weapons makers and (middle eastern) warlords, as opposed to say, imperialism, greed or, more to the point, the knee jerk use of force to solve all problems. Like the movie itself, Stark has a surface revelation but can't or won't look at the deeper issues. So while Iron Man works perfectly well as a popcorny action flick, its failure to deal with issues raised by the very nature of the screenplay makes it less satisfying than a superhero movie that never raised these issues to begin with.",7,0,1,19 September 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Well, I can't say I wasn't warned
","Yeah, I read the articles talking about now awful this movie was. How it was a dour mess. But you know, a lot of people had been critical of Man of Steel, which I really liked, so I thought, maybe it's just similar to that and people think it's a bit dark and pretentious, but it'll probably still be fun.But no, this really is awful.I didn't think so immediately; at first I just thought it was trying to hard. There's a moment early on involving a pearl necklace that tries desperately to create a cool cinematic moment, but it feels forced, and much of the opener feels pretentious. But that's five minutes of the movie, and I could live with it.The main problems turn out to be that the movie is slow and that the story is ridiculous.There's some good ideas in the movie. I like the way it considers Batman and Superman not as heroes but as vigilantes, and there's a delicious irony in the two of them each mistrusting the others approach to crime fighting.On the other hand, Superman's concerns are pretty reasonable, while Batman goes off the rails. And one of the great frustrations of the story is that it only works if Batman is far stupider and less inquiring than he has ever been before. In this movie, essentially he's the sort of guy who sees someone with a 'kick me' sign on their back and kicks them without asking, who put on that sign? Everything he does in the film relies on his being a complete idiot, although in their big confrontation Superman also proves himself to be a weak thinker (that whole scene, in spite of some good action, is utterly, frustratingly senseless).Not that there aren't other issues. Jesse Eisenberg seems to have been told he was playing Joker before the crackup and thus offers a really peculiar Lex Luthor. The movie is often utterly absurd, for example in suggesting that a nuclear missile could be aimed directly at a target in space that was speeding around erratically. While much of the movie is a huge waste of time, there are some good performances, particularly Amy Adams and Gal Gadot, and a battle at the end between three superheroes and one monster that is quite fun, although not as good as the action in Man of Steel.Director Zack Snyder approached Man of Steel as though it were a classic, Camelot-style myth, which worked well, but he approached Batman vs. Superman as though it were a Shakespearean tragedy, which is why it often sits in that uncomfortable place where something is so grim that it flips over into unintentionally funny.This is a big-budget superhero movie, so I know that those who like these things, as I do, cannot be convinced to skip this one. But the most you should really watch is perhaps the last half hour. Don't say you weren't warned.",4,2,8,7 October 2016
Bruce Almighty," unrealized potential
","This movie really ought to have been funnier. It's not that it's a great premise - it's pretty daft, actually - but it's a workable premise. You've got Carrey with ultimate power, which offers all sorts of opportunities for humor. Yet the film rarely made it above mildly amusing and often couldn't even manage that. I think much of the problem was the movie was torn between wanting to be funny versus wanting to be touching and profound (since they throw in a scene from It's a Wonderful Life I tend to suspect they were hoping for something with that feel). The end result is a movie that fails to succeed comedically or emotionally. Bruce is not an especially sympathetic character, he's so petty and self centered that it's hard to take much of an interest in his problems or his life or his decisions. I thought Freeman made a pretty decent Lord Almighty and the bits with the dog were cute, and it wasn't so bad that I gave up on it, but it's really a movie where you just wonder, why did they even bother making this?",5,3,6,18 December 2004
The Greatest Showman," Grittily determined to entertain
","The Greatest Showman wants every musical number to be a showstopper. If it were Music Man there would be no 'Til There Was You'; there would just be Ya Got Trouble over and over. Everything is big, flashy, building up to a crescendo that wants the audience to leap to their feet.For the most part, I wasn't leaping to my feet. A few songs rise above the noise, like the anthem-y 'This is Me' and the zippy 'The Other Side,' but often my reaction was, oh, this again.Still, the first time I saw this movie was on an airplane, and when I watched it again on TV it seemed better than I'd thought and I raised the score from 6 to 7. Yes, there's heavy doses of auto-tune, a tendency towards pyrotechnical high notes, and a preference for rhythm over melody, all reflective of top 40 radio. But at the same time, the film has some lovely visual ideas, like glittering stars on a ceiling or hung sheets blowing on clotheslines, and the sheer constant hurly burly of big moments and empty flash means that if you don't like what's happening right now, you might well like the thing that's going to happen in 30 seconds.Call it empty-headed fun. Enjoy the few people who sing so well that they aren't noticeably auto-tuned. Accept that almost everything in the film is untrue. And enjoy it.",7,3,7,27 April 2018
Toy Story 3," funny and surprisingly clever movie
","I wasn't sure about Toy Story 3 at first. It was, of course, funny and well animated, but there was something a little depressing about the story and I was wondering where they could go with it. But it just kept getting better and better, and much of it was riotously funny.It is also contains a remarkably ingenious plot. The central escape scenes are both a take-off of the prison camp escape genre and a really good example of it, with tons of clever ideas one after the other.In spite of my early doubts, I think this is the best entry in the series, a movie that hits the mark in every way, down to a lovely and touching finale.",9,0,1,2 January 2011
Signs," Another fascinating genre reinvention from Shyamalan
","So far, M. Night Shyamalan and done startlingly unusual takes on ghosts, superheroes, and now aliens.  This movie follows a completely different path from other movies of its genre.   The movie takes place away from the action, and one only has a vague idea of the overall picture.  Almost nothing is shown; at times the movie seems to just be teasing the audience with action that is just out of sight. The movie is full of lovely touches, and the ending is absolutely stunning, as though someone had created an elaborate domino trail that you didn't even know existed until they started falling one by one.  As with previous Shyamalan films, this is a thoughtful movie using genre conventions to create something unique.  It's probably not quite as effective overall as The Sixth Sense, although the ending is so powerful that it overshadows any weaknesses of the film as a whole.  It's far more successful than the interesting but unsatisfactory Unbreakable. Definitely worth seeing.",8,0,3,14 July 2004
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Good movie partially undone by terrible narration
","I almost stopped watching this movie at the 10 minutes mark. That first ten minutes was pretty much nothing but a narration of events by someone who sounded like he was doing a Power Point presentation on economics. I don't know why Allen felt the film needed a bland American narrator, but he did. The truth is, Allen himself would have been a far better choice; when he speaks, he sounds like he means something by it.The narration, of which there is a great deal, is also almost entirely unnecessary; you could cut it out all of the movie and you would still know pretty much was going on. The narrator says nothing about the characters that you can't glean from their actions, and I would think Allen has been around long enough to have heard of 'show don't tell.'However, since my girlfriend said she loved the movie I decided to keep going, and once the narrator took a pause and the characters started talking, they were pretty interesting (in fact, more interesting than the glib assessments given by the narrator). The story has the typically messy romantic tangles Allen is so fond of and it's interesting to see it play out. The actors are all very good, each making their characters likable. Sure, everyone in the movie is little more than a stereotype (tempestuous Spanish woman, free spirit, over- planned American), but the actors make these characters more interesting than they really are.While neither deep nor especially effecting, the movie is, when the narrator isn't speaking, quite charming, offering a romantic vision of Spain and a story that keeps moving even if not a lot ever happens. Cut out the narrator and it would probably deserve to be rated one star higher.",7,0,1,3 January 2012
Identity," Entertaining through a bit unmemorable
","This is a fun little mystery-thriller with a big twist. In an odd coincidence, it's basically the imaginary twist a writer comes up with in the movie Adaptation. In that movie, the twist is mocked as the ultimate in cheap Hollywood filmmaking, but I liked the twist when described and I liked it here as well.The film is well directed and acted, keeping viewers guessing and creating a good deal of suspense. The twist is nicely inset.The weird thing is, I saw this movie a few years ago, but I rewatched it because I forgot I'd seen it. And even as I watched it, none of it seemed familiar, only I knew some things in advance of their reveal. Anyway, I knew I'd seen that movie-with-the-same-twist-from-Adaptation before.Basically, it's a nice little B movie with some clever touches, some logic issues, and a rather dumb final five minutes.",7,1,2,15 August 2016
Saving Mr. Banks," great performances and fun though overly pat story
","This highly fictionalized, sentimentalized version of P.L. Travers experience contending with Disney over the adaptation of her Mary Poppins book is quite entertaining. Much of this is due to some excellent performances. The always-excellent Emma Thompson is terrific as the prickly Travers, and Tom Hanks, who I don't always care for, gives a nicely understated performance as Disney. I loved his reaction to Travers trash talking of his movies, in which he looked, just for a moment, like he'd been sucker punched.There are also excellent performances by Colin Farrell, in flashback, as Travers charming father and Paul Giamatti as a genial driver. I was particularly impressed by how much Giamatti caught the style of a 1960s character.The script has sharp dialogue and shows the actors off to good advantage, but even before reading the wikipedia article on the movie I knew it had to be pretty far from the truth. Many scenes are just way too pat; it's clearly a work of fiction inspired by a true life story.You can see some indication of that during the credits, when the movie plays an actual recording of Travers talking to the Disney writers. She's not nearly as hostile as Thompson portrays her, and sounds more like someone collaborating on a project than someone trying to shoot it down.Travers real-life reaction to the Disney movie of her book would, I suspect, be echoed in her real-life reaction to Saving Mr. Banks. But it is entertaining. It also makes me curious about the original Poppins books; I never even knew the movie was based on a book series!",7,2,4,29 March 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Brilliant dark comedy
","Jojo Rabbit skillfully offers the eccentric story of a 10-year-old German boy who worships Hitler - and has him for a genial imaginary friend - against the horrific backdrop of World War II in the third Reich's final days.The cast is excellent, with Roman Griffin Davis appealing as the little Nazi whose better angels sometimes peak out, Thomasin McKenzie as a feisty Jewish girl in hiding, Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's sweet, stylish mother, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson as Nazi kooks, and director Taika Waititi as imaginary Hitler.The movie manages to walk a very fine line between wacky comedy and searing horror. It is sometimes painfully intense and heartbreaking, but it is also at times genuinely funny.Highly recommended.",9,0,0,2 March 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I have mixed feelings on this one
","What exactly is the Fantastic Mr. Fox? Since it's a feature cartoon based on a Roald Dahl story one might assume it would be a movie for kids, or a movie for kids of all ages, but it's not. The dysfunctional family and the arch dialog and the low-key performances all make it clear this is something for adults, something aiming to be a quirky way to deliver Anderson's typical fare. Or perhaps it actually does aim to be a kid's film and this was simply the closes Anderson could come.In either case, the movie doesn't totally work for me. Even though I never read the Roald Dahl story, I know his work well enough to know that this has little to do with it. Anderson and Dahl have very different sensibilities. But at the same time, they are both quirky. I think if Anderson wanted to take a kid's story and give it a modernist twist he would have been better off with something less quirky, a more traditional children's story like The Wizard of Oz. As it is, the two varieties of quirkiness work against each other. Anderson is small and thoughtful and acerbic, Dahl is over-the-top and ironic and somewhat savage. And while Anderson wins this debate, because he has the final word, the vestiges of Dahl make it all feel a bit off.This is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I generally did. It's mildly amusing and the animation is kind of interesting in places. I didn't particularly mind watching it. But I was never drawn into the world, I never felt connected with the characters or concerned about their plight. The movie, like all Wes Anderson films, keeps you at a distance from the characters, but unlike his best movies, it doesn't make up for that with enough eccentricity to keep one engaged.It doesn't surprise me that the critics loved this movie. Critics tend to get jaded and immediately latch onto anything different, and this movie is decidedly different. But Anderson would have been better off either making a cartoon aimed at kids or making a live action show aimed at adults. Instead, he just confuses the two.",6,1,1,6 January 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," turn off your brain and enjoy!
","First off, this movie is irretrievably stupid. From little things like a cop that doesn't call for backup when he's in a fire fight to an evil plan that insists on such remarkable stupidity of every branch of national and local government (true, as someone points out, it took five days for the government to get water to Katrina victims, but that doesn't mean the country is protected by keystone cops) to the remarkably stupid actions of both henchman and hero, this movie shows a general disdain for reality or common sense.What the movie has going for it though, is witty dialog, effective performances, over-the-top action scenes and a lot of 'whoah!!!!!!' moments, most involve cars and trucks (the best of which is a fight in a car dangling in an elevator shaft).I debated with myself a bit over whether to give this movie 7 stars or 8. It's so stupid it really should get seven, yet by the end I was having such a blast that it didn't seem right to give it less than 8. Sometimes a movie is enough fun to get away with gross illogic; this is such a movie.",8,0,1,15 July 2008
Thor: The Dark World," Enjoyable Action Romp
","This movie improves on the last Thor film. It's nicely paced and has some excellent action scenes. In its eagerness to make clear to the audience that this is going to be a big action movie, the early part has a lot of chaotic noise to it, which is perhaps why the first scene I really liked was a peaceful one in an abandoned building. Once the movie caught me interest I stayed caught. The story is coherent without any instantly noticeable plot holes, which is about as much as you can hope for from the typical superhero movie, and there are some nice surprises and some good WOAH moments. Performances were good.It's certainly formulaic, but it uses that formula well.",7,1,1,14 July 2014
Lucy," Great as long as you don't use more than 5% of your brain
","This movie is a terrifically entertaining popcorn action flick that could probably benefit from a little less pretension and a little more common sense. But if you go into this movie just looking for a stylish action flick, it's fun.The movie is based on that old myth that humans only use 10% of their brain, and tries to imagine what someone was like who could maximize their brain usage. When an ordinary woman named Lucy accidentally absorbs a huge amount of a new drug, her brain starts ramping up and she becomes, as the percentage increases, a super soldier, a superhero, and a god. The movie is slick and stylish. It's often gimmicky, as in a scene where Lucy's first meeting with some bad people is intercut with wilderness footage, but it all works quite well.This is the sort of movie you could really pick apart. The problem is not that the 10% brain thing is BS, which doesn't bother me at all, but that the movie is often sloppy in its internal logic. For example, Lucy types on a computer and she's so fast that hundreds of windows are opening and closing, but a laptop is not mechanically capable of that speed. And if you accept that Lucy is using her mind to control the PC, then WHY IS SHE TYPING? And no matter how souped-up Lucy's brain becomes, it wouldn't allow her childhood brain to have taken in the sort of data she recalls.The movie is silliest when it has Lucy describe what it's like to be a super mind. There's a lot of talk about memories and sensitivities and time that all sounds like what someone tells you when they're describing their acid trip. The truth is, if someone were that smart, they would probably have difficulty talking to us at all; we would be animals.Still, it's lots of fun, and I do recommend it for all its flaws.",7,0,5,9 December 2016
Amélie," charming and quirkier than I expected
","I kept hearing about how charming and sweet Amelie was.  So I was a little surprised when I discovered it was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  The guy who directed City of the Lost Children and Alien 4 directed a cute movie about a sweet girl doing nice things?  It seemed odd, but I was curious to see how that turned out, so in spite of my general mistrust of French films, which are all too often dull and pointless, I watched Amelie.Yes, it is sweet and charming, but it's also wildly imaginative and original, full of clever ideas and stylish direction.  The movie is funny and extremely likeable and much to my surprise it makes complete sense as part of Jeunet's body of work.  All in all, an absolutely terrific movie.",9,0,3,26 May 2004
Moonrise Kingdom," As stylish as it is pointless
","I was excited by the beginning of this film, which was quirky, funny, visually striking, and just plain weird. I was hoping that finally, Anderson had made a movie I would love as much as The Royal Tennenbaums.Alas, it didn't happen. The movie is endlessly stylish and quirky, but it never connects emotionally. The characters made me think of those in Hal Hartley movies, conversing obliquely, but while Hartley's films, at their best, allow misfits to connect in odd, sometimes touching ways, Anderson's characters are just odd for the sake of being odd, and the disconnected conversations feel like they're just weird for the sake of being weird rather than because Anderson has something to say about finding connections in a disconnected world. Because of this, I just didn't see the movie as having any point or purpose.There were good moments, and the stylish visuals and general odd tone kept me somewhat entertained, but I'd say this is yet another miss for Anderson, who I have lower expectations for with each movie he puts out.",5,1,2,7 January 2013
RED," Almost as entertaining as it is absurd
","This is a very cute little movie, fast-paced and amusing, with a lot of over the top action and good performances. It is also a movie that treats logic not just as something unnecessary, but as something to be actively avoided at all cost.Red has every type of unreality. The movie is filled with places where you'll think, no law enforcement agency would follow those procedures, or no place has such incompetent security. I can't start listing these moments, because then I would just never, ever stop. There is also ridiculous action there's a wonderful - but completely nonsensical - moment when Willis steps out of the car and starts shooting as the bumper glides an inch past his leg), but I've come to accept ridiculous action in action movies. But the nonsense extends to almost every moment of the film. If you had a drinking game where the rule was you take a drink every time you, 'ah, that makes perfect sense,' you would end the movie cold sober. It's one of the most remarkably sense-free movies I've ever seen.But it's fun to watch. Just turn off your brain.",7,0,2,5 August 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Perfectly watchable, utterly forgettable
","Deathly Hallows was easily my least favorite of all the Potter books, representing Rowling's annoyingly grim, rather sadistic side, and at first I wasn't planning to watch the movie at all. I didn't watch Deathly Hallows Part 1, which got middling reviews, but since the sequel got better reviews I thought, why not take a look.Like all the Potter films, the story has been reduced to a bare bones presentation that would be virtually incomprehensible to anyone who has not read the books. While I considered that a flaw in the early movies, for me it's somewhat of a strength in the later ones, because the agonizing deaths of deeply loved characters that infest the final few books are, in the films, nothing but unfortunate events set amidst the special effects. Even the best of the movies barely touched me emotionally, and in a book series that seemed bent on breaking my heart, I appreciated the movies' shallowness.But having said that, the emotional disconnect of the last film is still a bit too much. True, I wasn't sad when characters died, because the movie did nothing to make me care about them, and barely even paused at their passing, but for the same reason, I wasn't especially happy when the characters succeeded. I really didn't care what was happening at all.I saw the movie four or five days ago, and I already barely remember it. The only thing I remember is thinking that Harry breaks an awful lot of innocent eggs to make that omelet, making him a rather dodgy hero. Perhaps that is true in the book as well, but in the book I cared more about the principals than the extras. I cannot say that of this version.Good special effects though.",6,3,5,20 June 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An exciting action flick that is so much better than the other two
","I wasn't planning to watch LOTR 3. I had watched the first one, found it as dull and overlong as the book it was based on, watched the second only because I like Gollum but found it dull as well, and figured that was enough. But after I read that the final film of the trilogy had won 11 Oscars I thought that even though the Oscars aren't that reliable I ought to take a look.And from the first, mesmerizing portrayal of Gollum's back story, I absolutelly love this one. It is an exciting, action-packed movie with epic battles and great special effects.The weakest part of the movie is it's peaceful final scenes. If you are deeply immersed in the story they are probably offer a satisfying emotional payoff, but if you're just there for the dragons and the ogres then none of it's that interesting. But that's a small part of a movie that is otherwise wall-to-wall action.Even if you're not a LOTR fan I'd recommend checking this out. You don't need more than a general notion of the thrust of the trilogy to watch this. It's been 15 years since I saw the last movie and 40 since I read the books, but even not being clear on who everyone was didn't cause much confusion.

","The Japanese movie Shall We Dansu was charming, funny and a bit of a mess. This remake actually fixes some of the weaknesses of the plot but loses way too much of the charm and humor.You really can't expect a lot from a movie starring too of Hollywood's least charismatic romantic leads, and it's no surprise that Gere and Lopez turn in forgettable, generic performances. Arguably this is acceptable from Gere; he plays a rather colorless drone to begin with, but it would be nice if Lopez had shown a little spark. She's pretty awful in this, tending to seem colorless but occasionally reaching the point of tears with little justification.On the bright side, Lopez's turn around isn't as jarring as in the original, and Gere's behavior and his wife's makes more sense. This is not to say that the movie isn't painfully Hollywood, but its probably no worse in the respect than the original. And the supporting cast is decent, although Stanley Tucci isn't nearly as funny as Naoto Takenaka was in the original.The last thing to note is that the dancing is poorly filmed. Now, this isn't a dance movie per se, it's a movie about how dancing effects people, but one still would expect the few dance scenes to be competently filmed. Instead, one gets no sense of movement or dance throughout the movie; the camera seems to unerringly go the opposite direction from where it should.None of this makes it a horrible movie, but it's certainly a weak one.",6,0,0,5 January 2006
What We Do in the Shadows," mildly amusing
","I watched this for about half an hour. A mockumentary about vampire roommates is a cute idea, mixing the day-to-day challenges of shared living with vampire challenges like finding victims, and it was all kind of amusing. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it funny, and the fact that I wasn't actually laughing or feeling interested hinted to me that this wasn't the movie for me.It's very low-key humor. It's so low-key that even the moments that might feel horrific instead just seem bland. In theory, this is a dark comedy, but it never felt that dark or that funny. To be fair, I don't like some mockumentaries that other people love. While I loved Spinal Tap, I never understood the appeal of Waiting for Guffman. So if you just love all the mockumentaries, you might like this better than I did.",5,7,14,2 November 2017
Deadpool," Well, that was fun
","A lot of superhero movies favor special effects over character (I'm looking at you, 2012's The Avengers), but perhaps because Deadpool had a relatively low budget for this sort of thing - something I only know because I read it on wikipedia - this movie is full of character. The protagonist is a vengeance seeking madman constantly breaking the forth wall, his best friend is a hipster bartender who gambles on his brief longevity, and he and his girlfriend (the ridiculously attractive Morena Baccarin) engage in the dark clever banter you'll love if you're a fan of the series You're the Worst).Deadpool proves that giving your characters personality does not mean you can't also have great action scenes, such as the crazed one that begins the movie (and clarifies the funny and perplexing title sequence). I found the action in this movie far more exhilarating than the bigger-is-better approach of some movies (I'm looking at you again, Avengers).Overall, this is as fun and funny as Guardians of the Galaxy and has action as memorable as that in X-Men: First Class. Ryan Reynolds beautifully plays Deadpool as a psychotic version of Spider-Man, and really, the whole cast is excellent.This is a sort of tangential X-Men movie, but it still exhibits a lot of what makes that series the best of the Marvel universe.",9,11,24,28 July 2016
Get Him to the Greek," very funny, especially Sean Combs
","Russell Brand was quite amusing in Forgetting Sarah Marshall playing a pretentious yet rather likable rock star. Brand's character might seem like something that would work best in small doses, but he works surprisingly well as a major character in this crazier take on the My Favorite Year theme of a nice boy who has to babysit a famous lunatic.Produced by Judd Apatow, this movie could be seen as a commentary on the guy's wish fulfillment theme of so many of his films. Here we have a nebbish who gets to lead the life of a rock star, but this is not portrayed as a good thing, making it more of a be-careful-what-you-wish for theme.Brand is very funny in this film (and in the end proves he'd make a pretty good rock star), but it is Sean Combs who supplies the biggest laughs with a take-no-prisoners performance as a music studio head.Brand's peculiar charisma and the movie's frenetic pace work well, and over all I enjoyed this movie a bit more than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",8,3,6,16 October 2011
Cloud Atlas," Very entertaining, Surprisingly Comprehensible
","I'm sure Cloud Atlas has some Deep Meaning, but I never picked up on what it was. However, as a piece of entertainment it was excellent. The movie is composed of six stories, intercut very tightly, and some of the stories are very involving, although others didn't do much for me.Of the six, I liked the comedic publisher's story and the Matrix-like futuristic dystopia best, but also quite enjoyed the '70s investigative thriller and the sci-fi-tribal piece. I found it harder to connect with the two set earliest in the chronology, which had less narrative momentum, but I still admired the way each story had a very distinct style.I am rather amazed at how easily I followed what was going on, as at times the movie would cut from one story to another to another in a matter of seconds. However, the film starts with relatively long sequences that familiarize you with each story, and because they are all so different you always instantly know where you are. (At least I did; I'm not sure what the response would be of a friend who said she couldn't for the life of her figure out what was going on in Memento.)The acting is all quite effective, with the same actors playing different characters in different stories. I was most surprised by Tom Hanks, because I generally don't like him (his noble, 'regular guy' shtick just doesn't work for me), but here I liked him in all of his six roles.Because the movie was stylishly filmed, and the individual episodes had compelling stories, I really enjoyed the movie. But I am completely unclear as to what point it's trying to make. It appear to be saying we are all connected throughout the centuries, but how we are connected and how these connections are significant eludes me. I think I'm going to have to read the book to see if I can figure that out. But forget the Greater Meaning; just enjoy the ride.",8,3,8,6 June 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," entertaining movie that doesn't always know when enough is enough
","Is this a spoof? I can see why it's getting described this way, but Kingsman isn't really all that different from its James Bond source material. Yes, there's the occasional mocking reference to James Bond, but the overall effect is more a slightly cheekier James Bond clone than an actual spoof. It's also not more than mildly amusing.But it is entertaining, mainly because of some terrific action scenes, some of which involve a woman amputee with swords instead of feet. These scenes are beautifully choreographed and often involve finding imaginative ways to knife and shoot people.Unfortunately, the movie is a little too in love with this stuff. At a certain point no amount of fancy choreography could distract me from the feeling that I had just seen something similar 15 minutes ago.The story is a rather messy one involving an evil billionaire fought by a mysterious spy organization made up primarily of lookalike square-jawed upper-class white guys bravely considering hiring a lookalike square-jawed lower-class white guy or a square-jawed upper-class white woman (who isn't lookalike because there's no one in the movie for her to look like).I kept wondering if the movie would make some sort of comment on the archaic nature of the organization, but since it didn't one tends to assume that the makers see nothing wrong with a powerful, secretive organization of white preppy guys. It makes an interesting contrast with the only important black character being a terrible person.Outside of that, I didn't really think much about the politics of Kingsman, but reviews like The Guardian's point out that it's pretty right wing overall. But because the movie is about 10% reactionary politics and about 80% stabbing people in the eye (the other 10% is for male bonding and dog walking) it's easy to ignore all that. For me, the issue with the movie is not its politics but it's inability to curtail its impulses. Watching a guy stylishly kill about a 100 people at once is pretty entertaining for about the first 25 people, and then feels like punishment. Cutting between a big action scene and a suspenseful high-altitude sequence sucks much of the pleasure out of both. The final battle's disco concept is clever but the flashy lights take away from the action.Still, Kingsman works more often than not, and while it's not consistently great, it has a decent mix of great and good moments and not that many bad ones. So overall, if you want mindless, violent action, this is worth watching.",7,1,3,16 September 2016
Green Book," Enjoyable movie in spite of its flaws
","Green Book tells the presumably true story of white racist guy hired as the chauffeur for a black musician doing a tour of the deep south. It's predictable, following the well-worn path to racial understanding of similar films, but it's got solid performances and is engaging throughout.There have been various criticisms of this movie. Don Shirley's family says its ridiculous to claim he'd never eaten fried chicken before having it forced on him by a white guy, and that's probably true. But it works as a way to contrast the plebeian white guy with the sophisticated black man, and it's silly to expect any Hollywood movie to not be at least half fiction.(It's hard to know who's telling the truth. Shirley's family has complained a lot, but from what I've read they don't seem to have been that close to him. The movie was written by the chauffeur's son, who says Don Shirley himself approved it, but the guy also echoed Donald Trump's lie that thousands of American Muslims cheered during 9/11, which makes me consider him inherently untrustworthy.)The movie has also been criticized as yet another movie funneling racism through a white lens; this is the chauffeur's story, not Shirley's. But because a movie is part of an unfortunate trend doesn't mean that individual movie isn't good, it just means Hollywood has trouble breaking out of its boxes.The title does, however, bug me. The Green Book was a guide on where to find hotels where black people could stay at a time when many hotels were whites only. It's a good example of what black people had to deal with, it was written for black people by black people, the existence of the book is a condemnation of the white culture that made it necessary, and even though it's a fairly insignificant plot point this is the title they chose. This is a movie about a white guy learning about racism; why make the title something so much a part of a particular black experience? It feels a little like theft.Still, I really enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was super memorable, and it seems like a movie I'll have pretty much forgotten in a year (so maybe I should give it a 7?) yet it's mix of humor and pathos make it a very enjoyable experience.",8,1,3,17 March 2019
Fantastic Four," serviceable superhero flick
","I was never a big comic book kid; I would read them but usually it was that one or that one and I never had much allegiance to any particular hero. But I do recall a fondness for the Fantastic Four, I think mainly because I related to the angst-ridden Thing, being angst-ridden myself.I didn't find the movie as intriguing as I remember the comic books being, but it does a decent job in a rather generic fashion. It keeps moving, the story makes sense and it has some fun stuff in it. I would rank it above Spider-Man, which I thought was overrated, but below Spider-Man 2 or the first two X-men movies.I almost always enjoy superhero movies, so I enjoyed it, but it's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination.",6,1,2,27 December 2006
Click," When you start thinking, hey, this isn't funny anymore, TURN IT OFF
","For the first half hour or so, Click is a very funny and charming movie. My initial reaction was, hmmm, why did this get bad reviews, it's that rarity; an Adam Sandler movie that is more about charm and fun than lowbrow jokes.Perhaps a third of the way through though, shortly after Sandler gets the remote that is the movie's central gimmick, it just sort of stopped being funny. Jokes became increasingly low brow and mean-spirited, although hints of what was to come came early on, most notably in the mean-spirited delight the movie takes in Sandler's petty cruelties to an obnoxious neighbor kid.By the last third, the movie dropped humor altogether in favor of bathos and treacly sentimentality as it hammered home its moral. The movie clearly wants to be Capraesque, but it fails to have noticed that Capra's films, even at their most serious and sentimental, would always toss in a few light touches.The problem is not the premise, which is pretty good, or even the moral, which is a fair one and which comes naturally out of the premise. The problem is the film is just badly done.Since a third of it is actually pretty funny, it might seem harsh to only give it 3 stars out of ten, but if a movie is going to be this awful I feel it shouldn't fool you into thinking it's good and then falling apart so completely. If I only judged the first third I'd give this a 7, but the second third deserves a 4 and the last third deserves a 2 if I'm feeling generous.",3,2,5,25 December 2006
Pineapple Express," watchable stoner flick
","This rumpled, shaggy comedy was somewhat amusing at first. It was genial, generally amusing, and not afraid to do something ridiculous like giving Seth Rogan a high schooler for a girlfriend and have everyone accept it.That's fine for a while, but this is a movie where you need to really like the basics of a buddy comedy between two bumbling stoners, because that's all there is. Cheap sex jokes, cheap joke drugs, over-the-top action that is never particularly exciting, are things you crave desperately, because that's pretty much all you'll get.By the halfway point I was tempted to give up on this, but I did watch it all the way through. It wasn't a horrible experience, but you probably need to be stoned to appreciate this fully.",5,2,4,30 August 2016
Annihilation," Atmospheric
","After watching this film I read the reviews voted 'most helpful,' which all were long lists of plot holes and logical inconsistencies. They are absolutely right. I didn't think about it while watching the film, but when it's pointed out, yeah, nothing in this movie makes much sense.But I still really liked it. It's creepy and atmospheric and more concerned with the psychology of people on a suicide mission than on the nuts and bolts of scientific investigation. It's often intense , usually beautiful, well acted, and had some really weird and mesmerizing moments. I won't argue that you should forgive it for its plot holes, or that it has any deep meaning, or anything like that. In fact, it's probably easier to make a convincing argument against the movie than for it. I'm just saying, I really liked it.",8,770,1021,8 June 2018
Minions," Cute movie that doesn't know what to do with its story
","There's a lot of hate for this movie here, but overall I really enjoyed it. Making a movie about characters that talk in gibberish and were mainly designed for slapstick gags in a different film is not easy, but they created a whole mythology for the things (I always figured they were invented by Despicable Me's protagonist) and manage to build a story around them. And it has a lot of the same silly humor of the original films.I'd say it was really very enjoyable for about an hour before it got away from the writers. The last half hour is hectic and doesn't make much sense, including things like a big chase scene that comes out of left field. It's a lot of noise lacking the cleverness of the first hour.Even that last half hour though isn't bad, it's just weak, and I say, ignore the haters and take a look for yourself.",7,0,0,9 March 2016
Incredibles 2," Decent sequel
","The Incredibles was a fun superhero comedy with a clever twist. The Incredibles 2 is a fun superhero comedy with a ... familiar twist. I guessed what was going on early on but thought, no, they can't possibly be just repeating the first movie. But yeah, they are.While the movie is utterly predictable and not always entirely sensible (heroes near the end don't do a super-obvious thing because it would have ended the movie 20 minutes earlier), it still has some terrific moments, most of these involve the youngest Incredible. There's also some nice exploration of traditional gender roles.I loved the original the first time I saw it but only liked it when I recently re-watched it. This felt a lot like watching the same movie a third time, which may be why I was less entranced yet again.Not *great* Pixar, but still fun.",7,1,3,24 January 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," ambling, watchable movie
","Historically I have enjoyed the Coen Brothers comedies and have been underwhelmed by their dramas. I didn't know which one this was before I watched it, but I'd say it's either a fitfully amusing drama or a dour, not especially funny comedy. Whichever it is, I found it watchable, but not really engrossing.I didn't hate the character as my girlfriend did (she found him repellent in every way and hated the movie). Sure, Llewyn is aimless and drifting, uncharismatic, a bit of a user, and prone to violent outbursts, but as someone who used to play in folk clubs I had some sympathy for his frustration. And really, most of the characters in the movie aren't likable, so in the film's world he's not really that bad.This is a musical, as the movie's songs are generally sung all the way through. It's mainly traditional songs sung pretty well, but there's not much excitement to it and the songs often feel long. I also feel that, in order to emphasize the end, they insist on only pretty, serious singing, although there were rawrer singers at that time like Pete Seeger and Rambling Jack Elliot. It felt like the movie wanted to make an untrue point for reasons of its own.My girlfriend almost decided to give up on this one, stuck with it because John Goodman was interesting in a fairly small part, and then felt it was too late to stop. I never particularly felt like turning it off, but I was never especially engrossed in the story. I wouldn't recommend it.",5,0,1,22 March 2014
Sin City," Stylish, if not much else
","For pure visual presentation, Sin City is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It does a beautiful job of brining a nourish comic book sensibility to life, with a fascinating use of color.And at first that and the movie's sense of degenerate cool is enough. As cop Bruce Willis goes after a psycho killer, the wit and the grit create a fascinating heightened version of film noir. I spent much of the movie wondering how one would describe it. It's not film noir, because it's so excessive, but while it is excess to the point of parody, it's not comical, and often the over-the-top grimness work.Because it is so over-the-top, the movie can slip into stupidity and a simplistic view of the world that is in many ways the antithesis of classic film noir. The film shows its worst is a sequence involving the prostitutes of old town, which with its Irish mercenaries and Kill Bill-styled assassins is just plain silly. And the movie tends to wear on you, because it's pretty much the same thing over and over.Still, it's high-cinematic cool pushes the rating from a 5 to a 7.",7,1,3,12 February 2006
Gangs of New York," quite good, although misses great
","I'm surprised at how hostile some of these reviews are, but truthfully I often react strongly to Scorsese films, either loving them (Taxi Driver, After Hours), hating others (the incomprehensibly acclaimed Raging Bull). My opinion of this one isn't that forceful, but I thought it was an entertaining movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis, who I consider overrated, is absolutely terrific, as is Jim Broadbent (as Boss Tweed), and DiCaprio and Diaz are both much better than I would have expected, giving effective performances.  It is stylishly made and keeps your interest, and the recreation of the draft riots is appropriately chilling.I do think as history the movie is a bit of a cheat.  The movie is quite forthright in its depiction of anti-Irish sentiment but shies away from confronting the racism of the Irish, which wouldn't have seemed so blatantly wrong if that hadn't been a central component of the draft riots.  Scorsese seems to have wanted something morally unambiguous, but if he wanted that I think he chose the wrong moment in history for it.",7,0,1,12 May 2004
Her," Sci-fi that doesn't feel like Sci-fi, Romance that isn't quite Romance
","Technically speaking, Her is a sci-fi movie, because it's set in the near-future and explores the ramifications of technology. Yet it is much closer in spirit to a quirky romance. But as romances go, well, it's an odd one.Taken as a romantic comedy-drama, its the engaging story of a guy, soured by failed relationships, meeting the perfect woman, and learning that relationships are always going to be work, no matter how perfect your mate. The movie has a lot to say about the complexity of relationships, and in some ways is mocking that whole 'perfect person' trope.The sci-fi twist is wonderful precisely because it doesn't care where A.I. stories have gone before. It's as though someone said, what if there'd never been a story about artificial intelligence and I had no clichés to fall back on? That's much of the reason why it doesn't have that sci-fi feel - it's closer to that odd Spike Jonez feel of movies like Being John Malkovich. Even good sci-fi tends to stay, for the most part, within certain conventions, but this movie neither follows those conventions nor ostentatiously refutes them. Her is it's own thing, and you should definitely watch it now.",9,0,1,16 August 2015
The Nice Guys," entertaining even though it never really gels
","The Nice Guys begins with a puerile joke of a death scene that represents everything that is wrong with the movie and with Shane Black in general. But while these sorts of problematic moments crop up from time to time in this buddy-detective movie, it manages enough entertaining moments to keep it interesting.The story, involving a sleazy detective and a a thug who join forces to find a missing girl, is fairly engaging, especially in the first half, even though the seams begin to show in the second. Gosling and Crowe are both amusing characters even if they're chemistry is only so-so. The movie is often funny although the humor can sometimes be juvenile and cheap. The 70s period seems random, but occasionally is used for a good joke. The action is decent.It's not by any means a great movie, and it hits a number of sour notes (including the odd speechifying of a bad guy at the end), but overall I did enjoy it.",7,0,1,14 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Best movie in the series
","Back in 1979, George Miller made his first feature film, a gritty little action picture, Mad Max, that was as mean-spirited as it was exciting. The movie was a hit, and was followed by an apocalyptic sequel called Road Warrior, which was also a hit but which underwhelmed me, and Beyond Thunderdome, which I didn't like any better. And the game Mad Max: Fury Road, which beautifully combines the grit and excitement of the first movie with the big budget action that followed.Max is broken down, haunted by the people he failed to save, concerned with nothing but survival. But this isn't really his story. In a surprise move, Max become an unwilling part of another hero's story. Her name is Imperator Furiosa, and she is as tough and determined and heroic as Max ever was.The movie's feminist vibe, with tough, gun-shooting chicks versus an army of bald, macho religious zealots consumed with war and honor, drove some 'men's rights' people crazy, but it shouldn't. First off, Max is still a tough guy doing a lot of cool stuff, and second, the movie is about 5% feminism to 95% of the most intense, heart-thumping action full of explosions and destruction. That 5% though, is what keeps the movie from being a hollow exercise in special effects like The Avengers. For all the action, this is a film with a vision, and a film about actions, consequences, bravery, redemption, hope, and all that good stuff.I have a few issues with the plot. The final plan relies on one of many warring city states doing something basically suicidal, and the final moment is a standard hero cliché that feels false and unconvincing in the context of the movie. But overall, this is everything an action movie should be.",9,1,8,15 May 2016
The Breakfast Club," John Hughes Masterpiece
","I love this movie so much, both for reasons peculiar to me and because it is just beautifully made.The basic idea is simple; five high schoolers who fit into archetypes like nerd or popular girl spend a Saturday in detention and begin to connect outside of the normal high school paradigms.The movie is, to a great degree, about the traps we make for ourselves, and the movie is clever for making you think you know exactly who these characters are in the first 20 minutes and then showing you the more complex reality.The movie is well acted and nicely structured. It mainly goes for a reasonably realistic approach, although at times it goes a little crazy, as in a scene in the halls that is reminiscent of the musical sequences in The Monkees.I didn't see this movie as a teenager; I was actually 30 the first time. In part, I like high school movies because they give me the school I would have liked to have (my school experience was closer to Welcome to the Dollhouse). The movie also gave me a revelation about my own tendency to see people (myself and others) as types; the movie let me, to some extent, let go of that. So my experience of the film is very personal. But watching it last week, decades later, afraid that it would turn out to be a dumb movie overinflated in my head, I was still impressed by what an amazing film this is.",10,1,1,30 December 2016
Gladiator," If you like to see heads chopped off then this is for you
",The critical acclaim for this movie really puzzles me.  It's basically like one of those old Roman epics from the 50s starring Victor Mature with a bunch of really harsh violence thrown in.  When I wasn't cringing at limbs being hacked off and the like I was just impatiently waiting for the damn thing to end.  I would have left if my wife hadn't liked it.,4,0,1,8 July 2000
Back to the Future," wildly entertaining and beautifully constructed
","I haven't seen this movie in 27 years. I decided to watch it again after playing Back to the Future: The Game, which made me nostalgic.As I remembered, it's a funny, entertaining, ingenious movie that never flags. But what I could appreciate now, since even after 27 years I remembered the story remarkably well, was how nicely constructed the movie was. Nothing in it feels like a coincidence, or like a stretch. Everything is put in place. Everything Marty needs is there, but there's a good reason. Every crazy event follows a logical chain of circumstances. The movie is not simply wonderfully filmed but wonderfully designed, an example of a movie where everything has been thought out and nothing fudged. Sure, the story has the sort of time travel conundrums that make all time travel movies susceptible to criticism for being ultimately impossible, but if you accept the basic sci-fi premises, everything else makes perfect sense.If you've never seen it, watch it just for the entertainment. If you've seen it before, watch it again just to notice how nicely put together it is.",8,1,1,12 December 2011
The Great Gatsby," Tempts me to give the book another chance
","I put off watching this movie for a long time. The flashy yet dull Moulin Rouge toned down my early enthusiasm for Baz Luhrmann, and the descriptions I heard from friends suggested this might be more substanceless flash. Many of my friends are also 1920s aficionados who complained about the music.But when I finally watched the movie, I really, really liked it.The movie is quite flashy, especially in the early parts, but it's not substanceless flash. Gatsby is in large part about ostentatious, unthinking wealth, and the flashy camera-work and frenetic cutting and R&B soundtrack all emphasize that this isn't a period piece about attitudes of the 20s but rather is about wealth and the desire for wealth that permeates our culture. The flashiness is also very well done, and the film is often visually stunning, whether it's showing a crazy party, a gorgeous vista, or a gritty slum.The movie is also notable for its low-key but insistent underscoring of racism. Black people are continually seen in the background as servants and entertainers while the white folks' dramas play out. It's nice to see a movie about rich people that offers that sort of context.The casting is interesting, in that I felt unsure about a lot of it at first but warmed up to pretty much everyone. None of this was based on the book, which I barely recall, but simply on my impression of what each character should be.The one character who seemed perfect from the beginning was Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan. He felt exactly right for the part. Tobey Macguire seemed odd and out of keeping with his world, but I eventually thought that was appropriate. Carey Mulligan seemed a bit less likable than I would have expected, but it made perfect sense as the movie progressed. The casting only felt odd at first because I didn't really know who these people were or understand the complexity of the story.Leonardo DiCaprio is the perfect example of someone who seemed slightly off in a way that turned out to be perfect. There was an odd mix of charm and falseness to him when he first appeared, but it turns out that's pretty much exactly what the part needs. And DiCaprio does a wonderful job of showing you what's going on under the facade, most notably in the lead-up to tea at Nick's, where he is funny and vulnerable.I read The Great Gatsby a million years ago - I was probably in high school - and I was really underwhelmed, unable to see why it was considered a classic. But the movie, which pulls a lot of great lines from the book, makes me think I should really re-read it. And I think any movie that makes viewers curious about the book is worthwhile.The one thing I didn't care for at all was the framing scenes involving a psychiatrist and the writing of a book, which for me felt extraneous and slightly distracting. I wasn't expecting to like this movie. My girlfriend and I began by saying, well, if it's awful we can just stop. But we were both pleasantly surprised by what an excellent movie it turned out to be.",8,1,2,26 March 2017
Shark Tale," generic
","I only watched about 20 minutes of this, so maybe it's great after that, but after 20 minutes of not laughing or being interested in the story or the characters I just decided to give up. Shark Tale (or at least the first bit) has the feel of a cartoon designed by a computer that was simply fed all the recent hit cartoons. It is achingly predictable in every detail. Which would be fine if it was funny. It's not like I look to cartoons for brilliant, incisive stories that comment on the human condition (although it's nice when it happens). A funny movie about fish would have been just fine with me if it were funny. Ice Age had one of the same writers and it was very funny, and that's what I was hoping for, and I didn't get it.",7,1,2,12 October 2005
Princess Mononoke," stunning
","I was a little startled by Princess Mononoke. Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle and heard their director Miyazaki referred to as Japan's answer to Walt Disney, I wasn't expecting the considerable violence of this movie. It was appropriate for the movie certainly, but it sure startled me.But if you're not looking for a Disney flick, this is one impressive and wildly imaginative movie. Many scenes are absolutely amazing, and the last half hour is truly stunning, even though I watched it all on TV.The attitude of the movie is very interesting. This is basically technology vs. nature, but even though the film's sympathies lie more with living with nature, the technology side is not portrayed as evil but instead for the most part as good people with a different world view. The absence of black and white thinking in films is rare and always appreciated.",8,3,5,2 August 2005
Alien: Covenant," A step up from Prometheus, but still a couple of steps down from Alien
","I was so excited when Ridley Scott decided to return to the Alien franchise, and so disappointed when I watched the pretentious, ponderous, utterly inane Prometheus. So I went into Covenant with a 'fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me' attitude. Only this time, I got something closer to what I'd hoped Prometheus would be.The movie begins as a crew in charge of cryogenically frozen colonists notices a planet, hears a message, and says, 'let's check it out, what could go wrong?' Then everything goes excitingly wrong in a flurry of spores, gore, explosions, and freaky mini-Xenomorphs.This going wrong thing is helped out tremendously by the striking idiocy of almost every character, which is one of the things it has in common with Prometheus. There is a *tremendous* amount of bad decision-making going on in this film, which might be understandable in a movie about teenagers trapped in a cabin with a serial killer but seems jarring in a movie about trained professionals hired to do a difficult and exacting task. It's like no one in this movie has ever been trained for anything, no one follows any protocols, and no one seems to be paying attention.While this is frustrating, the movie makes up for it with all sorts of excitement and some striking imagery. While the movie has about three or four endings (movies just don't end the way they did when I was a kid), they're all pretty exciting endings.The movie also boasts the return of Michael Fassbender as David (and another android), and his urbane creepiness is even more entertaining than last time.While it lacks the economy and unbearable tension of the original Alien, it certainly tries harder than Prometheus to be an Alien movie. In fact, it often seems to be taking a 'greatest hits' approach in which you'll say, oh yeah, I remember when that happened in Alien! (The movie also totally ditches the mysteries it was promising to answer in Prometheus, which is a total cheat.)Apparently they're planning some more of these Alien prequels, but honestly, I wish they'd just bring back Sigourney Weaver and make Alien 5. Still, I enjoyed Covenant enough that I will certainly check out the next one. But I will keep my expectations in check, and prepare myself for more stupid people getting themselves killed as stupidly as possible.",7,2,8,11 August 2017
The Martian," Farming ... in Space!
","A lot of sci-fi is about what's possible, but The Martian is the rarer sci-fi film about what's probable. This is a movie not about fancy effects but about *science.* It's a movie about a smart guy stranded on an alien planet who has to use his considerable knowledge to solve life- or-death problems. The movie makes its science quite interesting; I found myself totally invested in the problems of growing potatoes on Mars or getting a rover to go further than it's supposed to.While Matt Damon is doing his science, a bunch of people on earth are doing their science, and it's just as fascinating. While there are no shootouts or romances, there is some suspense and a good deal of humor, as well as a bit less concern about the probable versus the possible towards the end. When I saw the trailer for this, it didn't interest me; I really only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to (she liked the trailer). But this is a first-rate movie.",8,2,4,14 February 2017
Up in the Air," Intelligent and engrossing
","With a sharp script and good performances, Up in the Air is an unusually thoughtful movie driven by character rather than plot. Clooney plays the role of a man whose enjoys life in what to me would be an exhausting limbo, a life of constant travel from city to city. His life is disrupted when changes in his company, represented by a young go-getter, threaten to ruin his carefully constructed way of life, and the movie is primarily concerned with how this makes him ponder that life.But the movie avoids going to predictable places or offering pat answers. Yes, most of us wouldn't like his life, but the movie really shows that all lives are fraught with disappointment.I was a little bothered by how casual the movie is about Clooney's job. I mean, it's an awful thing to do, and I can't help but feel that the people who would actually do such a job are probably awful people. Clooney comes across as basically a nice guy, but if he were really a nice guy he would feel bad about what he does. And while you could argue that Clooney's character is simply someone who avoids introspection and refuses to think about the ramifications of what he does, he comes across as too smart for that to be true.While I didn't love this movie the way some people did, I thought it was very good.",8,0,1,21 June 2012
V for Vendetta," entertaining but problematic
","V for Vendetta is certainly a fascinating movie. In a future England in which right wing fear mongers have taken over the country and subjugated its people (basically the world as people like George W. Bush would make it if they could) a masked vigilante fights to bring down the government.At first the movie seems like an updated Zorro, and in some ways it is, following the formula of the noble hero battling for downtrodden people against enormous odds. But the tone is increasingly dark as the movie progresses, and the parallels with our current world situation make it sharp political commentary.So I liked the movie, I enjoyed the movie, but I was also bothered by the movie. Because it really is not critical of V's actions; it's pretty much on V's side. That's true generally of those lawless hero stories like Robin Hood or Zorro, but what V does goes far beyond Robin Hood-style justice. Arguably those old swashbucklers had a very simplistic view of the world, but they were simple movies with fantasy villains that rarely attempted to draw any significant parallels to the real world.There is an interesting moral question in this movie: is terrorism justified against an oppressive, dangerous government. But Vendetta doesn't really see the complexities of the issue. It's not interested in messy realities, yet it focuses too much on political realities (and political paranoia) to come across as a simple allegory. You can call it pro-terrorism or pro-revolution (they have often historically been the same thing). Revolution does not always lead to a better government, terrorism rarely leads to a better world, and violence is self perpetuating, so that fighting violence with violence simply condemns us to a continuous cycle of violence. And how often are the lines between good and evil so clearly drawn in the real world? Or perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps there are cases when a little terrorism would have been a great idea, say against Hitler, who of course is always a good example for pretty much anything. On the other hand, would terrorism against McCarthy have worked out well or made things worse? Do terrorist actions cause people to rise up or rally around their government? All good questions, but while watching the movie made me think about them, the movie itself isn't interested in any of that. They make no attempt to expose the underlying issues. People who are prone to think about the complexities of the world can watch the movie and start thinking about these things, but the movie doesn't encourage that at all.Still, I enjoyed watching it, even if it is at best politically naive and at worst dangerous.",8,1,5,4 April 2007
