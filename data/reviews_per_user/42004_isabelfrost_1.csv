Come and See," Come and See you'll leave in shock.
",This film was truly unlike any film I have ever seen. This Great European 'Auteur' was a heart- wrenching coming of age story of a boy Florya; from leaving his mother to joining the partisan soldiers to falling in love. Florya starts off as a boy playing in the sand looking for guns yet as the movie progresses he has to use the gun for more then just play. The aging of Florya can be seen on the boys face through out the movie and is made even more apparent with close up shots of Florya staring straight into the camera. The camera movements can be disconcerting but it only adds to the emotions running rampant within Florya. He seems to almost go crazy at points. This movie left me in a quite shock. Its images where haunting and powerful.,7,2,3,9 June 2008
