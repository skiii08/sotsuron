Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Politically Incorrect Comments for Make Annoyed World Tabloids! :-)
","It is actually quite difficult to even get past the title of Sacha Baron Cohen's latest venture without laughing out loud, and the film itself certainly lives up to the laughs of the title.Cohen, made famous for his portrayal of west-side bad man Ali G, re-invented himself in 2002 as the overly-inquisitive and incredibly politically incorrect Kazakh reporter, Borat. 'Cultural Learnings' marks Borat's first Big Screen outing and is set to make a huge impact on movie-goers worldwide!The film starts in Borat's Hometown as he embarks on his journey to the 'US and A' to learn about what it is that makes America the greatest country in the world. After filming his experiences, he hopes to bring back that information to his country to allow his people to reach a new level of greatness. However, as the film progresses, Borat does get slightly distracted from his original goal and attempts to track down Pamela Anderson (And the twins!) with the intention of marrying her!The tone of the film is set within the first few seconds, and as Borat introduces members of his village you start to realise that no punches are going to be pulled with how offensive this film will be. I consider myself to have a very dark sense of humour but this film even managed to shock me! Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this in a bad way, as what I experienced was one of the funniest events of my life. I, along with the entire audience in the cinema, laughed to the point I thought I was going to throw up!I am well aware that some of the scenes in this film were set up, but the dialogue between Borat and the people that he meets is so funny, it just doesn't matter. As the film moves on from scene to scene, the antics get more daring in nature, none of which I am going to disclose however, as you simply have to see them to believe them!Cohen is so at home with the character of Borat that even though his material contains some of the most politically incorrect ideas ever to make it onto a cinema screen, he still manages to seem innocent in his demeanour. This of course makes his 'victims' want to believe him and also want to help him reach his goals. In turn, this makes for superbly funny watching for us the viewers.This film, since its release has caused almost as much controversy as the 'Michael Jackson' court-case, and I imagine as time goes on will continue to cause more. I think people need to take a step back and see it for what it is. It is probably the funniest film ever made! Don't go and see it and expect to come out un-offended as I imagine it was created to offend as many types of people as possible. If you are going to see it (As well you should!), I recommend that you turn off your brain, watch the chaos that ensues and enjoy it!Ronson's Rating: 10/10 - Probably the funniest movie in the world!To read more of my reviews, please visit my blog-site at http:\\filmcell.wordpress.com",10,1,23,9 January 2007
Casino Royale," Movie of the Year!
","The question burning on everyone's lips has to be, is it any good?The answer is quite simply is  yes.The plot of the film is simple enough. Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) sets up a high stakes poker game in Montenegro to raise the funds necessary to pay back a debt owed to terrorists he once had dealings with. Bond (Craig) is sent on his first major assignment as '00' agent to ensure that Le Chiffre is not successful in winning the game, thus sending him into hiding and allowing MI6 to grant him asylum in exchange for vital information about the terrorist community at large. The flip side however is that if Bond loses the game to Le Chiffre, he and the British Government will become directly responsible for funding terrorism.The pace of the film glides along from start to finish so well that you remain completely unaware of the two hours and forty-five minutes that have just passed. The direction seems almost completely flawless and certain pieces of cinematography are almost breathtaking. From the scenes filmed in the Bahamas to the chique surroundings of the Casino itself, even a glimpse of the lavish apartment of 'M', the locations chosen really bring to life the world of Bond. The fight scenes and car work have clearly had a great deal of time and effort put into the choreography and eventual filming, and both entertain with spectacular results, this time going as far as to be somewhat chilling in nature (Look out for a torture scene with a broken chair that really did strain the boundaries of the 12A rating!). The usual element of charm and wit has not been forgotten either though, especially in a very memorable scene which shows us the invention of the famous 'Vodka-Martini, shaken not stirred'.But the real joys of the film are the people. Scripted in a believable manner the characters are truly 'brought to life'. Craig in my opinion is without a doubt the best Bond since Sean Connery, and in some ways he even surpasses his predecessor. His general appearance along with his calm and often cold demeanour is perfectly fit to what we would expect of a hardened spy/assassin and thus far is the closest to the James Bond of the original Ian Fleming novels. It's also nice to see the origins of 007 and to see what makes him 'tick'. We get to see a glimpse of the reality of what he does and even gain an understanding of his sexist nature towards women. Mads Mikkelsen is superb as Le Chiffre, the almost emotionless compulsive gambler, and lest we not forget the Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. Eva Green gives a wonderful performance in her role and the chemistry between Lynd and Bond is nice enough to watch. I have to say the best on-screen couple though is without a doubt Bond and M, as this outing gives us a much clearer view of the relationship we saw so little of in the previous films.Overall this film has surpassed itself in that it made a bold step reinventing the franchise and actually came out as one of the best of the entire series. Bond is back ladies and gentlemen, and he's back to stay. And for all you non-believers out there, Daniel Craig IS Bond, James Bond!Ronson's Rating: 9/10 - Movie of the year!To read more of my reviews, please visit my blog-site at http:\\filmcell.wordpress.com",9,1,3,16 November 2006
