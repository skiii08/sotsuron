Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," My thanks to the many commenters who gave this film one-star.
","There are already so many intelligent, insightful comments about Borat that I really have nothing much to add. After the landslide of critical approval (Armond White in the New York Press being one exception), I thought, I'm going to have to slit my wrists if I'm the only person on IMDb who thought this was an ugly, unfunny film.I especially liked the comment observing that this film is being used as a silly litmus test: If you liked it you're cool; if you hated it you should be wearing orthopedic shoes and shaking a ruler in someone's face.Thank you.",1,29,59,13 November 2006
