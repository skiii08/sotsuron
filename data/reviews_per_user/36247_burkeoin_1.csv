It," Unwatchable
","Cringeworthy disaster of a film. There is nothing I hate more in a movie than stupid characters doing stupid things to drive a story forward, it just makes the movie frustrating. Combine that truly unlikable clich√©s of characters and you get this mess of a film.
The only film I can think of that was as hard to finish and stupid as this film with an inexplicably large number of positive reviews is 1997's Face/Off.",1,2,4,12 October 2019
