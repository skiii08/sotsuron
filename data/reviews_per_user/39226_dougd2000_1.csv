Hereditary," Brilliant Terror
","Not since the likes of The Exorcist have we seen a film like Hereditary. It pulls you in emotionally with the ironically comforting and familiar themes of family and loss. But then it takes you down an elevator ride of horror, stopping at every floor so you can see and feel the normal being pulled away from this family in viscerally disturbing ways as they experience multiple levels of terror. You know nothing can or will be the same for them as you fear for your own sense of normality. Few films are brave enough to put front and center our darkest and most powerful fears and anxieties, and portray themes of grief and disintegration, in such an honest and unflinching manner as this one. The film as a whole is brilliant and will no doubt become a horror classic in the same vein as The Exorcist, and will leave you just as shaken after watching it.",9,2,4,26 October 2019
