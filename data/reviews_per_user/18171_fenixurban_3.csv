The Incredible Hulk," My Review
","NOTE: most of what I'll be saying is in comparison to Iron Man.Okay, yeah, um, TOTAL BADASSNESS!!!! The last Hulk was more like, 'Attack of the Play-Doh Man'. But this one... oh man. Not only does the Incredible Hulk delivery, but it exceeded all of my expectations. Lets face it, after Iron Man's success, this film was a coin toss. It was either going to be really good or really bad, and what were the chances that ANOTHER Marvel movie would be just as great? Well... it is.Since I am comparing it to Iron Man, I'd say it's on par with it.Pros: In terms of it's action, it's more intense and more 'edge of your seat' than Iron Man. In terms of its emotional connection, Incredible Hulk is better as well. Yes, Eddy Norton is, as usual, the s**t. He plays a GREAT Bruce Banner and is more than convincing in his performance. It may not be his BEST acting job, (see 'Fight Club') but it's high on that ladder. And Liv Tyler, holy crap. I was IMPRESSED. I mean, she may be too beautiful for the role of Betty Ross, but her acting is the best I've ever seen. Hell, I find it better than when she was Arwen in 'Lord of the Rings.' In short, I was just blown away by her performance this time around. William Hurt, awesome and convincing, as always. Tim Roth makes for an excellent bad guy, and not even an over-the-top kind. And of course, the special effects blew me away, which is pretty hard to do, nowadays. Yeah, that's pretty much it.Cons: Even though its writing isn't AS GOOD as Iron Man, it's still respectable and better than most (that didn't sound like a con, did it?). Also, for a brief moment, it had one of those 'okay, that scene just had no reason to be in the movie' moments. It's still funny, but it's just something I noticed (yeah, still doesn't sound like a con, does it?).Yeah, similar to Iron Man, there aren't too many cons to say about it.So if you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT!!! If you have seen it, GO SEE IT AGAIN!!! If you have no interest in seeing it, FIND INTEREST, GO SEE IT, AND THEN SEE IT AGAIN!!! If you've gone bankrupt from seeing it too many times, STEAL MONEY FROM SOMEONE AND SEE IT UNTIL YOU BANKRUPT THAT PERSON TOO!!! Just kidding. ^_^ Anyway, yeah, 10/10. GO EDWARD NORTON!!!!!!!!!!!",10,4,8,13 June 2008
Ghost Rider," It has its ups and downs
","Alright, I'm sure that a lot of people were expecting this movie to suck because of Nicolas Cage, or it will just flat out suck. Let me be the first to say that this movie has its ups and downs.Ups: Great CGI, compelling characters, good enough story/plot.Downs: Not Nicholas Cage's character, (he's not a bad actor, but it isn't his greatest role) very clichéd 60 percent of the time, and there are a few 'random moments.' (The crap that happens and there's no point in it) Personally, I like this movie because it has an awesome character, the Ghost Rider, and it's about Hell. So if you can hack the clichés and the 'downs' in general, you may enjoy this movie enough. Again, it's not the greatest, and the movie could have done better with another actor playing Johnny Blaze, but it's impressive. 8/10.",8,0,1,17 February 2007
Blood Diamond," The perfect action movie
","In all my years of watching action movies, they all seem to have one thing missing. Explosions, gunfire, death, plots, compelling characters, too much clichéd dialogue, etc... But nothing can compare to this movie.Blood Diamond is full of explosions and nonstop gunfire. There's enough blood to keep the sick vampyric people satisfied, (like myself) a very compelling story that almost seems like it happened once, and of course, the characters. None of them said anything all that clichéd, and Leo's performance is SPECTACULAR. As in, this was his best role yet. (In my opinion) Djimon Hounsou is also great, Jennifer Connelly was breath-taking, in both acting and looks. Not to mention, FINALLY, nothing was random. As in everything made sense. Ever seen those action movies where crap happens and there's no explanation why it happened? Like all of a sudden, a building explodes or a zombie just comes out and eats a person out of nowhere or a vampire was just stabbed - right there? If so, Blood Diamond decided to rebel against those clichés and made something awesome. I applaud everyone involved in this movie.9.99/10",10,0,1,3 February 2007
