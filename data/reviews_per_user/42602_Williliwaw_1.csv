Vertigo," Hitchcock/Novak/Stewart
","I feel that while Alfred Hitchcock created this great film, the performances of Kim Novak and James Stewart raise it to Masterpiece status...of the two stars..Miss Novak's performance is the greater. Astonishingly beautiful in this film, Kim Novak always gave the impression that no matter what we knew of her character in a film, there was just a little more we didn't know. Of all the major stars Kim Novak is the most underrated and frankly under honored. How about an Honorary Oscar for this great and wondrous star??James Stewart is perfectly cast in this movie, and this movie is deeply moving, and one cannot see it enough and further intoxicated with its magic.Dear Academy Awards: This movie, now considered Hitchcock's finest and likely one of the great American movies of all time has a special standing with the Academy. Neither Novak, nor Stewart nor Hitchcock were Nominated much less awarded an Oscar. Neither was the movie. Of all the Players and Executives only Miss Novak survives...how about an honorary Oscar to Kim Novak for this movie and for other great portraits on the screen; some say she wasn't an Actress..I beg to differ she was so great an actress she ranks with Garbo as one of the greatest.",10,2,4,29 April 2006
