Mission: Impossible III," tom cruise in general
","granted, tom cruise can be a little crazy sometimes, but I give him credit for knowing his business. I didn't agree with him lashing out at brooke shields because depression is something my family has been through. I think that was wrong of him. But, this movie was very good. I left out all of the personal thoughts about cruise and looked at this from a cinematic aspect. Cruise is a decent actor. I thought the cast did a great job, and this movie blew the heck out of the first two movies. Go see this, and forget that your money might be going to scientology. IT'S A MOVIE!!!!!! it's just for entertainment. Don't listen to these 1 ratings because most of the people who posted them havven't seen the movie yet. They do it because of Tom Cruise's crazy opinions. Don't listen to them, go see this thriller of a movie. You won't be disappointed.",9,0,2,6 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Childhood favorite
","This is probably one of the greatest movies ever made. Personally, just about anyone can relate to this. At one point or another, someone has felt lonely or felt like Elliot. This movie makes you feel good. I don't agree with the 7.8 average, it at least deserves to break 8.0. AFI voted it one of the best of all time, so this site should definitely have it in the top 250. Oh well, I still love it. I've seen it billions of times and i still get a smile out of it. Phone home! I do wish that Steven Spielberg hadn't added in the new digitized E.T. because it took out the darkness of the movie. he replaced the guns with walkie talkies, i mean come on!!! And they say hippie instead of terrorist. Someone should know when to leave a movie alone. It's like changing the last lines of Casablanca's for instance, you just don't do it! That is the cardinal sin of movie business. That's my opinion at least.",10,1,2,24 March 2006
