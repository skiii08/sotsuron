It," Not Up to TV Mini-Series
","I used to be a huge Stephen King fan, eagerly buying each of his novels on release. While my ardor has abated, I still love IT as a novel (along with The Stand, Salem's Lot, and a few others).
Having said that, this adaptation has been a let-down since the release of the first part with the kids.
One of the things that I love about the novel is the time jumps, i.e. past with the kids, present with the adults, back and forth. Having two separate movies, one with the kids time line and one for the adults just doesn't work to preserve this feature.
Secondly, the changes from the novel detract from my enjoyment.
Sorry... nice try, but it just doesn't make the cut. The TV mini-series is light years better than this version.
If you haven't read the novel OR watched the original TV version, this one will be good. If you like the others, don't waste your time.",4,0,1,31 May 2020
