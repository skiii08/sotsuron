Casablanca," Great movie, but not the greatest
","Casablanca is a great movie with strong acting and script.  But I don't think it's THE best or top 10 movies of all time. I haven't seen that many classics, but in comparison, it lacks the complexity and inventiveness of Citizen Kane.  Gone With the Wind, as melodramatic as it is, has astounding cinematography/sets, strong performances and 2 memorable characters instead of 1 (i.e. Rick.  Ilsa and Victor are rather 1-dimensional, the script's fault, not acting).  With the same strong ensemble performance, All About Eve's wittiness would blow Casablanca's script away.Of course, Casablanca is a nice package of romance, suspense and action, but it is not without its flaws.  The Paris scenes felt subpar and corny to the rest of the movie.  Besides, Rick already seems cynical back in Paris.  So it hinders the supposed transformation after Ilsa left him.  As mentioned above, Ilsa and Victor are bland characters.  Louis' transformation in the end is incredulous.  The plot is predictable.  Can't you see it coming that Rick still has a golden heart, that Victor & Ilsa would escape Casablanca, that even the bad Nazi gets what he deserved.  All in all, it feels more 'black and white' and dated than other classics, and it's not just because the movie is set during WW2.",8,1,3,16 December 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Unintentionally Funny
","MI2 has excellent action sequences.  In that regard, it succeeds as a summer action movie.  As a comedy, it is unintentionally funny.  It was hilarious to see how fast Tom and Thandie went from car chase to sex to love to self-sacrifice, I thought I was watching a porn.  It was hilarious to see Tom trying to act with emotional depth.  The characters/plot were very stupid, even by action movie standards.  I've also seen Hollow Man tonight and I have a hard time deciding which one is dumber. Big question: Is John Woo parodying himself?  Seeing Tom Cruise flying with 2 guns and trying to act cool a la Chow Yun-Fat makes me laugh so hard.  And what's with the doves?  In 'The Killer' and 'Face/Off', doves as an overt symbol of peace counter the struggle between good and evil.  In here without the dramatic tension (bland bad/good guys), it's corny and over done.  I rest my case.  Come on John, do you have to use doves, cathartic music and supposedly meaningful imageries for every movie or did Tom the producer force you into this?",5,0,0,25 February 2001
