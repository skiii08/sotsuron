The Incredible Hulk," It's good. Lots of action, not much story or character development. But lots of action.
","It is structured as follows: chase, battle, short pause for talk, chase, battle, short pause for talk, big battle, the end. So, they may have set the bar a bit low, but they have certainly achieved their target. And it must be said that the few short scenes of character development are very good and make me wish Norton had won his battle to make it a longer film. Roll on the DVD release! (The blu-ray version will have 70 minutes of extra footage, according to the director!) But, missing scenes aside, what we do get is still good. Sure, it's not Iron Man, but then it's not trying to be. More than anything else, it's just trying hard to be different from the previous Hulk film (which I loved). This film wants to entertain you every step of the way, so it rarely pauses for breath. Somebody is always running, jumping and hitting someone else. And the producers are hoping you are invested enough in the characters as it is, without them stopping to talk very much about what is happening to them.And it mostly works. We do know these characters, so we do care. And even if we don't know who they are we can see that Banner looks sad, keeps staring at a picture of pretty girl and has a nice dog, so we are going to like him. And Blonsky shows up and is mean to the dog, so we know to dislike him! (It's not rocket science, people. Pay attention!!) The film also manages to tie itself to the superb Bill Bixby television series in a million different ways (something the previous film chose not to do). Which makes it seem like a very humble film, approaching us with head bowed offering gifts to please us. The first film is a favourite of mine, but it wasn't a crowd-pleaser. This one has a real air of 'Hey, sorry about that. Look, there's more to the Hulk than that. He smashes stuff! Remember the old TV series? The Hulk can be fun!' And...It was. I hope there's a Hulk 3 and they keep everyone from this one on board. 'B+' http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/",7,3,10,13 June 2008
Terminator Salvation," Not an entirely bad way to spend two hours if you like to see things blowing up
","In a desolate future overrun with killer robots, two men fight separate battles. One of them has a mysterious destiny, and the other has a mysterious past...Dreadful dialogue, too many war movie clichés, a lack of story and a boring visual style drag this one down towards mediocrity. But there are things to enjoy. There are a couple of good performances, a couple of good action sequences and - if you forget the first two Terminator movies - you will enjoy this fast-moving summer blockbuster.The movie opens with stirring lines like 'it's too quiet' and 'don't point a gun unless you intend to use it' and continues in that vein for two hours. You are better off not listening when the characters speak because it will make you laugh. So will many of the set-ups and situations. The hero has a hard ass commanding officer who ignores him and reprimands him, there's a mute child running around looking alternatively cute/scared, there's a woman who lays it all on the line for true love, there's a big sacrifice at the end and stuff like that.Story-wise the split narrative does a great job of keeping the viewer interested. When the Christian Bale storyline gets boring (as it frequently does), the tale returns to Sam Worthington and we are interested again. Worthington has a better story, a better character and gives a much better performance. Bale is relentlessly boring and his character does nothing. He spends a lot of time sitting brooding (while listening to his mother's voice on cassette) and when he does make decisions they are frustratingly bad ones. This is John Connor, huh? Since 1984 we have been told of this great leader. The writers appear to have forgotten that fact or are incapable of delivering a script that will demonstrate his abilities. A hero who sits for hours squinting at a tape recorder and then runs full tilt into a trap does not inspire confidence. Idiot.Then there is the greyness of everything. Everything is grey and dusty in this movie. Even flickering flames appear to be grey! It's all a bit much.Worthington and Moon Bloodgood are the highlights of the film. Both have interesting characters to play. Yes, their story arcs are predictable, but - thanks to the performances - I cared and enjoyed. In fact, had this been their story (with no reference to Terminator/John Connor) this would have been a much more enjoyable film.In terms of actions there is lots to enjoy. Killer robots (small, medium and large) run rampant, there are chases on the land and in the air, and there are fights in the water, in the dusty grime and in sleek futuristic hallways. There isn't much downtime between action sequences and McG manages to put a neat visual twist on a couple of them (I really like the helicopter crash).Even with all the stuff that was bad/awful/disappointing I can honestly say I enjoyed the film as a whole. It's not epic like former Terminator movies, and it's not clever/deep like the TV series, but it's not an entirely bad way to spend two hours if you like to see things blowing up.Grade: B http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com",6,0,2,5 June 2009
Cloverfield," A giant monster attacks New York and a group of friends must cross the city to rescue one of their own.
","A giant monster attacks New York and a group of friends must cross the city to rescue one of their own.Had it been filmed the way I just described then it might have been a good movie and it might have been well worth watching. Depending on who directed it, what the special effects were like and who the cast was. I can hazard a guess like that because we've all seen movies that loosely fit that description. You know the ones I mean where a group of friends band together to escape something. They survive a few close calls and - inevitably - one of them dies and the levels of tension are ramped up before the all-action finale, after which the hero gets the girl.So, Cloverfield could have been another one of those movies.But it's not. Because instead of showing us everything that is happening, the film only shows us what is seen by a camcorder being carried by the group on their trek. This means, of course, that there is a lot the filmmakers can't show us. But that doesn't matter. Partly because this is the sort of stuff we get to see in other similar movies anyway and partly because their choice of storytelling technique allows them to show us stuff we normally don't get to see. And that's the stuff that makes this a film worth seeing.Some of the decisions are inspired (for instance the tape used to record this was also used to record something else, and sometimes we get to see that as well) and the movie is a thrill ride from star to finish.I'm giving this an 'A+' because I can't give higher/more.http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/",10,0,1,20 March 2008
Captain America: Civil War," Magnificent
","I lost count of the times I gasped or whispered 'wow' to myself.Story-driven and character-driven right to the bitter end, but it also has many amazing action sequences.Remarkably, all of the characters are well-served. Old favourites get moments to shine, and new kids on the block are put in the spotlight as well. One in particular basically steals the film.Weighty and serious, thought-provoking and intelligent, but also joyful and funny in almost every scene.Rapid-pace storytelling. Blink and you miss the next story development.Great, great performances from Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Daniel Brühl and Chris Evans.10/10",10,72,130,28 April 2016
Annie Hall," There is a lot of romance in this movie and a lot of comedy, too.
","Not only is this high on various lists of Greatest Movies Of All Time, it's also clocked up some of the best written reviews of any film. Ever.I know. Because I have spent the last few days reading them. It's all very daunting. Sitting down to write yet another review. What can I say about such a beloved and appreciated film? Other than: I love it, too. And, not having seen it in over fifteen years, I had pretty much forgotten how much of an impact it can have.'Annie Hall' is the story of a relationship told in flashbacks and fantasy sequences. The narrator tells us in the opening moments that: 'Annie and I broke up and I still can't get my mind around that. I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and examining my life and trying' to figure out where did the screwup come. A year ago we were in love.' And those opening lines are a perfect description of what is to follow.The movie has no linear structure, and no plot. It's mostly two people talking. Walking and talking in beautifully filmed sequences. There are a lot of fantasy sequences, too. No two of which are the same. One scene features subtitles to tell us what the characters are thinking, another scene shows Annie's mind leaving her body during sex, while another features people in different rooms (shown in split screen) having a conversation back and forth. Random strangers stop on the street with vital information, then depart again. And one of the scenes is animated. This is from 1977, by the way. The year it won the Best Picture Oscar.But this not a film of gimmicks. It's a film about love. The story of two very real people in love. AFI listed this as the greatest romantic comedy of all time. And it's easy to see why. There is a lot of romance in this movie and a lot of comedy, too. The stars/characters have astonishing chemistry and it's easy to believe that this woman is the Love Of His Life. The dialogue is peppered with some of the funniest dialogue every written for the screen, and many lines have escaped into popular culture and are quoted time and time again ('Don't knock masturbation; it's sex with someone I love').In terms of content and storytelling technique, this is a masterpiece. A+ from me.http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/",10,5,10,9 April 2008
There Will Be Blood," A Stunning Accomplishment (A+)
","Great central performances, stunning visuals and a fascinating story combine to make for a very enjoyable film with a truly epic feel.The first twenty minutes has no dialogue (so you need to pay attention or you'll miss something important for later on), we spend most of the movie watching Daniel Day-Lewis on his own, there are long stretches where nothing much appears to happen and - after nearly three hours in the cinema - the ending is abrupt and ambiguous. Yet, this is a completely satisfying experience from start to finish and I'd be more than happy to go back and watch it again. My only complaint is that the unsuitable score kept intruding upon my enjoyment. In the grand scheme of things, however, that's a minor complaint.Daniel Plainview, a hardworking solitary man, strikes oil in 1898. We follow his story in the years that follow, as he gets richer and richer. We meet his son, his brother, his rival and his enemy along the way. How he treats each one tells us a lot about Daniel Plainview. His 'enemy' - by the way - is a minister in a small town that Plainview wants to own. They clash repeatedly over the years, some battles are humorous and some are vicious, and viewers might be tempted to read the film as a study in Power vs. Revigion. But, truthfully, it's not a story that's that easy to categorize.While there is still a lot left unclear, when the the movie draws to a close in 1927, the viewer is left with vivid picture of who this man was and what sort of world he lived in. That's a stunning accomplishment. A+http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/",10,1,5,18 March 2008
X-Men: First Class," Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is basically a bromance).
","What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren't  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You've got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That's it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don't understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik's best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that's  okay, since this isn't THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw's two henchmen don't get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it's a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it's the Magneto helmet or  Mystique's everyday clothes, you are always admiring 'the look' of  what's on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven't been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United.",10,295,425,1 June 2011
Iron Man," Superb!
","After Superman, I believed that a man could fly. Now I believe that a man can redeem himself, no matter how badly he's fraked up in the past.And I could not be happier that they choose Robert Downey Jr. to carry this message. It works because it's his story, and it shows that he knows this. His heart is in every frame of this movie, his heart is in every word he utters, and your heart will be in the movie, too.It's a cool movie, with lots of things blowing up and stuff like that. But, it's a well-told human story first and foremost. If the X-Men movies strike a chord, it's because each one of us have known the pains of isolation and exclusion. If the Spider-Man movies strike a chord, it's because we all know the little fears and frustrations that drive our daily lives. And Iron Man? Iron Man is aimed at those of us who have made mistakes in the past and want to redeem ourselves.And, it strikes a chord. Believe me, it strikes a chord.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Affleck is good, story is weak, dialogue is bad. Wonder Woman impresses.
","Ben Affleck is good. Indeed, the cast is mostly good. But Affleck shines. The story is weak and doesn't really make any sense. It kinda fizzles out at the end. The narrative raises questions, or appears to, and then throws in some big action scenes to (hopefully) make us forget those questions. Much as Bruce basically forgets his desire to kill Clark and (inexplicably) refers to him as a friend!! The dialogue is often bad. Very bad. Bad enough to make you have to stifle chuckles from time to time. The film has an overly-serious, self-important tone. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex is terrible. He doesn't have one good scene. Zack Snyder seems to believe that the best way to tell a Superman story is to focus on politics, debate, morals, misery, regret and lots of destruction. It's like he read hundreds of comics and thought: This would be so much better with Senate hearings and sorrow. The result of all this is a dour character who does not resemble Superman. Snyder has a clear vision of who Superman is, but it's completely the wrong vision and it's one that nobody is likely to find all that interesting. Except Snyder, who is clearly fascinated by it. And by the idea that heroes should be punished. The Batman scenes are better than the Superman ones, and they always advance the story. Bruce is always doing stuff and getting closer to his goals. Clark, meanwhile, is always moping and saving Lois. Then moping some more. Clark is always miserable. So is Bruce, but at least Bruce is always moving forward. (Until the very end, when he just changes his mind. Because. Because he does.) The movie is too long, but still manages to be quite pacy because we are always jumping from Bruce to Clark to Lex and back again. It's well structured, just saddled with a script that is badly written. Every twist and turn is telegraphed far in advance. Nothing is subtle. Wonder Woman impresses, but doesn't get enough screen time. 5/10",5,3,6,25 March 2016
