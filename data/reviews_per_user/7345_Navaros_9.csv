The Incredible Hulk," The *only* Incredible thing about this movie: Incredible how pathetically bad the CGI is.
","The Incredible Hulk has Incredibly bad CGI. That is the one and only incredible thing about the whole movie.The CGI looks like the paid an amateur video game modder 5 dollars, total, to make the best CGI Hulk he could.In reality, they may have spent a bit more than 5 dollars and hired more than one amateur video game modder. But the end result *looks* like they *didn't*, and that is the only thing that counts.The Incredible Hulk is rivalled only by I Am Legend, and the Ang Lee movie version of The Incredible Hulk from 2003, for having the very worst CGI of all-time.Even the television Hulk from the 1970's looks *vastly* more believable and realistic than the CGI green turd Hulk in the Norton movie version does.Some criticize the TV Hulk for being corny. Sure, he could be a bit corny, but *even so*, he is *still* INCREDIBLY more immersive and believable than this movie's 5-dollar-looking CGI fake green blob of crap is, which you *won't ever* believe is real for even one single second.Besides, it is possible to use a human actor to play the Hulk *and* make the Hulk have a gritty, dark edge. Just because the TV Hulk was lighthearted and family-friendly, it doesn't mean that that is so *because* they used a human actor to play him. This is a huge fallacy in logic that defenders of the CGI green turd Hulk frequently make. But it's time to put that fallacy of logic to rest, permanently. The Hulk as played by a human actor could easily be every bit as gritty and dark as Batman or anyone else if the writers, director, and producers made him be so.Movies like Iron Man and Transformers have shown that it's entirely possible to make a great movie using *good* CGI that does not in any way detract from the believability and quality of the movie. The Incredible Hulk with Norton is the exact opposite of that. The CGI green fake turd 5-dollar-looking blob of crap Hulk completely destroys the movie in every conceivable way.The Hulk in this movie looks so awful, that by even putting it on the screen and expecting people to pay to see it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewing audience.Bottomline: there is no excuse whatsoever for how pathetically bad the CGI Hulk in the Norton movie looks.",1,21,68,12 June 2008
Star Trek," A few good points, but mostly ruined by SHAKYCAM, no plot, no meaning, a one-dimensional caricature villain, trashy smut, and being VASTLY INFERIOR to both TOS and DS9.
","Star Trek pretends to be the first film of its kind, but really it is the eleventh Star Trek film.Star Trek is much better than all of the TNG (The Next Generation) films, and the TNG television series, put together. Star Trek has put more character development in its two hours than TNG had in its seven years on television and an additional four TNG films. However, that is not saying much, because that series and those films are all terrible, so improving on them ISN'T an accomplishment.Star Trek is likewise much better than the shows Voyager, and Enterprise (the horrible non-Trek show that wanted to be a Trek show, and got canceled very quickly for being a piece of crap). However, that too, is not saying much.When compared to the original Star Trek of the 1960's (TOS), or Deep Space Nine (DS9), Abrams' Star Trek falls flat on its face and bleeds its green blood all over the rocks.Star Trek tries to remake TOS and on some levels it succeeds. Star Trek has restored the conflict and humor between the crew members, and adventure; vital concepts that made TOS special, but were subsequently murdered in TNG because by that time Roddenberry was a senile man close to death and therefore got the crazy idea in his demented, aged mind that having a show with no humor, no adventure, and no conflict would be good. Since he was calling the shots, his demented mind dictated for much smarter men in his employ to degrade themselves to his (insane, senile) vision and thus we got approximately twenty years of garbage Trek (TNG, Voyager, and Enterprise if you want to even call that abomination Trek, which it isn't).However, there was also a shining beacon of brilliant Trek in that twenty years: DS9. After Season 1 of DS9, the makers of that show realized that you CANNOT write good drama with no humor, no adventure and no conflict. Therefore, they (rightfully!) flipped the bird to senile Gene's insane vision and instead restored TOS' amazing vision to Trek. Like TOS, DS9 had conflict; adventure; humor; compelling non-generic characters; tons of master actors and brilliant, epic stories.Although Star Trek has likewise restored the conflict, adventure and humor of TOS, it left out one of the core aspects of TOS and DS9: intelligent, thought-provoking, meaningful stories. Star Trek has a generic plot (full of holes, at that), a generic one-dimensional caricature of a villain, and is overall, very dumb. No intelligence is required of the audience to understand Star Trek, nor is there any meaning to it. That is, it is dumbed-down for lowest common denominator (LCD) appeal. Whilst that is great for ticket sales because everyone, no matter how dumb, will buy a ticket, since seeing this movie will make them feel smart, it is very detrimental towards making a great film.Additionally, Star Trek's great special effects by ILM are totally ruined by Abrams' amateur director SHAKYCAM usage. It is mind boggling that directors who are not wise enough to AVOID SHAKYCAM are allowed to direct huge mainstream movies like this. They should be forced to go back to film school for another ten years first, or however long it takes them to realize that only idiots think shakycam is a good thing, much less use it in their films. The shakycam makes Star Trek annoying and frustrating to watch. You can't see most of what's going on...instead all you see is the camera shaking like the director is a spastic test lab monkey with a few too many experimental injections running through his system.TOS was groundbreaking by being one of the first television shows ever to feature, in Uhura, a strong Black woman as a main character. However, Star Trek completely bastardizes this point by turning Uhura into U-WHORE-A in this movie. U-WHORE-A spends all her time being pretty and lusting in her duties to be a sex slave to Spock and others. No reason is given for why U-WHORE-A has become a whore, nor for why Spock is using her as his sex slave. Not only does this bastardize the character of Uhura, but also that of Spock. Spock would never lust after a human woman in TOS, much less use her as his sex slave. Clearly, Abrams was just trying to sex it up for the sake of once again appealing to LCD viewers. As a result, there are many very excruciating minutes of screen time wasted on this trashy smut. Uhura is NOT supposed to be the inspiration for Quark's series of holosuite program entitled 'Vulcan Love Slave', but Abrams has trashed her character into being that.Abrams adds insult to injury by having the script canonize the non-Trek Enterprise show (which didn't have any Star Trek label on it when it originally aired), whilst simultaneously implicitly erasing the entirety of every other Trek show. Erasing garbage like TNG and Voyager is fine. But erasing TOS and DS9, which are both bona-fide masterpieces that are VASTLY superior to this Abrams movie, is an inexcusable slap in the face to the decades of hard work of much better men than J.J. 'SHAKYCAM' Abrams and his 90210-in-space script-writing kiddies. If you are gonna erase something, then the replacement should be better, NOT 10 000x worse, as the Abrams movie is when compared to either TOS or DS9.If you like mindless, smutty entertainment built upon the awful foundation of SHAKYCAM, then Abrams' Star Trek is for you. However, if you want to see Star Trek at its full potential: masterpiece works of art, you must check out Star Trek: TOS (the 1960's television series with Shatner) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (the 1990's television series, and only other good Star Trek show).",1,15,27,24 May 2009
Crash," Message of this movie is false, and doesn't work.
","Crash tries to be a complex anti-racism movie, meant to besmirch every human being by saying that every human being is racist to at least some degree. Plain and simple, the message of Crash is supposed to be:'Everyone is racist.'Crash's solution this problem, the way for everyone to no longer be racist, is:'Everyone should trust every other human being in the world implicitly, even if they are total strangers.'Which is obviously an asinine idea that can never work in real-life. Completely ludicrous. I saw Terence Howard on Charlie Rose a couple of years ago, promoting the movie Crash. Howard told Charlie Rose that Crash was the best thing that exists for mankind, and if everyone listened to and applied the message of Crash in real-life, it would be the single best thing that could ever happen in the world to change the world for the better.But, Terence Howard was wrong. Trusting every other human being implicitly for the sake of 'not being racist at all' would only lead to those who do so being taken advantage of horribly. It wouldn't help society at all, it would just make nefarious activities against other human beings *easier* for the law-breaking thugs to commit.The Ryan Phillippe character in Crash is *supposed* to be alleged by this movie to be racist because he shot a thug who it looked like was about to shoot him. That alleged racism is bogus. He wasn't shooting him because of his race, he was shooting him because he was a violent criminal thug and that was very evident from his hostile demeanour, irrespective of his skin color. This is another area the intended message of this movie fubars. Claiming that any negative thought or action taken against any member of another race, is wrong & racism by default. That is what the movie promotes, but that is not so. To delude one's self in believing that anyone who is not the same race as one's self is inherently good, and any negative thoughts or actions against them are wrong & racist no matter what, is not ridding the world of racism. It's ridding the world of common sense. Don't get me wrong, racism does indeed exist, and racism is indeed bad. No one is arguing with that. Where Crash gets it wrong is in stating that every human being is racist, and going through life without trusting implicitly every stranger in the world who is not the same race as you, is racism. Due to message of Crash being incorrect, impossible to rationally apply in real-life, and therefore failing, and the fact that Crash has no artistic merit or reason for existing beyond trying to promote that message, Crash is not a good movie. The acting in Crash is phenomenal from everyone, except for from Ludicrous who is a real-life rapper (not an actor). Ludicrous gives an embarrassingly-awful performance and clearly he is *vastly* out of his league playing in this movie, which aside from himself, is comprised of a huge ensemble of nothing other than master actors. To add insult to injury, Ludicrous' lines in the movie reek of hypocrisy, and consist of him getting up on a soapbox and renouncing rap music as evil that ruins Black youth even though the rap music he describes in the movie is *exactly* the same rap music he himself makes in real-life. I realize that an actor playing a role is just an actor playing a role, but that paradigm does not apply to the movie Crash in particular since Ludicrous in my opinion was not cast in this movie for reasons relating to his (complete lack of) acting talent. And because the purpose of Crash is not like most movies, to entertain, but rather the purpose is solely to deliver the message: 'Everyone is racist, and you must trust every other human being implicitly in order not to be racist.' Therefore the hypocrisy of Ludicrous delivering lines about the evil of rap music in Crash reeks extra much. Great acting from everyone but Ludicrous is not enough to save Crash, though, since it has nothing else going for it. Crash is also painful to watch and listen to due to the terrible foreign elevator-music singing that is constantly blaring over most of the scenes. In my opinion, some badly-done production elements of Crash are a result of reverse-racism/affirmative-action at work: the casting of Ludicrous even though he can't act at all but just because he's a popular Black man in pop culture, and filling the movie with terrible foreign elevator-music singing throughout because then it gets token points for giving 'foreign talent' a chance. Don't get me wrong on this either, foreign music is *fine* if it's *good*. The problem with Crash is that it sounds like they just greenlighted the very first piece of crap terrible foreign elevator-music singing that came across their desk *only* because it was foreign, and decided to plaster it all over the movie. Woe comes to the ears of the viewing audience as a result.Note: While writing this review, I have in fact spelled Ludicrous' name in the proper way how he wants it to be spelled: 'L-u-d-a-c-r-i-s'- every time I used it. However, IMDb's automatic 'spellcheck' changes it automatically to 'Ludicrous' every single time without any input from me or choice to prevent that. This is not carelessness or ignorance on my part, it's simply the automated spellcheck forcing these mis-spellings into this review. Maybe it's Divine Intervention. to be seen as an omen about Ludcrious' acting talent? I don't know, but the point is, the mis-spelling of his name in this review is due to automation beyond my control, not due to any error on my part.Crash is probably the greatest ensemble of acting talent ever put into a bad movie that goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing.",1,4,9,11 March 2008
28 Weeks Later," Only one good scene in the whole entire movie: the very first one!
","28 Weeks Later has only one good scene in the whole entire movie: the very first one! In the first scene, you see a calm situation quickly descend into madness with infected zombies suddenly turning up and causing chaos. This scene is very suspenseful, scary, intense and brilliantly shot. Unfortunately, it is the only scene in the whole movie that has any of those qualities. Everything to come after this opening scene is abysmally stale, boring, not scary, and uninteresting.I have been told that the opening scene was done by the Director of the original movie (28 Days Later), and the rest of the movie was done by the Director of the movie this review is about (28 Weeks Later). I have not verified this information to be correct or not, but the *vast* difference of quality between the opening scene and the whole rest of the movie certainly does bear out the correctness of that statement. The opening scene and the rest of the movie are like two entirely separate movies; one great (the opening scene) and one terrible (the whole rest of the movie).After the opening scene of 28 Weeks Later, it is no longer a zombie movie. Instead, it instantly *devolves* into a movie about two clichéd, dopey, very annoying children and their quest to escape being murdered by the US Military; which has been ordered to kill all humans in the country because they are mixed together with infected zombies. If you were expecting a zombie movie from 28 Weeks Later, you have been misled. 28 Weeks Later is *not* a zombie movie. It's a 'Watch dopey kids try to escape being hunted down by the US military' movie. Zombies in 28 Weeks Later are a complete afterthought. Aside from the opening scene, they might as well not have bothered to have any zombies in the movie at all, since the movie devolves to a point where it has nothing whatsoever to do with zombies.This movie seems to be a nothing more than a ham-fisted attempt to paint the US Military as bloodthirsty monsters who murder civilians indiscriminately. That idea may or may not have legitimate roots in real-life. But a movie that is *supposed* to be a zombie movie is not a suitable venue to be exploring that idea. If a Director wants to make a movie that is a soapbox for promoting a point of view that 'The US Military is evil', that is fine. But he *shouldn't* try to be cagey about it, and pretend that his 'zombie movie' about that is *actually* a zombie movie. That is what 28 Weeks Later does. 28 Weeks Later *masquerades* itself as a zombie movie, but it's more akin to a skewed documentary pushing an anti-US Military agenda, like Farenheit 9/11.Therefore, it should not have been masqueraded as a zombie movie, or had the '28' brand attached to it's title. The Director should have been honest about what he was making and not have tried to mislead consumers into watching a zombie movie, then once they've paid to see it, really they don't get a zombie movie. They just get to be subjected to his agenda to push a political message.Best way to watch 28 Weeks Later: watch the opening scene, then turn it off. Once the man has escaped on a boat, you know all the good parts of the movie are done with. Press STOP right then, you've seen *everything* worthwhile in this movie by that point.2/10 for the opening scene alone. Had the entire movie maintained the quality of the opening scene, this *would* have been a 10/10.",2,0,2,18 February 2008
American History X," Very contrived, badly-acted and unrealistic soapbox movie to let us know 'Racism is bad!'
","American History X is a very contrived and unrealistic soapbox movie against racism. The purpose of the movie is simple: beat viewers over the head with a simplistic message that they all already agree with in the first place! Namely, 'Racism is bad!' Everyone already knows racism is bad, so a movie comprised of 2 hours worth of strung-together ridiculous contrivances that exists solely for the purpose to push the message 'Racism is bad' is not exactly a work of art. Nor is it food for thought. This movie won't tell anyone anything that they don't *already know*, therefore the existence of the movie is pointless.Edward Norton plays a hardcore Nazi skinhead. He *looks* the part, but as soon as he opens his mouth, any chance of him being believable in that role is utterly destroyed. Edward Norton talks like - and has the demeanour of - a computer geek. There is no way to reasonably be immersed in believing he is a hardcore Nazi skinhead. For this reason I'm going to have to say Edward Norton gives a terrible performance in this movie. *Good* actors can change their voice, demeanour, and the aura they give off. Edward Norton cannot. He uses the exact same voice, and has the exact same wimpy computer geek demeanour/aura in American History X as he does in every single movie role he ever does. It bewilders me why such a bad actor - with no range whatsoever - is so popular. It actually makes this movie be *unintentionally hilarious* to see such a buffed guy be so incredibly wimpy and non-threatening.Edward Furlong plays his little brother. Furlong gives a good performance as always, however, he isn't given anything to work with. All his lines are very generic and bland.Avery Brooks gives an okay performance as the school principal, but there is nothing special about it. He's exactly the same in this movie as he is as Sisko in Deep Space Nine, or the gangster in the movie The Big Hit. Actually it seems Avery Brooks has actually *dialed down* his intensity in American History X; an intensity he has in all those other roles but *not* in American History X. So I must conclude that Brooks' performance in American History X is worse than usual.Edward Norton is supposed to be playing an extremely smart individual, yet his actions in this movie are anything but. He foolishly sets up a chain of events where if he had any intelligence at all, he would have foreseen that that chain of events would be sure to lead to his rape in prison. He also would easily have avoided prison in the first place if he had any intelligence. He also would have been able to prevent the bad ending his brother receives if he had any intelligence. Yet he sticks around the neighborhood like a moron at the end of the movie, which is what allows for his brother to be murdered.The ending of the movie is ridiculous, and actually ends up *reinforcing* the (incorrect) idea that Norton's character's original beliefs in this movie are accurate. The movie exists to say 'Racism is bad!' in big flashing NEON letters. However, the ending of this movie (perhaps inadvertently) completely destroys this message by implying that Norton's character was right to be a Nazi skinhead. The ending of the movie has a Black guy murdering Furlong's character for no reason. Furlong blew smoke in his face earlier in the movie, but that is not a reason to shoot someone dead over (maybe a beat down at the very most). It is not something someone would do in real life. Yet this movie (perhaps racistly) has a Black kid killing a White kid for no reason whatsoever, which lends (tragically!) undeserved credibility to idea that the Nazi beliefs are correct and Norton's character was wrong to abandon them. This movie can't even get it's own very basic message right.0/10.",1,27,66,19 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Better titles could have been: 'No story'; 'No Point'; 'No Ending'.
","No Country for Old Men is a very bad movie that is chockful of basic structural errors of storytelling & film-making, and common sense. But, hold on a minute. What I just said might be all wrong! An outmoded way of thinking. A viewpoint that simply does not have enough 'intelligence' to appreciate the deep brilliant art that *is* 'No Country'.It seems that these days if you make a movie that has no story, no point, and no ending --- that that is automatically a *masterpiece* that is worthy of universal critical and consumer acclaim, and a Best Picture Oscar. That in a nutshell, is *exactly* what No Country for Old Men is.Now that 'No Country' has paved the way for such 'brilliant innovations', I can't wait to see what other 'innovations' await films to come in the future. Maybe next in addition to masterpiece movies requiring there to be no story, no point, and no ending, they will also eventually further innovate by doing away with other things like actors and dialogue. Maybe mankind will eventually *evolve* to such a point of perfect enlightenment that films consisting entirely of slideshows of some kindergarten students' fingerpainting artwork will eventually be the recipient of Best Picture Oscar awards and universal acclaim.'No Country' has taken a lot of flack for having a 'controversial ending' --- but that is inaccurate phrasing. 'No Country ' has *no ending* at all. For it to have a 'controversial ending' carries the prerequisite that it first *has* an ending. It doesn't! 'No Country' is just a bunch of random scenes of a repressed homosexual, turned psychopath, who goes around shooting people with a weapon powered by a giant tank of compressed air. This random formula is even further randomized by not *bothering* to show many of his kills on-screen. Including the death of the main character, who is suddenly, inexplicably, shown as a corpse in the middle of the movie. Even though the movie had previously spent gratuitous amounts of screen-time showing him prepare for, evade, and engage in firefights with the psychopath. Yet no *zero* time is devoted to showing how he died. The randomness of showing trivial moments like the main character staring thoughtfully at a wall, and buying tent-poles from a camping store, are crafted with meticulous detail and given tons of screen-time. But the film's utter genius shines through *most of all* by not spending one second showing him die or struggle to survive in his final moments before he died. Just a random fade-in, and he's suddenly a corpse! The sheer *brilliance* of such artistic unconventional storytelling has never been seen in any film or book *ever* made before in the *history* of mankind. I wonder why? Why did it take until the year 2007 for man to finally reach this high watermark of storytelling utopia? Ah heck, I need to stop wondering, and be content to wallow in the fact that since I 'don't get it', I'm simply an idiot.The main character is an extremely banal hick so I had no emotional reaction whatsoever to him at any point in the movie, or to him magically fading-in as a corpse, but I'm sure the lack of any reason to care one iota about the main character is yet another of this film's amazing innovations. Layers upon layers, my friend! In several other cases, the movie makes it totally unclear if the psychopath killed his victim or not, because after trapping the victim, the scenes simply fades to black and then he is shown again outside the building later and the victims' fates are never revealed; they are never seen or mentioned in the movie again, as corpses or otherwise. One cannot assume he killed them, because in an early scene he spares a gas station attendant.'No Country' also innovates the art of film-making by making it's psychopath killer, 'the deepest film villain since Hannibal Lecter' (or, the universal acclaimists allege...and who wants to argue with *them*!). No Country's killer shows his compelling deepness by repeatedly shouting things like 'CALL IT!' after he flips a coin. In another scene, he further shows his deepness by making such deeply thought-provoking statements as: 'I won't tell you you can save yourself. You can't.' *Clearly*, this is Pulitzer Prize-worthy dialogue and one of the great cinematic villains of all-time. Thanks, universal acclaimists, for being honest about this and giving this character all the credit he so richly deserves! Maybe in the sequel he can play Blackjack or Poker to determine if he will shoot someone with his airgun or not? There I go again with my bad ideas, he's *already* *soooooooo freakin' unbelievably complex!!!* that to add a further level of complexity to him, like Blackjack-playing on top of coin-flipping, would be too much to even *try *to comprehend without bursting a gasket in one's brain wiring.Tommy Lee Jones plays a hick sheriff in this movie. He is a great actor, but he seems very bored in this role and it's like he's phoning in his performance. Perhaps he was disappointed when he read the script and realized the movie has no ending, and this made him not wanna put any energy or effort into the role. The other actors in No Country are all third-rate unknowns (other than Woody Harrelson who has a nonsensical, pointless cameo); maybe Tommy Lee was simply trying to dumb-down his acting down to their level. Whatever the case may be, it's definitely Tommy Lee Jones' worst performance ever. On second thought, I am probably wrong with everything I've just said in this paragraph. Really, Tommy Lee Jones' seemingly uninspired performance is probably just him tapping into the higher plane of existence upon which this whole enigmatic masterpiece of a movie so-good that normal human beings are barely fit to watch it, much less understand it, occupies.",1,201,335,11 March 2008
Event Horizon," Terrible movie that MIGHT have been entertaining, scary, and good, as a 10 minute short film.
","Event Horizon is a bad B-movie with a SciFi/horror mix, and it fails in every area it tries to explore.All the characters in Event Horizon have zero personality whatsoever. There is no reason to care about any of them.All the dialogue is terrible. It made all the characters be generic talking heads that only ever say the most necessary, obvious things, in the most mundane way possible, in addition to them having no personality.At least Laurence Fishburne had a strong screen intensity and performs great acting (as usual), which makes him interesting to watch for that reason alone. But none of the other characters even had that, so they were completely worthless. Sometimes bad movies can be elevated by great actors that make you care about their characters even when the movie has nothing else going for it. That ability is something an actor either has or doesn't have. Laurence Fishburne has that. Other than Laurence Fishburne, none of the actors in Event Horizon have that. Like Laurence Fishburne says in the classic gangster movie, 'Hoodlum': 'Either you get it, or you don't'. Fishburne is the only actor in Event Horizon who *gets it*. He made his screen-presence in Event Horizon compelling despite having very little to work with in terms of what his (badly) scripted lines are and the bad script in general.Event Horizon was extremely boring and barely scary at all. Most of the 'scares' come from cheesy gimmicks rather than from legitimate ways, like having a very loud crashing sound effect suddenly play when a severed hand floats into someone's space helmet.Event Horizon didn't really need to spend 5 minutes rehashing the tired old fold space/wormhole SciFi cliché that has been done ad nauseam over and over again for approximately the past 100 years. It is also very pompous the way this movie pretends it *invented* this concept, when it certainly did not.There are very, very few entertaining/interesting/scary minutes of screen-time are in Event Horizon. Maybe 5, at the very most. That leaves 87 minutes of boring, monotonous screen-time that is filled with nothing but pointless filler. Nothing really happens in this movie until the last 5 minutes, It does not take 92 minutes to say: 'This ship broke the laws of physics, went to Hell as a result, and brought back some scary delusions/supernatural phenomenon'. But Event Horizon tries to pad-out that 5 minutes worth of content into 92 minutes worth of content, and the result is the total disaster of a movie that is Event Horizon.I understand there is a concept called 'suspense', but for suspense to work there must *first* be characters worth caring about. Event Horizon doesn't have any, so claiming that all the boring filler (approximately 87 minutes of this movie's 92 minute screen-time) exists for the sake of suspense isn't going to cut it. The *only* way that Event Horizon works on any level whatsoever is as a sleep-inducing miracle cure for those who suffer from insomnia.Even *another* universally-panned (Event Horizon was also universally-panned) SciFi/horror movie with the same theme as Event Horizon, did the same theme much, much better. That movie is called 'Supernova' starring James Spader, from the year 2000. James Spader and everyone in the movie Supernova make you care about them via outstanding charisma and great acting. Event Horizon is a major step *down* from Supernova. Event Horizon is an *even poorer* rehash of what was a very poor movie in the first place. It is no surprise that Paul W.S. Anderson career would continue to consist of creating bad B-movie SciFi productions and video game movies. That is exactly what Event Horizon was. No better of a bad B-movie than any of the rest of his movies that came before and after, all of which have the same very low quality as Event Horizon.If Event Horizon was a 10 minute short film, it could have cut all the crap and had nothing but good, solid, scary, worthwhile entertainment in it. Instead of being that, Event Horizon is a terrible movie in every respect (other than Fishburne's excellent acting), with barely 5 minutes worth of of worthwhile entertainment in it.",1,3,10,10 March 2008
The Departed," The Departed is barely better than Mobsters with Christian Slater
","The Departed is barely better than 'Mobsters' with Christian Slater. For those of you who do not know what that is, it's a really mediocre/borderline crappy mafia movie from the 1990's.I absolutely love both Goodfellas and Casino. They are both 10/10, no question. Knowing The Departed was made by the same guy and has a lot of good press, I went in with high expectations of that same standard from The Departed. But instead of getting a Goodfellas/Casino quality standard, The Departed instead has a 'Mobsters with Christian Slater' (much, MUCH lower!) quality standard.I will concede that The Departed beats Mobsters in terms of acting talent. But that's where it ends. On every other level, the two movies are almost equal. Terrible characters, terrible script, terrible dialogue, terrible story, and no reason to care about any of the above. The Departed and Mobsters are completely on par with each other in these ways. At least Mobsters is better in one way though; Mobsters features some memorable scenes that are hilarious in cheesy way, whereas The Departed does not (maybe 5 seconds of Jack's tool, but that's it).I was honestly *shocked* that a Mobsters-quality movie has been made by Scorscese. What happened to his very high Goodfellas/Casino standards? Clearly, those standards have *departed* long before he made The Departed.Jack in The Departed has to be the stupidest Don in the history of mafia movies. Even stupider than the Dons from Mobsters. He had umpteen opportunities to realize that Leo was a rat, starting well-before he even employed Leo into his mafia circle. For him to ignore all those very clear, umpteen warning signs and just let Leo do whatever Leo wants despite that not making any sense whatsoever, shows that he's far too stupid of a Don to be worth caring about (as is the script). Plus doing everything himself for no reason, which even other characters in the movie are smart enough to warn him not to be so stupid about, just adds to the ludicrousity that a powerful Don could be so darn stupid. Besides all that, most of his dialogue was almost completely incoherent. I enjoyed Jack's acting style which was great as usual, but the stupidity of the character's actions/inactions and terrible dialogue makes it so even Jack's great acting can't save the character from being worthless.Here is a breakdown of the other 'characters' in The Departed: Matt & Leo - Generic pretty boys, with no character development at all, and bland generic dialogue throughout the whole movie. Leo did a very good acting job, but again, that does nothing to save the fact that his character had no reason to make him worth caring about. Is the reason to care about him 'technically' supposed to be; to care about him because he's pretty? Because that's about the only thing that the character has going for him. Not a good reason to care about him, if that is the technical reason one is supposed to.Shrink woman - Two-timing harlot. *Definitely* no reason to care about her at all. She adds nothing to the movie whatsoever. One of the most worthless main characters in the history of cinema.Mark Wahlberg was excellent and funny, but way under-used. The only interesting character in the movie, and the only interesting *thing* in the movie at all. But he doesn't have nearly enough screen-time to elevate the movie beyond a 'Mobsters with Christian Slater' level.The Departed is *easily* the worst Scorscese movie ever made, and one of the worst movies of the millennium. Mobsters with Christian Slater is worth maybe 5/10. The Departed is worth 5.5/10 at the very most.Putting a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in a movie does *not* make the movie into a masterpiece simply because it has a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in it. Although that *does* seem to be the popular belief about The Departed. That belief is wrong. And it sets a very bad precedent that the bar can be set as low as possible and still a movie will be seen as a 'masterpiece' by default *only* because it has a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in it.The Departed is a mediocre/borderline crappy movie that is almost exactly as bad as Mobsters with Christian Slater is. Christian Slater and the makers of Mobsters got robbed. They deserve Oscars for their work in Mobsters every bit as much as anyone involved with 'The Departed' does. That a shoddy movie like The Departed received so much critical and consumer acclaim is tragic.",4,5,10,18 February 2008
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Ripoffs, Stale Old Clichés, Repetition , Boredom and an Overlong Running-Time
","First of all it must be said that Saw II called, and it wants it's catchphrase back. Saw II made famous the catchphrase 'Oh yes, there will be blood!' as stated by the excellent actor Tobin Bell playing the amazing character Jigsaw in that movie. The title 'There Will Be Blood' is in my opinion quite obviously a ripoff of Saw II's catchphrase after Saw II popularized it. But the ripoffs don't end there. Not by a longshot.Daniel Day Lewis gives a magnificent performance as Daniel Plainview, an evil & insane oil tycoon from the early 1900's. The problem is, he also gave the *exact same* magnificent performance in the old Martin Scorscese movie, 'Gangs of New York' when he played Bill the Butcher. The *only* difference between Lewis' performance in these two movies is that he changed his accent, and his hairstyle is slightly different. These are minor differences. Other than that, the two performances and characters are completely identical. Daniel Day Lewis is just re-hashing here the same thing he's *already done* just as well in that older movie. His character even bludgeons another main character to death, off-screen, in both movies, in an almost identical way. Having said that, he gives great performances in both movies so he's interesting to watch due to his undeniable acting mastery. But there is nothing *original* about his performance in There Will Be Blood (TWBB). And great acting alone can't save a movie that has nothing else going for it.TWBB is 2 hours and 37 minutes long, but it doesn't need to be. Most of the movie spends gratuitous amounts of screen-time showing repetitive shots over and over again. Showing lots of CGI fire and black smoke for 10 minutes in a row, on more than one occasion. Shots which drag on and on needlessly for several minutes long-after the audience has already gotten the point of the scene. The content of TWBB could *easily* fit into 1 hour and 10 minutes or less.For some very bizarre reason, TWBB *thinks* it's a horror movie. It is constantly blaring cheesy 'scary horror movie music' over every scene. Horror music that in my opinion rips off the theme from the Hitchcock movie 'Psycho' as well as a host of other horror movies over the last 50 years. This is only speculation, but my guess is that perhaps they started with the title of the movie first, and since it was ripped off from a horror movie, decided that they might as well go right ahead and make TWBB *into* a horror movie. Then made the cheesy horror movie music score before doing anything else. But somewhere down the line some smart person realized that they weren't supposed to be making a horror movie and they stopped trying to, yet decided to save some money by using the cheesy horror movie score anyways.One of the main characters in this movie is a fraudster 'faith healer' Priest who doesn't believe what he preaches. This is a stale old cliché that has literally been done *thousands* of times in movies and television ever since they first existed. The only difference in TWBB's take on this is that there is no balanced perspective. TWBB *only* presents an anti-God, atheist point of view. Whereas other productions that have explored the fraudster faith healer theme have done it in a classy way that shows that while faith healers are indeed bad, not all Priests are bad, and bashing God or religion is not cool. For an example of a balanced and much better-done take on the same thing, try watching the television episode 'The Faith Healer' from Little House on the Prairie which was produced in 1979.No doubt one of the main reasons TWBB gets so much undeserved acclaim is because it bashes Christianity and has the Priest in the movie saying 'God is a superstition'. In Hollywood, it is very fashionable to bash Christianity and religion in general. Doing so is almost a guaranteed way to garner critical acclaim. However, for those who are not atheists, this is derogatory and an unethical thing to be doing in movies. Just because not everyone is religious - which is fine - it isn't an excuse to trample on the beliefs of those who are. Everyone is *supposed to* be respected, but this movie doesn't respect anyone other than the evil psychopath oil tycoon character who also happens to be an atheist.The plot of the movie is virtually non-existent. The entirety of the plot boils down to Daniel swindling some communities out of their land so he can dig oil wells and/or build pipelines in it, and murdering some people along the way. This too, is a stale old cliché that has been done - and done-better - thousands of times before.The dialogue is banal. In one case ripping off 70's Blaxploitation flicks. TWBB has a line in it, 'I'm your brother from another mother.' In another case it rips off the Kelis song 'Milkshake' with the line ''I drink your milkshake. I drink it up.' It sounds like I'm making that up, but I'm not --- both of those lines are in the movie, verbatim. It is kind of funny that they lift lines from Black culture, yet there are only White people in this movie. Maybe it's their small way of not being accused of being a racist movie? In any case, the banal dialogue doesn't work on any level. Another example of verbatim banal dialogue from this movie: 'You are a stupid man.' TWBB is a waste of almost 3 hours. You'd do much better to watch the originator of it's title instead, Saw II. At least Saw II *knows* it's a horror movie and has some interesting dialogue and plot in it. Much moreso than TWBB does.",1,12,27,2 April 2008
