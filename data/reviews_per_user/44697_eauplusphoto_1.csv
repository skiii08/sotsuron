The Monuments Men," big goof
","The flag at the end of the movie (the one they left for the Russians) had 50 stars. In 1945 there were only 48. I didn't really think this movie needed to be made at all. There are so many other, more poignant things about the second world war that could be told, or at the minimum rolled into the story line of the movie. The idea (seemingly over and over) that lives were being lost and yet these clowns were looking for art, just made the whole story line uninteresting to me. Was it worth it? Of course, but the sheer numbers of innocents killed during that conflict - to me, makes the art secondary. OK... the drums of gold nuggets made the movie for me.",6,0,0,12 September 2014
