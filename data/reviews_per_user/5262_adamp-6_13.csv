Requiem for a Dream," I watched in open-mouthed amazement. Or something like that.
","This was one of those movies that was so surrounded in controversy over its rating that I initially avoided it.  But finally, curiosity got the best of me and I checked it out.  Boy, am I glad I did.Because as brutal as it is, 'Requiem for a Dream' is still a masterpiece of filmmaking.  Yes, it is frank with its subject matter, in the kind of way that makes critics use words like 'honest' and 'unblinking'.  And that frankness adds to the impact of the overall film.  When you consider the muck these characters drag themselves through in order to quell their own appetites -- that's powerful stuff.But even more powerful is the style in which the story is told.  It's a unique and often objective representation of the lifestyle portrayed, and it is nothing short of masterful.  I've now seen this movie 3 times in 5 days, and I can honestly say I'm blown away.Man, am I glad I never did drugs.",10,0,1,22 January 2002
The Sound of Music," What to say, what to say...
","I hadn't seen 'The Sound of Music' in years, but my wife wanted to watch it the other night, so we threw it on.  I'd forgotten how good it is.First, I hold a negative bias toward most musicals.  Yes, there are exceptions ('Moulin Rouge', 'Beauty & the Beast' for example), but most of the time I just get annoyed when the filmmakers stop the story for a little song-and-dance routine, then crank it back up when the musical number's over.My recollection of 'The Sound of Music' was simply of the songs -- but I'd completely forgotten how well the songs work in the narrative.  Instead of halting the flow of the story, they actually help carry it along.  A pleasant surprise.And I'd forgotten, too, how well the film steers clear of syrupy cornball territory -- something that could've easily mired it, especially when you consider the time period in which it was made.  I appreciated the honesty of it, and the lack of melodrama and overacting you so often find in the films of yesteryear.The only drawback -- man, I can't stand it when Liesl goes 'wheeeeee!' once Rolf runs out of the little gazebo after he's stolen a kiss from her.  The punk.",9,5,14,11 February 2002
Fight Club," something I've noticed people aren't discussing.
","A lot of words have been spoken/ written/ transmitted about 'Fight Club' and its messages about men who haven't entirely grown up and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, but I haven't seen (yet) anyone tackle this movie from a religious standpoint.First, let me say 'Fight Club' is a brilliant movie, and I considered it the best movie of 1999 (I'm sure that means just tons to everyone).  But here's why the movie spoke to me -- it seems to me that the filmmakers, whether consciously or not, are saying that people who grow up with no moral or spiritual compass to guide them will eventually be morally and spiritually bankrupt.Tyler even says this in one of the scenes (something along the lines of 'our fathers are our role models for God.  And if they left us, what does that say about God?').  Pow.  Tyler believes God's no longer in the picture, so he can do whatever the heck he wants.  Tyler represents people who've grown up with no belief in God or any sort of values system that He handed down, and that lack of belief is ultimately what leads to his extreme behavior.  But the statement of the movie is that people like Tyler are to be pitied, not revered.",10,0,1,11 February 2002
Memento," watch it early so you can see something else afterward.
","I saw 'Memento' in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!  I finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched 'Election' to cleanse my palate.  Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating 'Memento' AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading 'Memento Mori', the short story upon which the movie is 'based' helped, too.'Memento' is nothing short of a phenomenon.  And a brilliant one at that.",10,118,142,31 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," So good I quenched my desire for the urinal.
","Shortly before walking into the theater to see this movie, my friend bought me a medium drink.  And even though I'd emptied my bladder before said purchase and sipped sparingly from said drink, I found myself in desperate need of the restroom just as the hobbits reached Rivendell.But I endured.So absorbed in the story was I that I tapped my feet, squinched my legs, and performed all other manners of contortions to keep from wetting myself so that I could take in every second of cinematic bliss that unfolded on the screen before me.So take heed -- drink nothing for several days before going to see this movie.  Or take a bedpan with you.",9,0,0,27 December 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Was that Paul Walker or Keanu Reeves?
","Boy, Paul Walker sounds JUST LIKE Keanu Reeves.  I kept thinking of 'Point Break' the whole time I watched this movie, expecting Detective Brian to ask his superiors 'So you're saying the ex-presidents are surfers?'I distinctly remember seeing the trailer for this movie in front of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and for the first few seconds after seeing Vin Diesel, I was excited about it, but by the end of the trailer, I was a little worried.  So I finally picked this one up at the ol' rental store on DVD and gave it a whirl.Not bad.  Not good, but not bad. Vin Diesel gives a good performance, and I guess you could say Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez do, too, given their limited roles.  But Paul Walker -- what are casting directors thinking when he walks in to audition?  This guy is bad -- plain bad -- and he brings the movie down, down, down.But silly me, talking about the performances of the actors, when this movie is plainly about the performances of the vehicles.  And perform they do. All the driving stuff is pretty fun in a campy sort of way; I especially like the way the different cars tend to drive in some sort of formation, as if they were the Blue Angels or something.  All the racing parts balance against Paul Walker's terrible delivery of his lines to bring the movie up to an acceptable level.",5,0,1,16 January 2002
Pearl Harbor," This movie is bipolar.
","I'm amazed that a film could be so simultaneously good and bad.  I gave it a 4 on the ol' IMDb vote-a-meter thing, but it would've been a 1 had the actual Pearl Harbor attack not been so well done.Everyone's right -- the attack's great, everything else bites.  Overacted, manipulative filmmaking.Although, once Alec Baldwin shows up in the last hour, the movie shifts into so-bad-it's-good territory.  Baldwin adopts a gruff voice that kept reminding me of Kurt Russell's Snake in 'Escape from LA'.  I kept waiting for Steve Buscemi to show up.And oh, is there some magical dialogue.  Simply magical.  I just wish they would've used the phrase 'Jap suckers' a little more.  You know, to really get the point across.But the attack sequence is pretty breathtaking.  I found myself being quite moved at the harsh reality of it, and I gained even more respect for those who actually experienced Pearl Harbor.  Too bad they're all paid tribute by such a bad film.I wish I would've taken everyone's advice with this DVD -- fast-forward to the Pearl Harbor attack, then ejected the disc as soon as that's over.",4,4,6,27 December 2001
Tigerland," I just wish they wouldn't've philosophized so darn much.
","My neighbor just got a DVD player for Christmas, and already he has more DVDs than I do.  Anyway, I was at his house the other day flipping through his selections when I saw he had 'Tigerland'.  I pointed it out.'Yeah, I haven't seen that one yet,' he says, 'I just picked it up because I was at Tigerland back when I went to Vietnam.'  He told me some stories about it, so it piqued my interest in the film.From what I can tell, based on my neighbor's stories, 'Tigerland' is a pretty accurate depiction of what went on in that training ground.  And while the film is sticking with the story, it's pretty good.
But then there are all these side trails in which Bozz and Paxton discuss war philosophy and how it's so wrong and blah blah blah.  All they needed was a pulpit and a gospel choir to *really* get their point across.These tangential asides are the only thing bogging the movie down and preventing it from becoming a really good film.  Cinematically, it packs a visual punch, although the handheld camera got to be a bit much.Oh, and if you really, really, *really* like to listen to men swear in ways you've never dreamed, throw on 'Tigerland' for a real treat.",7,0,0,6 February 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Wow.
","I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long, long time.  Once you get past the hyperkinetic opening bits, the movie settles down into what can only be described as true creative genius.  From the music to the acting to the stunning art direction, Moulin Rouge is an experience.This is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year, and while I was watching it two things came to mind: 1) 'I can't wait to see this again' and 2) 'I can't wait for this to come out on DVD'.If you get the chance, see it.  You shan't be disappointed.",10,0,1,26 October 2001
The Red Violin," It's hard to invest emotion when the main character is a violin.
","(this comment contains possible spoilers; read at your own risk)This is one of those films I'd heard a lot of good buzz about, both while it was in theatres and when it came out on video.  I've picked it up several times at the rental store, then subsequently put it back to get something else.  But finally, the time had come for me to view 'The Red Violin'.And it's pretty good.  More intriguing from the idea aspect than from the actual execution of the film.  I like the idea of following this violin throughout the ages and seeing what hands it touches on its way to the auction block, but I didn't really care for any of the people who got the darn thing.  The Austrian music teacher?  He's a jerk.  The long-haired English virtuoso? A jerk on a much grander scale.  Those gypsies?  All really good violin players, but not on screen long enough to care.  The Chinese girl?  She was the most sympathetic of the characters, but by that point of the movie I was really hoping it would wrap up soon.Also, it didn't help that I figured out the 'secret' of the red violin at the very beginning of the movie.But I appreciate the scope of the film, and the style with which its told. It's still a good film, but completely unengaging emotionally.  Probably it's suffering from the 'Batman' syndrome, in which it was hyped so much to me that when I actually saw the movie, there was no way it could live up to my expectations.",8,1,1,21 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Am I missing something?
","Oh, the glorious reviews that have gushed forth for 'A Beautiful Mind'.  The IMDb user comments section is brimming with praise; people are calling this the best movie of the year.  Heck, it even won the Golden Globe for Outstanding Dramatic Motion Picture.Have these people seen 'Memento'?  Or 'Moulin Rouge'?  Or 'The Royal Tenenbaums'?  Why is 'A Beautiful Mind', a fairly standard film, receiving all these accolades?Unfortunately, I have the feeling that my thoughts on 'A Beautiful Mind' are probably skewed from all the wonderful press and praise it received before I viewed it (sadly, the same thing happened with 'Gladiator').  I was expecting some elegant masterpiece, but instead got a movie that, while it features good acting, is still a slave to Hollywood convention.(insert spoilers warning here)Okay, so we start off with John Nash at Princeton, and we have all the classic high school/ college elements -- the socially outcast main character, the bully with the chip on his shoulder who's got it in for the main character, the wisecracking-yet-all-knowing roommate, the stern authority figure, the problem that can't be solved but suddenly is given a solution thanks to an unrelated real world situation, etc.  And it just went on from there.  More convention on top of convention.A lot of critics are praising this movie for being a good big budget film that came from a major studio.  Since when do we grade possible Oscar contenders on a curve?  Formula is formula, regardless of who's selling it. It's sad, too, because this could've been one of those 'small treasures' kinds of movies, had the hype machine not gotten so squarely behind it.",6,0,1,4 February 2002
Amélie," C'est fantastique.
","Man, what a great movie.  Charming, spunky, clever, innovative -- all adjectives that come immediately to mind.That's about all I can think to say about it.  It's a fun time, and I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release so my wife can see it.",9,0,1,27 December 2001
Cinderella," I guess Disney really, really, REALLY needs money.
","We watched this on 'The Wonderful World of Disney' on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at 'the Mouse' than usual.  Since this movie only runs 74 minutes, and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time, they had, and I'm not making this up, commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes.  And during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the guise of a 'TV show' hosted by the oh-so-annoying Kelly Rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of 'Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True'.Again and again, break after break, Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the loyal viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie.Anyway, all this commercialism and cash-register-ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of 'Cinderella', because by the time the commercials were over, I had forgotten where the story had left off.But of course, the original 'Cinderella' still maintains its magic, and the story is still a good one, though we've all seen it countless times.  It's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow-up.",8,4,10,4 March 2002
