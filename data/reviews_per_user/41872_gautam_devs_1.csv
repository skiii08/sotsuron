Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," For Jacky's fans only.
","This time even Cap. Jack Sparrow couldn't save the sinking ship. This movie is just for hardcore fans of Johnny Depp and his mesmerizing avatar as Cap. Jack Sparrow. As long as he is on the screen everything is good otherwise its all boredom. But even he has nothing much to play with this fourth time around though he is the center of the story. What I missed dearly was his ROYAL ENTRY that he had made in all the previous three outings. One thing everyone has said about this movie that this shortest movie in the series feels the longest is also true. They have dragged the story (for me there was no story they just linked some events after events). A lot of new characters are introduced apart from bringing back the old friend-foe-ally Cap. Hector Barbossa and Gibbs. Both are in their usual elements but it hurts to see the lead villain of 'the curse of the black pearl' in nothing kind of role. Penelope Cruz as Angelica, Sparrow's ex, looks stunning but I never found that chemistry between them. The chemistry between Jack and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) had much more spark than this one. Ian McShane as Blackbeard doesn't create the effect that Geoffrey Rush had created with Barbossa in the first one and Bill Nighy in the later two installments. The action choreography is wasted as the most scenes are too dark. Rest like cinematography, visual effects, special effects, BG score are as usual. And in direction Rob Marshall has given nothing new to the movie. To be fair the matter provided was not of that quality for any director. Its amazing that when I watched it, I didn't find it that bad but as I m writing all this I realize that I haven't written anything good about it. Whatever money this movie makes (sure it will make a lot) and the last two have made is only due to Johnny Depp. So final words: 'If you are a die-hard fan of the amazing CAP. JACK SPARROW like me then you are going to watch it anyways but if u r not then wait for the DVD mate!'Savvvvyyyyyyy ???",6,2,4,23 May 2011
