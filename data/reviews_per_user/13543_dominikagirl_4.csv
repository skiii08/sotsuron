Mission: Impossible III," This movie gives you reason to cheer for the bad guys
","I've seen swiss cheese with less plot holes than this story. Um, can anyone tell me what happens between the moment that 'Ethan' lands on the building that houses the rabbit's foot and then suddenly appears crashing through a window??? I'm pretty sure they had the budget - OK, no there is NO QUESTION they had the budget.. so why did we avoid this sequence which would have (in my eyes) been a very intriguing super-heroic example of why Ethan is a demigod (although at this point, if you're going to put Tom Cruise in it, you might as well put aliens in as well as part of the back up team).. and yet, no sequence, just some random phone conversation. This dull action non-action movie (and I'm a girl who loves 5th Element and the Transporter) was heavy on the emotional 'choosing marriage' scenes - there were people laughing out loud during Tom's crocodile tears scene. I mean, it felt like a personal ad about why he's choosing to settle down in a rustic Scientologist family life (hah!). The best thing about this movie was cool chick from KISS KISS BANG BANG (who, other than Lawrence with his awesome scowl, was the best actor in this with a stupid role written by someone who obviously thinks that nurses are people who don't have access to the internet and wouldn't notice their husbands coming home scarred and messed up). The 'big action sequence' was so horribly shot that (and nonsensical) that there was little scope of the bridge, no explanation why Tom was the only one able to run around and even less rationale in HOW they failed to notice and respond to the set up. Did action heroes need to be portrayed as stupid people, is that it? And if I wanted to see a not-so-cleverly disguised ad for why short actors who subscribe to cult theory are choosing to show off their pro-marital (with a way younger woman which is suspect to begin with), I'd go into a Dianetics center! Geez, what's next? Battlefield Earth part 2 by Tom?",1,17,30,14 May 2006
Up," Magical, Reverent, Inspiring -share with everyone
","It SOUNDS difficult: an septo or octogenerian, an overweight kid and the plight of nostalgia in an ever-changing world... and yet, from the moment the tears dry after the montage of how the main character loses his wife, this film is nothing short of a revelation. It speaks with so many messages I agree with.. and in such a non message-driven way: this is like hearing a story a true hero, while yourself finding more than one way to connect with their plight. There is a message to feel good sharing with your parents; adventure NEVER ever stops, and loving someone (your chosen beloved for life) is about wishing that their adventure is never ending... There are things we miss out on automating our lives... and reaching too hard for the future or clinging to needily to the past - both things can prevent us from living the moment. Our environment is precious... never forget that. Dogs are awesome.. oh wait, I already knew that:o)I felt like this movie would speak to all generations - an encouragement to reach beyond daily roles, tasks, expectations and allow oneself to seek out and aspire for life-altering moments. We live on an amazing planet surrounded by amazing organisms (human and other) and the joy, the essence and the beauty of life is to remember the discovery of these marvels is open to any age, race, species:O) and time in history. I cannot recommend this movie enough.. touching, ingenious and most of all, it makes you get off the seat you watched it on and start googling the nearest adventures to you to take up for the next weekend.",10,0,0,26 November 2009
Inside Man," Chaiya Chaiya the biggest event of this film
","OK, I LOVE the actors, like the director.. but there are HOLES in this story bigger than Mr. Ed's nostrils. As in, how did Clive Owen's character know about the bank founder being involved with the Nazis? The whole purpose (it seems) of Jodie Foster's character was to indicate how secretive this information was.. so how did Clive have access to it? How come the guy who played the mayor swore like a 5 year old child knowing he was going to get in trouble for it later? (horrible scene that one he calls her the C-word). I had 'where's my fast forward button' on this more than 5 times which means the pacing was really off - Chaiya Chaiya got me all pumped but then for some reason because of the obvious ties to India, I kept expecting the security guard with the turban to have some pivotal brain child of the whole thing revelation? Nope. Just a killer song in the wrong movie. The rest of the score was like... I can't even remember it. If you ask me a week from now about this film, I'll start singing that awesome song but the plot was BLAH. I like a good humanitarian 'go kick ass on the evil Nazi-dealing old guy' theme as much as anybody but really... how about a smart plot?",5,1,5,2 April 2006
V for Vendetta," See this film and become a part of history; hands down AWESOME
","They have cleansed themselves of 'serial drivel that became Matrix' finally. This film is stupendous and phenomenal.. and being in the audience, you get that breath-taking feeling that someday in the future, the succeeding generations will say 'V for Vendetta re-inspired the public faith in mass movement and demonstration' and this pro-activism ended a passive streak that has gone on for..... how long? I know my parents talk about demonstrating in the name of peace in the 70s etc.. but when is the last time there was a MASS global movement on account of anything? I feel like a thought-wave passed through the people around me in the audience and it was a really good feeling. In a time when it's obvious someone-whose-name-is-synonymous-with-shrubbery needs to step down from a leadership position and the situation in Iraq is conjuring way too many comparisons to Vietnam from the older (and wiser) people around us... I think this is one of the most powerful films of its time. Go see it.Take the message home with you.",10,1,3,2 April 2006
