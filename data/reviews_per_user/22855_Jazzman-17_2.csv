The Blair Witch Project," Defines Fear
",Let me pose a question. What is more fearful? A noise in the dark or the thing that actually makes the noise? Usually the noise alone. I'm not too scared when i'm in my downstairs and i found out that the noise was really just one of my two birds munching some birdseed.This movie really digs deep into fear.  Most movies nowadays can't seem to scare the audience without shock music and 3000 gallons of fake blood.  This movie far surpasses others in the scaring department even though it has aprroxamtely 1/1000 the budget.  I watched this movie two days ago and the final scene still gives me chills. This movie though is definately not for the MTV generation of people who need an explosion or bloody corpse every minute(hey i'm saying that and i'm a teenager)The only real flaw in this movie is that we cannot really beleive that they would continue to film with all the paranoia in their minds by the end of the film.  This movie though really builds and the fear is not attained by jumping out of your seats. It's the sense of dread when you come home and wonder what that bump in the night was...,10,1,2,4 August 1999

","This movie was...unique.  I liked the movie in the artistic sense and i applauded the movie...yet i shut it off 3/4 of the way through. Why?  I don't know exactly.  It was quite disturbing, really absorbing us into madness/genius.  Yet it was all so crazy and disturbing that i thought i couldn't watch any more.  Seeing a film like this such as 2001 (gave me the same feeling)  is more intellectual then seeing a good drama. Rent it, and judge for yourself.  Quite memorable, but i wouldn't watch it twice.
