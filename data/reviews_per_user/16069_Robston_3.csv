Marie Antoinette," A long long movie
","Marie Antoinette looks lovely, the music is nostalgic (if you remember the 80's) and the performances from the actors are fine. So why doesn't the movie work? Sofia Coppola takes us into the closeted world of Versailles where people gossip, eat fine food, wear lots of nice clothes and are generally oblivious to any national political activity. And that's about it. If Coppola's intention was to make us feel as if we were in Versailles i.e the routine, the royal protocols, the slow pace of life, then she succeeded. But it makes for a very dull movie indeed. How many times can you show Marie Antoinette choose a new pair of shoes, or a new dress, or the number of times she failed to get her husband interested in making babies! At one point I thought the film was going to last as long as it took Marie Antoinette to conceive her first child (7 years into her marriage). Then in the space of ten minutes the revolution is here and the film is over, no epilogue, no exploration of her time in jail, no head losing.If the purpose of Coppola's film was to show how insulated the people staying at Versailles were, and Marie Antoinette in particular, then she has achieved this. Unfortunately the slow pace of the film coupled with the lack of any emotional involvement with the characters means you will be shouting Vive la Revolution after only an hour.",4,3,6,7 November 2006
Pirate Radio," A missed opportunity
","I was hoping that a movie celebrating pirate radio, written by Richard Curtis and with a host of stars would be a festival of fun, and to a certain degree it is. However the quality on board this boat feels like the leftovers from other Curtis movies as this is clearly his poorest effort yet.The plot, which is incredibly thin, involves an uptight government minister (Kenneth Branagh) who is instructed to remove the radio station from the airwaves, meanwhile the station is merrily going on about its business having a lovely time partying along with having various guests on board from the mainland.But here's the problem, the government vrs pirate radio plot never gets fleshed out and what's left is just a series of self contained sketches that keep the movie ticking over until the big finish. Branagh is in no more than half a dozen scenes which appear at regular intervals in what seems an attempt by the director to say 'hey folks, if you've forgotten, he's the bad guy!'. The scenes on board are all too similar and get a bit tiresome because once you've seen all the DJ's do their thing into the mike, have a sexual encounter then have a bit of a dance to some music why bother doing almost exactly the same again for another hour.The music is obviously from the period but is used so liberally, and by that I mean a new song at the start of nearly every scene, that it loses any emotion that it may be trying to help convey. You get a bit punch drunk. For UK readers - think of an episode of Heartbeat then times by 10, you'll know what I mean.Performances are OK but nobody really stands out, the script is pretty flat and although there were quite a few people giggling around me at the cinema there were no real laugh out loud moments.If the script had been tighter, the movie 30 minutes shorter, and a more complete plot been in place then it may have been a nice little movie, however.....",4,16,39,1 April 2009
Blade Runner," A truly gorgeous final cut
","It is a wonderful thing to take a old movie and, with the help of modern film processing, give it a new lease of life, and Blade Runner is the latest film to have such a makeover. Its all very well having fond memories of the first time you saw a movie - grubby cinema, crackly sound, but to see an old favourite after it has been cleaned up, the colour and sound improved, and if you're lucky be transferred to digital is fantastic, and in the case of Blade Runner a rare treat.The film looks gorgeous, from the imposing Tyrell building to the sharp beams of lights from the advertising ships that float in and out of the LA 2019 skyline, the improved colour and excellent digital transfer really does make the film look as if it was shot yesterday. Having only seen the film on TV or DVD the chance to watch it in its full glory was something I'll treasure for a long time.It's only on in the UK for a week, and only at a few independent cinemas so catch it before it disappears. Failing that buy the forthcoming DVD and watch it on the biggest TV you have!",9,1,2,23 November 2007
