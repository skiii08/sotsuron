Source Code," Professionally made but by far not so good as 'Moon'
","It was a well-made movie, it entertained me for a while. The acting was very good but .......The story was totally unbelievable and why should it have an happy end ? Why have American movies a happy end, even if it ruins the whole story ? They even made a happy end to the 'Little mermaid' I hoped to watch a movie that was as good as 'Moon' from the same director. The story of that movie was much better and convincing. I don't regret to much that I saw this movie but I hope that the next movie of Duncan will be more a 'real' story. I know that I have forgotten this film tomorrow",Null,0,1,18 July 2011
Black Book," beautifully made, but some scenes are overdone
","I am a Paul Verhoeven fan. I know he likes big effects sometimes. But in this movie the aim is in the first place realism. Carice and Halina played and were beautiful. I hesitated to give this movie an 8, but I disliked the scene with Theo Maessen, Marcel Musters and a crowd of carnivals people. (why suddenly throw a pile of well-known actors in one scene ?). The scene ( copied from the Brian DE Palma movie 'Carrie' ) was totally unbelievable, misplaced and overdone. The misbehaving people were punished and discharged immediately by a Canadian officer that walked in exactly at the right moment. Is this for the American market ? All the bad people were punished. The last scene in the Kibboets was also unbelievable. As far as i know there never has been attacked a kibbutz. Nevertheless I liked the film but was not really touched by it.",7,8,13,15 October 2006
Avatar," Poor story, to much effects, fun for war-game lovers
","First of all, I did not regret to have seen this movie. I loved the colors and visual effects. But it is all too much. It lacks any subtlety. In every corner of the movie there are effects. It gives me the same feeling as the Starwar movies. It is all too much a computer game, no rest no time to breath. I think it is beautiful in the light of the zap-culture. The only thing that grabbed me were the visual effects. But one and a half hour should have been enough for me. I can imagine that for instance that the movies Solaris , I am legend, 2001 a space odyssey, planet of the apes in 3D have more effect to me. They contain a story-line and some mystery",7,3,5,17 February 2010
Moon," Beautiful, full of humor, top science fiction
","This is an example of how a science fiction film should be made. The story is believable, the character(s?) are played very well. I like this kind of SF-movies. It has special effects where it is needed and it doesn't look like a computer game (like Star Wars and so on) The special effects were perfect, the scenery was very stylish. The humor was top (The tabletop tennis game !) I also saw 'Source code' of the same director. That was very well made too, but it lacked the cleverness of 'Moon', that story was totally unbelievable. I think that for this director a big budget is not a guarantee for a good movie. So I hope Duncan gets a decent script (like Moon) for the next one.",9,3,10,18 July 2011
