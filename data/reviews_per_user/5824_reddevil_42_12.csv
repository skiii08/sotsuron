Requiem for a Dream," A trippy experience
","Requiem for a Dream serves up a trippy experience for the viewers. The use of rapid cuts was impressive and kept me captivated. It is a movie meant to shock in order to get its point through. Addiction in different forms is explored through parallel story lines of the main characters. Through their individual narratives, one can experience their fears, their angst and their pain. The cinematography is excellent in capturing the rather intense thoughts of the characters as they face the horrors of their addiction. But the most remarkable aspect of the movie was the soundtrack and how perfectly fitting it was. It kept me at the edge of my seat, heavily engrossed in the movie. The soundtrack reflected an array of emotions as the characters suffer from pangs of distress and abjectly surrender to their addictions.",10,0,1,14 March 2013
Chinatown," Well knit thriller
","Blame it on the characters that Nicholson played in the Shining and One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest or the fact that I had seen Shutter Island some time back, I had made up my mind that the whole movie was a setup designed to keep Gittes from going crazy. Many characters felt out of their minds and peculiar. The reference to the curse of Chinatown made me think that the whole thing had happened once before. When I realized at the end that it wasn't the case, I started thinking of the movie as a whole. I felt the movie was very neatly put together with bits and pieces of the puzzle being shared with the viewer as the plot thickens and goes deep. I did feel that the movie invoked the Deus Ex Machina some time towards the end when the plot had become too full of irrelevant details. The character of Mrs.Mullway is intriguing and lends the story an unpredictable touch that it needs every now and then. Jack Nicholson has put in a sterling performance that holds the movie together and keeps the viewer captivated. It would have been bloody brilliant though had the whole thing been a setup. Sigh.",7,0,1,14 March 2013
Oldboy," Effusion of pure emotion
","Oldboy is a Korean flick, part of the 'Revenge' trilogy by Chan-wook Park. The movie is about Oh Daesu, who is mysteriously abducted on the eve of his daughter's birthday and kept in detention for fifteen years by someone unbeknown to him. He finds himself in a small room, with a television and no means of escape. He is served food through a slot in the door and put to sleep by introducing various gases through the air shaft. While he is kept captive, he hears of his wife's murder, with which he has been charged. The movie reflects the internal struggle of Daesu in coming to terms with the dire situation he finds himself in. The fifteen years fill him up with relentless hatred for his mystery captor and an unquenchable thirst for revenge. When released, he sets out to find out who was behind all this and why he was subjected to imprisonment for so long. He befriends a young girl who's a cook at a diner and seeks help of his best friend from fifteen years back in order to unlock this mystery. He finds out that his daughter was adopted while he was away and is currently in Stockholm. Very soon, his captor does reveal himself. Still, Daesu finds himself unable to kill him without finding out what the reason behind his torture. It is this pursuit of putting the pieces together that drives the rest of the movie as clues to the mystery present themselves one after the another.Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu have both put in brilliant performances. The movie finds its strength in Choi's portrayal of the strong emotions that drive his actions. From a state of being despairingly lost and demented, he is driven by the pure emotion of revenge and becomes obsessed in his pursuit. All that is wonderfully captured in one of the scenes, in which Daesu fights a mob of crooks by himself, with a knife stabbed on his back.The plot keeps the viewer engaged and eager to find out what happens next. Interestingly, the director also delves into the psyche of his characters with the aid of some surrealist representation at times. I was slightly disappointed with the crowning revelation and felt it wasn't as convincing but I did find the absence of complication agreeable. Instead of leading the viewer into deeper layers of interwoven story lines in order to justify the strong tone of the movie, a simpler and an authentic rationale has been chosen.While I expected a more intense conclusion to the movie, the uncertain ending adds to the quality of the movie and does justice to it. Overall, it is the undiluted and pure portrayal of the strongest human emotions make the movie what it is.",8,2,7,14 March 2013
The Prestige," Prepare to be amazed
","Christopher Nolan certainly knows how to make thrilling dramas with loads of interwoven plot points amalgamating into an inextricable storyline. In a way, the movie was one act of magic itself comprising of a pledge, a turn and the prestige of its own. The final voice over of the movie indeed leaves the viewer smiling because he does not want to give too much thought to the intricacies of the plot and wants to be fooled. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were both great in their portrayal of a spiteful relationship between two magicians,comprising of continuing acts of one-upmanship and revenge. Michael Caine does what he does best. He acts as the viewer's guide to the movie, moving the plot along and presenting the lesser known facts that lie below the surface. Scarlett Johansson looks oh so desirable in the movie showcasing her grace and her voluptuous figure as an assistant to the magicians who unknowingly gets involved in an unpleasant tussle between the two. The inclusion of the AC vs DC argument between Tesla and Edison is something that the science lovers would relish. Both Andy Serkis and David Bowie act as rather mysterious caretakers of the science side of the movie and indulge into it only as per requirement of the plot. In summary, when people go out for a movie, they wish to be enthralled, to be shocked and to be entertained during those two hours and The Prestige (in general, all of Nolan's works) serves them all of this and more.",9,0,1,14 March 2013
Apocalypse Now," A Psychedelic Painting
","Apocalypse Now was definitely a lot different from what I was expecting from it. I had expected a war movie, with loads of blasts adorning it. Some sort of a battle that would eventually lead to the apocalypse or even the onset of a new species or some sort of an alien race. Obviously, that was not to be but thankfully, I was not disappointed with the movie. Some things that struck me deeply were the use of 'The End' by the doors, Marlon Brando's short yet impactful performance and a genuine portrayal of the emotions associated with the war, most notably by Kurtz's 'The horror, the horror'.The build up till the part when their boat enters Kurtz's territory is brilliant. That is followed by some scenes involving the locals that are quite thrilling. Their depiction as them being aghast, dazed and in a state of trance was creepy at times. The end of the movie with the Doors song and the two concurrent slaughters is also quite impactful. In between are spread the usual Vietnam war content that one sees in all the movies. Noobs being sent to Vietnam and not knowing what they're doing there, unnecessary deaths in the process, Locals being killed for no reason but to assert military authority over some specific part. What 'The Deer Hunter' explored, Apocalypse Now went deeper and presented it more as a psychedelic experience. Use of music in the movie is a distinguishing feature: The End, Ride of the Valkyries, Satisfaction all used quite effectively.",10,0,1,14 March 2013
The Intouchables," What a pleasant surprise
","I think that it is wise to not expect much from movies or know a great deal about them before watching them. I did not expect this movie to be great but it was. I usually like movies where the characters express themselves fully and are genuine. The two leads are men which makes it a 'Bro' affair. Omar Sy has put in a strong performance. The movie was a pleasure to watch, moved along steadily addressing the core issue with care yet in a manner that is lighthearted and cheerful. The core issue here being that of a life a quadriplegic lives.From someone who is a lively and an energetic individual, one becomes confined to a wheelchair and with a prospect of never being able to feel the way that he did before. A very scary prospect indeed. The last thing a person would probably want in such a scenario is the notion of excessive pity from everyone else. The movie deals with the same. It is hard to understand that feeling of helplessness without actually experiencing it even the notion of it is painful to bear. It is very important to understand that the disabled people are just rather unfortunate folks who are trying their best to make do with what they have. To act like a pain in the ass for them and be non supportive is probably one of the more ill deeds that one can do. There is some sort of a stigma attached to them in my mind. It has probably to do with the fact that seeing them evokes a painful emotion in me, one that I do not wish to give much thought to or protract. I guess, now that I think about it, I have that with anything even vaguely related to the hospital. Not the most cheerful of places.I was expecting a watershed moment in the movie somewhere after which the drama would take over but thankfully that never came. The movie ended on a cheerful note, which for a change, was nice to watch. The story is not a novel one and based on a true incident but the depiction and the acting in the movie make it a likable affair. Nina Simone's Feeling Good and the whole sequence featuring it was probably the most moving part of the movie, Driss's dance scene being the other one. Ludovico Einaudi's Fly being another brilliant soundtrack, overall, a nice movie.",10,1,2,14 March 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," A pioneering work of art
","Arthur C. Clarke once said, 'If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.' And boy does this movie evoke thought! This is definitely one my favourite all time movies and one I feel deserves to be rated higher than what it is right now. 2001ASO tracks certain events spread across time which are connected by mysterious appearances of a monolith. The movie is constituted of three different sequences: A look at early apes and some breakthrough moments in their evolution, Briefing at a space station and hushing up of a discovery on Moon, A manned spacecraft on course to Jupiter and the events on-board.Stanley Kubrick is a true visionary and his 2001ASO is a seminal work of art that paves way for more awe-inspiring works over the years in the Sci-Fi genre. For two and a half hours, Clarke and Kubrick manage to keep the viewer enraptured and in awe of the magical confluence of classical music and surrealist imagery on screen. The cinematography is brilliant (No wonder people were convinced of the Fake Moon Landing conspiracy theory) and visual effects in the movie are a treat for the senses,one that deserve to be appreciated all the more for the time this movie was made in. The space station scenes with bright closed spaces and high contrast sofas are very reminiscent of some of his other works, notably the Clockwork Orange. The credit for the amazing foresight and technological innovations shown in the movie must go to Arthur C. Clarke's vision. The space food, zero gravity toilet and other machines on board the spacecrafts are catered to with absolute attention to detail. Perhaps nobody uses music better in his movies than Kubrick and the use of the Blue Danube and Thus Spake Zarathustra help give a transcendental feel to the movie. The Blue Danube sequence is an exquisite one with the majestic soundtrack adding to every bit of it. In between, he makes you experience vicariously the eerie and haunting silence of space that keeps you on the edge of the seat. You get an idea of how lonely and insignificant one is in the vast nothingness. The breathing in the spacesuit being that one sign of life that keeps you hooked to what happens next. The movie does not feel rushed at any point and it's the music that plays the most important part in capturing the stillness in such an artistic manner. The dialogue, simple at all times, is engaging. The ominous 'foolproof and incapable of error' declaration and the iconic 'I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that' produce the effects of anticipation and shock ever so naturally. Finally, to the phantasmal (most fitting word) wormhole sequence and the ambiguous ending. While one can think of any number of interpretations, the one common element that probably connects them is a realization of the human race being on the edge of what is a vast ocean of knowledge that awaits us. We are just an insignificant and tiny part of the universe and the ending leaves us dreaming of the infinite possibilities that explain our existence in the larger scheme of things. There is no specific function that the monolith points to. It is the sum of all the uncertainties and the mysterious phenomenon that we fail to fathom. It leaves us wanting to explore and charter into the unknown. We have advanced till this stage and learnt of where we stand, it is now time to take the next huge leap.Forever indebted to Stanley Kubrick for giving us this pioneering masterpiece of his.",10,1,3,15 March 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Absolutely delightful
","Singing in the Rain falls in the genre of Romance and comedy. The musical is about a movie star Don Lockwood who was based in theatre and Vaudeville comedy before he got a lucky break and made it large. He meets an aspiring actress Kathy Selden and is drawn to her because of her forthrightness in her critique of his acting skills and later, falls in love with her. In order to make the rather difficult transition from silent movies to talkies, Don's production house needs to think out of the box as his co-superstar Lina Lamont is unable to adjust to the change. With the aid of Cosmo, his best friend who has been with him from the very start, and Kathy, the production house is able to turn an unsuccessful talkie into a buoyant musical.The strength of the movie lies in the effervescent portrayal of the main characters. Don's 'dignified' flashback sequence, an enchanting and bittersweet love affair with the theatre, sets the tone for the movie. As the movie goes on, one cannot help but fall in love with the characters and the delectable manner in which the dialogue is constructed among them. Be it Don mocking Kathy at the after premiere party, his charming confession that leaves Kathy blushing or Lina threatening to sue Monumental, the acting is so genuine that the viewer is engaged all the time. Glimpses of how Hollywood works behind the scene adds to the exciting feeling of going to the movies in order to be charmed.Gene Kelly portrays a superstar in this movie and certainly acts like one. He is brilliant in his role as the protagonist and puts in a charismatic performance. Donald O'Connor and Debie Reynolds are both adorable in the movie. Their inspired camaraderie and attempts to cheer Don up in times of trouble are beautifully done. Cosmo adds the spark to the scenes that liven them up and make them endearing. Kathy's innocence and impeccable affection for Don is charming. Jean Hagen is wonderful in her portrayal of Lina Lamont. In scenes with the diction coach, on set of the new talkie, her scheming to get rid of Kathy and the final premiere of the movie, she evokes such a wide array of emotions. You feel pity for her cacophonous voice at one time and loathe her for her nefarious plotting at the end.The heart of the movie lies in its musical numbers and sequences: Make em laugh, Singing in the Rain, Good Morning, Beautiful girl, Moses Supposes, Broadway Melody. All of them are sprightly and refreshing. Each of these numbers is an awe-inspiring and captivating work in itself. They portray unfettered emotions capturing joy, surprise, love and hope.Over the course of the movie, I felt as if a spell had been cast on me that left me enchanted. Musicals can have this effect and Singing in the Rain is definitely one of the best that I've seen.",10,0,2,14 March 2013
Some Like It Hot," Some like it hot indeed
","Some Like it Hot is a screwball comedy about two musicians somehow getting mixed up with a Chicago crime syndicate and their attempt to run away from them. They end up disguising themselves as girls in order to land a gig with an all girl band in Florida. Along the way, they meet an attractive, innocent girl, who has a tendency to fall for sax players, and attempt to charm her. Things get when complicated when the syndicate arrives in Florida for some other event and paths of the musicians and the gang cross again.Tony Curtis as the ever-optimistic Joe and Jack Lemmon as the frank and jocular Jerry were both delightful in their portrayals. Their on-screen chemistry constitutes the heart of the movie as they land themselves in awkward situations and wriggle their way out with the help of some cunning and fortune. Marilyn Monroe as the dim and naive Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, is the central character around which the plot rotates. It is almost impossible not to fall for her as she is ever so attractive and yet so innocent in character. There are times when one forgets about the movie and is enchanted by her presence on screen, her singing at the band's performance and the scene on the yacht being two of them. Joe E Brown as Osgood, puts in a hearty performance as the love seeking rich oldie who would go to any lengths to win Daphne's heart. He provides the fitting end to the movie with the iconic 'Nobody's Perfect'. The on screen camaraderie between Joe and Jerry, as they bicker along the way and yet never leave each other in times of trouble, is what makes this movie special. Joe as an esoteric millionaire who has a 'problem', Osgood has the doting lover infatuated with Daphne, and Daphne as the light hearted and carefree maiden who finds herself in perplexing situations , are three characters that give life to this brisk paced comedy. The most hilarious scene though has to be the post dates scene where Jerry's incredible contemplation of a love affair and future life with Osgood is discussed, leaving the audience in fits of laughter.Overall, Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is a wonderful comedy that has all the ingredients for an all time classic.",9,3,3,14 March 2013
To Kill a Mockingbird," Beautiful movie based on a wonderful book
","To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story written by Harper Lee that deals with some very important issues of that time in a beautiful way. To add to that, it is a story that serves as a model for rectitude and moral righteousness. Gregory Peck's delivery of the case summary, pleading not guilty to the jury, was just the icing on the overall brilliant performance throughout the film. While it started off as a feel-good movie where the children seemed cushioned away from any vile forces that existed, it was far from being like that throughout. The acting by the children is genuine and true to their parts, with all the three child actors pleasing the eye at all times. The movie deals with the issues of slavery, dealing with ethical conundrums, tolerance and acting as role models for our young ones. The courtroom scene was so well played that there is not a single moment when the viewer is not glued to the screen, ever so eager to know more about the case and judge for themselves the verdict of the case. The scuffle at the end and the suspense that ensued was riveting. And finally, the character of Boo Radley, that was constructed over the course of the movie through the interaction of the children with Atticus and the neighbors, and their own forays into exploring the dark and the unknown, cumulates into one with one final act committed by him: a selfless act, a courageous act, a virtuous act, yet an act of a Mockingbird. The message that goes across is that selfless and virtuous acts are always respected by everyone and if we stay true to the moral education imparted to us by our elders, we can all make a difference and make this world a better place to live in.",10,0,1,14 March 2013
Amélie," The gnome that travelled far and away
","Having watched Barfi recently, it was hard to not see the similarities between the two movies in the way the soundtrack has been used and the depiction of some serious incidents in a lighter way. It was one of those sweet movies where you don't want anything bad to happen to the protagonist because he/she means no harm. It is essentially a movie about an introverted girl who is unlike others her same age. Set on the path to do good for others, she goes about fixing problems around her and in the process meets someone like her. The whole cat and mouse game between Amelie and Nino was very enjoyable. It got me thinking about how people are identified by their peculiarities and oddities more than what they do for a living or are like usually. It is a sugar coated story with a very adorable protagonist that one cannot dislike even if he/she tries to. Usually such movies don't resonate that strongly with me and I put them in the category of 'Cute and sweet' without giving much thought to them. It is a tough world out there and that is why I find it tough to just flow with the impractical romanticism associated with such movies. There are just so many insecurities that manifest themselves in the real world in our thoughts, which is why the only such movies that I probably enjoy are the ones with loads of dialogue, like Woody Allen's, in which a neurotic protagonist ensures that all his insecurities are out there. How I would love to forget all issues that plague me and enjoy a love story vicariously but it's just not possible to do so without feeling rather sad and lonesome at the end of it. But then, I look hopefully towards the near future. Hopefully, next time I watch this movie, I will approve of the sugar coated texture of it. Right now, the purity and naivety of the characters was something I could not appreciate wholeheartedly. Great soundtrack.",9,0,1,14 March 2013
Princess Mononoke," Miyazaki: A True Artist
","Nearly all of Miyazaki's works rest in the 'Must watch' category for everyone. He is a true artist who manages to engage his viewers to the screen at all times with another beautifully made movie, Princess Mononoke.Princess Mononoke reflects on the conflict among men, and between man and nature. Cursed by a demon, Ashitaka wanders the forest to search for the cause of his distress and the spirit of the forest for a cure to the curse. There he finds San, who is the daughter of the wolves, bears deep resentment against humans and has vowed to protect the forest at any cost. The other prominent character is Lady Eboshi, who has helped brothel workers and lepers earn a job in her iron town. The movie then proceeds to showcase the events that take place when the paths of the characters cross. There are certain elements in Miyazaki's works that are always accentuated. Lady Eboshi is yet another strong female character. She creates employment for the unemployed and is pragmatic in her approach. She is not daunted by the task in hand till the very last and rejects the help of others as she is confident of herself and her people. In Ashitaka, we see the hero willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. It is his valiant efforts that manage to create some sort of a trust between combative parties. He acts like a mediator between the two warring factions. The analogy of damaged nature with troubled spirits, as seen later in Spirited Away as well, helps understand the plight of nature. The theme of man against nature manifests itself in the form the Iron town's gain of resources at the cost of the forest's well being.Overall, it is yet another liberal and refreshing work from Miyazaki that everyone should watch, preferably when young. The hope that remains is if we could all emulate the virtues of the characters and reject the basic human notions of greed and hatred, our World will become a better place to live in.",8,0,1,14 March 2013
