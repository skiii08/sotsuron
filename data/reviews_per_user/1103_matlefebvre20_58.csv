The Blair Witch Project," It works because it's real
","The horror film market is probably one of the most popular these days in cinema. The main reason is that today's moviegoers and people in general always want to get more and more thrills and experiences that makes adrenaline climbing. Well, you might say that it's not really new, but others things are changing in today's film industry.I'd say that moviegoers aren't really sensitive to whether the movie is good or not, because they simply want the thrills. That's the reason why ridiculous horror/slasher films are created, such as 'Final Destination' (and its sequels), 'Child's Play' (and its sequels), and so on.However, major exceptions still exist and 'The Blair Witch Project' is one of them. 'Blair Witch' is far from being an ordinary horror B-movie, or any parody of any genre. It's simply a pseudo-documentary about three film students who want to shoot their own documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, but they inadvertently become the subject of a movie that they never wanted to shoot.The main reason that 'Blair Witch' succeeds is because of its terrifying reality. The 'actors' aren't from Hollywood and they always seem to be playing the game during the 70 minutes that we see them. Heather, Josh and Michael are fairly convincing and not only in their scares. Yeah, the scary moments are the main part of the film and it's always great, but the interesting parts don't begin there. Just before they leave to the woods, we clearly see that they're real human beings. They have their own pre-shooting rituals (Heather drinks scotch because she's the director) and they have their own jokes, which do we might admit, are typical of people of their age.And when they notice that they 'lost' themselves, their reaction, their anger and their frustration don't leave any doubt about their sincerity. It's clearly evident when you see Josh fights Michael, because he let go the map and when Heather angers with Michael while she's taping, causing the image to muddle and shake.The way that this movie is shot is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of it. It's not in 35mm like in most of today's movies. It's shot alternatively between Hi-8 video and 16mm, which make the scenes even more real. We never see any of the events entirely from an external point of view, because we either switch from one of the students to another. This shooting process makes the movie even scarier and there's no let-down 'till the abrupt final scenes (before it switches to today's footage).Also a thumbs-up for the sound effects. Sometimes, we don't even see anything (because the camera light is off) and we're still scared, simply because of the sounds we hear. And that's maybe what's the scariest: the sounds. Just hearing the characters crying and shaking, the external cries of unknown people outside the tent and the sounds of the mysterious person who follow them in the night make the viewer shake as well.Hollywood filmmakers should learn a lesson here. When independent filmmakers shoot a $35,000-budget project that becomes a $150-million hit, there's definitely something to learn. It's not the budget that counts, it's the substance. Just do something that works and the moviegoers will come. And that's what 'Blair Witch' producers understood. And it's the reason why it became one of the best horror films of the late 20th century. Along with 'The Shining', 'Blair Witch' is one of my all-time favorites.",9,1,2,28 July 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," ...if you watch the first volume
","I still have difficulties to believe that this insipid and ordinary dish is the sequel of the ultra-spicy and tasty 'Kill Bill Vol. 1'.With the incredible spectacle shown in the first part of this epic four-hour-plus movie, my expectations were very high for this sequel and conclusion. Perhaps that it's just me, but maybe I've put the bar too high. Or perhaps that Quentin himself did with the blood pool of the first volume.At the end of the first volume, The Bride (Uma Thurman) already killed Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). So there were only Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and her boss Bill (David Carradine) to annihilate.The major difference is that director Quentin Tarantino visibly gave a more conventional taste to the second volume. And if there's one character trait that QT doesn't own, it's the fact of being conventional. It's almost like if somebody slapped him on the fingers while lecturing him of calm himself and behave better. Anyway, if it's the case, I'd really like to meet that person and tell him/her my way of thinking.This section of The Bride's story (who must be called by her real name Beatrix Kiddo) began pretty well however. The black-and-white opening about the church where the initial massacre happened is original and the massacre itself is never really shown, which gives a 'Reservoir Dogs' taste (it happens to be the movie in which Madsen plays the greatest role of his career).The fact that the shootout happened in a church during a wedding repetition acts like some kind of sacrilege. Just like the katana duel in the snow-covered Japanese garden in the first movie.Like always, Tarantino tries to pay homage to many film genres in the course of the same feature-length film. But here, it doesn't work very well when you compare to his other movies. The first part, which is supposed to pay tribute to the spaghetti westerns from Sergio Leone, falls short. And there's one good reason for that. The word 'spaghetti' hasn't been taken just like that. That precise word is used because of the supposedly huge amount of blood shown on-screen. But it seems that we're running out of currant juice. Moreover, the cinematography is supposed to be minimalistic, which is not the case here either. Images are not elaborated nor especially stylized, but they're not minimalistic either. Tarantino can try to include samples from Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack, it doesn't improve the situation.There's an obvious reference to the zombie films of George A. Romero which almost becomes a moment of unintentional comedy.While Volume 1 was definitely based on the presentation, Volume 2 is definitely aimed at character development and at moments of introspection and souvenirs. It's probably that brutal change of tone that is so uncomfortable.But it nevertheless benefits to some actors. Carradine impresses, not necessarily by his performance by itself, but by his capacity to remember so many lines and so many monologues by heart.Hannah is the most frightening killer of the group, because of her dirty character, her menacing face and her sinister blindfold above her right eye. Her fight with Thurman is exciting and the scene where Thurman pulls out her remaining eye is very hard to stomach and remains the most powerful image of this portion of movie.And we know at which point Tarantino is far from being sentimental. However, the scenes where Beatrix appears with her daughter (which Beatrix thought of being dead) are surprising and comforting.Now I'd like to go back to Carradine's monologues. It's true that the characters talk much more than they fight in this second volume. Some people would even say that it's another Tarantino trademark and that it's the point that made 'Pulp Fiction' so interesting. However, here, characters are rather boring and their conversations are not very catchy. Let's say that Bill's superhero speech is far from the level of the famous 'Royale with cheese' of Vincent Vega.On the cinematography level, there are not many things to underline. There's only the first chapter, entirely in black-and-white, and the scene from inside the coffin that are really interesting.To sum up, almost all of the publicity and the fame of 'Kill Bill' are built around the first volume. Volume 2 is good nevertheless, but we could compare the effect to a cold shower poured on a burning body. If both sections are put together, it would enhance the second part, but it would risk to harm the first one. And obviously, because we're so impressed by the first part, we desperately want to watch the second one. But what do you want...",6,5,9,16 June 2007
Mission: Impossible III," IMF: Incredibly Massive Fun
","I can imagine J.J. Abrams being told by producers Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner: 'Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to direct the sequel of Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II and to make it a worthy action picture and a great blockbuster.' That's a tough job and maybe that Cruise and Wagner didn't get the right person to do it.Abrams has never directed a motion picture before. His notable works were on television, as he directed episodes from 'Alias' and 'Lost'. So, let's not hide it, the expectations were very high.So, what's the result? Did Abrams complete his mission? In two single words: OH YES! 'M:I-3' is by far the best film of the Mission series and it mixes elements from the previous episodes, while adding a touch of things that weren't. I know now why the majority of the film critics loved this movie, because I was astonished too by the extremely well-filmed action scenes and the surprising, but fairly welcomed drama and emotion which weren't really present in the first two movies.First, the action. Because Mission is firstly an action scenes maker. I have to say that the action in 'M:I-3' is by far the most elaborate and the most spectacular, and the locations are well-chosen for them. For example, there is the helicopter chase in the beginning inside a field full of windmills. The cameras are shaking and shaking 'till it's over. The viewer really has the impression of being trapped in a thrilling roller coaster ride and the only thing to do is to grab the seat and hold on.I also liked the attack on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. These are epic scenes, because of the high level of circulation and the number of fighters involved. The images of Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise, who else?) hanging from the hole in the way are captivating.There's also a surprisingly high level of emotion and drama inside the movie. Hunt and his wife Julia are an appealing couple and the interaction between both of them is real and attracting.The gadgets in the Mission series are as inseparable as in the James Bond series. There are dozens of computers, guns, vehicles, chips etc. But director Abrams finally reveals how do the agents create their famous masks and the vocal stickers that come along. I was wondered.I kinda noticed a lot of references to Quentin Tarantino's movies in this picture. First, there is the very first scene which repeats itself later in the movie and the adrenaline injection inside agent Lindsay's body, which recall 'Pulp Fiction'. There's also the stealing of a secret item called 'Rabbit's Foot', but we only see the before and the after, much like in 'Reservoir Dogs'. However, in Mission case, I don't think that this kind of scene was necessary and it may just hide an event that the screenwriters weren't able to develop.Another weak point: I don't believe that it was necessary to give Ethan's wife a gun and to make her fight. I simply didn't like that scene. The kicking-ass-woman is too cliché (I don't want to look like a macho, however).Overall, 'M:I-3' is a really great blockbuster and it brings a holy part of sunlight into the 2006 movie year. A big, big thumbs-up!",7,2,4,18 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...
","It began in 1977. And it become one of the greatest cultural phenomenons of all time. Now, the time has come to see how it all began.This first episode of the Star Wars series of six introduces us to many new characters never seen in the episodes 4, 5 and 6 and also shows us earlier versions of characters that we've already seen.For example, all-powerful Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi is only an apprentice here, demonic ruler Darth Vader is a young boy named Anakin Skywalker and evil emperor Palpatine is just a senator, even if he becomes chancellor by the end of the movie.While the storyline doesn't have much to do with the older movies one, it magnificently shows how it leads to what we already knew.The story concerns a conflict between the Trade Federation and the small planet Naboo, which degenerates when the Federation invades and occupy the planet. Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to the Senate to settle the conflict and she's protected by two Jedi knights: arrogant master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his faithful apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).Their ship having broken down, they stop upon planet Tatooine to fix it and they meet young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a Miles Prower-like mechanical wizard who builds robots and racing pods. Qui-Gon is impressed with the boy's powers and is convinced that Anakin could become a powerful Jedi.Some nostalgic fans of this franchise would tell you that some lines of the movie are funny to hear. Because they say predictions that will either happen or go the opposite way.The key for watching this movie this effective way is looking at it like if it was the very first episode of the Star Wars franchise. I know that it is tough because of the series' prestige. And some comparisons with the older episodes are essential for the rating scale.I explain myself. The special effects are very abundant (almost too much), the sets are very imposing and the non-human characters have a greater roster than the real actors. The major difference between 1977 and 1999 is how everything is done.Director George Lucas is perhaps the greatest special effects wizard of all time and 'Episode I' might be the ideal playground to show what's he able to do with all of his high-tech toys. But using a computer is not always as impressive as using archaic ways and creating the similar sense of wonder. Using a computer is at the same time so difficult and so easy.But essentially, watching many epic action scenes and FX-laden spectacles can only convince us that this hi-tech stuff is well-appreciated by everybody.The exotic locations are very impressive and so are the CGI-created characters, such as the massive droid army and the Gungan people. Jar Jar Binks is funny, but his slightly incomprehensible dialect is a considerable flaw.It's the action scenes which deserve my best regards. Beginning with the memorable pod race which puts the spectator in the seat of a supersonic jet and the images pass at a neck-breaking speed. Secondly, the battle between the droids and the Gungans reminisced me of 'Braveheart' or 'Gladiator'. And thirdly, the epic laser sword battle between the two Jedi protagonists and evil Sith apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park). Talking about Darth Maul, his make-up is very well done and it comforts for his lack of speech.The bar was very high for this movie. But George Lucas reached his goal and made a very convincing prequel which should please every Star Wars fan (and those who are not also).",7,1,2,9 December 2006
Catch Me If You Can," As serious as a drama and as funny as a comedy
","According to me, biopics about little-known people are more interesting, because they're more surprising. Just before renting 'Catch Me If You Can', I've never heard anything about Frank Abagnale Jr. Now, I know a lot of things...Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man (in fact, not 20 years old yet) who discovered that he had a real talent of forging other people and to make money from it. And the story itself is not a forge, because it really happened. All of the elements presented in the movie are not necessarily true, but the majority is. The trueness of the story is simply incredible and hard to believe.Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers a fairly splendid performance here. While he was in his late 20's during the filming, DiCaprio perfectly appears as a late teenage boy.The other main character is FBI agent and fake checks specialist Carl Henratty, played by the incredible Tom Hanks. Henratty is the cat of the cat-and-mouse game and he personally runs after Abagnale on this wild ride in order to bring the kid to the justice. But the job isn't easy.The main example is the famous hotel showdown. At this moment, Henratty only heard the Abagnale name and he doesn't have any sight of Abagnale's face. So, he meets Abagnale, but the young man acts like if he was an agent as well and Henratty falls into the trap. This situation is the funniest one in the entire movie.Also highlighted must be Christopher Walken's performance as Abagnale's father.There is no single mood into this movie. Sometimes, it is very dramatic and there are very special scenes. But it's also very comic and it surely is one of the lightest movies of Steven Spielberg's career as a director.So, 'Catch Me If You Can' is another jewel in Spielberg's filmography and so it is for DiCaprio and Hanks...",8,2,4,4 June 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," You call this archeology?
","When two powerful cinematic phenomenons come together, you know that the storm that will result won't be a light drizzle.So when Steven Spielberg and George Lucas work on the same project, prepare yourself for a thrill ride. And that's exactly what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is.While the ultimate goal is to find the Lost Ark, the steps include a plenty whole lot of dangers, stunts, spectacular tricks and freaky other things. This leads to a re-definition of the archeology term...During all the movie, I never asked myself what made it good or bad. I was simply absorbed by it. I couldn't put off my eyes from the screen. There's always something fairly exciting that happens at every moment or so.Spielberg once said that he would like to direct a Bond film. Well, if he's not chosen, it's not because he can't do the job. The action scenes and the special effects are simply great and entertaining. And the variety of stunts is highly imaginative. I particularly liked the fight near the airplane and the car and truck chase during the Ark transport.But the best part of the movie is certainly the Ark's opening at the end. What follows is a masterful pyrotechnic, explosive and visually dazzling special effects extravaganza. Even if you try to look elsewhere, you simply couldn't. These wonderful scenes catch your eyes and never let them go. It's wonderful, period.Although I prefer the third movie, I must admit that the first is the best of the three (like in a lot of cases). And the best thing about 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is that it became a cultural icon for years to come. It's now a synonym of adventure and Indiana Jones is a symbol too.But if you want to become an archaeologist, do not expect to live things that way...Rankings: Best: RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK 2nd best: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Worst: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom",10,0,0,7 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'Close Encounters' with a heart
","'E.T.' is some kind of a new version of the movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. But the targeted audience isn't the same, the aliens that are shown are different and director Steven Spielberg put much more accent on emotion and feelings in 'E.T.' for obvious reasons.Since it was released 25 years ago, 'E.T.' is still considered as a classic children's film, but it's not necessary to include the 'children's' note, because 'classic film' is well enough to describe this incredible movie.The story and the characters quickly became popular, even for those who haven't seen the movie yet. It's because 'E.T.' quickly entered into popular culture and it must be believed that it's not about to get out of it soon.'E.T.' is also known as the quintessential children's (or family) film, because it contains every item that the genre could possibly offer and it's shown in an immaculate way.First, we see the heroic children, resourceful and very intelligent. There is the main character and best friend of E.T. the extra-terrestrial, Elliott (an astounding performance from young Henry Thomas). At the beginning of his adventure, we see Elliott as a not-so-brave boy, often lost in his own world. Eventually, he will take his courage with both hands when he discovers that there is an alien in his backyard.There's also Elliott's younger sister Gertie (cute little Drew Barrymore) and his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and let's not forget the other kids.The adults are typically shown as fearsome opponents or as goofy characters. So we can see scientists who want to get the hand on the poor extra-terrestrial and we suspect since the movie's very first scenes (where they chase E.T.'s spaceship) that they're the bad guys of the story. It creates some kind of contrast with 'Close Encounters', where the viewer expresses resentment, but also sympathy towards the scientists.Elliott's single mother Mary (Dee Wallace) is an idiot character however, in the sense where she seems to be totally devoid of reason, at which point she becomes unbearable. I really expected her to be far better than she is actually.In order to succeed with his movie, Spielberg efficiently topples over the sentimental and the special effects. And he never, under any circumstance, miss.In the case of the special effects, it's not a surprise, because it's Spielberg. But remember that the year is 1982 at this moment. The question that must be asked is not 'Will he use them?', but 'How will he use them?'. Spielberg's answer is remarkable. We can see him playing with flowers in their pot, but no-one could forget the incredible bicycle flight. This scene hasn't aged a bit and it still surprises.But the most spectacular element of the movie is not the artificial created by Industrial, Light & Magic, but by the feelings expressed by the characters, especially the kids. Spielberg wisely decided to shoot every scene in chronological order, so the emotional response from the children would be more natural. In this way, we can really see the links that are created between Elliott and E.T., reaching a very high level during E.T.'s 'death' and 'resurrection' in the two-thirds of the movie.But nothing could beat the unforgettable scenes at the very end when E.T. must go back to his far away planet. The young Gertie is touching and Michael, even if he's a teenager, shows in a clear and irrevocable way that he also owns feelings for the alien. And how could we forget the legendary good-bye hug between Elliott and E.T.? I'm not an emotional kind of guy, but I've almost cried while watching these pictures. This scene could easily make the stone hearts melt in a matter of seconds.'E.T.' is the crossover between the young Spielberg and the more mature Spielberg. The director has fun with the special effects like he did with the other movies that he previously released at the time, that is 'Jaws', 'Close Encounters' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', but he also shows that he still has his child's heart within himself and he transmits it very well. The emotions experienced by the characters are signs that the director begins to grow up and these are hints that lead to masterpieces like 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.Of all the numerous Spielberg-made classics, 'E.T.' largely owns its place on the podium. According to me, it's the third greatest Spielberg movie, 'Close Encounters' being in second place and 'Schindler's List' coming on the top. But I perfectly understand why Spielberg himself declares that 'E.T.' is his personal favorite. Among all of his other movies, none of them has captured the beauty of childhood in such an eloquent way.'E.T.' is universal entertainment. The kids will appreciate the characters and the visual effects which will definitely impress them. Grown-ups will love the movie for the same reasons, but something else could be added up. It's that kind of nostalgia that comes from the film. Some kind of envy for the past. Because 'E.T.' is a fable that demonstrates the importance of childhood and it shows that the greatest souvenirs from a lifetime always come from that period.",10,0,1,26 April 2007
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The apotheosis
","If there is one thing that is difficult, it's to mix live actors with animated characters. Well today, it could look easy with the development of computers and more and more sophisticated filming methods. But if there is one thing that is even more difficult, it's to proceed to the mixing at the point that it becomes homogeneous and where the unreal merges into the reality with an extreme subtlety.The year is 1988. Computer animation still is at a prehistoric level and the only way to do the famous live-action/animation mix, it's to shoot all live scenes and to add the animated scenes one by one. To make a feature-length movie that way could look crazy and utterly visionary, but producers Frank Marshall and Robert Watts decided to take their chance and hired Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams, so they would direct what has become one of the greatest gems in cinema history.'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' begins with an almost-completed animated short film starring Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit. However, when the director (cameo by Joel Silver) shouts 'cut!', the film's wizards enter into action.The story is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and pretends to be some new form of film noir. Every film noir story needs an hard-boiled detective and this one is no exception with Eddie Valiant, perfectly played by Bob Hoskins.Valiant doesn't like the 'Toons' which live in Toontown, an isolated borough somewhere in L.A., but he accepts an offer which gives him the mandate to spy on nightclub owner Marvin Acme and Roger's wife, the hypnotizing femme fatale Jessica Rabbit.What Eddie doesn't suspect is that he just got embarked into a palpitating adventure, filled with murder, lies and big-money business. Then you add the terrifying Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and a conspiracy inspired from a real-life urban legend.'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is at the same time an homage and a parody of classic noirs from the 40s and the 50s and contains classic elements and others intended to provoke laughs and frenzy for the viewers who could only leave the theater with an open smile on their faces.Directing a film noir is already complicated enough, so imagine if you have to add animated characters inside. Fortunately, Robert Zemeckis clearly shows that he's the man for such a feature. Zemeckis shows that he has an overflowing imagination and he visibly has fun in making this movie.What more, Zemeckis et Williams use a technique and a philosophy both borrowed to Walt Disney himself : what's difficult isn't avoidable and even desirable. Both directors never try to simplify their task and the actors react with an immaculate professionalism, especially those who directly interact with Toons.The very complicated plot, the nihilistic environment and the lighting methods are worth the greatest noirs, but some characteristics (such as Valiant's shadow saying 'Bless you' after the detective sneezes) attenuate this sinister landscape and make the film more attracting to people of all ages.But the main problem with the movie is precisely about the targeted audience. There is no doubt that 'Roger Rabbit' is an adult film. But I have no doubt that some mature movie buffs will believe that it's a kiddie flick, just because of the Toons' presence. And this is definitely not a children's movie. The story is way too complicated, there's enough sex and violence to unleash an outcry and Judge Doom can become so disturbing that he could worry youngsters.However, I encourage adults to see this movie because they would bitterly regret it if they miss their chance. Adding to the already-mentioned elements are the brilliantly orchestrated action sequences by Zemeckis and his crew. The wild chase with Benny the Cab is stirring and the final battle in the warehouse gave me fun like I've rarely had before.Anyway, the entire movie gave me fun like I've rarely had before. It would take an entire dictionary in order to find all the appropriate terms to describe 'Roger Rabbit'. But words aren't necessary. You just need to watch it to experience a goofy orgasm which is the apotheosis of the live-action/animation mix.",10,0,0,21 March 2006
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," 101 is the magic number
","One of Dodie Smith's friends once looked at the novelist's dalmatians and said: 'Those dogs would make a lovely fur coat!' It's this single phrase that inspired Mrs. Smith and led her to write what was about to become her most popular and influential novel: 'The Hundred and One Dalmatians'. I don't know who was this friend and what was he/she doing for living and what was his/her name. But whoever this person is, he/she inadvertently changed popular culture forever. This shows at which point the simplest sentences can become monumental.Smith's novel was adapted by none other than Mr. Americana himself, Walt Disney. '101 Dalmatians' was Disney's first work of the '60s, the last decade of his life, but it doesn't mean that old age slowed him anyway.It is Disney's 17th animated-feature film and 7th focusing on furry animal characters. It's the story of Pongo and Perdita, a dalmatian couple, whose puppies have been kidnapped by Cruella De Vil, one of the most cruel and diabolical characters portrayed by Disney and his crew. Cruella collected every dalmatian she could, so she would be able to make a fur coat from them. But Cruella didn't plan that Pongo, Perdita and a whole network of animal companions would unite their efforts in order to win back the puppies and get home safely.As previously said, Cruella is by far the most interesting character of the lot. We never know how Perdita's mistress Anita became friend with Cruella, but we guess that Cruella's not interested in Anita: she only wants the dalmatian. Cruella has a scary look. She looks like an old witch. She doesn't respect anyone and she's only interested in her desires. That's what makes Cruella one of the creepiest and most interesting villains of Disney's universe.But my predilection goes to the puppies themselves, which are absolutely adorable and charming. My favorite scenes are those where Pongo, Perdita and their 15 puppies watch a western on TV.We don't get to know each one of the 15 puppies, but some are highlighted. There's Patch, who is probably the group rebel, with his black spot on his eyes and his love for hard words; there's Rolly, whose favorite phrase is: 'I'm hungry' and there's Lucky who looks like the precursor of Generation X, because he always got the nose on the TV.The viewer is also introduced to the dogs' own communication system: the 'twilight bark', which looks like a large-scale Chinese whispers game. This is wildly imaginative and it's one of the most fascinating aspects of the dogs' own world.Outside of the dalmatians, my favorite animal characters are the 'military shed': a horse called Captain, a sheepdog called Colonel and, last but not least, Sgt. Tibbs, a courageous cat who is assigned to save the puppies from their countryside prison.Cruella is sided by two stupid and running-gag henchmen, Jasper and Horace. These two foolish guys provide most of the film's laughs and they're not too overshadowed by their horrible boss.Animation, even if it doesn't break any ground, is excellent, but not perfect. Victorian houses of London are well pictured, but it's not exceptional. It's the animals who are the best drawn. The dalmatians weren't easy to draw, because they don't have a uniform fur. Artists had to draw them white and then adding the black spots over and over, during 70 minutes of screen time. It must have been a monumental task.Every classical Disney aspect is here: drama (the main plot), comedy (Horace & Jasper and some secondary/tertiary events), fearsome elements (Cruella), suspense (Sgt. Tibbs' puppies rescue) and action (the climatic car chase). And let's not forget some potentially symbolic images, such as the dalmatians' long walk in the blizzard and the puppies watching TV.Also a thumbs-up for the music, and especially for the Cruella's title song. The soundtrack is mainly made from jazzy parts and it's very adequate.Another feature, another classic. Walt Disney never deceives us. After this film, we became more familiar with two elements, both from the title. First, the number 101, when heard, is almost instinctively associated with this movie, and so is the dalmatian dog itself. It's another success that both parents and children will like for generations to come.",9,12,12,4 August 2006
Se7en," Seven reasons why you should love 'Se7en'
","ONE: original and well-built story. Initially, 'Se7en' is a story about two detectives who investigate on a peculiar serial killer. This murderer gets inspired of the seven deadly sins to choose his victims and their punishment. Just a reminder, the seven deadly sins are: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, lust, pride and envy. The summary is well enough to convince people about the originality of the story. Scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker builds a script that hooks and never exhausts itself during the full two hours that the movie lasts. The movie is full of surprises and plot twists and reaches its paroxysm at the very end with an astounding, exploding and almost-miraculous climax that has already become legendary and which reflects the atmosphere and the ideology of the story in an adequate way.TWO: the main actors. 'Se7en' also works because of its two main actors. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt both deliver extraordinary performances. Freeman is Detective Somerset, ready to take his retirement, while Pitt is Detective Mills, who has been hired to take on Somerset's job after the latter leaves the homicide section. The most striking aspect about both characters is the chemistry between them. Sometimes, we see that they like each other and sometimes, it appears that one of them is about to jump on the other one. Pitt is by far the best of both actors with his detective with a boiling and impatient attitude and with methods that are too radical to Somerset's taste. If there's another actor that deserves to be mentioned, it's Kevin Spacey who plays the mysterious killer. He can't prevent himself from saying that he acts for the good side and he pretends to be an example to follow. But he nevertheless remains a sadist and he's one of the most horrifying killers in cinema's history.THREE: horrible images. For those who love horror movies, they will get well served with the pictures that they'll see. Even if none of the murders are portrayed on screen, the aftermath is horrible anyway, mainly because of the nauseating pictures shot by the crew of director David Fincher. In fact, the committed murders are so horrible that it's not even necessary to look at the corpses to feel repulsive sensations. The only thing that's needed, it's for somebody to tell the murders and the listener will certainly get grabbed by an impression of terror.FOUR: the cinematography. Apart from its images of horrifying murders, 'Se7en' also impresses by its general cinematography. The title sequence is catching and the sinister music that comes along sets the table for the general atmosphere of the film. The lighting belongs without a doubt to a modern-era film noir, putting emphasis on the darkness of the unknown metropolis shown in the movie.FIVE: its vision of the world. 'Se7en' isn't only a movie about a sordid murderer. It's also a movie having a pessimist vision of the world, where nobody is good, nobody is fine and everybody is bad. That's a vision which doesn't look like any other that was seen before in Hollywood. The only movie similar to 'Se7en' that I've seen is 'Taxi Driver'. In the city that is shown, it's always raining, it's always dark and sinners move into the streets. Despite the fact that Spacey is a sadistic and insane killer, the fact remains that he's the most philosophical character of the lot and he wants to get sure that the viewers don't leave the theater with a smile upon their faces. And it's precisely the movie's objective. And even if the killers gets himself killed at the end of the movie, Fincher manages to make it look like it's not an happy ending. This pessimism is also present in 'Fight Club', which is better than 'Se7en', but not by far.SIX: its description of police work. 'Se7en' is also remarkable for its accurate description of the police world, more specifically the homicidal section. Pitt and Freeman, as well as their colleagues, look like real police officers and not actors. We really could feel that we're in a real investigation instead of a fictitious story. We visit many places and we assist to the use of sophisticated techniques. SE7EN: redemption for David Fincher. Overall, 'Se7en' is a powerful movie that charges like a locomotive and it wants to be sure that the viewers don't leave it unscathed. It really is one of the most striking thrillers of the 90s and it's a great example that Hollywood isn't necessarily synonymous of censure and respite. It's also a redemption for David Fincher who was only known at the time for the disappointing 'Alien ³'. From now on, Fincher could show that he was an exceptional filmmaker and he kept going with other masterpieces, such as 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room' and 'Zodiac'.",9,1,2,27 April 2007
Fight Club," I am Jack's entire satisfaction
","Each time that somebody has just watched 'Fight Club', this person must have something to say on it. It could be something good, something bad or simply something anecdotal.In my case, it's something anecdotal. I was watching the film live on television. That means commercials which include big sales, promotions on varied products and reality TV shows where we are supposed to watch poor fools kissing each other or accomplishing their dreams. This is called wasting our own lives watching somebody else living his/her own.If you think that what I've just said is a little bit hard, then you're right. It's just that 'Fight Club' strikes so hard when you see it that it automatically leaves its mark on you and never let you go. After seeing it, our visions totally change, our beliefs are seriously challenged and the name of Tyler Durden cannot be forgotten anymore.Directed by David Fincher and starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, 'Fight Club' is a masterpiece that succeeds on almost every level evaluated by the film industry. Its greatest success is undoubtedly its capacity to disturb us and provoke thoughts. A half-anarchist, half-communist propaganda work, the movie is also fairly funny and transforms strange situations into banal situations and shocking acts into suddenly full-of-sense situations.Norton plays the Narrator, an insomniac bureaucrat who works as an outside consultant for an automobile company ('a major one' does he assert). His real name remains unknown, even if many film buffs incorrectly refer him as Jack. In fact, it's one of the movie's many goals. The only thing that is important about him is precisely nothing. Beginning by his very identity...Back to the story, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt). Tyler is a misfit who sells soap and lives in a house that is so rotten that it could chase the ghosts who'd like to squat it. Tyler is the messenger of the ideas carried out during the film and his philosophies turn around chaos, violence and misfortune.Together, they start the Fight Club, strictly reserved to men, whose goal is to give to its members the occasion to make roar their bestial instincts without any fear. But when the number of members begins to grow up, the Fight Club progressively changes its status until it becomes something that is really dangerous.Carter plays Marla Singer who acts as the finger between the tree and the bark. She is a misfit too, but she lives her own ordinary existence.The three main actors are quite superb. Norton is over-the-top, while Pitt is incredible and might find friends among those who hate his playboy image. Carter is convincing and adequately dreadful. Another highlight is rock singer Meat Loaf who plays a cancer patient with 'bitch tits'.The biggest irony about 'Fight Club' is the fact that it cost $63 million to produce when its lead wire indicates that one single cent is a cent too much. According to Tyler, man has evolved terribly wrong and his actual lifestyle might have deprived him from the most essential characteristics that make him a man. He privileges a return to the caveman status.Obviously, I don't need to mention that it's our insatiable need to consume that is attacked. You can do whatever you want with that philosophy. You can attack it, which is, for many viewers, very easy and very tempting. You can criticize it for being macho, too violent to deliver the ideas it wants to share and uselessly filled with sexual scenes.However, those three elements have all something to do with our natural instincts. Our instincts, that's what the movie wants to bring out. It's disturbing, it's shocking, but it's wanted this way.But to balance those intense moments, 'Fight Club' also includes funny and grotesque scenes. There's something I've remarked about the Narrator and Tyler: they seem to be the only ones to know that their story isn't real and that they are in a movie. It happens that they break the fourth wall and talk directly to the viewer and we can even see Tyler make appear a 'cigarette burn' in the top right corner of the screen.Besides, many people often forget it, but the film's cinematography and special effects are exceptional. Overflowed with more-or-less obvious subliminal images, domestic rooms transforming into life-sized 3D IKEA labels and elaborate, even darkly comic explosion sequences, 'Fight Club' becomes a feast for the eyes, as much as it is for the mind.There's no doubt that the movie is a novel adaptation (from Chuck Palahniuk, to be more precise). The constant, almost overabundant narration from Norton's character is a good indicator, as are the impressing quantity of quotes and lines that have become early classics, such as 'The first rule of the Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.' It would also be a sin to forget the titanic plot twist of the end that astounds as much, if not more than the one from 'Se7en', also directed by Fincher. The twist renders full of sense some previously unintelligible sentences and allows to contemplate previous situations from a different eye.'Fight Club' is so overheated that it becomes burning by moments (I think about the car accident episode). But nobody complains about it, if they ever notice it. Because the only thing that is essential to know is that 'Fight Club' is a philosophical must on the same level than 'The Matrix' and its true place is in philosophy classrooms. The problem is that few people could bear watching such hallucinating pictures.Too bad... These are superb pictures...",9,1,3,17 May 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious Tarantino
","Without the shadow of a doubt, Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' is the most expensive, the most profitable, the best crafted and the most enjoyable Nazi exploitation B-movie ever made.Tarantino is probably the most talented filmmaker of his generation and he shows us why once again with a gem of a picture. 'Inglourious Basterds' is a movie which, just like World War II itself, makes the viewer experience a whole combinations of emotions before it's over. Sometimes shocking, sometimes hilarious, while also having strong emotion, suspense, fascination and absurdity, the movie is a joyous mix of war movie scenes that we never get to see in any other war movie.'Basterds' contains a nice cast of stars who make the movie work perfectly. In the main role, Brad Pitt plays Southern-American Lt. Aldo Raine, the leader of a squad of Jewish-American soldiers (and a few German renegades) whose job in occupied France can be summed up as this: go hunting Nazi soldiers and giving them a free scalping session. 'Each man must carry out 100 scalps to accomplish his mission', Raine says to his crew.The surprising Austian actor Christoph Waltz plays the part of Nazi colonel Hans Landa, also known as 'The Jew Hunter'. His initial role is more or less the same as Raine, but in the opposite direction. He tracks Jews and... well, you get the idea. And much like Raine, Landa is intelligent, but also very sly. He can simultaneously become as charming as a cat, as rapacious as a vulture and as dangerous as a bear. And Waltz perfectly embodies this man. The acting prize he received at the Cannes Film Festival for his Landa part was fully merited. And he should eventually be considered for the Best Supporting Actor Award at Oscar time.French actress Mélanie Laurent plays the third character in importance in the movie: Shoshanna Dreyfus, who escaped from the cruel colonel's claws and became the owner of a small movie theatre in Paris. And when she meets the star (Daniel Brühl) of an upcoming German propaganda film, she gets to receive many high-ranked Nazi officers (including Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler himself), which would be the perfect moment to unleash her vengeance against the Third Reich.Put all of these ingredients in the blender, press the 'hi' button, add a few more juicy and spicy scenes, and then you get a full explosion of flavours, each one tastier than the others. Quentin Tarantino is an accomplished director, but his biggest talent still resides in his capacity to write stories and screenplays. If you think that age can get a hold on the great QT and tone down his explosive creative impulses, only a small glimpse at 'Inglourious Basterds' will make you think otherwise. Tarantino's talent has remained perfectly intact and everything that turned his other movies into masterpieces is here to create another one.And the main part of Tarantino's talent consists in grabbing our attention and to keep it firmly without inserting any action, nor making the story move forward in significant ways. Tarantino's dialogues are always filled with fascination and to listen to the movie without keeping much attention to the screen is thrilling. There is simply no other filmmaker in the world who can do such a trick.And when comes the time to get into the action, Tarantino builds a story filled with twists, as well as surprising and spectacular scenes which hold the moviegoers in suspense until the very end. And you can forget all the historical veracity. 'Inglourious Basterds' is not a docudrama, far from it. It's simply the kind of movie that a European director working with a tiny budget would have made if his only goal was to get a mock of Hitler and his Nazi pawns.Don't try to get into any deep meanings regarding what you see on screen. There's absolutely no symbolic about a Jewish squad who scalp Nazi soldiers or let them live after they carve Swastikas on their forehead with a knife. Don't try to understand anything about the climax of the movie in Shoshanna's theatre, even as brutal, spectacular and unexpected as it can be. The characters' dialogues are tasty, but they are not metaphorical. The entire movie is just one big pollution.Actually, Quentin Tarantino's entire filmography is one big pollution. Is there anything to understand in 'Reservoir Dogs' ? In 'Pulp Fiction' ? And especially in 'Kill Bill' ? There's nothing to understand. 'Inglourious Basterds', just like those movies, is nothing more than an unhealthy drug which you quickly get addicted to, even though you're conscious of its repugnance. But is there anything wrong about that? If the movie is funny, brilliant, intelligent and leaves smiles on the viewers' faces after the credits roll, frankly, what would be wrong about that? And once again, Tarantino gives die-hard movie buffs the occasion to get into a handful of delicious movie references. Shoshanna's theatre is filled with French movie posters from the Occupation era, something film historians will love. And as for the atmosphere, we're treated with scenes which seem to come out from the more intense Spaghetti Westerns and re-worked the WWII way. And it wouldn't be complete without a few samples of Ennio Morricone's music, would it? If you consider the sky-high expectations for this movie, 'Inglourious Basterds' is exactly what we would have expected from the great Quentin Tarantino. Let's hope he'll never change his style and remain into the unconventional side of Hollywood film-making, because there's really no other man on this planet who treats cinema the way he does.",9,2,8,3 September 2009
Batman Returns," Batman reviews, part II: A fair sequel
","After an excellent first movie, Tim Burton is back for the next revisionist adventures of the Dark Knight. Only, this time, there are two super-villains.Burton keeps it going and presents an even darker and more disturbing vision of Gotham City, forsakes somehow the psychological side of the superhero and focuses more on giving more action, chases and technological gadgets for this first Batman sequel.The movie opens on the apparition of the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. The Penguin keeps many characteristics coming from the original comics, like his arsenal of umbrellas, his short and chubby stature, his kick for birds (especially penguins) and his top hat. However, many modifications have been made, mainly to remain faithful to the dark and sinister atmosphere which already prevailed in 'Batman' and which stays in 'Batman Returns'. These changes are mainly mirrored in his appearance, since he's now presented as deformed, with fins instead of hands, a long beak-like nose and his grotesque clothes.The Penguin comes up to the surface after having lived his whole life in Gotham's sewers. He tries to find his parents only to discover that they're both deceased. Machiavellian businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) then suggests the Penguin to present himself in the elections to become the mayor of the city, with less-than-altruistic plans.The other villain who jumps into the game is Catwoman or more commonly, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Kyle is Shreck's awkward secretary and when she discovers her boss' malevolent plans, he throws her of the window. But mysteriously, after a group of cats gathered around her body, Kyle gets up, goes back home, where she goes completely berserk, and creates her feline alter ego.It's now up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to come to terms with those two new adversaries who each have different plans and objectives.The Penguin is accompanied by henchmen who look like a group of artists having escaped from a freak show or from the carnival from the movie 'Something Wicked This Way Comes'. As for Catwoman, she's a thief and she falls in love with Batman. The situation gets more complicated when the real people, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, begin to feel a particular affection for each other.The Penguin and Catwoman team up to discredit Batman and arrange things so Gotham's citizens would turn up against him, which would make things way easier for the Penguin and his election plans.It must be said that their plans are meticulously prepared and greatly imaginative. Let's say that their actions are more convincing than the Joker's ones in the first movie.But in 'Batman Returns', the characters are generally more two-dimensional than in the first movie. The psychology of the characters is far less explored and it's the general presentation who wins in that case. Not only do the look and the costumes of the characters are carefully prepared, but the action scenes also are.The Penguin's presentation is fairly good. He's ugly, grotesque and frightening. His den is no less either. The Catwoman costume, made of leather and 'claws' is appropriated for such a dark picture.Many gadgets appear in 'Batman Returns'. Some are original, inventive and useful, while others are frankly ridiculous. I didn't like what looks like some kind of 'batarang' which automatically hits the enemies one by one and the Batmobile which 'auto-mutilates' to escape from the police cars. However, the Batsuit's retractable wings is a brilliant idea.Gotham City still is a Gothic, dark, disturbing and postmodern metropolis. But the atmosphere is different somehow. The action of the film is set during the Christmas period, which is even more bizarre. We could almost assert that it's some kind of test from Burton's part before the director would launch himself into the production of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. At one certain moment in the movie, we even see sunlight, which didn't happen at all in the first movie.The dialog is sometimes bizarre, should it be intentional or not. It can lead to lengthy, boring and disconcerting scenes. But there also are grandiose lines, such as the one where the Penguin distorts the most famous line from David Lynch's movie 'Elephant Man'. And we must not forget that scene where Catwoman meows in front of Batman and the Penguin, just before the store behind her blow up.I also loved the scene where Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle become aware of each other's respective alter ego. There's visibly something that happens in their minds at that precise moment.'Batman Returns' is far from being perfect, but it's a much acceptable result nevertheless, especially with such expectations from the public's part. You must notice that if there's something difficult in the film industry, it's to make a sequel from an already acclaimed and popular hit picture. But Burton succeeded in his challenge.And when you look at the Batman movies which follow 'Batman Returns', that is those from Joel Schumacher, the value from 'Returns' heightens even more. Some people would even say that this movie is a consolation prize. But while this film is not as good as the first one, it must be appreciated. And it's not necessary to force yourself. It comes all by itself...",7,1,5,25 July 2007
Ed Wood," Holy Wood!!
","While the majority of biopics focus on personalities who were the best and/or the most popular in what they did, 'Ed Wood' tells the story of the man who is considered today as the worst filmmaker of all time. It must be said right away that the life of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is far more interesting and fascinating than those of many other popular Hollywood legends and this movie shows why.For starters, Wood was a filmmaker who defined himself as a writer-director-actor-producer, much like his idol Orson Welles. However, unlike Welles, Wood didn't have any magic touch, he never showed any visible talent in his movies, should it be his own or those of his faithful associates.Ed Wood is played here by Johnny Depp, in what might probably be his best dramatic performance ever. Wood is portrayed here as a fiery film buff who is well decided to leave his mark in Hollywood. His main characteristic is his unequaled optimistic attitude and this attitude pushes him to go forward, even in front of the most insuperable problems. He is always able to find a ray of sunshine inside the most devastating reviews. But in a movie like 'Ed Wood', the hardest thing to do would be to find some negative in such a genius and entertaining film.'Ed Wood' is directed by Tim Burton, probably the most weirdo of all mainstream Hollywood directors and the most capable of presenting the life of Wood and his motley crew of misfit collaborators in the most adequate way possible. Besides Wood, we can find the veteran star of 'Dracula' Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), drag queen Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), the 'amazing' Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (real-life wrestler George Steele) and TV show host Vampira (Lisa Marie).The actors are fantastic in the sense that they are able of recreating such bad acting roles with that much conviction. Once Burton's camera starts rolling, we can see their real talent in front of us, but when Wood's camera starts rolling, they become pathetic, unconvincing and they deliver the Wood-written lines without even realizing their absurdity.The movie is shot in black-and-white, which is frankly the only logical option for this kind of motion picture. Honestly, how could we imagine in color those sets that we can only see in black-and-white? How could we possibly imagine 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' in color? The recreation of Wood's turkeys is simply perfect. The story is set in the 1950s, the era where Wood directed his worst projects: 'Glen or Glenda?', 'Bride of the Monster' and 'Plan 9'.The 1950s, it must be said, represent the golden era of the Z-movies in Hollywood. Although there have been many classics, like 'A Streetcar Named Desire', 'High Noon' and 'Ben-Hur', this era is much remembered for those horror and science fiction flicks interested in the atomic age and monsters derived from it. Besides Wood's masterpieces, we can also mention 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms', 'It Came From Beneath the Sea' and the Japanese opus 'Gojira'.The 1950s is also an era where the studio system still prevails and the directors are always at the mercy of the producers who are the supreme authority and they own a veto over every aspect of the movies. And it can even go well outside of the movie. For example, in the 'Bride of the Monster' making, Wood is forced to modify his cast and even his ending in order to meet the requirements of his main financier. And for 'Plan 9', he must go under baptism (and so must his friends), so a group of Baptists will finance the picture. This adds even more to the incredible, as if the movies were not enough.Even if 'Ed Wood' contains numerous scenes showing the stupidity and the lack of talent of the protagonists, there's still some fair level of intelligence emerging from the picture and some goofy statements suddenly become full of sense. For example, Bela Lugosi, even if he's been addicted to morphine for twenty years and lost nearly every bit of his talent since he made 'Dracula', is able to deliver some interesting utterances, such as why the Dracula character is more interesting than the Frankenstein character and why women should love the classic 1930s horror movies from Universal.The actors from the movie are all tremendous, but two of them clearly stand above the others. Johnny Depp plays his Ed Wood role in an immaculate way. He knows how to write a script, how to shoot a picture and he's able to detect some qualities in people that very few would be able to see. That's why he casts Loretta King (Juliet Landau) just by watching her commanding in a restaurant.Depp also seems to be very comfortable when comes the time of wearing women's clothing, just like Wood did in real life as a transvestite.In the case of Martin Landau, the scale of his (Oscar-winning) performance is difficult to surround. Simply said, he is better as Lugosi than Lugosi himself was. His Hungarian accent is perfectly convincing and he delivers very interesting quotes ('This is the most uncomfortable coffin I've ever been in'). His relationship with Wood is touching and extraordinary. Lugosi finally meets someone who still believes in him and who is able to find him some new work.'Ed Wood' is without a doubt the greatest Tim Burton movie for the moment. The Ed Wood story couldn't have been directed by anybody else than him. Instead of ridiculing Wood, which would have been too much easy and far less interesting, Burton seems to celebrate him and making him a symbol for those who idolize movies and absolutely want to leave their mark in Hollywood, whatever the result be good or not. 'Ed Wood' is the ultimate proof that cinema is far more than a job and an art. It's mysticism.",10,0,0,3 June 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Fortunately, you won't be left cold
","The very best image of 'The Day After Tomorrow' is the very last one. We see Earth from space, but the entire land of the North hemisphere, instead of being green and brown, is completely white along with little parts from the seas and oceans. It's an inarguably eloquent proof of nature's powers.As far as I can remember, I never anticipated a movie that much than 'The Day After Tomorrow'. I won't hide it, I've always been a fan of disaster movies in my youth and the fact that there have never been so many cataclysms depicted one single movie is simply irresistible.Roland Emmerich should get some credit for being one of the rare mainstream filmmakers to voluntarily take on the problem of global warming. Even if the events depicted in his movie will evidently never occur, Emmerich gives us a rather convincing demonstration of what Mother Nature is able to accomplish.The concept, despite it's not surprising when you think it's Emmerich, is also unique in its own way. While Emmerich, by the past, made big-budget sci-fi disaster movies about enemies which can be vanquished (Independence Day, Godzilla, Eight Legged Freaks), he now presents a terrifying enemy which can never been defeated: nature itself.Unsurprisingly, special effects get almost all the place and the characters and the screenplay are made up with the budget that's left. However, the story is one of the best of Emmerich's career and some of the actors, especially Jake Gyllenhall (in his breakthrough role) and Emmy Rossum, give some gravity to the film.Action scenes and special FX are indescribable. I've never seen something like that before. Emmerich literally hired an army of special FX teams. Actually, there are 16 of them and they're lead by the reference in this domain: Industrial Light & Magic.The catastrophe sequences are extraordinary. Better than a thrill ride. It begins very quickly when the Antarctic ice shelf begins to detach itself and Jack Hall (the main character, played by Dennis Quaid) and his mates are stuck in the middle of it.Then, you see a hail storm hitting Tokyo. After that, it's the best of the lot: massive tornadoes hit Los Angeles. These scenes are better and more thrilling than in 'Twister' (so it's not little words) and the sound effects shake our eardrums. The chaos sound almost prevents us from hearing the characters' voices, which adds to the realism already brought.Then it's the massive tidal wave which swallows New York City and the second half of the movie begins. The main attraction becomes the superb superstorm which lethally freezes everything on its path. I'm sure that after seeing the superstorm scenes, you'll never watch the sky the same way.Emmerich seems to include some political satire in his movie. Vice president Becker owns a strong resemblance to actual vice president Dick Cheney. To be honest, it's the first that I see a vice president having more screen time in a movie than the president himself. And the United States political plans are spoofed as well. It's evident when you hear Becker refusing to pay for Kyoto Protocol and declaring that finances should be a priority before environment. Is it a message that is sent here? Let's hope so...The world will never actually freezes over. At least in the way shown here. But 'The Day After Tomorrow' sends its environment-caring message in a very shocking way and procures solid entertainment with its thrilling action scenes and its breathtaking special effects. This is easily Roland Emmerich's best movie and it is totally, the word is appropriate, cool.",6,0,1,22 August 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The darkest comedy of them all... and one of the funniest too!
","When 'Full Metal Jacket' was released in theaters in 1987, it was said that the timing couldn't have been worse because of the huge success of the movie 'Platoon' the year before, without adding the quantity of Academy Awards picked up by the Oliver Stone film. However, in January 1964, it was the exact opposite that was said about 'Dr. Strangelove'.Today, the Cold War issues remain present, but they're far less important than the scenario that was being drawn at the end of the year 1963, that is the moment where this classic Stanley Kubrick comedy was shot. It was the time of the 'Freezing War', the scary Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in the collective mind and the young President Kennedy was just being assassinated.That's when arrived this movie, which dared to show a nuclear apocalypse with a comic eye. But what could have been funny in there? It's possible to laugh of the mishaps of somebody other than ourselves, but when everybody is concerned, it's far less funny. Just remember the 9/11 aftermath, when rumors of WWIII surfaced...But Stanley Kubrick, being a master of virtually every genre, conceived an astoundingly funny comedy, skilfully mixing the suspense from a man-made end-of-the-world with the absurdity of the characters who act in, sometimes without knowing it.Kubrick worked with a talented screenwriter in the person of Terry Southern, but especially with prodigious actors. I'm evidently referring to Peter Sellers, whose three roles entered into the legend, and George C. Scott, whose role quality rivals with his Oscar-winning performance of General Patton in the movie 'Patton', released six years later.Based on the theme of the failure to communicate, the movie is set in three different places. Primo: the Burpleson Air Force Base, headed by General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a psychotic obsessed by fluoridation which 'saps and impurifies all of our precious bodily fluids'. His aide de camp is Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Sellers), a timid but highly competent English officer who doesn't buy Ripper's theories.Secundo: a B-52 piloted by Major 'King' Kong (western star Slim Pickens). We see Kong and his crew (which includes young James Earl Jones) preparing themselves to the nuclear strike and composing with unexpected difficulties which will provide even more thrills.Tertio: the Pentagon or more precisely, the War Room. It's there that the three most interesting characters of the story are located: President Merkin Muffley (Sellers), General Buck Turgidson (Scott) and hilarious mad scientist Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). They try to communicate with drunken Soviet president Kissoff, but in vain.'Dr. Strangelove' is among the greatest comedies ever made, but this statement isn't based upon the quantity of laughs that the movie unfolds. In fact, the first time I watched it, I only laugh wildly twice: when Turgidson stumbles in the War Room and when Dr. Strangelove is struggling with his uncontrollable alien right hand.Instead, 'Dr. Strangelove' plays on tongue-in-cheek humor and the absurdity of the characters, as well as some subtleties. The best example is the impossible names of the characters, which have almost all a sexual connotation. There's a list: Merkin Muffley, Turgidson, Kissoff, de Sadesky, Bat Guano and Jack D. Ripper. We also laugh of improbable messages or writings, like the post in the base on which it is written: 'Peace is our profession', at the moment where soldiers are fighting each other. There's also the useless ' NUCLEAR WARHEAD – HANDLE WITH CARE'.It is obvious that the movie wouldn't have been so successful without the exceptional performance of its three main actors. Peter Sellers is remarkably all-round and he's an unequaled master with different accents. His Dr. Strangelove role is probably the greatest of his career, even if the character himself appears on-screen for about ten minutes only.George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens are the other mentionable actors. Scott is very funny with his character who spends most of his time at chewing gum, making ridiculous facial expressions and insulting the 'Russkies'. Hayden is disturbing with his perpetual cigar and his monologues about fluoridation and 'Commies'. The orders he gives to his troops before the base attack are particularly absurd, especially when he says: 'Don't trust any man, except if you know him personally'. As for Pickens, he will always be remembered for his idiot but enjoyable-to-hear speeches and for his cowboy hat which he wears until the end, during the most memorable scene, where he rides the bomb like a matador riding a bull in a rodeo.Not only is this movie very funny, it's also very pessimistic. How many times do we speak of prejudices and no-confidence between people? Even at the end, when doomsday is unavoidable...And I've almost forgotten to mention the precious aid from production designer Ken Adam. Without him, there wouldn't be no War Room, this fictitious but pop culture-iconic room. The interior of the B-52 is also well-made.However, the plane exterior is the main problem of the film. To suspend a plane model in front of the camera with a Russian land background is a big disappointment, especially when we know how fussy director Kubrick is.But from the opening title sequence, where a plane refueling looks like a jumbo-size sexual act, to the final scene, where a sequence of nuclear explosions is accompanied by the famous Vera Lynn song 'We'll Meet Again', it's guaranteed that 'Dr. Strangelove' never bores. Even if universal peace happens someday, we'll watch this movie with a large smile and a satisfied mood. That's what we call a timeless classic...",10,7,13,2 July 2007
Alien," Houston, we have a nightmare
","« In space, no-one can hear you scream » That line has become so famous and it's the definite way to talk about 'Alien'. To be honest, I'm not the kind of guy who would openly show his feelings when watching a movie. I've never screamed while watching a movie and I didn't with 'Alien' neither. But it doesn't necessarily mean that I wasn't scared.Because I was.'Alien' is the definitive sci-fi-meets-horror flick. There had been a lot of B-movies produced in the first years of the Cold War which focused on terrifying monsters from outer space but they mostly failed to capture our terror. 'Alien' does, and this is because of many reasons.First, it's important to tell the synopsis. I'll be brief because this is a rather simple one. Somewhere in the future (when exactly, you ask? is it supposed to matter?), the Nostromo heads back to Earth after a mining expedition, somewhere (where exactly, you ask? same answer).They arrive on an exotic planet where they receive an odd signal. They discover a huge... structure, where there's an odd pod containing odd eggs. Kane (John Hurt) wants to examine one of them, but before he could do any scientific comment, an odd creature (with tentacles) hugs to his head.Kane is eventually brought back to the Nostromo. Bad move...The most famous (and hideous) scene in the movie happens when the alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The remaining 90 minutes becomes a non-stop chase aboard the space ship in order to eradicate this extra-terrestrial 'serial killer'.'Alien' is both minimalist and naturalist. Minimalist because of the simple concept, the small number of characters (nine: the seven crew members, Jones the cat and the alien) and the small screen time of the thing itself. In fact, the alien is only portrayed when he's about to attack. When it's already too late... That approach is genius.Naturalism now. Director Ridley Scott and his own crew members from the visual effects, decoration and make-up departments all own a great deal of reality in this sci-fi movie. The Nostromo is not shown as a toy and the crew is divided in classes, exactly like in a capitalistic system. This system is depicted in the way that it supposedly leads to the problems, which could give this movie a pro-socialist or pro-communist mood (you don't have to believe me, you know...).The disgusting scenes of the face-hugging creature dissection, the alien escaping from Kane's chest and Ash (Ian Holm) being stalked are at the same time horrible and realistic, which gives even more power to the movie.'Alien' is also one of the first movies to have a strong woman as the heroine. Sigourney Weaver became a star with her portrayal of courageous and intelligent officer Ripley. And she rightfully owns that kind of reception. I loved Weaver's performance.I also loved the special effects. The visual effect services are used for the famous and original title sequence and the 2001-inspired explosion of the Nostromo near the end. The silence which precedes the alien's attacks is almost a necessity in that kind of movie but it's used to perfection. It brings thrills when it needs to.Many psychedelic followers would tell you that space is a dream place. 'Alien' shows what happens when it becomes a nightmare.'Alien' is not only a great sci-fi movie, but it's also a terrifyingly good horror flick. The aspects of both genres are mixed at the point that none of them predominates over the other. And those who like only one of the genres won't be disappointed, even if they don't like the other part.I just can't wait to show the movie to my sister. She isn't a sci-fi fan but I know that she likes horror flicks. I hope she'll love 'Alien'. But I have a pretty good feeling.",9,1,3,12 April 2007
Taxi Driver," He's God's lonely man... and we love him!
","'Taxi Driver' comes to the screen on the year of the bicentennial of the United States of America. It should be a year of celebration, pride and solidarity. However, the atmosphere of this masterpiece from young Martin Scorsese (he was 33 at the film's release) inspires the very opposite. 'Taxi Driver' wants to be depressing et pessimistic and its vision of America, especially of its supreme city, is everything but happy.The story of 'Taxi Driver' is about Travis Bickle, a young insomniac ex-Marine who takes a job as a taxi driver. He tours the streets of New York City, which are continually populated with prostitutes, pimps and 'Negros' from Harlem with the jazzy music of the pleasant Bernard Herrmann soundtrack. Travis' only wish is that someday 'a real rain come and wash the scum off the streets'.It's Robert De Niro who plays Travis and he lives in his character like in a second skin. When we see him in the beginning, he seems to be absolutely normal and he looks like all of those innocent characters whose only desire is to have a good worthwhile job, even if it should be tiresome or boring. However, we can quickly perceive that he's the only person of his kind and he's also about to blow off.Desperate to connect with others, Travis invites Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a pretty young woman who works for the electoral committee of Senator Palantine (do not confuse with the emperor Palpatine, even if the spelling looks alike), for a date. Travis, however, makes a gross mistake when he brings her to a porno movie, the only hobby that Travis knows.After buying a rather unreasonable number of firearms from a black market vendor, Travis' mental state quickly deteriorates and he becomes addicted to violence with the miniature army that he bought and his days in Vietnam don't help him. He simulates shootouts in front of his mirror in his apartment and of these simulations lead to the now famous monologue 'You talking' to me?'.Eventually, Travis tries to 'save' a young 12Â½-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) by attempting to persuade her to free herself from his pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel with long hair). It's at that moment that Travis breaks down.He shaves his hair and adopts a Mohawk hairstyle and he becomes almost unrecognizable. He attempts to assassinate Palantine himself (which would infamously inspire John Hinckley), and in one of the most terrifying sequences I've seen in my life, Travis launches a blood bath by killing all those who want to get too close from Iris.Describing himself until that moment as 'God's lonely man', Travis then gets a lot of attention in the media for courageously killing gangsters and saving a little girl from NYC's decaying culture and then sending her back to her parents. Everybody sees Travis as a hero. But is he really? By attempting to erase the 'scum' off the streets, he practically became part of it. It's a vicious circle. It's a pessimistic vision from Scorsese on the indomitable city of New York, a world without mercy where nobody can get off without being affected.'Taxi Driver' is very bold. And it's for that reason that it remains so striking, even more than thirty years later. It's a very crude film. Its presentation is crude. Its vision of the world and of the city are crude. And especially, its violence is crude. We see little violence, but when it comes out, it doesn't leave anybody indifferent.The violence that Travis manifests at the end of the movie is simply the fact that he makes visible to everybody what was previously invisible because it was kept hidden in his mind. We can assist to the deterioration of his mental state and we feel that he could crack at any moment. In the end, with good thinking, the violence that he shows is shocking and terrifying, but it's not that surprising.It's definitely a worrying look, not only upon New York, but also America in its entirety. New York is not the only city in the United States and its problems are not unique to it. 'Taxi Driver' is the story of an idealist who wanted to change the world and make it better. And he decided to do it without caring too much about the means.The movie's ending is ultra-violent, but the bad guys are dead anyway. Is it a happy ending anyway? I think it's the choice of the viewer. Everything depends on how the viewer takes on Scorsese's vision. If the viewer decides that it's a happy ending, it means that he/she is optimistic and believes that it is possible for us to change the world in a good and significant way. If the viewer believes that it's a sad ending, then he/she is pessimistic and doesn't believe that we can really free ourselves from the mess that is American society.In the end, it can summarized this way: if you think it's a happy ending, you're like Travis Bickle. If you don't, you rather are like Martin Scorsese.'Taxi Driver' won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival in 1976. It's a fully deserved honor, because it's a really revolutionary film. I wonder that if it didn't win the Oscar for Best Movie (an honor that rather went to 'Rocky'), it's only because it was too hard for the jury's taste who wasn't ready to accept the reality or who refuted Scorsese's ideology shown in the movie. They preferred a typical film with a happy ending rather than a cold and cruel picture destined to cause some discomfort in the population.However, it's a very enjoyable discomfort. Unless you prefer to live in your inside world.",10,0,1,30 May 2007
Full Metal Jacket," Ermey gets the job well done
","It took seven years to Stanley Kubrick for finding a subject for his next movie after 'The Shining' in 1980. He decided to keep on the flowing amount of movies about Vietnam War and directed his own Nam vision, less than a year after 'Platoon''s victorious night at the Academy Awards ceremony.If you start up with that point, that's not very good news. When a movie like 'Platoon' almost sweeps the Oscars, it's hard to believe that another film about the same subject or so will come out in theaters and look as great as the former movie.Hard to believe, but that happens. At least, a good hour of it. I give the movie 9 stars, but there are two parts in it which are not on the same level.The first part is by far the best and it would deserve a enthusiastic 10/10. In fact, this is an obligatory part which the other Nam movies forgot to tell about. A group of Marine volunteers enter into the Parris Island instruction camp, and after a quick haircut montage on the air of Johnny Wright's 'Hello Vietnam'. Right after that comes the meat of the movie.It's the entrance of GySgt Hartman, masterfully embodied by real-life DI R Lee Ermey. Hartman owns the task of turning the innocent boys into 'ministers of death praying for war'. The best way to make it is to yell constantly, shouting explicit phrases and beat them physically when necessary.And Ermey is excellent, and this is an euphemism. Almost entirely ad-libbing his text (a rarity in Kubrick movies), Ermey never repeats himself and he never lifts a doubt about his menacing quotes. 'Full Metal Jacket' is about soldiers but is the only one which also focuses on their training and there couldn't have been a better way to portray it.Ermey's role is already a part of the legend. He could appear in any kind of movie after this one, but this character will live forever in 'Full Metal Jacket'.The remaining 'maggots' are many, but we only get to know four of them. There's main character Joker, who is an arrogant and humorous but intelligent soldier. There's also Cowboy from Texas, black Snowball and another legendary character: over-weight Gomer Pyle (a really good performance by Vincent D'Onofrio.The second part of the movie takes place in Nam but it gets an 8/10. Instead of covering almost-unreachable Vietnamese forests, Kubrick focuses on destroyed villages. This particular setting is not exactly a winner, especially because we all know now that the director didn't want to shoot in Vietnam, result of a fear of flying.On another point, it's interesting to see the effect of Vietnam War on the soldiers. On this point, 'Full Metal Jacket' goes a little bit aside of the others: war doesn't drive soldiers crazy, they already are before they leave American soil. This is perfectly reflected in Pyle's transformation from a maggot to a skilled, almost insane killer. This is the kind of message that puts 'Jacket' above the other ones.Other than Hartman and Gomer Pyle, the only really interesting character of the lot is Joker, played by Matthew Modine. While the two former men are great, they're still two-dimensional. Joker has a much more interesting personality, dominated by his moral ambiguity. He is smart and has a strong sense of morality but he desperately wants to kill somebody. This duality (which even Joker acquiesces) is well shown through his 'Born to Kill' helmet and his peace pin.After World War I with 'Paths of Glory', Cold War with 'Dr. Strangelove' and Seven Years War with 'Barry Lyndon', Stanley Kubrick shows that he still has a knack for war movies. It doesn't resound as strong as his other war films, but we have to admit that he raises the bar pretty high by himself. That's probably why some critics were left cold somehow. But it's a really good movie.This movie isn't the strongest Kubrick film of all, but it's another unmissable hit and still is one of the greatest war movies ever made.",9,0,0,15 May 2006
Forrest Gump," Run, Forrest, run!
","There was a Quebec poet-singer named Félix Leclerc who sang a song which began with these words: 'Moi, mes souliers ont beaucoup voyagé'. In English, it means: 'Me, my shoes have traveled a lot.' So, just watching the opening scenes from the movie, where the camera zooms on Forrest's shoes, made me understand that Forrest Gump was that kind of guy, too.In fact, Forrest's journey began right after the end of World War II and it went on throughout all of the baby-boom generation events 'till 1982, where his childhood sweetheart, who became his wife, died of AIDS.But what Forrest Gump never understood is that any single event of his life would have been a lifelong dream for somebody else. Everyone on Earth would die for a single sight of the President of the United States. Well, Forrest personally met three of them (Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon) and he never realized how lucky he was. And that's a single element of his existence.Forrest Gump's character is played by Tom Hanks, a role which deserved him the Best Actor Oscar for a second-straight year (he won for 'Philadelphia' in 1993). But it's very easy to understand. I think that Hanks' performance is one of the most brilliant interpretations of any kind in the history of cinema.Also brilliant are Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn, who play respectively Lt. Dan Taylor (Forrest's superior in Vietnam) and Jenny (the girl of whom Forrest has a crush on). While Forrest is a very lucky guy, Taylor and Jenny are mostly down on their own luck. Taylor lost his legs during the Vietnam war and after the war, he depended on the government for living and became an alcoholic. Jenny had the bad luck of having a cruel and abusive father and she met a lot of men who weren't as tender as her childhood friend Forrest was. She even became addicted to drugs during the hippie movement and she contemplated suicide for a while.But it's Hanks' performance that really makes this movie a unique one. Not only does Hanks put all of his skills into Forrest's interpretation, helped by young Michael Conner Humphreys,but the script is also a gem. It shows a character whose innocence is still a part of him, like if he still was a child. Forrest's IQ is very low, but his physical shape is great (especially in his legs) and he's led by his heart, which is as big as his own Alabama estate.Visual effects are magnificent. It's one rare movie that features state-of-the-art special effects in such a drama. Most of the time, this kind of effects are featured in genres such as action, adventure, fantasy or science fiction. I loved to see Gary Sinise without his legs and the feather movement in the opening and the closing scenes. But the most astonishing of all is the interaction between Forrest and famous people, such as presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, and also Elvis Presley and John Lennon.So, all in all, 'Forrest Gump' is a unique movie. It's a great historical drama, featuring one of the most recognizable characters ever conceived and it's a very enjoyable showcase of one of the greatest historical periods ever. It means that I perfectly understand why did this movie win the Academy Award for Best Picture. However, this award should have belonged to 'Pulp Fiction'...",8,0,2,3 June 2006
Predator," Good action picture, but it could have been great
","It must be said right now: 'Predator' is one of the rare good action movies to see the light today. The problem is that it could have been great...Starring the indestructible Arnold Schwarzenegger, 'Predator' is an audacious and inventive movie, doing a great mix of action, science fiction, horror and exotic destinations. And that just before the film's director John McTiernan come up with his masterpiece 'Die Hard'.Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, an American military officer dispatched somewhere in Latin America. His crew has to find and rescue a small group of American hostages captured by guerrillas in the jungle. According to Dutch, this mission seems to be only a walk in the park (or in the rain-forest, if you prefer...).In fact, it is. The guerrillas' camp is quickly knocked down by Dutch and his mates and the Latino soldiers of fortune are all eliminated. But neither Dutch, nor anyone of his colleagues could have predicted what would follow...In the way of the Xenomorph in 'Alien', the soldiers are killed one by one in an horrible and disgusting way by what looks like to be an invisible figure.The Predator, thus we have to name it, is rather an extra-terrestrial whose 'hunting' outfit contains super-powerful weapons, an ultra-perfected camouflage mode, a mask that looks like those from Polynesian people and a rasta 'hairstyle'... By the way, we get to see its true (and very ugly, should I say it) face at the very end of the movie only, simply to imply that the people who are responsible of the presentation do not twist their thumbs...The movie 'Predator' starts pretty well. The three skinned corpses give a gruesome foretaste of things to come and they are even more convincing than those that we would see four years later in the famous 'Silence of the Lambs'.In fact, the soldiers are killed one by one and each one in a different method. So it avoids to give a repetitive mood to the film and it also avoids from giving to the viewer a feeling of non-surprise. On the contrary, horror and gore are always there, victim after victim.But what really draws the attention, it's the Predator itself. Its creation and its movements required the use of very sophisticated special effects for its era and nothing has been left at random in order to make the creature even more frightening and also more exciting to watch.What made the movie famous, it's probably the audacious, ingenious and inventive use of the thermal camera. This method strengthens the existing parallel between 'Predator' and 'Jaws'. Not only that the two main 'antagonists' kill their preys one by one, but we never really see them in the first hour. Instead of that, a special viewing point is taken for each of them. In 'Jaws', it's the underwater swimmers' legs. In 'Predator', it's the thermal camera.We must not forget the enemy's 'camouflage' either. Remember: the time is 1987. That means: no computers. Because today, recreating the curved mirror-like effect would be a child's play. But in the context of the time where the movie was created, it was a prodigious technique. And even today, it still stuns, even if it became easier.The greatest adversary of the Predator is also very good. Schwarzenegger is surprising in this film and his stature of former bodybuilder helps him instead of attracting prejudices, because he's not the only character in this movie who has mountains instead of biceps. In fact, I think that it's his best role (after the Terminator, of course).And to crown everything, the jungle becomes an entity within itself, as in 'Platoon', thus fueling the thrills that give the Predator hunt.Unfortunately, the movie contains massive mistakes. In fact, 'Predator' is an almost-perfect film for the first hour, or hour and a quarter. It's when there's only Schwarzenegger left to kill that everything changes. The action scenes, which were previously well-orchestrated and rather realistic, suddenly become laughable and ridiculous. Instead of killing Dutch, the alien doesn't seem to notice that he's there at all (problem of vision?) and when it has the possibility to kill him single-handedly, it doesn't. Why? I imagine that it's because the story has to end well and the hero must survive. Dutch also builds traps in order to kill his enemy. But just by watching his actions, I searched in vain, but I couldn't find the instruction manual in the scenery...Fortunately that 'Predator' has a strong start, because the falling in the final act would certainly have annihilated it. Still, it's a good action picture that is worth seeing.",6,3,10,10 May 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," The second sequel cure
","Do you know the first sequel syndrome and the second sequel cure? The first sequel syndrome happens when the sequel in question is of far inferior quality from its predecessor, often because it uses the same formulas, but the result gives a pretentious look to the final cut of the movie. Generally, it means more action, more explosions, more spectacle... and less brains.The second sequel cure refers to the process which involves that the director or the producer (or both) becomes aware of the mistakes made in the second movie and tries to correct them by presenting a third movie that is closer in presentation to the first movie or by changing almost everything to avoid feelings of déjà vu or pretension.'The Matrix' was exceptional, a real masterpiece. 'The Matrix Reloaded' was suffering from the first sequel syndrome. But the Wachowski Brothers applied the second sequel cure and this gives 'The Matrix Revolutions', a far more satisfying effort than its direct predecessor, without reaching the level of perfection of the original one.The storyline of the third film starts immediately after the end of the second one, thus putting a contrast with the latter which began six months after the end of the first movie. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is unconscious in the real world, but his mind is elsewhere, somewhere between the Matrix and the Machine world.The bad news is that the Machines are about to attack Zion (with their 250,000 sentinels) and the humans' chances don't appear to be very high. Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are thus heading for Machine City where they hope to find a way to stop the war.The Matrix series, somehow like the Star Wars saga, lies almost entirely on visual content and much less on the characters. They can be cardboard, it doesn't stop the filmmakers.What I didn't like from 'The Matrix Reloaded' was the special effects which looked rather 'recycled' and simply upgraded from the first movie. The sequences of the fight and the highway crazy chase looked interminable.What I liked from 'The Matrix Revolutions' was the freshness brought in the treatment of the special effects and the fighting sequences. Apart from the final fight between Neo et Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), the special effects and the action sequences are almost all set in the real world. That means that the effects of bullet time and time-slicing are somehow left apart. This single fact is already a positive thing.I especially liked the fight between Neo et Smith (as Bane) inside the Logos ship. The climax, where Neo see a fiery Smith, is profoundly chilling and almost look like a horror film extract.I also appreciated the performance from Ian Bliss, who plays Bane who is possessed by Smith. Bliss is spectacular in his ways of re-creating Smith by speaking like him and by having the same facial expressions. A big cheer for him.But it must also be said that Smith himself got promoted in a way of speaking. He was the main villain in the first film and only one of the main in the second one. But here, he finally completed his transition from simple villain to super-villain, a bit in the style of Lex Luthor or the numerous James Bond enemies.The Battle of Zion is also of a prodigious grandeur and magnificence. The battle is long, but it is so captivating that it never becomes interminable.In fact, nothing is interminable in 'The Matrix Revolutions'. Not even the final combat between Neo and Smith. Both fighters are about from the same strength and their confrontation is long. But unlike the fight between Neo and the clones in the second movie, it is not interminable. And there's a reason to that: everybody knows at that moment that the upcoming battle will be the last one. So we want to see all how it's going to end, regardless of the amount of time it will take. But it must be said that the Wachowski Bros. know how to make the suspense last.What sparked controversy among fans, ordinary moviegoers and film critics is the film's conclusion. And in a sense, I support them. The movie's ending is terribly complex, perhaps even more than the legendary final puzzle from '2001: A Space Odyssey'. But in another sense, it's better that way.Why? Because the conclusions from the first two movies were so simple and banal that they sadly looked like a typical ending from a Hollywood flick. The ending of the third movie (and consequently, the whole series) shows that there's some creative renewal from the directors' part and succeeds in showing that the series remain intellectual until the very end, even if it has lost some parts previously.To summarize all of this, we can take the famous phrase of the Oracle (Mary Alice): 'Everything that has a beginning has an end' and change it for: 'Everything that is mysterious has an explication'. And like any ambiguous ending, it will become the target of many speculations by the fans of the series, thus showing that the Matrix stimulates the minds till the end.There also are mystical, almost poetic moments, like that famous scene where the Logos goes over the dark clouds of the 'desert of the real', allowing Neo and Trinity to see the real sun for the first time.'The Matrix Revolutions' mixes up the purity with the artificiality. The purity of eternal love between Neo and Trinity and the purity of the battles set in the real world. The artificiality of the special effects, of the machines and of the Matrix itself. And this blend of the real and the fake works without causing any malfunction, or almost.After a disappointing first sequel, 'The Matrix Revolutions' fulfills its task and makes sure that the series doesn't crash down.",7,0,0,19 July 2007
The Shining," 'The Shining' will ice your guts
","Every film genre has its own characteristics. So does horror. There are some golden rules and hints that some directors totally forget to check out before or while they shoot their movie.First of all, horror is not visual. It's mental. Your eyes can't judge whether something is scary or not. It's your brain that does. Eyes are only a tool.Many contemporary directors shoot their horror films by putting visually-dazzling images and think that it will do the job. But it's what's inside that counts...Stanley Kubrick understood that. But he did more than that. What Kubrick did with 'The Shining' is that he created that is as scary by its visuals than its mental representations.The reason why Stanley Kubrick succeeds in every genre he works with is because he searches for the most essential essence of each one of them and exploits it the effective way.While the majority of filmmakers effectively work with zombies (George A. Romero) or vicious serial killers (John Carpenter) which could become menaces themselves, Kubrick works with a haunted hotel, filled with ghosts, which aim a particular target: mind. And there's nothing that can be done about it.The three main actors are the main reason why 'The Shining' is such a masterpiece. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is the main target of the Overlook's ghosts and his peaceful existence is quickly turned upside down by what happens. Kubrick's choice of casting him was controversial because he already looked slightly insane, even in normal mode. That might be true, but we must admit that, once put in berserk mode, nobody is as maniacal as Jack Nicholson. And the actor proves it in a chilling way here.Shelley Duvall, often mentally-challenged by director Kubrick during the production, is very effective as Wendy Torrance. And especially at the end, when Jack crashes the bathroom's door and when she meets ghosts herself.But my predilection goes to Danny Lloyd, who plays Danny Torrance. He's probably the most effective of all the actors present in the movie. His cold face and his dramatic voice are appalling.As it's a Kubrick film, it's inevitable that special camera tricks and movements should be present. In 'The Shining', we quickly think about the legendary use of the Steadicam during Danny's ride in the hotel's corridors and the maze excursions. Kubrick's trademark zoom moves were heavily used in his previous movies, but they've never been as effective as here. Zooms perfectly catch the scary moods expressed by the characters and create a sense of suspense and fear, which is what's needed in such a movie. There are also these almost-one-frame shots, which are effectively scary and thrilling.There are numerous unforgettable moments and lines during the movie and some of them have become a part of modern pop culture. Some lines, such as 'Redrum', 'All work and no Play make Jack a dull boy' and the chilling 'Here's Johnny!' are now considered as icons of the horror genre.Some of the scariest scenes include the two hypnotic girls in blue dresses that Danny meets and Jack's smashing down the door with an axe. But the scariest scene of the movie is Dick's murder. Jack kills Dick and, at the same moment, Danny screams in his hiding place, due to his 'shining' gift.'The Shining' is a horror masterpiece, because it goes deep in the delicate parts of our minds and the way that these scares are depicted is as delicious as a Halloween candy. So don't waste your time in watching ridiculous 'trailer' movies, made to be Kraft dinner for your eyes. Just remember that movies like 'The Shining' contain the pure fluids of the horror genre and must be watched before today's horror messes. It gives you more adrenaline wherever you watch it and by renting it and watching it at home, you save money.And just a friendly advice: don't watch it before going to bed.

Being John Malkovich," '... this is a very odd thing. It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.'
","When we talk about bad movies, we often say that they are so because they are weird, strange or because they don't make any sense at all. But 'Being John Malkovich' is just too much weird and too much complicated to be rated as a bad movie.John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer who lives with a dog, a talking parrot, a chimpanzee and an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as his wife.Craig badly needs money, so he takes a job as a filing clerk and he works for a New York firm located on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan building.Things just get even stranger when Craig discovers a secret tiny doorway that leads him directly into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich). After having lived a quarter of hour into Malkovich's head, Craig is ejected from it and mysteriously finds himself on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike, just outside New York City.Craig and his new colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) have the idea of making people who want to live the same experience pay for it. So, Craig and Maxine 'rent' Malkovich's mind fifteen minutes at a time and people become a famous Hollywood actor for that amount of time.'Being John Malkovich' is directed by Spike Jonze, better known for his numerous music videos, and masterfully written by Charlie Kaufman. His screenplay is brilliant and of an almost unreached level of originality and perfectly allies surrealism and the philosophy of mind.Jonze evidently does a great job in the director's chair, with some astonishing and breathtaking moments. Unfortunately for him, Kaufman is the real star of this movie and so is his simply unreal and completely crazy story. At some moments, we could find ourselves wondering what does Kaufman have in his mind, if he didn't simply put his brain on autopilot and went on a wave of automatic writing.Only a few examples are enough to illustrate my point of view. First of all, we get to know that Craig's wife works in a pet store, but is it a good reason to keep a dog, a talking parrot and a chimpanzee named Elijah in their apartment? And then, we get to wonder how can people work on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a building. And when we finally get the 'rational' explanation, we wonder why we asked that question instead of shutting up.And the characters we get to meet are not any more normal. The first example is the secretary who interprets every word wrong. Then, Craig's new boss, Dr. Lester, who is 105-year-old and who drinks almost exclusively carrot juice, which explains why he 'pisses orange'.But except the surrealist moments, the movie is also one of the most thought-provoking and philosophical motion pictures of the recent years. Actually, 1999 seems to be the year of philosophy in Hollywood with the releases of 'John Malkovich', 'The Matrix' and 'Fight Club'.The film cleverly plays with the themes of identity, celebrity and the body/soul union. Is living for a moment as a famous person is worth it? Is it legitimate? And if it was really possible, would there be a real danger of 'playing' with a person like the characters of the movie do? 'Being John Malkovich' is an intellectual comedy drama unlike any other. And the first term is the most important of the three. With such a mix of surrealism and philosophy, it's definitely not a movie for the weak minds. You have to love these two things and complicated stories as well, or else you're gonna quit on this movie about halfway through.And the most controversial aspect of the film is the relationship between Maxine and Cameron Diaz as long as the events pass. There are moments that are gonna put some people away, if they are not instantly outraged and/or scandalized.With everything I've said about the movie, there's only one adequate way to describe it : it's a movie that takes chances. And this attitude gets rewarded by the viewers' admiration and amazement.I perfectly understand that it's not everybody who's gonna love 'Being John Malkovich'. But I believe that it's a movie that deserves to be watched. Not necessarily loved, but watched for sure. Because we have to salute the originality, the eccentricity and the vision of every artist involved into this project.'Being John Malkovich' is one of the rare proofs that we can both stimulate our mind and our moralities by watching Hollywood actors. And this fact is enough for us to appreciate the movie as a whole.",8,1,2,28 May 2008
Ocean's Eleven," The greatest sin of Sin City
","There are some stories which you know from the start that it won't be worth five-star. The only thing you can do is making the best with what you have and hope that it will be worth the try. Caper movies are like that. It's too much unbelievable, high-tech gadgetry is overly used and robbers rarely appear to be real human beings.'Ocean's Eleven' is that kind of movie, but the major difference between it and the other heist movies is that it works well, whatever the difficulties might be. Directed by the always excellent Steven Soderbergh and starring Soderbergh's favorite George Clooney as the title role, 'Ocean's Eleven' is one of the best heist movies since a very long time and I appreciated every bit of it, from the first to the last second.Released about six months after the disappointing and violence-laden '3000 Miles to Graceland', 'Eleven' only focuses on the complicated and meticulous planning of the robbery and the robbery itself, instead of making it a silly and looking-easy launching element, like in '3KMTG'. And that's all we need. We don't need an aftermath with stupid inner battles about who's gonna keep the loot and what is gonna happen to the robbers' associations. There's also a surprisingly low amount of violence and there is no gunfight and no car chase, which is well-welcomed in that domain.In a sense, it's like 'The Score' from the same year, but on a much larger and more spectacular scale. Instead of two guys stealing a single scepter in a federal building of Montreal, you get eleven guys who try to rob $160,000,000 from three casinos in Las Vegas.The eleven guys are the following ones: Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a charismatic and professional thief who's leading the operation; Rusty (Brad Pitt), Ocean's loyal right-hand man; Reuben (Elliot Gould), an extravagant casino owner who is also a longtime friend of Danny and Rusty; Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), two very dysfunctional brothers from Utah; Livingston (Eddie Jemison), the electronic specialist; Basher (Don Cheadle), a bomb expert; Yen (Shaobo Kin), a Chinese acrobat; Saul (Carl Reiner), a con artist; Frank (Bernie Mac), a croupier and Linus (Matt Damon), a young pickpocket who becomes the rookie of the gang which makes that he's not aware of the strict rules and codes of the caper game.That's a very long list of characters. But the casting has some kind of genius. The characters are so different and so good that we never lose ourselves among them. It's not like in 'Platoon', where the casting is some kind of labyrinth.When you listen to Ocean describing the vault and all of the obstacles that await the 'Eleven Team', you wonder how they're gonna make it in the most realistic way possible. Well, the screenplay is so well crafted that it can only make the viewer satisfied. Screenwriters include plot twists and safe-cracking elements without losing themselves in the complex storyline. And some scenes are so surprising that they're funny. Not ridiculous. Funny.The boxing championship tournament is an excellent background and it's good to see Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko marching pass the crowd in the MGM Grand arena. The way that Soderbergh pictures the scenes give some grandeur to this event, which is not something that every filmmaker do.Anyway, every Vegas spot is well shot and it makes you see that Sin City is not an ordinary America town. The crowds' reactions to the provoked black-out are eye-catching and brilliant. The final 'Team' scenes near the Bellaggio fountains are gorgeous and beautiful. So, all in all, every shot is well done...George Clooney is good as Danny Ocean. He's as cool and charismatic as he looks, but he ends up getting too much Mr. I-know-all for me. But every character does the adequate job. Julia Roberts' performance is very mixed, but when she's good, she's good for real. Her relationship with Terry Benedict, the casino owner played by Andy Garcia, is not very convincing, but her loyalty for Danny Ocean is quite good.Directed on a very epic scale with an incredible list of A-rated Hollywood actors, 'Ocean's Eleven' is a real success, from the very first scenes to the very last scenes. No less, no more. It's a pure delight.",7,0,1,29 July 2006
Independence Day," A movie to love a lot or to spit on
","I know that I've recently written many reviews about sci-fi pics or other special-effects-laden movies and that I've inserted several comparisons with 'Independence Day', without reviewing the latter movie. Well now, this is a thing of the past and here is my 'ID4' review.We can't talk about 'ID4' without talking about the visual effects involved here. From the beginning, ie. with the arrival of the mother ship above the Moon, till the final battle, which leaves every spaceship destroyed, a lot of laser and missile shots, explosions, eardrum-hurting sounds and other surprises occur.That's because 'ID4' primarily is a special-effects machine. These are incredible and harrowing visual effects. I haven't seen this movie in a theater, but I guess it would have shaken the walls and the screen, along with the produced sounds. Sounds are a primordial aspect of the movie. They give to the spaceships a terrifying and monster scream when they come through the atmosphere and hover over the cities (nice wordplay here...). Explosions are eye-catching and the fire waves which break on LA, NYC and Washington are astonishing.But the problem is you can't do a good movie with over-the-top special effects and a storyline bought in a Dollar Tree store. It's surprising that the movie is called 'Independence Day' because it itself depends on its visual and sound tricks... Show the example, they say...With some very iny-tiny exceptions, the storyline and the actors are no more than weak. The story elements are built like in the Bible: they say a lot of things, but they don't give the details about anything. We know the facts, but that's all. For example, we attempt to communicate with the visitors with a helicopter equipped with powerful projectors, which send light spots that are supposed to be some kind of message. What does the sequential message means? It's so cheesy that I guess it's the reason why the aliens shot the copter.We're introduced to cheap characters into the movie. Jeff Goldblum, best known for his Ian Malcolm appearance in 'Jurassic Park', is David, a Jewish computer whiz who appears to be the only person in the world who's able to find the aliens' signals, how to interpret them and how to defeat them. It's far from a great performance. He's able to track the signals, while the NASA, the ESA and the different armies are not? Talk about something! Bill Pullman is the President of the United States. He's apparently the youngest president that the country ever had and, as we can hear, he was a fighter pilot during the Gulf War, which occurred only 5 years before the movie was released! Other (cheap) performances include Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an alcoholic ex-fighter pilot in the Nam War, who suffered a post-traumatic incident that makes him believe that he's been abducted by extraterrestrials. Well, guess what? He's about to become the Earth's savior! There is also Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun, an Area 51 scientist who looks like an insane modern Victor Frankenstein, and James Rebhorn, who is the Secretary of Defense, but he acts like if he was in the George W. Bush cabinet, with his words, his ideals and his attitude.The only actor who delivers a fair performance is Will Smith, who gets his breakthrough role here. He is Captain Steven Hiller, a hot-shot pilot from the El Toro base. He's the most entertaining character of the lot and it's always enjoyable to watch him.Aliens are briefly described in various parts of the movie. They're mostly a nomad people and their technology is told to be much superior from ours. This is surprising, especially when you watch the end of the movie, when Jeff Goldblum's character is single-handedly able to send a virus into their system. Our technology is already able to produce anti-viruses and theirs is not? Help me, I don't understand...And finally, let's not forget that patriotic mood that swarms into the movie. It's present from the very first scene, which shows the American flag planted on the Moon's surface, till the very last one with typical fireworks from the Fourth of July's festivities. And among that, you even have the movie's title that's implied into this.An interesting essay subject for film students, a crowd-pleasing experience and an anti-intellectual presentation. That's what 'ID4' is. And while it won an Academy Award and became the highest-grossing movie of 1996, there's not a lot to cherish here. But if you just want to get entertained and to escape reality for a moment, 'ID4' is more efficient than smoking marijuana. And that's enough to justify its existence.",5,0,1,16 June 2006
Batman Begins," One of the greatest comebacks in Hollywood history
","The first time I watched 'Batman Begins', I only gave it a 5 or a 6, I couldn't remember. Watching it for the second time, I knew where I went wrong the first time I rated it.It's only because I compared it to the other four movies of the Batman franchise. But 'Batman Begins' is so different from the other films that it cannot be classed as part from this franchise. Director Christopher Nolan has literally created the Batman Franchise 2.And like Tim Burton did in the first series of movies, Nolan brings an explosive, surprising and visually-dazzling adventure which gives hope to those who thought that Batman's movie career died because of Joel Schumacher's ill-fated vision.Burton's Gothic landscape of Gotham City is dead too, but some characteristics remain. Essentially the dark and sinister atmosphere that flows on the town. Instead, Gotham City looks like a modern metropolis and we can feel that the action happens nowadays. I can interpret this as a mean for getting closer to the spectator, which is welcomed.In a global way, every aspect of the movie is designed in order to give a more realistic look to Batman. Not only visually, but psychologically and socially. And especially psychologically.The introduction shows a Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) full of rage and despair after his parents were murdered in front of his eyes. This event deeply traumatized him and his desire of vengeance brings him to the Far East. There, he meets mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who is a member of the powerful and secret organization known as the League of Shadows, which operates for global justice in very unique and arguable ways.Ducard teaches Wayne how to fight his enemies and how to canalize his rage and his fears. The young billionaire returns to his manor and, with the help of his butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a scientist working for Wayne Enterprises, Wayne becomes the hero that we all know: the Caped Crusader himself.Christopher Nolan sounded like a risky choice for the role of director. 'Memento' and 'Insomnia' were impressive psychological thrillers, but a superhero film (especially from a shattered franchise) is not the same ballpark. But surprisingly, Nolan doesn't change his techniques and that's what helps the movie working.Nolan gives a lot of attention to the psychology of his characters (something that Burton and Schumacher did in a minimalist way) and his unique special effects are dazzling, exciting and adequately nightmarish.Some scenes are catchier than others. But I think that the movie's trademark is the horror images coming from the toxin that plays a major role in the story. The shimmering effect created by the camera and the horrific images and voice of The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) are easily the best FX ever made in a Batman movie.And let's not forget the bat invasion near the end of the movie, which could be dubbed as Christopher Nolan's 'The Bats', creating a parallel with Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds'.The story is first-rate and the action scenes are worthy of the best Bruckheimer movies. But mixed together so well is almost a miraculous move.'Batman Begins' shows actors at the top of their shapes. Christian Bale is a superb Batman, probably the best of all. Liam Neeson is a scary villain, proving that he's not only able of portraying heroic good guys (Oskar Schindler and Qui-Gon Jinn). Katie Holmes owns her name instead of Mrs. Cruise's one and Gary Oldman gets the role of his life as scrupulously honest police officer Gordon.The only false note that I would give to this movie is that it ends way too quickly and brings its conclusion too fast. The story can get very complex (even if it's also a plus) and some of the characters' philosophical and moral speeches can distract from the real story.Do you believe in miracles? Because this movie is one of them. Batman lives again with this terrific redemption film and there's definitely a dove in the sky, which might be accompanied by a bat.",9,2,3,11 December 2006
Man on the Moon," Bizarre but good
","You all know that the world becomes crazier and crazier. With our jobs, our occupations, our families and our ruled-by-the-clock existence, we could believe that we just can't afford the risk of losing our seriousness. But anybody will tell you that getting some good laughing will help feeling better.'Man on the Moon', a biopic based on the life of Andy Kaufman, acts as a strong message. It shows that annihilating every bit of seriousness can become a threat and not a remedy.Directing a movie about Kaufman is very complex because the guy himself is very complex. Apart from his name, it was impossible to define Andy Kaufman. He was not an actor, neither a humorist, and especially not a comedian. 'I'm not a comic!', says Kaufman himself in the beginning of the movie.So, Kaufman is Kaufman. And what about his performances? Easier to categorize? Well, what would you say about an artist who reads Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' until the audience leaves or falls asleep, play conga drums restlessly and wrestles with women? Jim Carrey is the ideal guy to personify Kaufman. Not only does the physical resemblance is convincing, but Carrey himself is an out-of-ordinary actor who performed many different (and bizarre) roles since the beginning of his career.Here, Carrey gets the jackpot. He gets profit from his emerging dramatic talent, but he stays in contact with his manic and hilarious manners, especially when he's on stage or on air. Carrey perfectly switches from the childlike Latka to Elvis Presley to the unforgettable Tony Clifton, Kaufman's stage alter-ego, who is also an horrible lounge singer and a dreadful person.So, the character is bizarre and the actor is bizarre. Could the movie itself be bizarre too? Yes, it could and it is! Especially at the beginning. Frankly, have you ever seen a movie beginning with the end credits? The movie is good, but there's something missing. Or too many things. I think that both statements are true. There's something missing, because Kaufman did many more sketches than those presented here and it doesn't do justice to him. However, the movie performances are some of the most memorable of his career, but there are many, many of them and the movie becomes overloaded.Apart from Carrey, there are not many important characters. Courtney Love appears as Kaufman's girlfriend but their relationship doesn't look very real. I'd say that the relationship between Kaufman and his manager George Shapiro, played by Danny De Vito, is far more personal and interesting.'Man on the Moon' feels more magical and surprising when you watch it for the first time, because there are many unexpected events which don't share the same appeal once you see them for the second time. Those who watched Kaufman performing know these events. There's the famous 'Fridays' opening show on NBC, the Kaufman-Lawler incident and the 'death' of Eleanor Cody Gould on the Carnegie Hall stage.'Man on the Moon' is not a perfect movie, but it has some charm and its unusual content makes it worth a watch. You'll laugh a lot and you'll feel like you're a member of the 'Saturday Night Live' or 'Taxi' audiences. So, why should you avoid it?",7,0,0,13 January 2007
Schindler's List," The greatest movie of the 90s
","For the last thirty years or so, Steven Spielberg has been the greatest star to shine in the film universe. He is already claimed as being the greatest filmmaker of all time even if he still have time to make other movies.And of all of these last thirty years, one of them must be especially highlighted: 1993. It's by far the greatest year of Spielberg's career. First, he broke the bank and revolutionized modern cinema with 'Jurassic Park' which became (and still is) the most successful film of his career. It was the summer's highlight.And for Christmas, Spielberg came out with his crowning achievement: 'Schindler's List'. Based on a true story (yes, a TRUE story!), this extremely dramatic and ultra-realistic tale of a Nazi businessman who saved 1,100 Jews during Holocaust ultimately ended up with seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a well-deserved Best Director Award for Mr. Spielberg.The first aspect of the movie that strikes the viewer is the filming process. 'Schindler's List' is mostly shot in black and white, because it matched with Spielberg's ideas about World War II. He said that the only images that came to his mind when he thought about WWII were in black and white. Thereby, the movie brings a very adequate mood which is fueled by fear, sorrow and the most inhuman cruelties and dark feelings that are parts of this abominable war.But even if black and white is the most prominent filming process, colored parts appear in short, but crucial moments. The greatest example is the little girl with the red coat. She becomes the catalyst of Schindler's altruistic efforts. She is first spotted during the liquidation of Krakow's ghetto and then, Schindler sees her, unfortunately dead and about to be incinerated by the SS officers.The main force behind 'Schindler's List' is the depiction of the Nazis' cruelties and racist gestures made to the Jews. And also the Jews' efforts in order to stand and flee from these absurd and inhuman moves. This idea is particularly shown in the ghetto's liquidation scenes which are the greatest, hardest and most harrowing pictures of the movie.'Schindler's List' is also a success because of its three leading actors. Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, this Messiah-like figure who used his recently-made fortune in order to save his people. Neeson's performance is extraordinary and we can feel his inner transformation throughout the movie. He is perfectly depicted as a greedy man, but also as a restless seducer and womanizer. Ben Kingsley is Schindler's Jewish assistant Itzhak Stern and he delivers his greatest role apart from Gandhi in the eponymous movie. Finally, there's Ralph Fiennes' unforgettable performance as Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth who is the main representative of the Nazis' horrors and his attractive physique hides a wildly devilish nature, which fuels each one of his atrocities.Because it runs for about 200 minutes (three hours and twenty minutes), the movie includes several sub-plots which either highlight some passages of Thomas Keneally's novel or show other Holocaust-specific pictures, such as the 'selection' in Plaszow's camp.Out of all the movies made in the last decade of the 20th century, 'Schindler's List' is probably the greatest, followed by Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'. This is only a 'probable', but some things are surer. For instance, this is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's greatest picture, which is somehow ironic because Spielberg is known for his blockbusters and action-filled movies. So, it's ironic to see that such a war drama can be considered as Spielberg's definitive masterwork.But, in a sense, only Spielberg could have done a movie like this. He is a Jew himself and the Holocaust can only have more effect on him than any other filmmaker. Roman Polanski did well too with 'The Pianist', but Spielberg's vision and direction were just superior. From now on, anyone could try to make a movie about the horrors of the Holocaust, but nobody will ever measure up to one of the most unforgettable true stories of the century: 'Schindler's List'.",10,9,13,3 September 2006
Ghostbusters," Some crazy stuff, some funny guys. Who ya gonna call?
","Combining big-budget special effects with irony and sarcasm-laden dialog, 'Ghostbusters' is a one-of-a-kind sci-fi fantasy comedy as entertaining as it can get.The movie stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, three graduates from the great schools of 'Saturday Night Live', 'SCTV' and 'National Lampoon', as three 'scientists' whose specialty is to detect and hunt down ghosts of all kinds. They form a team called the Ghostbusters and they offer their duties to whoever wanting to get ridden of a ghost.After some troublesome beginnings, the team quickly becomes very popular and is able to eradicate dozens of paranormal creatures from every corner of Manhattan. They are in such demand that they need to hire a fourth crew member, played by Ernie Hudson. However, their skills and their knowledge are soon going to be rudely tested when a destroyer god from the Babylonian era is getting ready to penetrate into our world and to spread chaos in a Judgment Day fashion.This kind of scenario could reminisce anybody of such disaster movies from the middle of the 20th century, monster movies such as 'King Kong' and 'Godzilla', or even contemporary blockbusters, filled with rumpus, destruction and special effects intended to terrify and provoke some panic. 'Ghostbusters' is all of that at once, but it dissociates itself from the bunch in its own particular way.Instead of presenting itself as a drama, a thriller or an action flick, 'Ghostbusters' is introduced as a heavy special FX comedy. Chimeric idea? Maybe. But the result is simply delectable, because of the quality of the special effects, but mainly because of the humor brought out by the stars of the picture, beginning with the master of irony, Bill Murray.Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the unofficial leader of the group. His on-screen appearances are always delightful, his lines being almost always stamped with irony and impassive humor. Murray is very much at ease and he does whatever he wants in front of the camera.Murray's two accomplices (and the co-writers of this movie), Aykroyd and Ramis, are not relegated to oblivion anyway and, together with Murray, the three of them have a good lot of chemistry. At moments, they can become as funny as Murray is.Sigourney Weaver is also a part of the cast in 'Ghostbusters'. She plays a violinist who quickly realizes that her refrigerator could very be some kind of portal towards a parallel dimension. Rick Moranis plays her nerdish neighbor. Sometimes nice, sometimes unpleasant, it's actually very hard to really care about Moranis' character in this movie. It becomes easier when he is pursued and possessed by the Sumerian demons, but we actually do care much more about Sigourney Weaver in that situation.Ernie Hudson, a relatively underground actor, is fairly attractive as the fourth Ghostbuster. He represents somehow the link between the ghost trackers and the ordinary people.Nonetheless, the actors from 'Ghostbusters' are generally overshadowed by the impressive special effects required for that kind of movie involving creatures from another world and innovative technology to hunt ghosts. But the actors find themselves rewarded from that move. Thus, we see 'proton packs' with extremely dangerous, but extremely convincing beams. We also see ghosts that are both frightening and funny, the green wiener-eating 'Slimer' being the best example.But how could we forget the unforgettable climax starring the most unlikely destroyer in New York City history: the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man? It is without any doubt the most famous scene of the whole picture and it's not without reason. His arrival unleashes the greatest panic attack from the movie's extras, because of his menacing stature. But in the viewers' case, they can't help themselves from smiling and laughing when they see that surreal giant walking in the streets of Manhattan, even if they know that this monster is not so much different from Godzilla, save for the hideous and repulsing appearance.So 'Ghostbusters' is technically innovating, comically revealing, but it's globally some really tasty entertainment that everybody will be able to appreciate. Everyone will be able to find at least one element that will satisfy them. Those who love spectacle and eye-popping sequences will be delighted by the special effects. Others will respond to Bill Murray's lines with an inescapable smile. And let's not forget the eponymous theme song from Ray Parker, Jr. that will play in the heads of people long after they've seen the film.So, twenty-five years later, we can still watch 'Ghostbusters' without telling ourselves that this picture comes from another era. The majority of the special effects have aged well, even if some of the moves from the demonic dogs begin to look like those created by Ray Harryhausen for 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms'. So, it's still easy to love the movie, just like if it was just being released.Since the first silent movies of the early 20th century, there have been a lot of comedies that were created. But among those which tried to insert big-budget special effects to counterbalance their comic moments, 'Ghostbusters' is among the best, if it's not THE best. It's really some pure crazy fun.",9,4,6,14 July 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'Kill Bill' is absolutely extraordinary...
","'Revenge is a dish best served cold' Almost everybody knows this proverb. But not necessarily its origin. That's alright, because nobody really knows where that famous phrase comes from. Not even the well-read Quentin Tarantino. In the case where you wouldn't have noticed it, Klingon is the name of a race in 'Star Trek'. But seriously, do you really think that I'm writing a review to discuss the origins of an expression that every school kid knows? So, it's supposedly a dish best served cold...Yet, Tarantino, perhaps unconsciously, strikingly makes that proverb lying. Because revenge in 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is not served cold, but rather dangerously hot, with flavors so explosive that sensitive stomachs will assuredly throw up their dinner.Even well before he made 'Kill Bill', Tarantino was already known for his skillful conjugation of extreme violence and aestheticism. We only have to think of the ear-slicing scene in 'Reservoir Dogs' or too-many-scenes-to-give-a-specific-one in 'Pulp Fiction'. Tarantino completed his violent scenes with numerous references to popular culture in other scenes. Here, Tarantino puts popular culture aside and concentrates almost only on grape juice scenes.The simple story of revenge is complex nevertheless. Uma Thurman plays 'The Bride'. She is a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, a team of assassins composed of herself and four other members. Their boss is named Bill (David Carradine, whose face is never revealed in this episode).The Bride seems to have left the organization so she could marry and have a child, but her former colleagues show up at her wedding and kill everybody. They think they've also killed The Bride, but she miraculously survives after being shot in the head, even if her assailants cruelly took her baby off her body.You would have guessed it, The Bride then wishes to get revenge upon her former colleagues by killing them one by one, and Bill as well, hence the title (surprising, isn't it?). This first episode shows The Bride attacking Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).Faithful to himself, Tarantino presents his story in a fragmented way, just like if there was simply no other alternative to his methods.The Bride quickly liquidates Vernita and we learn at the same time that O-Ren has already been killed. So the rest of the story is presented as a flashback and we know what will be the final result. What we don't know is that Tarantino is about to provide us with a breathtaking show of martial arts fights and extreme violence like nothing ever shown before in the history of cinema.Tarantino really is a living encyclopedia of violence and ways of presenting it. For almost two full hours, the child prodigy from Knoxville, TN shows an exhibition of violent scenes and practically each one is different from the other ones. With such an amount of violence, naturalism quickly lets devolves into surrealism and, at some moments, shock and disgust become laughter.Volume 1 is almost completely set in Japan, so it's without any surprise that Tarantino takes benefit of the occasion to pay tribute to Japanese film genres and popular culture. Just by seeing what he had done before with other well-known genres, it's not very surprising that QT concentrates on that kind of genre. I'd even say that it was only a matter of time.And for a fan of Japanese culture like myself, I had a gorgeous feast. It all begins with the short anime, as surreal in its violence than the rest of the film. A superb homage.The scenes where The Bride drives her yellow motorcycle towards the streets of Tokyo wearing a yellow suit are an homage to Bruce Lee, but it also strangely reminisces the famous anime feature 'Akira'. And the suit seems to come from the 'sentai' sub-genre, which gave us the already-forgotten 'Power Rangers'.We also have to remember that we cannot dissociate Japan from video games. The spike ball linked to a chain used by the young terror Gogo (Chiaki Kuriyama) seems to be a reference to the early titles from the 'Sonic the Hedgehog' franchise.But how could we forget the Japanase sword fights? This amazing spectacle provokes incredibly high thrills during minutes that fly away as fast as the heads of The Bride's victims. Tarantino shot nearly all of the fight scenes in the famous Shaw Bros. studio in Hong Kong and called upon many action choreographers and martial arts specialists to re-create the atmosphere of old Hong Kong movies.It's true that all of this stuff can shock. Tarantino is aware of it and even takes pleasure from it. How then would you explain the final fight between The Bride and O-Ren? Why would it be shot in a cute and innocent Japanese garden covered with pure white snow? Seeing this natural beauty, we could almost shout out 'Sacrilege!' when Tarantino soils the snow with red blood.But QT is pitiless. He fully trusts his own skills and those of his crew. We have to say that he really is prodigious. He never slows down, even if his last movie has been made in 1997.For QT, everything in his movies is a question of appearance. It's still true here. Besides the examples already mentioned, we can add the mega-fight that suddenly goes from color to black and white and another one which takes place in a room plunged into darkness except for a blue screen in front of which fighters only look like dancing silhouettes.With such a beginning, expectations are very high for the following. I must confess that I'm barely able to wait.",9,1,3,15 June 2007
World Trade Center," The day the world stood still
","NOTE: I'd like to thank my sister Cynthia for her complementary comments.When very young kids go to school someday, one of the questions that their teachers will ask is : 'Ask to your parents where they were on September 11, 2001?' A similar question which was asked in the past was: 'Where were you on November 22, 1963 when President Kennedy was murdered?' For those who lived through this day (including me), we will always remember where we were when we learned the news. In my case, I was in a biology class in my high school when my teacher came up in the class with these news on this Tuesday in September.The day (and the entire week, should I precise it) has been a day where television took an almost-unprecedented importance, in my small city as well as in any other place on the planet. Because the terrifying scenes of the planes hitting the World Trade Center and the Pentagon instantly entered into the collective memory and the horror of these scenes was even greater than the first time that moviegoers saw Anthony Perkins stabbing Janet Leigh in 'Psycho'.There will never be a movie which will surpass and the emotion and the feelings experienced live on 9/11. I don't mean that there won't be any good movie about 9/11 but it won't be worth the images broadcast millions of times by CNN, ABC, CBS, FOX...So why would anyone produce a film like 'World Trade Center'? With a director like Oliver Stone (who likes to draw the attention), we could have doubted that it was another publicity shot from the famous filmmaker, as were 'Platoon', 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers'.The film's story is very simple and could be summarized in one sentence or two. The movie is about two NYPD policemen who found themselves under the WTC rubble on 9/11 and their families who pray for a miracle.This script is rather unusual for a politicized director like Oliver Stone. The last time that Stone examined so much the human side of a drama in one of his movies, it's probably in 'Platoon' in 1986. By the way, this movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture on that year.Stone can thank his principal actors. Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña are the two officers trapped under the ruins and Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall are their respective spouses. The four of them offer a touching and emotionful interpretation.The movie alternates for almost 90 minutes on three plans: the two policemen, Cage's family and Peña's family. Stone succeeds in giving a fair dose of suspense even when we know since the beginning that at the end, they're gonna come through alive.The movie begins very slowly but the approach is ingenious. Stone takes his time before showing the main characters, only to show the city and its citizens getting up on that morning. At that moment, nobody suspects anything. People are busy getting to the job, opening their shops or chatting about Derek Jeter's performance during the weekend game. This approach only wants to show that every extraordinary day always begins like a very ordinary day.The picture that always come to my mind in the movie is the one where the man on the boat watches the twin towers. Was he suspecting that they would disappear completely before the end of the morning? We must admit that the entire film is slow and could annoy many viewers. But it remains nevertheless a very personal and very touching vision from Stone's part and even if it's not his best picture, it's way better than the 'Alexander' flop two years earlier.'World Trade Center' is one of a few stories which shows pictures that TV stations didn't show. The collapse of one of the towers on the rescuers is terribly catchy and the pictures shot from under the rubble are amazingly realistic. The pseudo-patriotic mood at the end is not really appreciated and the police officers' reaction when the first images are shown on TV is disappointing, but these mistakes are easily forgivable.For a movie so hard to make, this is a very acceptable result. For sure, nothing is comparable to the actual pictures, but those from Stone's film work where they have to work. That's a very good 9/11 flick.",7,4,10,9 August 2006
The Dark Knight," He who laughs last laughs best
","To be perfectly honest, I'm not the kind of moviegoer who waits to see the critics' reactions or to witness the box-office numbers in order to determine if I go watching a movie or not. Usually, my mind is made up several months before the release.I love Batman movies, but I expected to wait until the DVD release of 'The Dark Knight' to get hold of it instead of going to the theater right away. But after hearing about the numerous laudatory reviews about the movie and witnessing the box-office records being beaten one after another in so little time, you'll understand that I couldn't resist. And now being able of talking about the movie in a retrospective way, I can tell you that I would have regretted my first choice.If 'The Dark Knight' is that much praised and that much seen, it's because it's well deserved.. Whether a moviegoer is a fan of Batman or not, whether (s)he's curious about Heath Ledger's final role or (s)he doesn't give a damn, it'a movie that can satisfy anybody, independently of what's looked for.The story begins shortly after 'Batman Begins' ends. How much time, exactly? The movie isn't very clear about that, but we quickly figure out that there hasn't a lot of time spent between the end of the first movie and the beginning of the second one. The Wayne Manor is still under re-construction, so Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and his servant Alfred (Michael Caine) have to live in a penthouse for some little time.Meanwhile, criminals haven't been totally eradicated from Gotham City's map. And one of them, the manic and schizophrenic Joker (Heath Ledger, in the role of a lifetime and a death-time) appears and doesn't take much time before spreading even more chaos and terror in the streets of Gotham.Harvey Dent (a surprising Aaron Eckhart) is the new district attorney in the city and his energy, his ardor, his determination and his intelligence fascinate the inhabitants of Gotham. He has fallen in love with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Bruce's childhood sweetheart, and he works closely with the few honest cops of the city, all personified by scrupulously honest Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).Obviously, when you think about the Joker, you can imagine that it won't be an easy game to win. But even if you're anticipating a lot from him and his performer Ledger, let me tell you that you'll be completely spellbound once you see it for real.Many journalists and professional critics imagine that Ledger could be granted a posthumous Oscar for his performance. Even if there are a lot of movies that will be released until the ceremony, and that many great roles will be unveiled before that date, I have to say that if Ledger receives a nomination, I wouldn't be surprised at all. I can imagine many of you having a suspicious look about the possibility of seeing a comic book villain awarded with an Oscar, but believe me, Ledger's performance is breathtaking and will silence many skeptics. It's simple: Ledger didn't play the Joker, he WAS the Joker. His appearance is very convincing (thank the make-up artists), but his voice, and especially his twitches with his tongue demonstrate the whole scale of his role. It's too bad that he's dead, because Ledger had everything he needed in order to become a new Brando or De Niro.But the biggest drawback about Ledger's performance, it's that he steals almost all the publicity, while another actor who deserves some recognition is almost completely overshadowed. I'm talking about Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, transformed at the end of the movie into Harvey Two-Face. Eckhart is astounding and he also delivers the performance of a lifetime. He is completely convincing as Harvey Dent and he is even more as Two-Face. As for his facial make-up, you can see it, but you can't believe it. It completely flabbergasted me for the rest of the movie. I think that 'The Dark Knight' deserves a nomination for Best Make-up.The story is particularly complex and the movie, with its two and a half hours, may be a bit too long. Some would say that the movie is impossible to follow, that he contains a lot of useless characters and that some scenes could have been shortened up. I shall acquiesce to these complaints, but I also think that director Christopher Nolan deliberately created a film based upon the Joker's personality: manic, chaotic, merciless and full of surprises.Nolan proves once again his great mastery of mixing action scenes with the psychological side of his characters. The cinematography here is even more extraordinary than in 'Batman Begins'. Here's another man who should be awarded with an Oscar in a more-or-less distant future.Besides Ledger and Eckhart, the other actors play their own role with professionalism. My only complaint concerns Maggie Gyllenhaal, who I think is totally miscast, especially after that Katie Holmes played the role of Rachel Dawes in the first movie. If you compare both pictures, it looks like Rachel has aged of about fifteen years between both.This film makes us realize two things. First, Heath Ledger had a lot of potential and his premature death will earn him a place in the category of the stars dead too quickly, among with James Dean and River Phoenix. Second, Ledger's performance, paired with Jack Nicholson's one in the 1989 'Batman' proves that the Joker is the #1 villain in all of the comic book medium.'The Dark Knight' will probably be venerated as Heath Ledger's swan song and as Aaron Eckhart's breakthrough. It will also be probably treated as cursed, considering Ledger's death, Bale's arrest and Freeman's accident. One thing is sure, it will forever be a great movie and the immutable testament of a legend gone too quickly. Hence the saying: 'Only the good die young.'",9,6,13,7 August 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," The greatest movie ever made
","Yes, some people could argue with me that '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't the greatest movie ever, but all the elements are here in order to provide an experience that challenges any comparison.Almost a silent movie, '2001' is a unique trip into the unexplored areas of outer-space. But the film doesn't begin in the future, but in the far-away past. Director Stanley Kubrick depicts men at the ape stage, which existed 4 million years ago. That's maybe the most ancient representation of mankind ever presented. The ape make-up is so well done that we all could be confused. Just to say it, make-up artists weren't nominated to the Oscars, because the judges were all certain that these were real monkeys...Parallels between ancient and future times include man's existence and wandering inside an hostile and dangerous world. And his need of evolving. But Kubrick puts his pessimist mood by showing us as unable of evolving by ourselves. We need outside intervention (aliens never shown) in order to accomplish our destiny.Black monoliths are the objects used by the hidden aliens in order to make humans evolving. First time, ape-men become able of using bones as tools and weapons. Second time, world scientists create the space ship Discovery I for outer-space exploration and they hope that they will find the monolith's signification. The third one is a gate throughout space and time and the final one rises astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) to the next level.But '2001' is a fantastic voyage into reflexion and meditation, which means that it's not everyone who's able of enjoying it. Those who expect that space should be used as a playground or as an extreme fight terrain will be strongly deceived when they see that space is only a background to man's research for his own existence and destiny.'2001' is to cinema what 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' is to music. Both items are the epitome of the 60's counterculture and there is a strong psychedelic mood that translates well on screen or on gramophone. The Star Gate sequence is the best example, with its surrealist sequences of geometrical colored motifs and abstract landscapes. But the themes reflect also the new cultural values which promote introspection and disputes over traditional values.Realism is strongly flagrant. Especially in the sound process. Probably the only movie that really shows space as a fully empty place, Kubrick presents universe as a great black danger, with its desolated landscapes and dead, almost haunted atmospheres.Kubrick wasn't an Oscar favorite, but he strongly deserves the Visual Effects Award that he received for '2001'. Futuristic computers, spaceships, furniture and costumes are eye-catching and imaginative. But the best special FX of the movie (and perhaps of all time) are presented in the final twenty-five minutes. These are the spectacular and unbelievable slit-scan star-gate, which is a psychedelically colored gate towards time and space, and also the spatial events, such as the birth of a supernova.The best character of the movie, surprisingly, is not a human being. It's HAL, the ultra-perfected computer that runs the Discovery spaceship. He's so obsessed by his quest for perfection that he wouldn't hesitate to get ridden of anyone who would threaten him. He also leads the viewer to ask himself/herself many questions: is it safe to create computers and machines that are more and more perfected? And do we depend on them? Questions, questions, questions... Answers, there aren't any. At least, they're not revealed. We have to figure them out by ourselves. And do not hope that a monolith will appear and give you an answer. In a time where psychedelic music would be the ultimate escape, '2001' was the symbol of a society that entered into a great phase of questions about itself and it still is today. That's the power and the possibilities of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. 'The Ultimate Trip' still is an adequate nickname and, with its unforgettable sequences, its gripping realism, its visually dazzling shots, its strongly meditative mood and its legacy beyond compare, '2001' is nothing else than the greatest movie ever made.",10,1,5,21 January 2006
Men in Black," Cosmic rhymes with comic
","The less that we could say is that movies about extra-terrestrials are becoming more and more fashionable. It's certainly the most fertile period for alien movies since the '50s. At the time, these flicks were some kind of Cold War metaphors that promoted anti-communism and McCarthyism and were disguised as tales depicting an invasion from outer-space. Today, it's mainly a very valuable excuse for developing special effects and ultra-sophisticated animatronic creatures. Only, in the case that's picking our interest right now, there's something different.It must be specified beforehand that there are different kinds of alien movies. The first kind is the invasion film which dominated the silver screen in the middle of the twentieth century and which seems gaining in popularity since recent box-office successes like 'Independence Day'. The second kind is the benign alien movie a la 'E.T.' where space invaders are kindly and inoffensive and where humans look like a primitive form of life in the universe.'Men in Black' belongs to a third type that we don't see much often. We could call it the alien comedy. It's a film genre that is not much approached and which releases even fewer great successes on the box-office side as well as on the critical side. There has been 'Mars Attacks!', but critics didn't hook to that kind of iconoclast humor from Tim Burton. But with 'MiB', they will get hooked for sure.'Men in Black' stars the endlessly serious Tommy Lee Jones and the rising star Will Smith. Jones plays the role of K, a MiB agent, that is an organization which monitors extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. K hires Smith (re-named J) after he successfully pursued an alien in the streets of New York City.Their first mission together consists in recovering a galaxy (because it seems that the size doesn't have any importance) on 'Orion's Belt'. Their adversary is a 'bug disguised' as Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is also searching for the galaxy. With the passing of the events lived by the two agents, we gradually discover the Men in Black world, their weapons, the different species of extra-terrestrials who live on Earth and what their job implies (and it's not included in any job guide...).It is hard to define what is the 'meat' of the movie. It could be the duo formed by the two principal actors, the futuristic gadgets which will make salivate those who have an eye on advanced technologies or it could also be the aliens, who are CG, played by actors with special costumes or remote-controlled. In fact, there's a little bit of all this. But I'd say that the most interesting moments are those which make the audience laugh wildly.In that case, it's Will Smith who's the best. In a performance that seems to be an evolution from his hot-shot role in 'Independence Day', Smith is incredibly funny and wacky and he always provides good laughs, should it be for moments of physical comedy or when he makes the use of jokes and irony.And what could be better to complete a jester role than combining it with its total opposite? This fact makes that the movie enters in the category of 'odd couple' films. We must admit it, Jones plays his role with professionalism and his serious and his calm of stone give him a particular look in the tongue-in-cheek style. The sequence of the car in the tunnel with Elvis Presley's 'Promised Land' playing in the background is the best example. In fact, the only moment where he laughs, it's when he tells a joke that is so appalling that the viewer could only laugh of him and not of his joke.I also fairly loved the famous segment where K and J's boss, Zed (Rip Torn), displays pictures of real-life people who are supposed to be aliens themselves. In the lot, I've spotted Steven Spielberg (I've always told myself that he had to be from another planet), Danny DeVito (who redefines the 'little green man' term) and Sylvester Stallone (who apparently had difficulties to get rid of his extra-terrestrial accent). And at the end of the movie, we also learn that Dennis Rodman would be an alien too, which wouldn't be too surprising for obvious reasons...I've been somehow muddled by Vincent D'Onofrio's performance. Was he really there during the entire movie moving in such a mechanical way? Or was he played by a giant-sized animated puppet by moments? Anyway, in both cases, we can only raise our hat.I wouldn't say the same thing for principal actress Linda Fiorentino who looked very annoying. The end of the movie is also ambiguous.Special effects are mentionable. Aliens, even if they are totally peculiar, are well-conceived, should it be with the help of computers or from Rick Baker's hand. It must be said that the fact that the story is an adaptation of a rather unknown comic series (which also proves that comics' adaptations do not always involve superheroes), there must be a special treatment that should be brought to the presentation because comics images are rather stylized. The final result is more than satisfying.In a genre not much approached like the sci-fi comedy genre, 'Men in Black' is probably the greatest representative of it since 'Ghostbusters' in 1984. It's a very funny thrill ride that you would want to see again and again...",7,4,6,23 May 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Outrageously remarkable
","'A Clockwork Orange' is without any doubt the most politically incorrect movie that I could have seen in my short life. Full of sex, violence and shocking and degrading images so much that it could make the screen blowing off, it appears necessary to wonder why many people (including myself) dare to talk about this Kubrick picture as a masterpiece.'A Clockwork Orange' tells the story of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a young delinquent who patrols the streets of a futuristic and dystopic London accompanied by his 'Droogies' and their only goal is to get 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. We can quickly discover Alex's only three interests: savage violence, raping and Ludwig van Beethoven. Why does he love Beethoven so much? Judging by the images that are shown, it's simply that Beethoven's music inspires violence in Alex's soul.However, Alex's life takes a different turn when he is betrayed by his Droogies and then arrested and jailed for fourteen years for the murder of a lady in her residence. After two years of incarceration, Alex is offered to be liberated after two weeks if he agrees to give himself up to an experimental treatment which is supposed to free him from any desire for violence and brutal sexual acts.Even if there isn't any doubt that the main theme for this film is the origins of good and evil in the human being, it could be totally normal that some people ask questions about the utility of including so many scenes of violence and sex in order for the story to make the point about the conclusions it attends to draw.It's probably because 'A Clockwork Orange' seems more to be an exercise of style and a test of tolerance rather than a simple and ordinary allegory about a dystopia that doesn't really differ from many other portrayals that we've already seen before.Stanley Kubrick doesn't content himself by putting degrading scenes in their most natural character. He brings each time his own personal touch and transforms the vice into art.Kubrick's favorite weapon remains the ironic use of music, just like in '2001'. Rossini's services are particularly used. The brawling scene between Alex's own gang and a rival gang is particularly brutal, not to say almost humorous, and that on the strains of Rossini's 'The Thieving Magpie'.The scene where Alex rapes two young girls in his room is very particular and is probably the best one in the whole movie. In fact, the scene is shot in fast-motion on the strains of the famous piece 'William Tell Overture' (also played in fast-motion).And obviously, how could we forget the famous raping scene of Mr. Alexander's (Patrick Magee) wife? How could we forget those images where Alex, wearing a Pinocchio-like mask, ill-treats his victims while singing 'Singin' in the Rain' and dancing just like Gene Kelly? In fact, Kubrick's cinematography stays simple except at the moments where offending images appear. So Kubrick's goal is to prove that it is possible to treat violence as an art. It's nothing but morally unacceptable, so why doing it? Kubrick rather seems to ask: why not doing it? It's rather obvious that Kubrick doesn't give a damn about the commercial side of cinema. After all, his film originally received a X from MPAA and was inevitably condemned by religious authorities. It must be admitted: Kubrick didn't draw a very flattering portrait of religion in his movie. We can see four plaster Christs wearing rather prominent crotches and Alex, in his fantasies, imagines himself taking pleasure to whip Jesus carrying his cross and we can see him taking part to bloody death fights and orgies.The society presented in 'A Clockwork Orange' really is a totally absurd society where totalitarian and repressive governments can emerge anywhere, even in traditionally democratic states like England. Several characters are so much bizarre that we cannot even consider them as living caricatures. It's the case of Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris) with his totally ridiculous smile who drinks water from a glass containing a denture. There also are the prison guards which look more like soldiers than civil servants. Their chief (Michael Bates) furiously look like Adolf Hitler.The film succeeds in giving the impression of a futuristic world without ever showing any futuristic technology. Everything is based upon peculiarity. We can see Alex and his Droogies wearing totally white suits as well as bowler hats, top hats and flat caps. As for women, they dye their hair in fluorescent green, blue and pink. The architecture and design are also odd, without counting upon the fact that it's often garish and ugly.But Malcolm McDowell's performance is all but undesirable. His character shows so much charisma that he almost hides his sadism and his own darkness. He is violent, not because of a mental disorder, nor because of an unstable family or social order, but because he chose to act that way. He also made the choice of subjecting himself to the Ludovico treatment and he made the choice of throwing himself out of the window when he's unable to bear with his new situation. But the treatment looks like an antidote to freedom. So it's a formidable battle that Alex does against society itself. And when he's searching for forgiveness, he can't find anyone ready to offer him.It's therefore a cold, hopeless and pessimistic look that Kubrick offers here. In his case, it's just normal. He simply combined his ideas with an exercise of style that acts at the same time as some kind of test to check out what an audience is ready to bear to watch a movie. Even thirty-five years later, 'A Clockwork Orange' have lost nothing of its ability to shock and cause controversy. For me, it's a shocking film but there's nothing to blame. It's outrageous and it's remarkable. Nothing else to add, O my brothers!",10,1,3,22 April 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Nostalgic pollution
","'Reservoir Dogs' is the baptism by fire for Quentin Tarantino, an obscure actor who is at his first experience as a director. And let's say that, for a first time, Tarantino knows how to draw the attention.Released about 15 years ago, 'Reservoir Dogs' is looked up today as a classic, just like the other subsequent Tarantino movies would be, should I say it.'Reservoir Dogs' tells the story of a group of gangsters recruited by an eccentric, but serious boss, in order to rob diamonds from a jewelry store. The film shows the before the operation and the after. But not the during. There are indeed some clues which allow to build a script in our mind, but that's precisely what Tarantino wants: that the viewer let his imagination working.What's more, there is no straight line. The before and the after are alternated in such a random way that it becomes almost impossible to get all the scenes back in the actual order. The only thing we can know for sure is whether we're watching the before or the after. Generally, we can have a certain idea. But it would take several days of viewing and checking the scenes one by one in order to determinate where they go in the story's actual chronology.This strategy is reminiscent of older movies like 'Citizen Kane' where we could see a young Orson Welles, then an old, younger, older We almost get lost.Anyway, whether it's the before or the after, one thing predominates throughout this movie: the politically incorrect. Some would say that Tarantino's trademark is the extreme and aesthetic violence, while others would say that it's his characters' monologues. But one thing unites each of these elements: they're all politically incorrect. And this is precisely Tarantino's real trademark: the politically incorrect.Tarantino fills his movie with violence at one point we could believe that he's compressing several war movies at the same time, so they could get the same size as only one. There's as much blood in 'Reservoir Dogs' as in a Red Cross collecting center. But Tarantino can't get satisfied by only showing violence. He shows it in several ways.He can show violence in its most simple expression, like in the pursuits between the police officers and the gangsters or he can elaborate it. The most striking way is by turning on the radio. In this way, we can see the sadistic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slice the ear of a police officer taken as an hostage while listening (and dancing) 'Stuck in the Middle With You' from Stealer's Wheel. For baby-boomers, it's called nostalgic violence. It's horror and happiness. It's been rarely seen before.Another way, more expected, is black, even philosophical violence. Thus, we can see Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), completely beaten up, who still shoot on each other. Two gushing sponges who battle themselves till it's the end for both of them And the gun zigzag at the end. That's what we call a shooting line.From a philosophical point of view, we can add the monologues from the different characters as they chat about subjects like the real signification of the song 'Like a Virgin' from Madonna (is it about dicks?) and why people should tip when they go to the restaurant.Each actor has his chance of having his own monologue or a long and endless scene where the importance of knowing his text by heart is primordial. If the actor bluffs, he has to shoot this endless scene all over again. But the director seems to trust his actors totally and he trusts their talents for such scenes.With its generous violence, its anti-heroes without honor, its numerous blasphemies, its macho and racist dialogs and its countless sexuality references, 'Reservoir Dogs' truly is a pollution.But with its numerous references to old TV series and movies, music from the 70s and popular culture, 'Reservoir Dogs' is also nostalgia.In the end, much like 'Pulp Fiction', 'Reservoir Dogs' can simply be summarized in two words: nostalgic pollution.",10,5,11,25 April 2007
Pulp Fiction," The Tarantino Revolution
","Three stories into one. This is 'Pulp Fiction', one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.Just after seeing the first story, which stars John Travolta and Uma Thurman, I was satisfied with the movie. The second (and the best) story, with Bruce Willis, made me understand that the movie deserved a 5/5. Add another story, with Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, and you know that 'Pulp Fiction' is simply perfect and a revolution into the film industry.What impressed me the most is the structure of the movie. Even before the opening credits appear, you assist to a conversation between a young man and his girlfriend who decide to rob the restaurant in which they eat, because it would be an easy job. They both shout 'Hands up!', just when director Quentin Tarantino cuts the scene starts the credits and then shifts elsewhere. Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson) are about to meet their boss Marcellus (Ving Rhames), but they meet other guys and the scene (that I baptized scene A) ends tragically, but not for everybody.The first story begins. Vincent and Mia(Thurman), Marcellus' wife meet each other for a drug trade. They go to a 50's drive-in and they participate into a dance competition, which they win. It shouldn't be surprising, when the dance man is John Travolta. It's clearly visible that he hasn't buried the Grease and Saturday Night Fever days. But the story ends less happily as Mia overdoses herself and Vincent brings her to the dealer who sold him the drug. In order to re-animate Mia, Vincent has to perform into the most shocking scene I've ever seen.Cut to the second story. Young Butch is given his deceased father's gold watch by Capt. Koons(Christopher Walken). Actual Butch(Willis), a boxer, wakes up from this dream and goes to the ring. We never see a single scene from the combat, but the radio announcer tells that Butch fought his adversary so hard that he killed him. Unaware that he actually killed his opponent, Butch flees to the motel where his wife Fabienne waits for him. Fabienne forgot Butch's watch and the boxer goes back to his home to get it. But he discovers a gun on his oven and at the same moment, Vincent goes out from the bathroom. Instinctly, Butch takes the gun and shoots Vincent to death. Butch flees in his car and Marsellus appears in front of him. Butch runs over Marsellus, but the boss wants Butch's head and he pursuits him to an electronic store. Both men are taken hostages by the salesman and the sexual-obsessed policeman on the scene. They're able to free themselves. Butch kills the salesman with a Japanese sabre, while Marcellus shoots the policeman into the genitals.My God, this is something entirely new for the violence genre! This is some kind of depiction and exaggeration of today's everyday violence and it's absolutely awesome. The aggressiveness and the violent instinct, as well as the sexual needs make the characters intriguing and fascinating, if not frightening. In their minds, violence is neither funny, nor dramatic. Violence has just lost its signification and it becomes the only employable language into their world. This world has lost of its logic and moral working, turning itself into a savage jungle filled of barbaric people.The third story begins with the scene A and its followings. Vincent and Jules bring a friend into their car. During the ride, Vincent inadvertently shoots him and the vehicle is filled of blood and a corpse lays on the back seat. Vincent and Jules visit a friend, Jimmy(Tarantino), and try to find a solution. Soon, Winston Wolf(Harvey Keitel) arrives and tells them what to do. The following scenes are filled with drama, as well as extreme-black humor. Vincent and Jules decide to take breakfast in a restaurant, but the place they chose is about to be taken over by robbers. So, the first scene of all superimposes itself. What follows is images of drama, as well as this ultra-violence and that taste for anarchy and robbery.'Pulp Fiction' is simply a classic. Its revolutionary structure and stories make it twisting and intriguing and the characters that we see here are only superficial, especially the main ones. Jules takes violence as a simple aspect of life and his religious chats are somehow special. Butch is a soul-tortured boxer who acts like violence was as normal as breathing. The drug use and the sexual situations into the movie may be controversial, but they're just other elements from a mad world, in which violence, absurdity and foolishness are the order of the day.",10,0,1,19 April 2006
Titanic," Review of the highest-grossing movie of all time
","So many things have been said and written about the movie 'Titanic'. And well before it premiered in theaters around the globe. After all, it's not everyday that the most-expensive movie of all time is released and it was James Cameron's first theatrical release since 'True Lies' in 1994, three years before 'Titanic'.Since its release in December 1997, 'Titanic' still is a talking subject. Not necessarily in family reunions, but in film, it's an unmissable. Not only it was the most expensive movie ever made, it also became the most successful and that title still remains up to that date.The storyline is very simple and doesn't break any serious ground, but every guy who only has a small knowledge in cinema knows that story by heart and even the main characters' names.The story begins in present day, where a group of researchers led by Brock Lovett (played by Bill Paxton) explore the Titanic's wreck and discover the portrait of a nude young woman wearing a huge necklace. When she learns of that discovery by the means of her granddaughter's TV, an old woman named Rose reveals to Mr. Lovett that the lady in the portrait is none other than herself.Old Rose is brought to Lovett's ship and tells the story of what happened in early April 1912. Young Rose (Kate Winslet) is a late teenager from a wealthy family and she is engaged with Cal (Billy Zane), the heir of a big fortune. However, Rose doesn't love neither Cal, nor her very reclusive lifestyle and dreams of freedom.She's planning to suicide until she meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), an American street rat who makes portraits of nude women and sells them for living.This is the typical premise for a romantic story: the two less-likely people who could get together meet themselves. They are in a two-class difference (Rose 1st and Jack 3rd) and, at first, they don't fit much each other. But the more they pass time together, the more they realize that they're made to be together.The first problems for that couple is evidently the fish-out-of-water situations. Jack is a poor guy who temporarily finds himself in the high society of the time and Rose, who voluntarily wants to get out of water, spends time with Jack with the other 3rd class passengers whose lifestyle is very different from the 1st class one.But the biggest problem happens next. Because when you say 'Titanic', the first thing that should go to your mind is 'iceberg'. This is where the special effects wizards enter into action. And it's at that moment that you see why this movie cost more than what a third-world country has for all of its people.The sinking is the best part of the movie. It's more thrilling, more exciting and more visually-dazzling than the best action blockbusters made by Jerry Bruckheimer or the like. The spectacular views of people falling from the top of the ship, the blowing furniture, the water infiltrations, the frozen bodies floating on the ocean... All of that stuff earns my best regards.The movie is also an epic because of its representation of the early 20th century society. During all of the movie, there's one thing that's never in doubt: it IS 1912. The high society is well shown by the 1st class cabins, the costumes, the ballroom, the majordomos and the like. That kind of stuff could easily be grabbed by an history teacher to show how life was in 1912.It's just impossible to hate 'Titanic'. Simply because there's something for everyone. Those who love romantic stories will definitely fall for the Jack-Rose relationship. This is strongly due to the actors' performances. It is not DiCaprio or Winslet's first acting roles, but that kind of hyper-budgeted movie is what was needed to show their talent to the world. And they don't waste their time. DiCaprio is charming (tell that to young girls) and professional, while Winslet delivers the greatest acting performance of all.But one actor that is often forgotten is Billy Zane. His interpretation of Cal is very strong and has unfairly been locked in the closet. He's very aggressive, tyrannic and egotistical. That's exactly what's needed for the third side of the love triangle.Those who prefer spectacle will have to wait until the middle of the movie to see the Titanic's sinking but it's worth waiting. It's time that you don't see passing.Those who like history will definitely be pleased by the movie's sets. It's like a travel in the past. Cameron used to be a science-fiction specialist but he works astonishingly well in any time period.Everybody should approach 'Titanic' like if they know nothing about it. Because I did and I'm glad I did. I know some people who can't stand such mass publicity made about a guy with an Italian-sounding name and the mass budget allowed for that movie. But if you defer your judgment for a moment, you'll see that 'Titanic' is one of the finest movies of the decade and the greatest disaster film of all time. Because there's nothing more stupendous that a catastrophe that really happened.",10,1,2,9 October 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded, you say?
","Reloaded, the Matrix? In a sense, it's true... But in another sense, it's far from it...More explosive than ever, more spectacular, containing more action than the client could ask and far less satisfying than the first episode, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is nothing more than a very ordinary sequel...The story from this second act isn't set directly after the events of the first one, but some time after. The clues are rather obvious anyway. Neo (Keanu Reeves) already knows Zion very well and also its inhabitants, while at the end of the first movie, he hadn't set a single foot there before.To be more precise, I think that it is set six months after 'The Matrix'.The story from the second film follows Neo in his quest to destroy the Matrix. The Oracle (Gloria Foster) informs him that to get through with it, he must reach the Source, located on a building level where 'no elevator can go and no stair can reach'. But first, Neo has to find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), the only person who can give him the access to the door which leads to the Source.This mission will not be without any pitfall for Neo. The Keymaker is kept prisoner by a rogue program named Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), shaped as a Don Juan-like man who is obsessed with the French language at the point that he learns nearly every insult from it. Merovingian is surrounded by many more-or-less interesting henchmen who are not worth the potential of our favorite super-cool hero. Except two strange twins (Neil and Adrian Rayment) who can transform themselves into invincible ghosts. These two characters are undoubtedly the most interesting villains after Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).And talking about Agent Smith, you thought he was dead, didn't you? Don't you believe it! Because he's back! He's as powerful as he was before, but he acquired the capacity of copying himself as many times as he pleases. This makes the matters even more difficult for Neo and the other protagonists.If you're the kind of viewer who got an eye on the action scenes in the first movie, then be sure that you won't get bored here. Because there's plenty of action here...The special effects used in the first movie all come back and they're usually upgraded by the Wachowski Brothers, so they can get to a superior level. After all, why would they change a winning formula? But there's an answer anyway: it's less surprising. The reason why 'The Matrix' was so breathtaking is because the effects of bullet time and time-slicing appeared like something new and innovating. But what is done here is recycling...It seems that the Wachowski Bros. haven't learned from Stephen Sommers when he made 'The Mummy Returns'.In the first movie, the main dish in terms of action was the ultra-stylized slow-motion lobby fusillade, made to look like a John Woo movie sample. This time, the main dish is more conventional, because it's a high-speed pursuit on a busy freeway. Besides, it's the only scene from the movie that hasn't been shot in Australia, because it was actually shot in a specially-built highway in Alameda, California. The chase is spectacular and provides a lot of high thrills. However, it looked interminable to me.The first battle between Neo and the Agent Smith clones is also interminable. The fact that the Wachowskis experiment new kinds of figures to impress us is actually not-so impressive. By moments, you can also clearly see the artificial Neo doing the CG stunts. I think that we should not see those kinds of scenes, especially in such a movie, where advanced technology is the only true thing that drives the picture.But what truly strips the interest of 'The Matrix Reloaded' from 'The Matrix', it's the reject of addressing philosophical issues to the characters and viewers at the same time. 'The Matrix' was interesting because of the numerous spiritual questions that it raised, most notably about the definition of reality. The second movie tries to redeem itself by giving to its characters the occasion of asking questions that are nearly impossible to understand and even less to answer, which doesn't fix anything up. 'The Matrix' was complex, but it stayed sufficiently clear to be understood by the everyman and the everywoman. 'The Matrix Reloaded' is just too much difficult to catch.'The Matrix Reloaded' is definitely spectacle-oriented. And in more ways than one...Not only are there really epic action sequences, but the sequence of the Zion cave is also made on a big scale, with hundreds, if not thousands of extras. We can see Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) pronouncing a speech reminiscent of Winston Churchill in the Battle of Britain, followed by a lengthy and perfectly useless sequence of dances and proto-primitive musics.In short, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is not a bad movie, but you must really be a big fan of the Matrix franchise to appreciate it.I don't know what the third movie will look like, because the first two were so different in style than we cannot really predict what will be retained. Ideally (and obviously), the best thing to do would be to combine the best elements from the first two pics, but it's easier to mean it than doing it.So, will Neo accomplish his destiny? Will everybody survive? Will humanity be victorious over the machines? To take an already well-known question: 'What is the Matrix... end?'",5,0,1,14 July 2007
Mystic River," Drama with a capital D
","In today's cinema, there are dramas and there are Dramas. A drama is often not much more than a generic term used to designate a movie which doesn't suit in any other category. For the general public, the definition for drama is so much innate that it becomes almost impossible to give it. Instead, a Drama is a movie that catches the viewer in his/her deepest depths at the point that he/she feels exactly the same feelings and the same emotions than the characters portrayed on screen. And 'Mystic River' is a Drama.Directed by Clint Eastwood, 'Mystic River' tells the reunion of three childhood friends in less-than-enjoyable circumstances. The movie begins in a street from a residential neighborhood in Boston at the end of the '70s. Jimmy, Sean and Dave are playing street hockey when they decide to write their names in a part of sidewalk whose cement hasn't dried yet. However, they're caught by 'policemen' and the latter bring Dave with them.Cut to present day. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an ex-convict, owner of a small store and father of three children. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a divorced homicide detective. Dave (Tim Robbins), whose life dramatically changed since the car event, lives peacefully with his wife and his son.Jimmy's oldest daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) has been found murdered in a park. Sean is assigned to the case and his relationship with Jimmy is a factor that stimulates him even more in this sordid affair. Dave is also sympathetic to Jimmy, but several clues picked up by Sean and his partner Whitey (played by Laurence Fishburne) start to make believe that Dave could actually be a prime suspect in that affair.The movie lays on a solid story, immaculate direction, but especially on the strength of its three main actors. Talking about that, two of them (Penn and Robbins) received an Oscar each for their performance in the film. Penn is a society rebel, shown by the sidewalk episode and his two years in jail, but he also has a heart and the sadness and the revolt that he shows after his daughter's murder are sincere.Bacon does his job very professionally, but he's not insensitive to the fact that the murder he's investigating concerns his childhood friend. And just like Jimmy who's bruised by the murder of his daughter, Sean also has to come to terms with his own divorce.Robbins is the most fascinating of the three. He had the bad luck of being the one taken in that car and this traumatic event is well-reflected in his face. Very often, he looks more like a beaten dog rather than a middle-aged man. Even if he's imposing physically speaking, he remains nevertheless the weakest character among those we see on the screen.The story of 'Mystic River' is adapted from the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. Such a story is unusual for a filmmaker like Clint Eastwood. And yet, it's probably his best non-Western film as a director. It all demonstrates that Eastwood is a film virtuoso, should he be in front of or behind the camera.Even if the story is originally from Lehane, screenwriter Brian Helgeland must be credited for his faithful and skilfully successful adaptation.The movie immaculately shows how one single event can affect so many people and, at the same time, how this event can reunite people. The story is terribly realistic and shows the fragility of child life and never attempts to restrain the impact of pedophiles on youngsters. It's very courageous from Eastwood's part.Add to that an explosive, merely believable climax and you'll obtain a strikingly poetic and tragic, almost Shakespearian taste.Eventually, the good old question 'what if?' comes to the major characters. It's obviously a unanswerable philosophical question, but it still refers to that painful day when everything changed for three boys who were innocently playing street hockey...'Mystic River' makes a very good development from a simple story that will finally last for over two hours.As for the mystery of the murder of Jimmy's daughter, the investigation is imaginative and suspenseful and, as for every good mystery story, the revelation of the guilty is surprising.But we don't fairly get interested to 'whodunit' when we see the pain and the emotions of the characters. Especially the male ones. It's good to see men sharing their emotions. It's yet surprising from a director like Eastwood, who had mainly worked on macho films during the major part of his career.'Mystic River' is an eloquent example of how the past can affect a life in the present. It's also a very courageous film about pedophilia towards young boys.",9,2,3,15 June 2007
Die Hard," The grandfather of modern action movies
","Ahhh... There's nothing like the holiday season! Family reunions around the big table, presents for everybody and the kids playing all night long after Santa Claus' visit. Movies set in Christmas are always the kind of production which enhance our mood, touch us and make us feel better... Is it? Not anymore. Because 'Die Hard' is set exclusively on Christmas Eve, but it has nothing to do with Santa, elves or Frosty the Snowman. It simply is the catalyst of the blockbuster generation of the 90s and it's also one of the best action movies of all time.The movie is about a group of European terrorists (they're German, actually) who plan to steal $600,000,000 from Nakatomi Plaza's vault, in Los Angeles. By the way, for those who didn't know it, the Nakatomi Plaza building is exactly the same than 20th Century Fox headquarters.The group is led by Hans Gruber, one of the most interesting villains portrayed for a while and Alan Rickman's best role to date. What distinguishes Gruber from the other master criminals is his great intelligence, his apparently high level of education and erudition and his careful plotting of the heist. He always seems to know what he is doing, what he has to do, what is gonna happen and what to do if there is any hitch. He looks like a modern Phileas Fogg. This is almost scary, because we can ask ourselves: 'How could we beat this... machine?' Unfortunately for Gruber, there is only one little thing (and a considerable one) that he didn't count on: John McClane (the one and only Bruce Willis, in his breakthrough role). McClane is a NYPD cop who came to L.A. to visit his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), but he was able to escape himself from the terrorists when they invaded the building. Now, he's the only one able of defeating the terrorists and he's gonna have to use his brains, his guts and his muscles in order to stay alive and save everybody.McClane is first depicted as a mildly-reclusive, word-avid cop, but he quickly becomes wild after the terrorists' takeover. And his heroic actions throughout the entire movie make him one of the coolest heroes of the last years, along with Indiana Jones and James Bond.The action scenes are greatly orchestrated by action maestro John McTiernan (known at the time for 'Predator). Not only do they figure bloody battles, explosive gunfights and eye-popping pyrotechnic effects, but they're filmed in unique and interesting ways. Here are some examples: After Harry Ellis is shot, we can watch Gruber talking to the police via walkie-talkie... throughout holes made in Ellis' head. And there's also these scenes where McClane shoot two terrorists in the legs, making them literally blow out with blood.Gunfights are unrelenting and we could believe that there were as many bullets shot in this film as in an entire war.And for dessert, what about two great bombings inside the building itself? First, there is that unforgettable and visually-dazzling massive explosion made by McClane with a 'bomb chair' and, second, that epic roof bombing, which can be visible from the far other side of the city.This is the great part of the visual. The less shining part is the light circles and ovals which constantly appear and disappear during nearly all the movie. This is very annoying and disturbing.Other than Gruber and McClane, there are only two very interesting characters. The first one is Gruber's henchman Karl (Alexander Godunov). Just looking at him is dreadful. His eyes are aggressive, cold and piercing. And his indelible grimace render him menacing and serious. He's that kind of guy with whom it is preferable not to make angry.The other interesting protagonist is Sgt. Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). He's the only contact that McClane has with the exterior from inside his glass pseudo-prison. Together, they develop a close relationship with each other during the operation although they never see each other until the end, in a very heart-warming scene.'Die Hard' wins points for what it is and for what is has become. In 1988, it showed a whole new kind of action sub-genre: the die-hard genre, which is an action picture taking place in a restrained place, such as a skyscraper, a plane and so on... The hero was a real human being, instead of being a reckless soldier, a suave spy or a martial-arts expert. It is a great example of the near-perfect action picture. It's 'Die Hard' that launched a wave of big-budget action pictures, making the 90s what we could call the 'yippee-ki-yay' generation.",9,7,11,5 September 2006
War of the Worlds," Forget the little saucers
","'Independence Day' wasn't good. Not bad, but not good neither. There were some exciting and entertaining moments with an eye-popping presentation and self-parodying characters whose only good point was to be funny. But these characters were frankly ridiculous, the story wasn't any better and the quotes seemed to be prefabricated. Roland Emmerich tried the best way he could to revive the alien invasion genre, but his lack of seriousness resulted in a mixed bag of a movie.That was in 1996.Nearly ten years later, it was mythic filmmaker Steven Spielberg's turn to bring us his vision of the extra-terrestrial invaders who came to Earth with the one and only goal of destroying us, in this new version of the H.G. Wells novel. Obviously, because it was Spielberg, the stakes were very high. It must be said that the astronomical budget of the movie ($132 million) and the casting of Tom Cruise made the stakes climbing even higher. The final result is an exciting and terrifying adventure that really acts as a resurrection of the genre.'War of the Worlds' starts with a narration from Morgan Freeman taken almost word by word from the novel, then Cruise takes the command and never lets it go until the movie is over. Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who is rather selfish and unable of assuming his parent responsibilities. We see that he's rather distant from his daughter Rachel (another extraordinary performance from Dakota Fanning), but especially from his son Robbie (Justin Chatwin). This confrontation is even reflected in their baseball caps (Yankees vs. Red Sox).And if trying to get care of his children wasn't difficult enough, deathly alien tripods have just emerged from every part of the world, including from Ray's neighborhood.What comes next is an incredible thrill ride for Ray and his children while he tries to bring everybody to a safe place even if he doesn't have any precise plan and is not sure of what he's doing.'War of the Worlds' is one of Spielberg's most exciting and thrilling films. We're beginning to get used to adrenaline-upping flicks and human dramas in the famed director's work, but he rarely mixed both elements as well as in 'War of the Worlds'. And it's the human drama part that puts Spielberg's film above Emmerich's one, but the special effects are also better in 'War' than in 'Independence Day'.I say better because the special FX of 'War' does own a characteristic that 'ID4' doesn't: FEAR. It's the main difference between both movies and it's useless to say that it's a winning hand for 'War'.'ID4' special FX were only made for presentation use and spectacle and the viewers didn't have to care about the thousands of people that were getting 'killed'. These were good special effects, but there wasn't any substance.'War of the Worlds' owns the great advantage of coming at the right moment, that is after the 9/11 events. The movie characters and the viewers (especially the American ones) are now fully aware that disaster film-styled scenes can really happen and this fact is well echoed in the images of the film. The social context becomes crucial. And Spielberg uses it very well.'War' also avoids from falling in the landmark cliché. There's no Empire State Building, no Statue of Liberty, no White House and no Capitol in 'War'. Only typical suburbs, which proves that nobody is protected from the aliens' attack. Not only the people from great centers...So fear is the primary emotion of the movie. The second one is undoubtedly selfishness. We just have to look Cruise's character to be sure. People can say what they want on Tom Cruise, but it remains that he's a great actor and his Ray role is one of his career best. The other representation of selfishness is that famous sequence where the crowd turns against each other only to get Ray's vehicle (because it's the only one that works). In a moment where unity and cooperation become vital, these scenes are upsetting. It's a rare example of pessimism in a Spielberg action picture but it's impossible to ignore it.Many viewers coldly reacted to the movie's ending, but I personally found it satisfying, logical and full of sense. You just have to listen to the narrator. We see the annihilated tripods, then Spielberg zooms on bacteria in a drop of water. Why? Because they are responsible for the invaders' defeat. Because they come from 'somewhere else', we could think that they're not immune to the particles that we don't care about because they don't have any effect on us. Yet, everything lies on exoticism. Just take the difference between people from temperated regions and people from tropical regions. A person from Canada could easily be infected by some tropical disease while locals won't care too much about it. But in my hometown, a cold would only disturb me for a short week while it could be lethal for somebody from Central America. It's this concept that inspired Wells and was taken over by Spielberg. I have the impression that what disturbed the viewers is that the conclusion comes too quickly...Aside from these little shortcomings, 'War of the Worlds' really is the movie that makes the alien invasion genre living again. And as a Spielberg film, it's another gem in his filmography and it shows pretty well that the great filmmaker doesn't slow as the years pass by.",8,0,2,23 January 2006
Jaws," A new fish in the waters...
","Steven Spielberg said (and still say) that 'Jaws' was the most difficult movie he ever had to make. We, poor mortal moviegoers, can't really approve this assertion, but we'll take it as true.However, if this statement is really true, then we can say if this hard-working job was rewarding or not. Fortunately for Spielberg, his shark nightmarish project became one of the most glorious movies of its kind and a landmark in Hollywood history.That kind of hellish shooting mood was also felt by Francis Ford Coppola during the making of 'Apocalypse Now' and there again, we can see that it was rewarding. But just imagine if 'Godzilla' makers said that their movie was a difficult one to make...'Jaws' is a very particular film. Not only in its story, but especially on the legacy it gives to the whole film industry. It was the first movie to break the nine-digit profit (and thus becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time), the one that established summertime as the dominant period of the year for cinema and one of the greatest 'high concept' films of all time.'Jaws' has a very simple story and relatively simple characters. But it succeeds, simply because it doesn't try to force itself to become more interesting. It stays simple and the natural flow takes on.The synopsis could be summarized with these six little words: 'A shark attacks a coastal town.' This shark, a dangerous Great White as we learn, tries to get a meal from the local swimmers and it terrorizes the little summer town. With the profitable season rolling in and the big national holiday approaching, the mayor doesn't want to get the beaches closed but as a near-fatality involves the son of police chief Brody (Roy Scheider), things get more and more serious.This first part of the movie is good. Very good, actually. But it's only a curtain-raiser for the really interesting part which is the hunt for this devil-sent shark on the ocean.The three passengers are: Brody, oceanographer Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and experienced mariner and former WWII soldier Quint (Robert Shaw). The triangle interaction between them and the shark hunt are the only elements that we need in order to get the great show we want.Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw offer performances which are among their personal best ones. Scheider, as Chief Brody, shows that he is a skillful police officer but that he has a great fear of water. Dreyfuss is the near-nerd and he is very convincing.Shaw is perhaps the best of the three. He plays his role of fisherman with solid professionalism and his jargon can only give more credibility. But it's his two monologues which moves him above the other characters. First, he introduces himself to the other citizens in town and he sets the table for his later appearance. Second, his unforgettable speech about his dramatic experience aboard the USS Indianapolis ('We delivered the bomb') and the tragedies of the soldiers who died attacked by sharks is unarguably fascinating and it ranks as one of the greatest monologues ever delivered by any character in any modern movie.Other than the three major characters, 'Jaws' impresses with its pre-ILM special effects. The mechanical shark (nicknamed 'Bruce') looks so real that we forget its artificial nature. More impressive, we can feel its personality by its cruel attacks on weak humans and on Quint's boat and also by its empty black eyes.The underwater camera shooting of the swimmers' legs, accompanied by John Williams' Oscar-winning cello score, is already legendary. This is the kind of shot that is repetitive but surprisingly never spoils the suspense. On the contrary, watching the legs approaching from the camera with the tempo speeding up is exhilarating and frightening.I don't like that the shark be killed with a bottle of compressed air, but it provides some great elements anyway. The visual shooting of the shark 'explosion' is impeccable, but it's the music that hooked me. Instead of hearing a triumphing fanfare of trumpets, drums and flutes, we find ourselves listening to a sad succession of falling piano notes, which gives the impression that the shark's death is tearful instead of happy and resolving.At only 29, Spielberg showed what kind of path he would take with 'Jaws' for the rest of his career and the famed shark movie remains one of its greatest thrilling rides, as well as the very definition of contemporary commercial cinema.But in a sense, even if it's a supremely good movie, there's some kind of bitterness in its legacy. 'Jaws' showed to the world that cinema was not only an artistic mean, but also a very efficient money-making business. This is sad, because it opened the doors for a new generation of filmmakers, driven by the attract of money and totally uninterested in the artistic side of movie-making. And this reflects Spielberg's entire career.But everybody has its own opinion. This is mine and I share it. But it is still possible that commercially-successful flicks become loved gems by critics as well as spectators. 'Jaws' is one of them. And only Spielberg's vision was good enough to support the movie's ambitions. Just look at the sequels...To finish, here's a suggestion. If you go to the beach, bring a cello. You could get much attention...",10,0,1,18 December 2006
WALL·E," Even mechanical hearts can love
","'WALL-E' represents the perfect mix between innovation and tradition. Pixar, the supreme leader in computer animation, has conceived a feature film which expands animation to a technical level which had never been reached before while treating it with very simple narrative concepts, which we could recall from old silent movies from the era of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.The director of 'WALL-E', Andrew Stanton, treats his movie as a huge tribute to science fiction, by inserting many different themes and concepts, such as robotics, interstellar travel, the apocalyptic concept of a desert Earth, mega-corporations and space colonization.'WALL-E' is a family movie, but that doesn't necessarily mean that audiences have to content themselves with simple themes and ideas. And it's fine. But the fact that the movie works so well is intrinsically linked to the genius of Pixar's screenwriters. Those guys have effectively created a complex story with an extremely simple narrative structure.The story opens around year 2800. The first shot opens on a spatial background with planets and galaxies and the camera then moves to reveal the Earth. But is that really the Earth? A first look seems to show our planet enveloped in a yellowish atmosphere, contrasting with the ocean blue to which we're so accustomed. When the camera then zooms upon the Earth, our initial fears are confirmed: the whole planet is a huge desert, complete with totally empty cities and huge towers of garbage compacted in cubes. That sight fills the entire landscape.Those garbage towers are the work of WALL-E, the hero of the movie. For the last 700 years, his workdays are exactly the same: he picks up the garbage he finds (and he's far from lacking of work on that level), transforms it in huge cubes and organizes them in towers. But he keeps in his shelter a few objects which catch his attention and which he doesn't dare to sacrifice.And then one day, a huge rocket arrives from the sky. From it appears EVE, a female robot whose primary function is to inspect the Earth in order to determine if it can sustain life once again. The timid WALL-E makes contact with EVE and shows her his artifacts, among them is a small plant, an ordinary discovery for WALL-E, but a rather significant one for EVE.In less time that it takes to say it, the two robots find themselves aboard the giant spaceship Axiom, where human beings, now ridiculously obese, gelatinous and lazy, live in an Utopian lifestyle, courtesy of the Buy 'n Large mega-corporation.WALL-E and EVE live an extraordinary and thrilling adventure during which they will fall in love. Yes, you read that well. Not only do the robots in this movie have a well-defined gender, they are also able to express emotions as strong as love.Even if some of the robots in this movie have a language and a vocabulary as developed as humans, most of them communicate with only a few words, often pronounced in a slow and detached way. WALL-E, for example, reminded me of R2-D2, since he primarily communicates and expresses himself with electronic sounds rather than with syllables. And I think it's way better that way, because it makes him more innocent, more charming and more attractive than if he'd expressed himself with more words.The way that these robots express their state of mind lies mostly in specific movements, body language and facial expressions. For example, when WALL-E curls up his mechanical limbs towards his body while lowering his tremendous 'eyes' (actually cameras), you don't need words to explain what he's feeling. That's the same situation for EVE. She has some kind of video screen instead of a face, where luminous blue spots light up to simulate eyes. When those blue spots are arranged in her face in such or such pattern, a very precise feeling is expressed.What a fusion! I had never seen such a convincing mix of technology and emotion in a film before. Even in 'A.I.', where a robot designed to look like a boy is programmed to express love.This masterstroke is due to the animators at Pixar, who clearly demonstrates once again who is the master in the domain of computer animation. Not only character animation is exceptional, but the presentation of an apocalyptic desert world is also breathtaking. The realism of the opening scenes is mystifying for an animated movie. There are some moments in which you could forget that you're watching an animated film.'WALL-E' is an excellent science fiction movie, but it's also an excellent tribute to science fiction movies. Andrew Stanton has inserted in his film a lot of references to pictures such as '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Star Wars', 'Blade Runner', 'Idiocracy' and 'I Am Legend'. And in the great tradition of Disney movies, important life lessons are learned in 'WALL-E', and their importance is as capital as it can be, considering the state of the Earth after humans have decided that it was easier for them to forget those precious life lessons.However, I found very ironic the fact that a Disney picture would carry a message against mega-corporations and against the concept of brand loyalty.Overall, 'WALL-E' is an absolutely extraordinary movie. Fans of animation and science fiction will surely appreciate it for its technical and narrative qualities, but families and kids will definitely fall under the charm of those two robots and their heart-melting love story. A must-see!",9,3,5,11 June 2009
The Terminal," A story of sealed items
","Comedy has never been Steven Spielberg's specialty. '1941' was the only serious comedy made by Spielberg and it became one of his biggest failures. Other than that, Spielberg infused his other movies with subtle touches of humor, but it was essentially a small tool that helped to keep contact with the viewer.'The Terminal' is by far the greatest straight-forward comedy ever directed by Steven Spielberg. The genius of this movie is that it turns a very serious and worrying situation into an avalanche of errors and funny situations, just like Kubrick turned nuclear holocaust into a big farce in 'Dr. Strangelove'.The always excellent Tom Hanks stars as Viktor Navorski, a man from Krakozhia who wants to get an autograph from famous saxophonist Benny Golson for his deceased father who was an avid jazz fan.However, the situation becomes more complicated upon his arrival at JFK airport. Viktor learns that a coup occurred in his country and his passport is not valid anymore. Thereby, he cannot penetrate in America and he cannot return in his country neither. The only solution is that he must live in the international transit lounge until another solution becomes possible.Viktor speaks very little English and he doesn't completely understand his situation. Anyway, he settles himself into the airport (Gate 67, to be more specific) and a new life begins for him.Sometimes, we believe that an actor gets a couple of big roles and then, he only becomes a name. Tom Hanks is not that kind of actor. He won Oscars for 'Philadelphia' and 'Forrest Gump' and he got notable roles in 'Apollo 13' and 'Cast Away', but his role in 'The Terminal' is one of his greatest.In a sense, Viktor Navorski looks like Forrest Gump to me. His language is not clear (for different reasons) and his situation makes the other 'normal' people looking the same way.An airport is a very ordinary place. Ordinary and almost dull, especially for regular travelers. But Spielberg transforms this boring place into a fantastic environment, almost like a country inside a country. We discover the type of people working there, what is hidden behind every door and the very characteristics of the building.Ultimately, the airport becomes a destination itself.'The Terminal' is a story of sealed items. Of course, there's the airport which is Viktor's prison for a long time. But there's also that special peanut can, which is the fuel of Viktor's travel. This blue box intrigues not only the characters, but ourselves as well. And when we learn what it contains, it becomes the most heart-warming moment of the whole movie.Also heart-warming are the scenes when Viktor is about to leave the terminal at the end of the movie. We see the bunch of friends met by Viktor and they follow him like fans who follow a rock star.This is the kind of story that we all love. A man wants to get a very little thing and he gets it, but he also gets much much more that he wanted to get. And this element is well-highlighted by Spielberg and the tens of characters.So, 'The Terminal' is a very comical movie, but it is also serious and it's a perfect display of what is good in ourselves.This is definitely a movie to grab, before it flies away.",7,1,3,28 December 2006
Platoon," Great job, Mr. Stone!
","I've heard of 'Platoon' when I was searching for a movie that would contain violence that is not used to entertain, but as a symbolic violence. I decided to rent the movie... But I got more than I expected.'Platoon' is a very shocking anti-war film that tells the incredible story of a young American soldier named Chris Taylor who left college in order to fight in Vietnam. He quickly regrets his choice as he experiences the horrors and the wounds that come with the war.We see a lot of combat movies, but few come with the real reality (weird words, but that's how I see it) of the Vietnam war: little hurting bugs, humidity, rations, marijuana to escape reality and those disgusting tasks, such as emptying the pots that the soldiers use as toilets. This IS reality. Director Oliver Stone took out his own memories of the Vietnam and he wonderfully put them into the movie.Outside of Taylor, Sgt. Barnes (played by Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (played by Willem Defoe), it's very difficult to follow the characters. The main reason is that they all look alike. That's one of the movie's hidden geniuses: Stone presents ordinary looking guys who surely got normal lives in the States and their insertion into the jungle war. Barnes and Elias are the only ones who are highly recognizable and they've got their own reason. Barnes owns a frightening face and a horrific soul, which stick perfectly together. Barnes is an inhuman soldier and the scenes where he intends to kill the innocent villagers of a Vietnamese village are a nice reflect of his personality.Sgt. Elias is mainly recognizable because of his appearance. His face can't be missed and he wears an almost-trademark headband. Also trademark is his morality that makes him the least threatening of the soldiers we see in the film, along with Taylor. Elias also appears in the most shocking scene of the movie: as he's shot in the back by the Vietnamese soldiers, he lifts his arms towards the American helicopters in the sky and this is his final movements. This scene has an almost religious mood.Also shocking are the soldiers' questionable moralities, which are mold by the difficult context of war and the tyranny of their superiors, mainly Barnes. There's also this scene where a barely wounded Taylor looks beside him and sees a young fresh deer.Overall, 'Platoon' is a perfect example of a proverbial anti-war film and its shocking images and lessons provide reflections on war and soldiers for anyone who watches it.",9,1,2,14 April 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Aaargh!!! It's Hannibal Lecter!!!
","There are characters who make their entrance in the movie world in such a spectacular way that the actor or actress which played that character risks to be associated with him/her for the rest of his/her career. It's notably the case for Clarice Starling, but especially for Hannibal Lecter. From the moment they appeared for the first time, it became evident that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would forever be remembered for their iconic roles.I have to say that it's Hannibal Lecter who impressed me the most. And that's not only the case for me. I allow myself to tell you that anecdote which happened to me. My sister is some kind of horror buff and I decided to test her by showing her 'The Silence of the Lambs'. She passed the test successfully but I'll always remember her reaction during the famous ambulance scene when the movie is two-thirds over. When Lecter puts off his mask to reveal his face, my sister instantly gasped. This demonstrates without any doubt the formidable power of Dr. Lecter. His only very presence is frightening. We see him and we are afraid, period.'The Silence of the Lambs' is the first horror movie in history to be rewarded with the Academy Award for Best Picture. And believe me that it deserves that prize. The Oscars for Foster and Hopkins' acting roles also are. We often associate horror films with ghosts, demons, monsters and other creatures which come from the imaginary and the supernatural. But nothing is more horrifying than what appears real and very plausible. Alfred Hitchcock has already shown that in 'Psycho' and director Jonathan Demme raises the bar with this adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel.The story involves Clarice Starling (played by Foster), a student at the FBI Academy who is also a specialist in serial killers. One of her superiors, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), asks Clarice to interview the terrifying psychopath Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter (immaculately played by Hopkins) who is also a brilliant psychiatrist, so he could deliver clues which would lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), another serial killer actively searched by the FBI.Lecter accepts to help Clarice, but only to the condition that she feed Lecter's sordid curiosity by confessing herself about her childhood's worst souvenirs.Why is Lecter interesting himself to Clarice's worst days? Does he want to weaken her? Does he want the bad guy to win? Or is he only a sadist and a pervert? I would go with the latter affirmation.I think that it is useless to specify that, of all the characters, Hannibal Lecter is by far the best and the most fascinating. The other characters describe him in such a frightening and horrible way that we fear him well before we see him for the first time. And when we see him for the first time, we instantly remark his cold and menacing eyes, as well as his disturbing grin.Himself a serial killer, we can consider Lecter as one of the worst (or best, depending on how you read it) villains in the history of cinema, even if we see him killing only once. And precisely, his attack is very stylish. He kills both policemen on the strains of Johann Sebastian Bach's 'The Goldberg Variations' and once he accomplished his work, we see him stained with blood, just like a painted how has just finished from making a new painting. That scene establishes a shocking parallel between murder and art.But Lecter is only one side of this story. In fact, he's only a sub-plot. The true story involves Buffalo Bill's actions. Bill, brilliantly played by Levine, acts in nearly the whole Midwest, but his victims always are rather fat young women. Unlike many movies which hide their killer until the very end, we often see Bill in this film, even if we don't know his true identity, nor the frightening motives of his crimes until the end. The only thing we can discover about Bill is his appearing mental problems which push him to kill.The horrors of the film aren't limited to the killers themselves. The movie is strewn with blood-chilling naturalistic images, especially the images of corpses who got parts of their skin removed. And how could we forget this unbearable image of the dead policeman with an open abdomen posing like an angel who is about to take off? There's also a good dose of suspense, especially at the end when Clarice is chasing Bill in his labyrinthine basement. The climax of the pitch-black room while Bill is wearing his night goggles to see in the absolute darkness is breathtaking and holds suspense until the conclusion. At this moment, we're totally absorbed in that cat-and-mouse game at the point that we totally forget Lecter's existence.'The Silence of the Lambs' is an excellent example of the horrors of the criminal acts and of psychological horror aroused by childhood traumas. Overall, the film is an immense metaphor about the horror of modern world and wants to get sure that the viewer leaves weakened and less in security than before he got inside the theater. The sinister soundtrack of Howard Shore adds to the already sordid atmosphere and the Q. Lazzarus song 'Goodbye Horses' adds even more with its broken notes which resonate and give goosebumps. Personnaly, each time that I hear that song, I start thinking about Buffalo Bill who cross-dresses in front of the camera with that song playing in the background.'The Silence of the Lambs' is a grandiose spooky symphony well-carried by Foster and Hopkins whose roles are already a part of the legend. The numerous references of the movie in the popular culture keep it well alive more than fifteen years after its release. Everybody, at least those who are able to stand horror images, should watch this movie at least once in their life.",10,4,8,31 May 2007
Casino Royale," Craig is an ace
","Four years and 200 candidates later, the new James Bond is here. I couldn't remember of a more intense search for a new actor than the Bond search. This story could almost fit in a movie of its own. But all's well that ends well. And the curtain rises for Daniel Craig, aka 'James Blond'.Initially, Craig gets evident attention for his blond hair and his sea-blue eyes, which are not typical from the 007 agent. But these physical doubts vanish when we see what Craig really is able to do. Because the James Bond that we watch here has accomplished his most fabulous task to date: looking more like a human being.'Casino Royale' begins by presenting a recently promoted James Bond, who finds himself blamed by the MI6 for a wrongfully executed mission. But Bond has a chance to redeem himself by winning a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro's Casino Royale against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a banker who finances global terrorist organizations. If Le Chiffre loses, his organization will collapse.Bond is accompanied by Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a Treasury agent who's assigned to watch over Bond and help him win the game. Eventually, Bond and Lynd fall in love and the game becomes more and more dangerous.The story is very complex, but that's far from being a shortcoming. I think we've all had enough of black-and-white stories filled with colorless villains and allies. Le Chiffre is a good villain, but the fact that more hidden crooks are present and play various roles in the story adds some spicy stuff.If Daniel Craig has been chosen for the main role, it's not for nothing. His interpretation is gorgeous and because he suffers more in this movie than any other actor before him, we can only fall for him. I'm not saying that it's good seeing Bond suffering and being devilishly tortured in that famous cargo scene with Le Chiffre, but the realism that it brings transform the Bond franchise into something very different. A large gap has been created between 'Die Another Day' and 'Casino Royale'.This movie relies less on gadgets and other stupid stuff, but it's not completely thrown away. The screenwriters made their chores by showing us that a cell phone can do a lot of things today. It's something that we all knew, but this kind of stuff is great to see.The action scenes are spectacular (but this phrase isn't surprising, is it?). It begins with this relentless chase in Madagascar. The crane sequence is astounding. In this scene, we don't see vertigo. We feel it.However, I don't like that James Bond jumps from crane to crane and then to small buildings without pain like he does. He's a British agent, not Super Mario! The car accident that Bond gets after he wins the poker tournament is completely over-wondering. The sequence of rolls and flying debris is probably the best of its kind that I've ever seen.I also liked the suspense created by the poker game. I don't know anything about card games, but I know when a scene is suspenseful. And this was suspenseful.And finally, the opening sequence is one of the very best ever made for a Bond film. The surreal animated images of Bond shooting spade-shaped bullets and targets becoming roulette wheels is catchy. And that's a small word.The accompanying opening song has been criticized because it's an alternative rock song, which is supposedly not in the spirit of James Bond. I disagree with this statement because Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name' is a great song. And because Bond is evolving, I think that the title song should evolve as well. I'm not saying that as an alternative fan (because I'm not an alternative fan). I only say that an adventure happening nowadays should not only LOOK but also SOUND nowadays. I just hope that the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will recognize what was wrong with the previous films and what's great about this one. With these thoughts in mind and with Daniel Craig as Bond, it would only be a matter of time before the series could really be dubbed as a royal flush.",7,0,3,12 December 2006
Speed," Wild fun at 50 MPH and over!
","Pop quiz, avid moviegoers. You're looking for a serious thrill ride without having to spend your last paycheck in its entirety. What do you do? Tell me what do you do? There are two possible answers: 1)You go to the mall and you buy 'Speed' on VHS or DVD or 2)You rent 'Speed' at your local video rental store.You're gonna tell me that these aren't the only possible answers, but I tell you that these are the best ones.One of the best action thrillers of the 90s (if not of all time), 'Speed' never takes a moment to get its breath back and that's the reason why it's one of the great thrills of modern Hollywood.The story, for those who don't already know it, concerns a Los Angeles public bus on which a bomb has been placed by a cop-turned-terrorist (Dennis Hopper). The bomb will be armed when the bus goes over 50 MPH and it will blow up if the bus's speed drops below 50.The only hope for the unfortunate passengers is devil-may-care police officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), who previously wrecked a plan from the same terrorist.To make such a ride and to throw away cheap introductions and conclusions, 'Speed' has been scripted in order to put minor rides between the principal one. While the bus is the hamburger's meat, the two bread slices are an hijacked elevator and a runaway metro train. And the three parts of the story work well in their own way.Jan de Bont gets his first directorial effort here, after working as a cinematographer for movies like 'Die Hard'. Cinematography is one of the key elements of 'Speed' and especially aboard the bus. The numerous camera angles and positions make the vehicle a pleasure to watch and almost becomes an entity.Also outstanding are the performances of the three main actors. Keanu Reeves is at his coolest as he plays Jack. Sandra Bullock, in her breakthrough role, is the most three-dimensional person of the lot and she is really fine as the bus' 'substitute driver'. However, Dennis Hopper is the finest character of all. His role as the former cop who wants money for 'revenge' is menacing and maniacal. So, Hopper's performance is the best of his career, after Frank Booth in David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet'.'Speed' is dubbed as an action thriller, but it's more of a thriller than an action film. Or, if it's action, it could nearly be called 'unconventional'. Because there are no gunfights, a very short battle sequence (which ends very creepily) and while the vehicles run to full speed, there are absolutely no chases.What could be called action in this movie are Jack's attempts to enter inside the bus and his battle with Hopper on the top of the subway train.The movie mostly succeeds on its 'thriller' segments. We could count among them: the initial elevator rescue, Jack's attempts to stop the bus before it goes over 50 MPH (even if we know that he failed) and the numerous elements that happen during the bus trip, which include a rescue attempt, a big jump and a failed attempt to dismantle the bomb.It's perhaps the only modern movie where an odometer is the key element of the story...You wouldn't want to miss a single second from this astonishing tour de force by Jan de Bont, from the imaginative elevator title sequence to the final notes of Billy Idol's 'Speed' (the title song) at the end of the credits.",9,0,0,9 September 2006
Munich," The athletes were shot, the movie is too
","After the blockbuster 'War of the Worlds', Steven Spielberg quickly followed it with a very different of movie: an historical drama about the killing of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich by Palestinian terrorists.The situation of 2005 was often compared to 1993. That year, Spielberg made the most-successful film of history (at the time): 'Jurassic Park'. It was quickly followed by what was about to become Spielberg's undisputed masterpiece: 'Schindler's List', which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.While 'War of the Worlds' is a terrifying and spectacular sci-fi action thriller, 'Munich' is a very ambitious project, but it ultimately fails to satisfy our expectations.Let's examine the film point by point. The beginning scenes with the Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli athletes start the movie pretty well. We feel the interaction between the terrorists and the hostages. The mêlée with the terrorists and the police at the airport is thrilling. Unfortunately, it's very uncomfortable to edit it as a Avner's (Eric Bana's character) flashback. It would have been even more convincing and real if it was told in a linear sequence at the beginning of the movie. However, it could have meant that Spielberg would have had to chop out the TV footage, which are quite fascinating.It tries to be a thoughtful drama about Israeli-Palestinian relations, but it never involves us in an interesting way. It depicts Israelian dialects and traditions, but that's all.Characters try to be interesting and dramatic enough, but the most interesting are the gang members. Eric Bana is very touching and professional by moments, but he often acts too much spontaneously and we don't believe him. Steve (played by future-super-spy Daniel Craig) is cool and he acts quite well in mood-enhancer scenes, such as the moments where he and an Arab companion argue about the station they will put on the radio.The plot is too much complicated and the only thing we know for sure is that they have to shoot eleven Arabs who are supposed to be related to the Munich events. We quickly lose ourselves in the action and dialog doesn't help. I never knew the name of some important characters before I saw the credits.Because it was so much discussed, publicized and aimed by high expectations, 'Munich' is the kind of work that brings Spielberg back to Earth. It's not because you have a good concept, a good name and a good streak that you're gonna have a good movie. There are fairly good moments in the film, but it's not what it could have been. 'Munich' is good, but it's also disappointing.",6,1,4,21 August 2006
The Truman Show," Satire in high definition
","The first one who imagined a concept similar to 'The Truman Show' is Plato. It is known today as the 'Allegory of the Cave'. The great philosopher told the story of a man chained up in a cave and forced to see the shadows made by a fire, assuming that it's the real life. Ultimately, he discovers that what he saw was fake and he tries to accommodate to reality.Twenty-two hundred years later, Plato is replaced by Australian filmmaker Peter Weir and the sinister cave is now called 'reality television'. The allegory is now called 'The Truman Show'.Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance company employee who is also the star of the show, although he's not aware of it. He lives in what for him is Seahaven, which is in fact a giant domed-studio located just outside L.A. He (obviously) never left Seahaven of his life.Seahaven is supposed to be a peaceful city located on an island on the seaside. In order to keep Truman in the city, the crew finds many ways, including cutting off bridges and simulating a nuclear accident. Moreover, Truman can't leave by the sea because the producers voluntarily infused him with hydrophobia when his father 'died' in a boat accident.However, in recent days, many strange events occur and lead Truman to believe that something is not right in Seahaven. A 'plane piece' falls from the sky, but Truman finds that it strangely looks like a projector. And there's also that elevator, whose back falls and let see the crew for a second.This sounds like a crazy and overly exaggerated media satire. But there's one place where 'The Truman Show' wins: the timing couldn't have been better. In a modern society where reality shows invade the little screen, 'The Truman Show' is a strong metaphor of the dangers and the consequences of permanent broadcasting of a person's life.The movie is not perfect, but just its concept makes it a winner. The acting is good, especially when you think that this movie is 'fiction-within-fiction'. There are two movies in a single one. Jim Carrey is only aware of half of it and it looks real. Carrey gets one of his greatest roles, mainly because he finally shows what he's able to do and he shows that maniac comedy is not the only thing he can do.Ed Harris appears as Christof, the creator and the director of the show. He's responsible for the Machiavellian tricks made in order to thwart Truman's escape plans and to keep him in Seahaven. This determination is well-hidden by his cold regard and his continuous calmness.The greatest characters of the movie are perhaps the viewers themselves, as we regularly see them at different moments. Every time, they're at the same time at the same place, doing the same thing. Just like if there was nothing else to do. Or maybe nothing 'important' to do.They are the figures that stand for today's reality-show viewers. They're stuck in front of their TVs like if nothing else mattered and there was nothing else to do. Like if it was as essential as breathing. They're not aware that they're wasting their own lives watching the same person living his own life.There's a quote from Christof that I like: 'I am the creator of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.' That's how a real TV director would speak. By telling lies. By telling what appear to be good words, which are in fact empty words. This is the kind of hidden quotes that are part of the linking between the satire and the reality.The only major gap between satire and reality in 'The Truman Show' (and perhaps the most arguable aspect of it) is that Truman Burbank is not aware that he's constantly filmed. In reality shows, people know that they're filmed. It's just that the overabundance of cameras and tests ultimately drive them crazy. It would have provided an even more powerful movie, but as long as this movie is good, it's less worrying.What is different about Plato's allegory and 'The Truman Show' is that the latter doesn't have any conclusion. In the Allegory, the man gets out of the cave and has to face the sunlight and, after a long time, he succeeds. The last image we get from Truman is when he gets out from the studio and we never see him contemplating the real world. So we don't know what's gonna happen. We don't know how he will face the sunlight...We don't see him, so good afternoon, good evening and good night Truman!",7,0,1,12 October 2006
The Matrix," 'Alice in Wonderland' in the electronic era
","DOWNLOADING COMPLETED...FILE OPENING...What is the Matrix?How many times do we hear that phrase in the movie of the same name? And do we really know everything we have to know on it once the movie is finished? 'The Matrix' owns many characteristics that could appear inconceivable. Because it's at the same time a movie with an incredibly complex story, a philosophical festival, an homage to many genres of film and literature and an explosive blockbuster as well.'The Matrix' is directed by two near unknowns, the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), and stars Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson, a software programmer whose main hobby is to hack different computer systems, under the pseudonym of Neo.Neo soon meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who learns him that the world where he's living isn't real. It seems that it's rather a virtual world created by the Matrix. So the Matrix would be an immense artificial intelligence system that 'sucks' the energy coming from the humans and locks their minds inside a virtual world where the most fundamental laws (such as the laws of physics) seem to be hardly applicable.Morpehus believes that Neo is 'the one', that is the person who owns the power of stopping the Matrix and thus freeing humans from their cybernetic prison. Morpheus brings Neo along with his crew towards a Star Wars-like adventure in order to accomplish his destiny.'The Matrix' is some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland' set in the electronic era. The parallels with the Lewis Carroll classic are very obvious in the film and the Wachowski Bros. are fully aware that their work can be linked to Carroll's.And like 'Alice', 'The Matrix' astonishes and entertains with its infinitesimal quantity of surrealist elements that make the people asking if it's possible to completely understand the movie (and/or the world that it describes).In fact, 'The Matrix' is nothing but a genuine feast of spectacular and revolutionary special effects which already elevated the film to the rank of legend. The movie makes a clever mix of techniques which require the use of sophisticated computer programs, which is ironic with the anti-technology message that prevails in the film. Some passages strikingly reminisce the George Lucas odyssey. The difference is that instead of traveling in the infinitely big, we travel in the infinitely small.And the final addition to this virtual jaunt: nothing else than action scenes directly taken from the oriental genres... Kung-fu sequences, especially those which take part during Neo's training, evidently come from Hong Kong martial arts films, while many other action scenes with superhuman movements seem to come from Japanese mangas and anime.The whole movie lays almost entirely on presentation, and for once, it's the only thing that is needed in order to provide a good movie. Characters are cool, but too much two-dimensional to my taste. They can thank their sunglasses. But it doesn't prevent them from being interesting. Neo is the best example. We can feel his questioning, his fear and also the acceptance of his fate throughout the progression of the story. Honorable mention to Hugo Weaving who plays the sinister and almost-unbeatable Agent Smith. In his case, his sunglasses don't make him cool, but even more terrifying.Just like 'Fight Club', released a few months later, 'The Matrix' is at the same time a pollution of explosions and fights and a philosophical must. In the Matrix case, the viewer has to ask himself about the notion of reality and the importance of machines on human life. This latter theme is very popular nowadays because of the quick industrialization process by the developed countries. Presented the Matrix way, we want to get the farther from our computers... at least for the moment...With its open end, it was obvious in 1999 that the movie would turn into a full series. And it was the case with the release of two sequels both in 2003. But nothing is worth the original... Because the sequels usually use the same techniques and they're not as striking as the first time we see them.Overall, 'The Matrix' is a set of breathtaking special effects which owns the merit of having a story that is solid enough to make all pieces hold together. And it's not even worth searching to understand everything. The only thing to do is to watch. And you won't be disappointed. And remember that what you see is real (way of talking, evidently...), so take benefit of it...FILE SHUTTING DOWN...",10,0,2,3 May 2007
Tarzan," The king of the jungle, indeed!
","Edgar Rice Burroughs would have once suggested that his Tarzan character would fit perfectly with animation. If that anecdote is true, then we could say that Burroughs was a visionary man. But I don't know at which point his vision would have met the one that Disney Studios used to realize their own version of the man raised by the gorillas.'Tarzan' is among the most spectacular adventures ever made by Disney. Not only the animation is astonishingly innovative and breathtaking, but the story, the characters and the wonderful songs from pop superstar Phil Collins will undoubtedly satisfy the youngsters and the grown-ups.Tarzan's story has been adapted to screen a rather incalculable amount of times in the history of cinema, most notably in the middle of the 20th century with Olympic athlete Johnny Weissmuller in the title role, but this 'Tarzan' is the very first feature-length animated movie about the man-ape, and it takes advantage from every benefit that animation could bring in its presentation, but especially into the characters' development.The relationship which Tarzan keeps up with the gorillas, which he considers his family, are never really convincing in live action. And the attempts made to give some personality to the jungle creatures had never really allowed the viewers to express any sympathy towards them. We just have to look at the movie adaptation of 'George of the Jungle' to be convinced.But here, the jungle animals are really likable and their depth allows to give to the story a much stronger foundation than everything that was done before. The relationship between Tarzan and his gorilla 'mother' Kala (voiced by Glenn Close) is incredibly touching. Tarzan is also surrounded by funny and entertaining sidekicks, such as tomboyish gorilla Terk (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) and coward elephant Tantor (voiced by Wayne Knight). Even Kong-like Kerchak (voiced by Lance Henriksen) is rather well developed beyond his monstrous stature, and his attitude towards 'strangers' kinda recalls Shere Khan in 'The Jungle Book'.And talking about 'The Jungle Book', 'Tarzan' inevitably sparks comparisons with the 1967 Disney classic, since both movies own many resemblances. Both of them talk about a human kid whose parents have died and who is raised by the jungle beasts. And when comes the moment of choosing their true place, between the animals and the humans, both Mowgli and Tarzan are confronted with heartbreaking dilemmas. So which one of the two movies is the best? Well, there again, it depends of your preferences. 'The Jungle Book' benefits from a gallery of characters that is larger, more diversified and more elaborate than in 'Tarzan'. And that's probably on the weaknesses of the latter movie. Besides the gorillas, the elephants, a few baboons and one leopard, Tarzan's jungle seems to be rather huge, but also rather empty. And the musical numbers are way livelier in 'The Jungle Book', and they are incorporated better into the story. The Phil Collins songs in 'Tarzan', as good as they might be, sometimes give the impression that the images we see are merely a pretext for music videos which we could find on the MTV channel.The greatest advantage of 'Tarzan' on 'The Jungle Book' is the quality of its animation. Beside Tarzan's jungle, Mowgli's habitat looks like a botanical garden. In order to give more dimension to the African wild environment in which the characters live, the animators at Disney have created a new animation process called 'deep canvas'. This process gives more dimension to the jungle, giving the realist impression that the characters are moving themselves into a three-dimensional universe. The results are astounding. The illusion is pitch perfect. Thus we could bill 'Tarzan' as a 2.5D animated movie.This process allows animators to conceive astonishing sequences where Tarzan moves from one vine to the other with the movements and the style of a skateboarder and also to create action and chase scenes which turn a trek among the branches and the vines into an authentic roller coaster ride. The images are often dizzying. Some of them might even be too much dizzying to my taste and I would have had no objection to slowing some scenes so I could appreciate them better.That kind of new technological development clearly shows that Disney is still the number 1 animated house in the world. It also demonstrates that, in spite of the constant rise of computer-animated features, movies made in traditional animation still own their place inside our film universe. I don't want to take off anything from computer-animated movies, but I have always preferred movies made in traditional animation. I have always felt that emotions and feelings were stronger and more authentic in that format instead of in 3D animation. There are some truly touching moments in 'Tarzan' and I don't have the impression that those scenes would have had the same impact had this movie been realized in 3D animation.With the exception of Tarzan himself, there are only a few human characters in the movie and they are not among the most memorable ones. Jane maintains an interesting, but rather ambiguous relationship with Tarzan. Her father is your typical British scientist, while Clayton the hunter is not one of the most threatening nor interesting villains we have in the Disney filmography.Beside a few glitches, 'Tarzan' still is an exceptional animated movie and a must-see for Disney fans. There is no better introduction to the world of Tarzan than this movie. Of course, beyond it, there are the Weissmuller movies, but if you consider their relative absence in today's shop shelves, Disney's movies is a more-than-perfect alternative. There is no doubt that it belongs among Disney classics, along with 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King'.",8,2,2,8 May 2009
Contact," If '2001' was made today
","'Contact' begins and ends on the same note. We still search for truth.This astronomical adventure, directed by Robert Zemeckis, bases its characters on one single principle: if we're alone in the universe, why does it have to be so big? I find that question very interesting. It's food for thought for those who don't believe in extraterrestrials. Personally, I believe that aliens do exist, but I don't think that events such as those depicted in this movie will happen someday.But even if this story is one of the craziest space quests ever presented, we must admire it for what it is. It feels like a modern re-telling of '2001: A Space Odyssey', which was made 30 years earlier. However, Zemeckis doesn't share Kubrick's pessimistic and cold view of human race and he shows us a metaphor which sends messages of hope, belief and wonder about universe.The movie is about brilliant astronomer Ellie Arroway, who is magnificently played by Jodie Foster. Ellie's father died of a heart attack during a meteor shower when she was a child and since, she devoted her life to the search for an extraterrestrial intelligence in our universe. Her obsession seems to be granted when her team receives a strange message from Vega.After a twisted series of deciphering, which includes prime numbers, the 1936 Olympic Games and an alien alphabet, scientists find out that the message contains instructions for building a transport machine. With the help of flamboyant and enigmatic billionaire S.R. Hadden (played by John Hurt), the machine is built and it sends Ellie in outer-space, much like Dave was sent through the star-gate in '2001'.But while Kubrick only focused on the scientific aspects of such an adventure, Zemeckis shows us what does humanity think about it. And not everyone shares the same enthusiasm than the world scientists. It is well represented by religious fanatics (even extremists) and Ellie's boyfriend, theologian and writer Palmer Joss (played by Matthew McConaughey).It's unique, because no other movie has ever taken in consideration the delicate but strong opposition between science and faith. And it's presented in a very memorable way. I have to say that religion receives a mild cold shower in the movie, especially when a religious leader bombs the machine, so the scientific expedition would be aborted.This divergence of opinion is very present within the two main characters, Ellie and Palmer. But in spite of their differences, the chemistry between them is strongly believable and much appreciable. And even if characters take second place prior to the visual effects, there are highlights. Beside Ellie and Palmer relationship, there is the bombing of the first machine, which gives to the viewer a sense of frustration and grief. And there's Ellie's unexplainable and mystic encounter with her father during her travel among the stars.Even if emotions are a good substance, it's the visual effects that steal the show. It all begins with the opening sequence, which is a trip among planets, stars and galaxies all the way to young Ellie's eyes... Then, Zemeckis proves himself very good with television screens as he presents living personalities much like he did in 'Forrest Gump'. We can see Bill Clinton, Larry King, CNN journalists and broadcasters, but I strongly liked Jay Leno's appearance with one of the funniest jokes I've heard on screen.And like '2001', the icing of the cake is the space travel sequence itself. We feel like we're stranded in a roller coaster car and we travel ourselves among the stars, the colors, the lights and every trick accomplished by Industrial Light & Magic.With emotion, drama, mystery, science awareness, religion and visual spectacle, 'Contact' can boast itself of being one of the greatest science fiction movies of recent years. It's a strongly realistic presentation of modern astronomy and it's far more convincing than other modern alien films in the mood of 'Independence Day' which, in this case, shows data like if it was falling from the sky. So, whether you believe in aliens or not, and whether you are of scientific or religious mood, this film will definitely please every moviegoer in the universe.",8,0,2,6 May 2006
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Two Jones are worth one
","Better than 'Temple of Doom', but not as good as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'The Last Crusade is another precious entry in the Indiana Jones franchise.The two main characters are greatly entertaining. Harrison Ford is the same old gutsy Indiana Jones and he plays the archaeologist like if it was a second skin.But the best character of the plot is certainly Henry Jones Sr., played by Sean Connery. We all know that Connery was in the heart of the action in the James Bond movies, but here, he perfectly fits as the old professor for whom danger and action mean nothing. As James Bond, Connery was able to play the character with seriousness and a devil-may-care attitude, but here, he looks like someone who never saw any gun showdown or auto chase. That's the good acting way.Of course, because it's Indiana Jones, the special effects and the action scenes must be interesting. Well, it's all true here. In fact, because of the mid-eastern environment and the main antagonists, added to the supernatural religious artifact, everything looks like if it was a 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' remake. But it all fits well and it owns its charms, without copying the 'Lost Ark' principles.The movie is also funny. Sometimes, the dialog is laughable and the situations are greatly ironic.But the movie is also very serious and even has some historical truth: the book burnings. It was a true part of the Nazi regime and a quick look to that is highly appreciated.Overall, a great movie and a worthy addition to Steven Spielberg's filmography. Rankings:Best: Raiders of the Lost Ark, 2nd best: INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, Worst: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom",8,1,1,7 May 2006
Jurassic Park," God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.
","It's been a long time since Steven Spielberg made his last great move as a director. In fact, his last great achievement could have been 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' (1989), but it was generally a facsimile of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981). His latest landmark was probably 'E.T.' (1982). So maybe that it was time to unleash a hurricane...In 1993, with the computer revolution at full speed, Spielberg effectively used the latest technologies in order to create a movie about the latest technologies. Using computer-generated-effects from George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic Company, Spielberg and his special effects team created 'Jurassic Park', perhaps the greatest dinosaur movie of all time and, at the moment, the most technologically advanced movie ever released.'Jurassic Park' stars Sam Neill as paleontologist Alan Grant and Laura Dern as his girlfriend, paleobotanist Ellie Satler. They're both invited, along with professor Ian Malcom, a cynical scientist played by Jeff Goldblum, to visit an attraction park created by a biotechnological company headed by eccentric John Hammond (played by Richard Attenborough).But Jurassic Park isn't your local carnival. It's a faunistic reserve housing real dinosaurs and plants from the prehistoric era. Dinosaurs, as we learn in the movie, have been made with DNA coming from the blood of fossilized mosquitoes, which had bitten dinosaurs 100 millions years ago.Accompanied by Hammond's grandchildren Tim and Lex (played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards), Grant, Satler, Malcolm and a bureaucratic lawyer (Martin Ferrero) are sent on an interactive tour inside the jungle in order to observe the dinosaurs.However, the initial wonder turns into a nightmarish ride when the security systems are sabotaged by unscrupulous computer specialist Dennis (Wayne Knight), who attempts to steal dinosaurs' embryos and to sell them to a concurrent firm. With the security off, dinosaurs (including deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptors) can easily seep into the park and become threats for everybody.So, from now on, what was just a gentle jungle ride turns into a life-or-die cat-and-mouse game with the dinosaurs and a single false move can easily become a deadly mistake. It's at this moment that Spielberg's movie turns into a harrowing adventure thriller as only him can make.But the movie's calmest moments principally involve fairly good character development and greatly interesting philosophical debates that take place inside the film, and not in a movie-fan committee reunion. We're introduced to the concept of nature's rights, as well as the limits of technological progress, which is ironic, due to the fact that the movie itself involves so much technological progress.Actors are generally good, but some are above the others. Beginning with Sam Neill, who is awesome as professor Grant and he embodies his paleontologist role like if he was one of them. Director Richard Attenborough is also noticeable as John Hammond and he shows that he's good for acting, too. But my best regards go to Jeff Goldblum and his Ian Malcolm role. Malcolm is that type of character who never delivers a phrase that is not quotable. His cynical and philosophical speeches are very interesting and surprisingly entertaining. I particularly love the phrase that is also the title of my review.But the best aspects of the movie are the dinosaurs themselves. The CGI-created beasts appear so real that we can almost forget the computer illusion. It's a step forward inside the film industry and it shows the powers of the computer era. It helps to show that Industrial Light & Magic are the best among all of the industry's special effects teams.With a movie like 'Jurassic Park', it's not surprising that people developed a sudden interest for dinosaurs, paleontology, computers and scientific progress. In a movie so well done, with sublime special effects, thrilling scenes and entertaining characters, it was also not surprising that it became the highest-grossing movie of them all at the time.",8,2,4,15 June 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Incrediddily-bly funny
","Some people could ask themselves why it took so long, that is almost twenty years, for the Simpsons producers to transform the adventures of the most-known family in America into a full-length animated picture. Some less-popular TV series, such as 'South Park', only waited a few years to see a movie based upon their stories. But once we see the final result, complaining is the very last thing possible to do.Obviously, 'The Simpsons Movie' must obey to two crucial rules which are applicable when a movie is based upon a TV series : 1- Never take 90 minutes when 30 minutes are enough. 2- Never modify an important aspect which concerns the characters.'The Simpsons Movie' owns a characteristic that is even more difficult than other TV series adaptations. Many series from the '60s, such as 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and more evidently, 'The Fugitive' re-told their whole storyline within two hours. 'The Simpsons Movie' shouldn't do that for the series is still aired today.But 'The Simpsons Movie' avoids every trap and presents the best of what it has to offer: an avalanche of gags, satirical sequences and absurd scenes, all packed into an unforgettable 90-minute hilarious adventure.The movie is extremely well made, the script is tightly built, the characters never lose a bit of their punch and attacks and cheap shots are nicely done. The result is an extremely funny and absurd comedy, a rare gem among the comedy genre.The characters need no presentation, so let's go to the story. Before going any further, it must be specified that there are many subjects into the storyline, but one of them is more prominent among the story. And this subject is precisely the most tempting for the satirists: politics.Lake Springfield is becoming so polluted that the situation becomes more and more urgent and the citizens of Springfield have no choice than curing the problem. But as you guessed it, Homer comes ruining everything by dumping a silo full of liquid manure into the lake. The EPA gets involved and the government cuts Springfield from the rest of the world by enclosing the city under an enormous glass dome, just like futuristic cities seen in some works of science fiction.Able to escape from the inhabitants' fury, the Simpsons flee towards Alaska and try to begin a new life there. But circumstances will do that they will have to save Springfield themselves... as well as their family union.To be honest, I don't remember having laughed as much while watching a film than with 'The Simpsons Movie'. Some sequences are so full of gags that we risk of choking ourselves or having a heart attack. I thus decided to stop eating popcorn so it wouldn't happen to me.The die-hard fans of the TV series won't be disappointed of the film, far from it. The movie makes a good use of recurrent themes talked about for so many years in the TV episodes, such as the Homer-Bart relationship, Lisa falling in love, the marriage of Homer and Marge in crisis, the Simpsons family discovering an exotic place and the city of Springfield vs. the American government. And none of these subjects is misplaced or inappropriate.The only element that is not appropriate is the suddenly growing relationship between Bart and Ned Flanders. It is supposed to highlight the fact that Bart is growing more and more distant from his father, but it should have been made more adequately than that way.The script is so well written that even the most obvious technical mistakes become quickly forgivable. I obviously make mention of Arnold Schwarzenegger who is depicted as the President of the United States, when somebody who is born outside of the U.S. cannot become president. But if this gag would have been deleted, a nice quantity of laughs would have been deleted at the same time.But it must be said that the movie is masterfully handled by entertainment geniuses. Conceptors took many subjects which have been publicly ridiculed so many times and kept the most they could. There are a lot of subjects, but some are more memorable than others, such as: rock activists, government agents, Disney, industry and even Fox parodies itself, which happened more than once in the series.The usual title sequence has been heavily modified for the movie. There's still a punishment for Bart, but the sacred couch gag has been left aside, which is a great disappointment.On the artistic side, nothing bad to say. The animation is first-rate and special effects have been used to create shadows and to make the pictures more three-dimensional and thus, more realistic. This is a privilege that TV episodes can't afford.And to counter-balance funny scenes, the producers use dramatic scenes whose efficiency goes sometimes beyond of some straight-forward dramas. Finally, there's everything in that picture! Many guest stars have appeared along the years and the movie makes no exception. We can see Albert Brooks in a key role, as well as Green Day and Tom Hanks as themselves.Some scenes will undoubtedly become classics soon. We only have to think about Spider-Pig, Homer and Bart fixing the roof and Bart who cruises the street naked on his skateboard after his father challenged him to do so.Matt Groening and his band of collaborators have successfully taken up the challenge. 'The Simpsons Movie' might be the funniest comedy of 2007 and perhaps one of the best of the 21st century. And I don't think that its freshness will fade soon. It's really a splendid comed'oh.Uh, I mean comedy...",8,2,7,27 July 2007
