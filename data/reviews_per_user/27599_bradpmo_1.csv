Source Code," 7.5 is way too low.
","Finished this film about 15 minutes ago and had to share my thoughts, incredible piece of work. After hearing that the director will be in charge of an anticipated film I'm looking forward to, I had two choices, to watch Source Code or Moon. Source Code seemed the more appealing, and I'm really glad I picked this flick up. The plot itself is simple yet makes you think. By the end of the film I was in tears. The emotional and ethic writing that has gone into this film is phenomenal. I recommend this film to anyone who loved Inception style thrillers. Jake Gyllenhall was exceptional in this film.9/10, extremely good.",9,1,3,21 May 2014
