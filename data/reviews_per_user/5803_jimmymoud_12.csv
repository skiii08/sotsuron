Avengers: Endgame," ARTWORK
","This movie has been highly anticipated. I prepared for it. Saw all the MCU MOVIES and took a friend along who is even nerdier than I am.
A masterpiece work of art by the Russo Brothers and truly worth every second of it",9,1,3,24 April 2019
City of God," Oscars ain't enough
","How typical of the academy to snub off a masterpiece like this. Based on a true story with relentless risk and breakthrough cinematography and still no Oscar to go home with.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Alternate Reality
","Quentin imagines a day in 1969 where things could have gone differently and what it would look like. The costumes, scenery, and research are so well executed.Another point is at the end.

Joker," Dream come true

The Shawshank Redemption," Masterpiece
",Probably one of the greatest movies ever made no wonder it's on the top of the 250 List. I was personally holding back from watching it but the moment I found out Morgan Freeman was in it I just couldn't resist. Indeed it's been quite some time since the movie got released but it's just one of those golden works of art that can be picture at any time or place,9,0,0,18 August 2017
Blade Runner," Too bad she can't live
",Funny enough I saw Dennis's 2049 version first. It was actually a good idea and made things a whole lot easier for me while watching this one. Imagine how big this must have been in the 80'sAnd Ridley was directing all the way back then this was a newsflash for me. Well I gave it a 7 because it lost me a lot in between. Script could have been a little bit stronger but Scott isn't to blame. Harrison just isn't my fav actor out thereGreat film nonetheless,7,0,0,27 March 2020
The Matrix," 21 years later

Cinderella Man," Turtles made it home
",What a movie ! Such a beautiful bio of a wonderful man. A try inspiring figure in a difficult time in history. These movies are why I love cinema and Ron Howard displays it so well.I like how Russel portrayed the character he was smart to rewatch the tape and even smarter not to take the fight out of the ring. Learned from his tactics and how he was always there for family.Ren√© played an amazing role in the success of this film,8,0,0,30 April 2020
