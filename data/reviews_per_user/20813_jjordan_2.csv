The Devil's Advocate," You've gotta be kidding
","I recently rented The Devil's Advocate, remembering that it had berecommended by a family member who's taste I now have toquestion.  I've read several of the other comments posted hereand I simply can't believe the praise being lavished on thisremarkably  mediocre film.  Where to begin.  Well, let's start withKeanu Reeves trying on a Southern (?) drawl and succeeding onlyin proving he can be a lousy actor  in more than one dialect.  Thenyou've got Al Pacino chewing the scenery shamelessly.  I'mtempted to read the novel this movie was based on, if only to see ifthe reasonably interesting premise was handled with any moresubtlety in print.  Because the movie is like a 2.5 hour WesternUnion commercial, with every plot twist telegraphed an hour aheadof its arrival.  Was there really anyone who didn't recognize thatPacino was supposed to be Satan the moment they learned hischaracter was named John Milton?  Could the endless succession of demons and specters have been a clue? And all the while, Keanu and Charlize Theron just keep drawlin'and Al keeps shoutin' and it all leads up to what, exactly?  Theflying mallet to the head moral that a scuzzy lawyer that stops atnothing to win will eventually pay a price for his amorality?  Whowould have guessed?  Who would have cared?  But, hey, themusic was good.  But what was the deal with the voodoo guy andthe goat?  Awww, nevermind.",Null,1,2,7 November 2001
High Fidelity," Great movie, better book
","When this movie was first released, I avoided seeing it because,  having read and LOVED the book, I was sure they wouldn't do it  justice.  My brother-in-law convinced me to rent it and I'm glad I did.It really is a great movie, however I still think I would have liked it better had I not already read the book.  The problem I had with it is that throughout the book, you get a running stream of conciousness of what's going on in Rob's head.  While they tried to recreate this to a point, it was only possible TO A POINT.Otherwise you would have had Cusak standing in front of the camera talking to the audience for 85% of the film.  What brought this home to me was that I watched the movie with my wife who hadn't read the book and she was finding it hard to fully relate to Rob.  Eventually I realized, that was because the book does a much better job of letting him provide justification for his actions and attitudes without minimizing his flaws.  In the movie, many of his flaws appear to be those of a self-absorbed boor without giving the other side of his character.  Having said all that, the movie really is entertaining and the cast is tremendous from top to bottom.  And as a record collector myself, I found the soundtrack and discussion of obscure records (even those I've never heard of) very authentic and enjoyable.  And as several others have written here, if you have a choice, rent the DVD for the extra scenes and the interviews.  Many of the scenes stand alone.  My particular favorite is the scene where Rob and Beverly D'Angelo (as Too Tan woman) 'reverse-haggle' over her spite sale of her errant husband's record collection.  Overall, a solid 4+ out of 5.",Null,0,1,24 January 2001
