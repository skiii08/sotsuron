Angels & Demons," Nothing special
","First of all, I didn't read the books and didn't see the first movie so I'm not able to compare this movie with those. I just rate it as a movie.I'm very disappointed on the way this movie turned out. The flow of the action is very stop-and-go and the dialog is often very strange. A lot of the time you see two characters in a scene explaining their actions or their thoughts to each other. It doesn't feel natural at all, the characters are explaining their steps out loud as they go. It feels like they are not talking to each other but to the viewer to be sure he/she can follow the twists and turns of the movie.As a result the acting feels forced. The action scenes are done well.Overall this is still a book and not a movie. It could have been a good movie if they had confidence in the audience and didn't explain everything out loud.",5,23,75,13 May 2009
Black Book," Verhoeven is back with this great WWII thriller
","In Holland this film is hyped, just because it's the first of Verhoeven since returning to this country. If you judge this film by it's content, the hype is completely justified. It's an action packed, thrilling ride where the plot twists and turns where you don't expect it. Star of the movie is Carice van Houten, who blows you away in every shot. Although some scenes might seem a bit far fetched (but hey, it's a movie), the power lies in the scenario. It stays away from the easy good vs evil, resistance vs nazi's stereotypes. On both sides there are good and bad guys making good or bad decisions. Go see it if you have the chance, it's different from anything you've seen before.",9,8,13,20 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Style over substance
","I haven't seen the previous Pirates and I must say I was not convinced by this one. The visuals are great and stunning, so you're in for a good ride. Sadly this ride is too long for the story to hold up and there are too many characters running around. The first hour I got completely lost in the different bad and good guys and had real trouble focussing on the main story. All these different characters have a different history with one another, which is really difficult to get a feeling for without having seen the previous pictures.In the end, I didn't care who won or lost, I just wanted this movie to be over. As a spectacle it holds up pretty well, with stunning visuals and some good jokes. As a movie it's below par.",6,12,40,24 May 2007
The Dark Knight," Good blockbuster, but nothing more
","I like the Batman movies of Tim Burton and I thought Batman Begins was a fresh new start. This new episode is a good follow-up but not the masterpiece I'm reading in the other reviews. The story is too flat for me with a lot of noise and great action scenes but no real depth, just chaos all around. The biggest problem for me was the role of Batman himself. I never felt he was really in the storyline. Everything seems to happen around him and too him and he's just following along. The Joker is the central character in this movie and the performance of Ledger is haunting. Problem is he only appears in action scenes and high drama interactions with other characters. I never got a feel of the real motivations of this character, his background etc. It's a good movie and I loved it as a blockbuster, but by no means an epic.",8,2,5,26 July 2008
