Hereditary," Very Suspenseful
","This movie is very suspenseful. Very few movies have I felt the need to watch through my fingers. This is one. However, the way the trailer sets up the movie is misleading and the 'finally' was a little over the top and unbelievable. Frankly it left me and my movie companion dissatisfied. The reason I rated it a 7 is because for 90% of the movie, it is nail biting.",7,1,4,11 June 2018
