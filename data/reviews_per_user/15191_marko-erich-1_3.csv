Captain Phillips," Watchable
","Film is watchable, nothing more, and in my opinion doesn't deserve all the praise it is getting. It simply doesn't have enough substance to justify 2 hours of running time. It is a story that depicts the true events of first seizure of American flagged merchant ship by pirates in two hundred years. Tom Hanks plays the protagonist captain Phillips. Tom Hanks is a capable actor and he portraits cap Phillips as wimpy corporate overseer perfectly. Normally this leads to inability of viewer to connect with the character. What I've found the most amusing part of the film is how four Ak-47 armed Somalis in a skiff were able to capture freighter of hundreds of tons operated by at least couple of dozen crew members, the true representation of Western social decay.",5,13,28,2 December 2013
Skyfall," Judi Dench is a 'new' Bond Girl
","I was one of those who liked Daniel Craig as James Bond, more precisely I liked Casino Royale the most of all Bond films, being the only one with some semblance of plausibility in real world, without over the top villains and hair brained schemes to rule the world. So I've started having high hopes for Bond. Alas it didn't last for long. With the 'Skyfall' were are back at it again, minus one redeeming quality that we had in previous Bonds, the aloofness of Bond character is gone, Craig's Bond is more emotional than ever.We have Bond opposing Silva (Bardem), former M's pet agent, in his wish to punish 'mommy' (M) for betrayal, stealing agent list (through the means of computer hacking), bombing MI6 headquarters (through the means of computer hacking), getting himself caught and escaping (through the means of computer hacking - again), so that he could just see his former employer in the face (and M being cold hearted bitch, viewer sympathizes with Silva). When all that is needed to get rid of M is a quality sniper. Oh yes, the agent list is completely unmentioned in the latter half of the film.You know that Bond film is a flop when woman who has the most screen time is a gray headed granny. Making her literally the oldest Bond girl on the screen ever.Since it had nice opening chase scene I give it three stars.",3,7,17,15 November 2012
Quantum of Solace," Poor sequel for Casino Royale
","I myself was quite pleasantly surprised with Casino Royale and Daniel Craig as James Bond, film had relatively good story, not that much action oriented, and good villain. There was even a chemistry between leading actors. Well, this is not the case for Quantum of Solace, true this film is a lot more action oriented than previous one, but some stunts are just plain ridiculous and comparable with Pearce Brosnan era, like sequence with planes.All in all just ordinary action flick without story and characters you could connect to.Craig lost his charm here.",5,5,8,12 March 2009
