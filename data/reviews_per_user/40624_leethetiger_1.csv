The Legend of Bagger Vance," great movie-redfords best!!!!!!
","anyone who cops out on this movie by saying that its sappy needs to check their pulse. This movie is not only a great golf movie, but more importantly, a great movie that celebrates the spirit of life.  I admit i was not a big fan of Will Smith in a dramatic role before this movie , but he completely proved me wrong.  To make it short, everything in this movie was perfection and if you dont realize that your either a prejudice yankee who hates anything that is southern or (like i said before)you have no pulse.10/10",Null,0,2,7 May 2001
