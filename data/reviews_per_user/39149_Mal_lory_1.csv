The Avengers," Earth is being threatened by Loki, and so a team of favourite superheroes is formed.
","I am a firm believer that every film should be able to stand on its own.This was a heavy action packed movie. The fight scenes were well choreographed, and the CGI was well done. The script cast some stellar characters with interesting backgrounds.In theory this movie should have been tailored to my liking.Unfortunately...I spent the first half of the movie dead bored and wondering how much was left. What this film lacked was character. We didn't see any depth of character. It doesn't matter that the actors or actress showed great facial expressions (reactions), their character was never explored beyond that. They remained flat, personable characters.And yes, I did read the arguments all over the internet: 'That's what the other movies were for. They showed character. Go watch those.' This leads me back to my first statement. It doesn't matter if it's already been done in a preceding movie. I expect to be wowed in THIS movie.To me, this movie came off as melodramatic.I was the wrong audience for this film.Recommends it for: Marvel fans; action-superhero genre fans.",4,4,10,26 April 2015
