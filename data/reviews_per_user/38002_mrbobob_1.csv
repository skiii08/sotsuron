Sucker Punch," Stupidest movie I've ever seen
","This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of movies. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but probably the second worst. It is though, by far, the stupidest.Everything about it is just terrible. Well, actually the intro had potential, but then it just became a horrible mess of plot holes and bad directing.I mean I didn't expect much from the trailer or the poster, but it was way worse than I could ever dream of.I kept wanting to shout 'Why are you doing that?! That serves no purpose! It doesn't help you achieve your goals!'. Examples:Why didn't they do anything when the cook killed Rocket? The music comes back on and she.... continues dancing? NOBODY'S LOOKING AT YOU! YOUR FRIEND NEEDS HELP RIGHT THE FOOD NOW!Train going to city, has bomb on, will explode. Uh... so blow up the track! Get *on* the train, what are you KIDDING ME?Airplane going round and round when there's a dragon down there. Yeah, that's clever.So you're sent to a mental institution. You make up a dream world to escape from your situation. You make up a dream world WHERE YOU ARE AN ABUSED PROSTITUTE. That's like sitting in a boring meeting daydreaming about being in ANOTHER BORING MEETING.And the directing is equally horrible. When I loudly complained about this afterwards someone pointed out that the writer and director are the same person. Makes sense.He's also guilty of extreme overuse of 'filming into a mirror, zoom in, the mirror is now the 3D scene' and similar suspension-of-disbelief- killing methods.No sex or boobs to make up for it either. There was only the hint of a hint of a euphemism for sex. And the PG rating prevented any blood worth mentioning. Fighting scenes - terrible. The less said about them the better.And 'your will be unprepared'... but... you just prepared me. It's like 'prepare to be surprised'.Parting words: (something like) 'Go out and fight!'. What are you, 12? Why? I guess if the people in the movie performed actions completely unrelated to their goals I guess we in real life should too?By the way, yes I did see all the hints about deeper meaning and who's real and who's not, but it was all just half-hearted that you'd think the director/writer just threw a bunch of stuff up there to see what would stick (or possibly did it by accident). Nothing did.The only thing that makes sense about this movie is that it premiered on April 1.",1,8,18,7 April 2011
