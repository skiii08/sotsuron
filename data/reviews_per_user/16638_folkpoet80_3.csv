The Ring," True Horror has come
","I watched this movie last night and I must say this is the best horror movie out of Hollywood, I've ever seen. Earlier this year I saw 'Shining' and 'The Exorcist' - which everyone had been telling me about and saying that they were the scariest movies of all time.... In the end - after watching those two I knew I had wasted time. There was nothing scary, but gore cursing and other stupid effects in both those movies. This movie had some extraordinary direction. Each frame/scene ends leaving you thinking that something will happen.I had to turn away couple times so I wouldn't have to look at the faces of the girl who dies in the start and Naomi's husband who dies in the end. Not that I was scared, but I don't believe looking at those gruesome images is any good, mentally. A true horror classic with no gore, no nudity, no cursing and other B grade horror movie stuff. I would rate this and 'The Others' as the best ones I've ever seen. I live alone in a studio apartment, but I wasn't scared or anything. It's simply a matter of what you want to believe.",9,0,2,25 May 2006
The Exorcist," This is a JOKE
","Yes, I had never seen this movie before!! Until yesterday... I got so pumped after reading reviews like 'This will never get out of your mind.., You won't be able to sleep..blah blah..'That I decided to watch it last night. Here is my take on it. First 45 minutes, nothing happens!! Barely any dialogue, which could sometimes cast magic spell in movies, but here it was horrible.I was actually laughing while watching this idiotic movie. If anything, this movie is full of expletives and swearing coming out of that girl, who is possessed. It is amazing to see how sometimes movies like this can acquire space among classics. Utter disappointment. I can't think of any actor who stood out. Screenplay was splattered all over. I am disappointed to say that there was NOTHING scary in this movie. Nothing that would make you cover your eyes, no sounds, no story, nothing.If you want to watch a true horror classic, watch Gregory Peck's, THE OMEN.",1,13,36,31 March 2005
The Terminal," Wonderfully done
","I was a little hesitant before I rented this one, especially after reading poor reviews on Amazon and Netflix. But Tom Hanks superbly carried the movie on his shoulders with great support from the supporting actors. A man who is simply stuck thanks to the indifference of the authorities, finds refuge and friendship on a most unusual place, an Airport. Comedy was well mixed with momentary drama. Although the ending was realistic, but could have been better if it had focused on Catherine Zeta Jones. So she basically walks away in the end. In any event, may be this is not something you can watch everyday, but definitely worth seeing once. 8/10",8,2,4,10 November 2005
