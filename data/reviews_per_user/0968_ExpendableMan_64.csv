The Rock," Like a heavy metal album made into a movie
","Just before the credits roll at the finale, a brief line of text appears on screen dedicating The Rock to Don Simpson, the Producer who died before it was released. Now while he was alive, Simpson was the walking definition of all the stereotypes of Hollywood excess. He hoovered up cocaine by the bucketload, gave jobs to actresses in exchange for 'favours' and had an ego so bloated he cast himself in a role in Days Of Thunder despite having no previous acting experience, so The Rock couldn't be more of a fitting tribute. It is a loud, brash and incredibly fast paced film where everything is done to excess. The action is spectacular, the explosions enormous and the bad guys keep on finding new and more inventive ways to die, all to a pounding military soundtrack.The story is a spin on the old Die Hard formula with Nicholas Cage starring as a mild mannered FBI Chemical weapons specialist who finds himself running around on Alcatraz with John Mason (Sean Connery) the only man to ever escape the prison and facing off against a squad of disillusioned US Marines who are holding San Francisco to ransom with some deadly bio-weapons. And from this we are treated to all manner of chaos, especially as Mason isn't exactly a willing volunteer...Needless to say, the level of violence goes through the roof. It may take a while for things to really start moving but once Mason makes his initial escape attempt to visit his teenage daughter in a truly jaw-dropping car chase, the pulse speeds onwards without stopping faster than you can say 'Hey, we haven't seen anyone go flying through a window in a little while.' And when our heroes and their doomed Navy SEAL escorts finally make it to Alcatraz a whole string of inventive set-pieces await.What makes it work though is that underneath all the violence and macho posturing, the film has a very sly sense of humour as is readily apparent in the numerous daft lines (the brief nod to Roswell in particular is especially good) and the overwhelming bravado. After all, most people would be traumatised if they were nearly crushed in a stolen Ferrari by an exploding tram car, not Nicholas Cage. He just gets up, brushes himself off and tells a bemused onlooker 'It's not mine,' before punching him in the face and stealing his bike. Not to mention the fact that Cage and Connery make a great double act. Cage has long been adept at playing the bemused everyman thrust into a situation beyond his comprehension but it is Connery who shines. Those who remember him best as the suave, tuxedo clad James Bond may be surprised at the grizzled beast he plays here, as John Mason is an aggressive, foul-mouthed and really, REALLY angry man as ruthless as he is charismatic and capable of quoting Oscar Wilde while being beaten around the head without making it seem contrived.In short then a typical end to Don Simpson's reign as the king of excessive Californian mayhem. With the likes of Top Gun and Beverley Hills Cop to his name, the Producer bows out with a film that not only matches the adrenaline thrill of those classic eighties releases, but also manages to be even louder than they were. Add on a conflicted villain played by Ed Harris who is taking things way too seriously and you have yourselves a highly watchable film with 'guilty pleasure' written all over it.",8,1,2,21 August 2006
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Nicholas Cage and the Guilty Pleasure of Doom
","Not satisfied with stealing the Declaration of Independence last time around, half way through this movie Nicholas Cage says in that trademark drawl of his the words: 'I'm going to kidnap the President of the United States.' In the preceding hour he's not only broken into Buckingham Palace but the Oval Office as well and in the ensuing hour he discovers a top secret diary in the Library of Congress and a Pre-Columbian temple buried in a cave network beneath Mount Rushmore. You can only wonder where they're going to go when the inevitable third entry comes around in 2011, but I wouldn't put it past them kidnapping the Pope and finding Atlantis underneath the Toronto Skydome. As you can probably tell then, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is preposterous guff, but it nevertheless possesses a sense of charm and a feeling of urgency that was lacking from its predecessor.First off the good news, the franchise has improved. The original National Treasure wasn't particularly strong and smelt too strongly of a cross between Indiana Jones and the Da Vinci Code designed purely to cash in on the recent success of Dan Brown's novel. This second instalment however is a lot more fun, the two hour running time zipping past at a remarkable pace as the cast are hurtled from America to France, to England and then back again in a globe trotting adventure to locate a mythical lost city of gold (sorry Dr. Jones they beat you to it). Its a good thing too, if it slowed down for a second there'd be more opportunities to pick up the numerous plot holes - how this is all going to clear the name of Ben Gates's long dead ancestors for instance is never explained particularly well. Neither is why it's so remarkably easy for a history Professor to keep avoiding the CIA.Carbon copy of an established original it may be then but National Treasure 2 still packs in enough outlandish stupidity, dizzying set pieces and intriguing historical trivia to have it ear marked as a guilty pleasure. Ever wanted to know how to use a London traffic camera to record a vital piece of evidence while in the middle of a car chase? This is the film for you. As an added bonus it's also the most animated that Nicholas Cage has been in years, avoiding his recent tendency to phone things in by playing Ben Gates with just the right mixture of rebellious humour and deadpan seriousness. Granted, it's just a bit too obvious where all the chief inspirations have come from but even so, National Treasure 2 is entertaining enough to warrant a night in front of the television with your brain switched off.And at least the Lost City of Gold in this movie doesn't have a flying saucer buried in it.",7,2,4,2 June 2008
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Will Smith and Matt Damon playing golf for two hours, much better than it sounds
","The thing you have to bear in mind when watching The Legend of Bagger Vance is that sports movies, by their very definition, tend to match the atmosphere of the sport they depict. Football or Ice hockey movies for instance tend to be loud, bombastic and flashy, just like the games themselves. Basketball movies meanwhile often rely on the street/hip hop connection and are just as loud, but with a slightly more gritty edge to them, provided you completely forget about the atrocious Space Jam. Bagger Vance on the other hand revolves entirely around golf and consequently, is a lot quieter, slower paced and gentle than its brash genre cousins, but it nevertheless possesses a charm and subtlety that is quite endearing.Told completely in flashback, the film's story involves Matt Damon's depressed World War One veteran Rannulph Junnuh taking part in a highly publicised golf tournament against two established (real life) professionals - Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones. At first things don't look good, Junnuh hasn't played the game since getting back from the trenches and is a slovenly drunken washout and despite having the support of the townsfolk, nobody really expects him to win. And then he gets a new caddy in the shape of Bagger Vance (Will Smith).At this point I imagine alarm bells are ringing in your head. Will Smith must mean wise-cracking, one-liners and the word 'damn' being stretched out so that it consists of two syllables right? Well you'll be relieved to know that Bagger is a pleasant change of direction for the normal Smith stereotype. Relaxing on his heels and working his acting muscles instead of his action hero ones, Smith is the undeniable soul of the movie. His eminently likable charm is still there, but he relies more on home spun wisdom and gentle prodding to help Damon back into his game, rather than calling him a honkey and effecting a cocky swagger. Playing off against him, Matt Damon is suitably vulnerable and insecure but is overshadowed a bit and with the exception of Junnuh's two rivals, the rest of the cast might as well be superfluous. Thankfully, Junnuh's redemption and Vance's easy going friendship is enough to carry the film and the story, while corny, is just as charming as the title character.Elsewhere, director Robert Redford once again shows off his knack for beautiful cinematography. As most of the film takes place on golf courses you're never too far away from some gorgeous scenery and the contrast between the vibrant green vegetation and stunning blue sky makes Bagger Vance a feast for the eyes. Given the film's somewhat slow pace, it also makes this an ideal choice for a wet Sunday afternoon where you'd like to go for a walk and appreciate the countryside but are unable to thanks to the rain.That said, Bagger Vance still has its faults. The writing is a bit hackneyed and anyone who doesn't like cheese would do well to stay away. Junnuh's love interest sub-plot with golf promoter Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) meanwhile feels tacked on and unnecessary, as though somewhere along the production line someone decided that if Junnuh was to fully come to terms with himself he'd have to get it on with a sweet country belle. The positives outweigh the negatives though and if you're in the mood for a relaxing, slow paced movie with a lot of subtleties that not everyone will appreciate, you can't really go wrong with Bagger Vance. This is a film to watch with your feet up, the house clean and a big mug of hot chocolate in your hand. And refreshingly enough for a sports movie, it doesn't feature a scene where a big crowd begins cheering wildly while over-the-top power ballads play in the background, that alone should be enough to raise an eyebrow or two.",7,42,53,22 October 2007
Walk the Line," Excellent
","At this point in time I'm sure you've heard all you need to know about Walk The Line and don't even need to see yet another review from an English guy with a film studies degree on the Internet to make up your mind about whether to see it or not. I'm sure you know all about how stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whitherspoon sing all the tracks themselves, how the story builds up a stark portrayal of the Man In Black's back story and the emotional turbulence that led to the creation of such classic songs, but the simple fact of the matter is this; all the hype is richly, justly deserved.But then Johnny Cash's life story was always perfect fodder for the biopic hungry crowd. He grew up in a poor rural area of America and blames himself for a childhood tragedy, carrying the self-loathing and rage tightly wound within the depths of his being for the rest of his life. He is at first rejected by studios who don't want to hear more gospel music and so sets out to craft his own sound, but as his success increases his first marriage deteriorates in a spiral of infidelities and drug abuse. He finds himself at death's door and on the verge of his entire life collapsing, turns things around in startling fashion tailor made for an uplifting, life affirming climax.So far, so very Ray with an acoustic guitar and better eyesight, but then Ray was such an incredible film in the first place, it's all too easy to just sit back and get lost in the saga until you realise you've been sat in the cinema for the last two hours with the same expression on your face staring open mouthed at the screen. And you can put that down to the magnetism of the stars.Joaquin Phoenix for starters is a revelation. He doesn't so much play Johnny Cash as wear him like a glove and commands the screen with a power that fixes your attention from the offset. Just watch the moments where he sings an impromptu version of Fulsom Prison Blues after the label agent ridicules his gospel songs, the combination of his whiskey-soaked voice and those sad, yearning eyes creating a truly dramatic turn, quite an accomplishment when all it really is is a man singing and playing guitar in a cramped recording studio. The occasional moments of awkward nervousness that impeded his role as Emperor Commodus in Gladiator are gone and in their place is a man who has ascended from a position as a movie star and can now stand toe to toe with the greatest thesps in cinema history.But good as Phoenix is, even he is outdone by co-star Reese Whitherspoon as his love interest June Carter. Unlike Phoenix, Whitherspoon did not have the aid of her real-life counterpart for inspiration, but nevertheless she encapsulates the character so fully you can't help but wonder if the girl who made the Legally Blonde movies wasn't a different person altogether. As June, she plays the sweet, wild west gal stage persona alongside the backstage position as the confident, strong woman that tamed Johnny Cash and does so with a great deal of conviction. Phoenix is almost guaranteed the Best Actor Oscar but with a performance like this, it's hard not to see the Best Actress statue going to this movie either.The end result is a film that is very frank in it's honesty. Cash does not get smothered in adulation, but is instead shown as a very human character behind the songs that gave him fame. With his recent passing, Walk The Line is an excellent tribute, showing us the troubled man without flinching and focusing on the truth of his life, just as his songs did when they were first crafted by a tired old man with nothing but a cigarette, a guitar and a head full of demons to draw from.",9,0,0,24 February 2006
Training Day," Fantastic, Denzel Washington's finest hour
","Before seeing this movie, my impression of Denzil Washington as an actor wasn't especially high. Not to say that he isn't talented, just that ever since Crimson Tide he appeared to be slotted neatly into every stern hero in every serious political thriller to be trotted off the studio assembly line for years. But then came Training Day and his role as Alonzo Harris and all that changed. Shrugging off the overly serious good guy image once and for all, Washington here is a revelation; a barking, ranting maelstrom of police brutality who believes that maintaining order on the crime ridden streets of LA means being even more ruthless than the drug dealers he faces on a day to day basis. His performance elevates the film from standard thriller fare into an exemplary story that has quite rightly become one of my favourite films of all time.Set over the course of twenty four hours, the film whisks Ethan Hawke's naive young police officer onto an introductory day of Narcotics work under Alonzo's tutelage. As the hours go by, Hawke is subjected to more and more violence as the heat and paranoia of suburban Los Angeles combined with his loose cannon superior officer play a heavy toll on his nerves. Consequently, the film is very much a two man story with Hawke and Washington playing off against each other expertly as polar opposites. One young, inexperienced and a firm believer in the rule book, the other older, more cynical and twisted by all his years on the streets into a bull-headed monster.The story itself is fraught with tension. Alonzo forcing his young protégé to smoke PCP at gunpoint is just the start and from there on the pulse pounding never stops. The execution scene where Hawke realises just how far gone his partner is for example is one of nail-biting pressure and shortly after, his encounter with a trio of Mexican gang members is jaw dropping, working as the exact moment you realise how much hot water he has found himself in.The end result is nothing less than a brilliant thriller. Hawke and Washington make for a phenomenal double act and the pace only occasionally lets up to allow the characters time to breathe and establish the depth that makes you care for them more. Highly, highly recommended so long as you're prepared to be absolutely terrified of Denzel Washington for years to come.",9,121,141,15 May 2006
Monster," Excellent
","Even now, eleven years after 'Monster' was first released, it's still difficult to comprehend that that's Charlize Theron you're watching. We all know that it's her of course, but it's still hard to reconcile the wild eyed, jittery and aggressively-defensive woman at the centre of this film with the glamorous Hollywood starlet we're used to. What's even more remarkable is that despite being a violent, foul-mouthed and unhinged lunatic who winds up killing several people, Theron still manages to make Aileen Wuornos a sympathetic character. She does some terrible things, but you'll still feel sorry for her come the closing credits. It's a masterful performance and that Oscar was well deserved.A single terrific performance doesn't make a movie however and even if it were a different actress in the lead role, 'Monster' would still be an excellent movie. It tells the story of a woman who became a prostitute at the age of 13, never escaped it and eventually grew into a gun-totting serial killer who would pick up men at the roadside, then murder them to steal their cars and money. It's a film about life at the bottom rung of society and is mercilessly harrowing in its depiction of life in the gutter. There are scenes of rape and murder, some devastatingly un-erotic sexual encounters and there's more chance of Godzilla turning up than a Richard Gere shaped Knight In Shining Armour.And yet, 'Monster' still has moments of warmth and humour. Aileen's rather misguided attempts at pursuing a new career lead to a few unexpected laughs, while her roller-disco kiss with her lesbian lover Selby is remarkably touching. There's also a brief but moving appearance by Bruce Dern as Aileen's only real friend and his speech about survival is one of the great understated moments of the film.Plus, there's Christina Ricci as Selby who plays off against Theron admirably. Where Aileen is loud and confrontational, Selby is shy, quiet and for the most part rather sweet. She also gets rather petulant at times and Ricci manages to just about convince that she can remain innocent while begging Aileen to start prostituting herself for money again. What's more, they have a natural chemistry and do genuinely seem to love one another, even when screaming at each other in alcohol fuelled frustration.In other words,this is an excellent film. Theron gives the performance of her career and the film does a remarkable job shining a light on the grubby underbelly of modern society. Prostitutes, alcoholics, junkies and vagrants all exist and while 'Monster' doesn't exactly make them seem noble, it does humanise them. Highly recommended.",9,2,2,20 July 2014
Alien: Resurrection," Runaway egos and unnecessary sequels
","Back when I was about thirteen, I remember cheering with delight upon hearing that this movie would be made. I was born too late to catch any of the preceding films in the cinema but thanks to play ground gossip and not-entirely-wholesome class mates I'd managed to catch all three on video in those heady few hours between getting home from school and the scramble to hide the boxes when my parents got in from work. Needless to say then, my hormone addled teenage self practically foamed at the mouth at the prospect of more alien carnage, especially when somebody mentioned they were bringing the guns back into the franchise. However, I was of course still too young to see it on the big screen and it wasn't until a plane flight back from Florida a year later that I finally caught Alien: Resurrection in all it's glory. I whooped and hollered with delight and thought it was the most bad ass thing I'd ever seen. However, upon watching it again recently, all it really achieved was reminding me of the old me (which ironically was the young me) and how easily pleased I was. So I guess the whole point of this whimsical and nostalgic tale which has most likely caused the majority of you to skip to the next review down after clicking the 'not useful' button is simply this; for gun crazy, early teenagers wanting gore, violence and acid bleeding monsters, this is a an absolute must once you've seen Aliens. For the slightly more seasoned film goer however, the ones who would have chosen The Third Man, The Seventh Seal, Cool Runnings or Citizen Kane on the flight instead, Alien: Resurrection is ultimately unrewarding.Now, for all the plus points (Ron Pearlman!), the minus points (alien sex???) and the sitting on the fence points (is Distephano awesome or not? I can't tell), the principle reason for dismissing Alien: Resurrection is this: it's completely and utterly unnecessary. The original trilogy as I'm sure you're well aware runs in sequence quite beautifully. It moves from a haunting, slow paced opener, to a fast paced and action packed middle bit before climaxing in a grim, nihilistic opus of despair. Alien: Resurrection doesn't fit the storyline at all, it feels tacked on, the last slow gasp of the horse as it gets beaten to death. And given that two hundred years after Alien 3, scientists are able to clone Ripley and the alien inside her makes the character's noble sacrifice at the close of the third act less heroic and more of a delaying action.Credit where credit's due though, it does have a very striking visual style. The influence of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet has carried over into the Gilliam-alike cinematography where everything is filmed with muddied, hazy colours and bizarre machinery waits round every corner. The appearance of the scientists in particular is pure nightmare fantasy; all shiny white suits that lead up to heads wearing quirky optic goggles and topped off with slick, greased back hair. The corridors of the ship meanwhile are dimly lit, endless octagonal constructs that fittingly enough, look like the inside of an alien's intestinal tract. Alien: Resurrection may not be the high point of the franchise, but it sure as hell is the weirdest looking one. In fact, the best way to describe the whole thing would be as some kind of dark, science fiction carnival of the grotesque, with the 'grotesque' part ably supplied by a smattering of gore in which the human body is ruined in some incredibly inventive ways (at one point a man quite literally picks apart his own brain).Unfortunately though, imagery, gore and violence alone do not a good movie make. Unless it's 300. 300 was great. But I digress...At the forefront of the problem here is this new version of Ripley. I hate to pass judgement on an actress the calibre of Sigourney Weaver but it does seem as though her ego was left to run rampant on the film every step of the way. This carries over into her performance as well, with this version of Ripley remaining nothing more than an aloof, nonchalant presence to such an extent that even the emotional outpouring when she torches a clone lab feels altogether forced and unnatural. The Ripley of the previous movies was an impassioned and determined survivalist, this one is just sterile. This wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the cast could fill in the blanks but sadly, they're the most uninteresting bunch of xenomorph ready meals yet. There's none of the natural charisma or camaraderie of the marines or the inmates and with the exception of Dominique Pinon as an ass kicking, handicapped mechanic and Ron Pearlman as Ron Pearlman, they're very difficult to root for.By and large then, not a great film. It has its plus points but an uninteresting cast, silly concept and uninspiring heroine bring it down terribly and it's only real worth when compared to the rest of the series is as a catalogue of inventive deaths, best of which is undoubtedly the 'chestburster out the torso and through a man's head' bit. It all reaches its zenith of course with the unveiling of the new monster, a human/alien hybrid that resembles a New York sanitation commissioner who just had the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man detonate above his head.And Winona Ryder was rubbish.",4,6,12,23 April 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Difficult sequel to a tee
","Criticising Pirates of the Caribbean is a bit like criticising Christmas. It is one of those sacred institutions whereby daring to even utter a word against it leaves one branded a miser and a scrooge with no sense of fun, but the downside is sometimes it is quite apt. Now the original Pirates movie was terrific, an energetic romp through the high seas that has become one of the classic blockbusters of the decade, but the sequel sadly isn't quite as good. Like trying to recreate the childhood magic of the holiday season as an adult, it just isn't as rewarding. Not that Dead Man's Chest isn't a good film, far from it. In fact it's another highly entertaining ride with enough one liners, set pieces, 'yarr matey' shenanigans and sea monsters to keep the multiplexes packed for months, but unfortunately it doesn't have the zest of it's predecessor. The main reason for this appears to be a case of over-ambition on the producers part as they have crafted an epic film with multiple plot strands and have sadly succumbed to the same over-stretching that blighted the Matrix sequels.The storyline here involves Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) attempts to pay off a blood debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), commander of a fearsome crew of sea monsters and Captain of the fabled Flying Dutchman. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) meanwhile is hired by the East India trading company to retrieve a key that Sparrow is searching for in return for pardons for his crimes in the first film. Inevitably, Turner's fiancée Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) becomes involved as well and all three characters set off on their own individual plot lines as they race towards a reunion in the latter half of the film. This may sound exciting on paper, but sadly what it translates to is increasing the running time to a bladder-challenging length and over-complicating the premise. Worse, each character is afforded an equal amount of attention and as they all become separated, Johnny Depp is given less screen time. Bad move. Jack Sparrow was the best thing about the first film and once again, every second he is on screen is a joy to behold. Unfortunately, Turner and Swann are considerably less interesting characters and whenever the storyline returns to them, you find yourself tapping your fingers and waiting for the mascara-clad pirate rogue to reappear. The pacing suffers because of this and there's a continual sense that much of the fat could have been trimmed to make this as sleek a vessel as the first: an escape from an island populated by cannibals at the start for instance is riotously enjoyable but in all truthfulness, isn't that essential to the rest of the film.That said, Dead Man's Chest is still a rewarding experience despite it's faults. Alongside Depp's vibrant charisma there are some terrific performances including the return of the ever bickering Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook) who provide a lot of laughs, plus the foreboding sight of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). His is a villain that easily matches that of Captain Barbosa from Curse of the Black Pearl, a sea-dwelling abomination with horrific arachnid legs and a beard composed of a slimy wriggling mass of tentacles. But the real breakout is from Jack Davenport, who returns to play the now-ruined Commodore Norrington. Where once was a man of honour is a drunken, brawling, back-stabbing villain and one of the biggest surprises is that he quite effectively steals every scene he's in.Furthermore, the studio hasn't held back on some big budget set pieces. A three way sword fight inside a spinning waterwheel is perhaps the standout as director Gore Verbinski makes the players throw in a really rough and tumble ride that looks so dangerous it's amazing nobody was hurt. Added to this are plenty of rucks with the Kraken, a vast sea monster sent by Davy Jones to drag Sparrow to the bottom of the ocean and numerous clashes with all kind of villains.Additionally, they should be praised for making Dead Man's Chest a significantly darker proposition. There's an ever lingering sense of foreboding hanging over it and the moody lighting, grim score, themes of damnation and the sight of men having their eyeballs pecked out by crows leave no doubts that the waters are far more turbulent this time around. And let's not even get into the sub-textual references of Jack Sparrow falling into an open grave...In a nutshell then, Dead Man's Chest is a film all set to divide audiences. The over-indulgence in the running time and the sometimes convoluted storyline do it no favours but these grievances aside, it still makes for a glorious evening's entertainment with plenty of giddy thrills to remind us all why we love Jack so much. Just bare in mind that it is the first part of a two part story and come the jaw-dropping cliffhanger ending, you'll be counting the days till Pirates 3 sets sail.",7,4,8,13 July 2006
Oldboy," Good, but not outstanding
","Oldboy, the Korean film so beloved of Tarantino has become something of a word of mouth cult film in the UK lately. As a film student myself, I've heard plenty of talk in seminars among other people on my course about this incredible movie that simply has to be seen but I wasn't swayed into watching it immediately because of one thing; it is director Chan-wook Park's follow up to Sympathy For Mr Vengeance. That previous film, while decent enough went on far too long and the end payoff was not quite worth it, yet despite this it was hyped to the heavens. So, settling down to watch Oldboy, I was a tad wary of the hype machine blinding viewers to the limitations of an otherwise unspectacular film.Like Sympathy...Oldboy is another film concerned with the theme of revenge but on a first glance, seems a little more straightforward in it's approach. A man named Oh Dae-Su has been imprisoned in a room for 15 years and when released, sets about hunting down the people who did this to him and taking his revenge. On the surface, this seems like a simple revenge fantasy, but as the mystery of why he was subjected to his confinement unfurls, things become a little more complicated. Lee Woo-Jin, his nemesis is at first a cold, calculating man fixated on destroying Dae-Su, but once his reason for doing so becomes clear, its hard not to feel just a little sympathy for him. Furthermore, Park pulls plot twist after plot twist out of his film makers bag of tricks, but manages to keep it from becoming disorientating like in say, Identity and the pace of the film does not suffer for these quiet, analytical sequences.However, what ultimately lets it down is that you get the feeling Park wasn't totally decided on what sort of film to make. Sympathy...for all its flaws had no misgivings about the fact it was a dark revenge tale, but Oldboy cannot seem to decide whether it is a action spectacle or a twisted, Oedipal tragedy. The infamous corridor fight sequence for instance, while fun, seems extremely out of place with the rest of the film and can we really believe that Dae-Su is such a great fighter, when all the training he has done has consisted of shadow boxing? And whoever was in charge of casting needs a grand old kick in the balls, as Dae-Su and Woo-Jin look to have about fifteen years of age difference between them, when they're supposed to be almost the same age.An interesting and diverting film then, but hardly the nugget of cinematic gold that some have made it out to be. Also, be prepared for some rather gruesome moments. In one instance, the lead characters eats a live octopus, in another a man has his teeth snapped out with a hammer and there are numerous cases of torture and violence.",6,24,81,4 April 2005
Superbad," The best teen movie since American Pie
","Having covered middle age and young adulthood with the wicked one-two punch of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Hollywood's current reigning comedy overlord Judd Apatow turns his sight on teenagers. And although this isn't quite as good a film as his pregnancy misadventure, Superbad is more of the balls out laugh marathon that Knocked Up was billed as. Focusing on three teenage friends taking the long route to the graduation party, it is a very funny but also rather sad film that portrays eighteen year olds in a much more realistic way than usual. Producers/directors/writers take note; the average adolescent male doesn't give a toss about the prom, the big game or dating the geeky-but-hot girl, he just wants to get laid and is liable to do just about anything bar you know, talking to a girl to do so. Superbad knows this and while the overly familiar plot is hardly going to score points for originality, it certainly racks them up when it comes to the execution.Granted, the few female characters are little more than sketches, but our central trio of Seth (Jonah Hill), Evan (Michael Cera) and Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are brilliantly written and performed. Seth is rotund, foul-mouthed and aggressively insecure, Evan is quiet, vulnerable and the most level headed of the three while Fogell is so nerdy he'd even get kicked out of a Stargate convention. Every scene where they're together fizzles with chemistry, the lads bickering and trading some killer lines and it's very easy to believe that they've been friends since childhood. Not only that, but their insecurities are profoundly believable and their tendency to over-examine everything girls say to them makes them all likable leads.It's therefore no surprise that Seth ropes them all into a plan to get in the girls good-books by using Fogell's newly acquired fake ID to purchase alcohol. All they have to do is go to the nearest convenience store, pick up a few bottles and then head back. Simple right? Well things get rapidly out of hand and soon the narrative splits in two, Fogell spending most of the evening with the two most unprofessional cops in America (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) while Seth and Evan, believing that Fogell's been arrested, try to find alternative sources of booze. Several near disasters later and they find themselves at loggerheads which is where Superbad's real soul emerges. The overlying story may be about their relationship with girls, but it's really about the friendship between Seth and Evan. With college looming ever closer they know their days of raging hormones will soon be over and what's more, they'll be separated as they head off to different schools. Their break-up and inevitable make-up is incredibly touching in it's sincerity and should speak volumes to anyone who ever had to go to University and leave their best friend behind.So Apatow once again knows how to do heart-breaking sentimentality but what about the comedy aspect? Well, after Knocked Up's intelligent relationship commentary, Superbad is a bit more low brow but man is it funny. The storyline fires out a rapid succession of smutty humour and is utterly remorseless in its assault, an early penis-drawing flashback being one especially gut churning highlight. It's a good thing too, you'll be crying with laughter so much that no-one will really notice if you start blubbing when the heart-wrenching ending rolls around.In some respects this is the sort of film that Kevin Smith would make if he ever made a film about his adolescence, but with the added bonus of not having to put up with Jason Mewes for the entire thing. It has familiar cast members, an easily-relatable scenario and a script packed to the rafters with pop culture nods and foul mouthed humour, but lurking beneath it all is an honest paean to awkward outsiders in every secondary school. If you spent your teen years as captain of the football team, smoking behind bike sheds, banging the school bike and calling the kid wearing Metallica shirts things like 'Mayor of Loserville,' you should probably avoid this film. And go fist yourself. But for everyone who still looks back on secondary school with fond sentimentality and secretly wishing they could have brought a few more mates out with them, this is the best slice of Pie since the American one.",8,0,4,29 January 2008
Troy," Whoops, it's rubbish
","What with all the anticipation for the macho thunder epic 300's imminent release, fans of bloody historical battles in movies may be tempted as I was to go back and re-watch Wolfgang Peterson's Troy as a warm up. However, I'd strongly advise against it. My first impression of the movie when it came out a few years back was that it was decent enough but ultimately forgettable and a poor runner up to Gladiator's success. A second viewing nowadays reveals the full extent of Troy's weaknesses and it is undeniably a very poor film, trading any worthy story or acting for spectacle and leaving us with a rather shallow interpretation of an epic conflict.Set a really, really, really long time ago, the film sees the ruthless Agamemnon (Brian Cox), King of the Greek Empire looking for an excuse to invade his equally powerful neighbour, the nation of Troy. When his brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is humiliated by his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) running off with Paris (Orlando Bloom), prince of Troy, Agamemnon realises his chance and sets sail with a vast armada of warships, crammed to the hilt with Greek warriors in pursuit of conquest. And suckered into this high body-count soap opera come a variety of classical Greek characters, each with his own stamp to leave on the tale.On the plus side, despite being 'based on' Homer's 'The Illiad,' Peterson makes clear this is not a direct transcription of the story. As a result, he jettisons the Gods from the proceedings, reduces the length of the war from ten years to a few months and focuses squarely on the fighting and the people involved. Thus, we are saved the sight of celestial super beings interfering in events and are given a rather straightforward war story. The downside of this however is that somehow, Peterson has managed to make what should have been an Earth shattering conflict come across as more of a quiet little skirmish.Take for example the initial beach landing as the Greek armada lands on Trojan soil. Leading the charge is Brad Pitt's Achilles who has raced ahead of the rest of the fleet in order to show off. Achilles and his men then go on to win the battle almost entirely by themselves in a logic defying leap designed to show just how dangerous the man is meant to be. Unfortunately, it fails to do so and instead makes the Trojan military force come across as a woefully inept bunch of losers who were lucky to survive this long, their response to Pitt and co landing on their shores being a pathetic flight of arrows when in truth, they should have been wiped out almost immediately by a hail of death.This doesn't bode well but things begin to brighten up when Agamemnon leads an assault on the city itself. The sight of the huge Greek army piling into the equally-huge Trojan force is the most visually spectacular moment of the film, but sadly it's all over too soon. The subsequents reprisals and the eventual climax to the war can only disappoint, the movie whimpering when it should roar.The acting meanwhile is a game of two halves. On the one hand, there is the likes of Sean Bean as Odysseus and Pete O'Toole's King Priam lending some heavyweight class, plus Eric Bana's fantastic portrayal of the heroic Hector who is easily the best thing about the movie. Then there is Orlando Bloom's nondescript Paris, Brian Cox's spoilt brat Agamemnon and Brad Pitt's Achilles doing their level best to scupper everything. Indeed, a lot of the time it feels as though the film is turning into a Brad Pitt vanity project, the camera lingering all over him as he pouts into the lens. Somewhat worryingly, he also spends the majority of the film stark naked, turning Achilles from an all powerful force of the Gods into a narcissistic nudist.These gripes aside, what ultimately wrecks Troy's aspirations of greatness comes in another common-sense defying scene in the later half that puts even the beach assault to shame with its crass stupidity. With both sides drained, morale low and stricken with tragedy, King Priam disguises himself and sneaks into the Greek camp to talk with Achilles in a moment of desperation. Yes, you didn't read that incorrectly, THE KING WALTZES INTO THE ENEMY CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THEIR CHAMPION AND NOBODY THINKS TO MENTION IT. I mean come on, surely someone in the studio system must have noticed this rather glaring piece of idiocy and pointed out to the director how incredibly stupid it was? Needless to say, this is not a good movie. One impressive battle scene and a charismatic Eric Bana are not enough to save it from drowning under it's own flabby excess. It flits between a classical tale, a war story and a Brad Pitt love-in session with a worrying ease and leaves the impression that ancient Greece was nothing but a glorified soap opera. Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven frankly, leave it in the dust. Here's hoping 300 rekindles the Greek pride.",3,17,36,23 March 2007
Dead Poets Society," Robin Williams invents a string of school movie clichés
","Best known for it's (in)famous 'oh Captain my Captain' sequence, Dead Poets Society's biggest problem is the clichés it invented for the high school movie drama. Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies. Dead Poets Society's teenagers aren't simply lust crazed hormone bags that wander into embarrassing social accidents every fifteen minutes, they're a tad more realistic...for most of the film at least. When the movie ventures into darker territory in the closing quarter it falters, becoming an awkward attempt at manipulating emotions that jars against the promising story told in the beginning.Set in a prestigious school where the upper lips are stiff, the shirts stuffed and the emotions repressed, a class of teenage boys find their new English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) taking a slight detour from the established curriculum. Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse. Soon, the boys are exploring various avenues of life (one becomes an actor, another pursues a local girl etc...) while their parents look on disapprovingly and the identikit old-fashioned teachers with grey hair and suits start trying to interfere.What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.Dead Poets Society therefore is ultimately a promise that wasn't completely fulfilled as the subtle, intelligent storytelling is blown out of the water by the mishandling of the closing scenes. Consequently, if you're anything like me, you'll spend most of the film trying to guess which kid pops his clogs. It's an enjoyable and involving drama, but as a tear-jerker it fails to move. Williams is excellent as always though and for seventy five percent of the time, Dead Poets Society is a great film.",7,10,17,8 October 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Brilliant! A roller-coaster finale to the trilogy
","It's somewhat ironic that a film where the majority of the action takes place on the ocean is shallower than a millipede's paddling pool but in many ways, that is one of the great strengths of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Employing the same approach as the previous film, it is in no two minds of what kind of world it is set in. The original may have been grounded in reality despite its plethora of undead pirates, but At World's End is rooted firmly in a fantastical universe where normal rules do not apply and by the time a woman grows to nearly forty feet tall then turns into thousands upon thousands of crabs in the final third, there is no question that Pirates 3 is totally and utterly bonkers. It's also the most fun you can have while sitting in a darkened room with total strangers, shovelling popcorn into your mouth.Beginning with a deceptively dark introduction where several dozen people are led to the gallows by the fascist East India Trading Company, Pirates rattles on rather quickly to Singapore, where Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) and co are set for a meeting with Chow Yun-Fat's Fu Manchu-style Pirate Lord, Sao Feng. One explosive brawl with a battalion of English marines later and the cast are off on a do-or-die mission to return Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to the world of the living, unite the Pirate Lords and fight back against the tyrannical villains who are taking over the high seas.Needless to say, not everything makes sense. Quite exactly how being eaten by a giant squid monster can send you to an otherworldly desert is never fully explained. Neither is how an entire ship can sail off the edge of the world and have everybody emerge unscathed. And with double crosses and triple crosses piling up in such a chaotic fashion that it becomes nigh on impossible to keep track of what exactly is going on, there'll be plenty of ammunition in the bag for anyone who hates this movie to fall back on. But it still doesn't detract from just how much fun this film is. It's a riotous blast through the high seas where a new set piece is always only a few minutes away and the closest a movie is ever likely to get to becoming a roller-coaster.Sure, the bit where Elizabeth makes a big pre-battle speech and prattles on about freedom is cringe-worthy and the scene where she and Will get married in the midst of an apocalyptic battle is relentlessly stupid, but there's a very simple solution: just turn your brain off. That's right, turn it off. Don't worry about cohesion, character motives, emotional development or sub-textual references and just get caught up in it. After all, nobody who goes to Disneyland to ride Thunder Mountain is likely to sit there complaining about historical inaccuracies with the plastic mining equipment.At World's End is naturally, a film that will divide audiences. There are already plenty of critics lining up to poke holes in it but there are just as likely to be those who revel in it as pure chaos gets played out on screen. Geoffrey Rush is clearly having a whale of a time, Johnny Depp is as charismatic as ever, Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is a formidable villain and by the time the blistering climactic ship battle has subsided, you'll likely be wondering if you'll see a more insane film all year.",9,5,10,31 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," So....where's Venom?
","If you've caught any of the pre-release hype for the third Spiderman movie (and if you haven't, welcome friend to Earth, this little grey box before you is called a Talk-A-Matron and my name is HAL. I'm in charge round here), chances are you've been convinced that it's the dark chapter in the saga. You know, the grim and brooding one with the web-slinger sat on Gargoyles at the top of Cathedrals in the rain. The one which will send the kids home with nightmares, terrified that Venom is hiding in the attic and so forth. Well, Sam Raimi and co lied to you I'm afraid. That's right, they lied! Because this movie is so light and breezy as to make Scooby-Doo look like The Exorcist and the emphasis is on extended action sequences rather than subtle and layered character development.As such, Peter Parker's much talked about descent amounts to him getting a bit more arrogant than usual, dressing in black, adding a touch of mascara to his face and doing up his hair in a trendy new Indie rock do. If only he'd started listening to The Jesus And Mary Chain in his spare time then maybe Aunt May would have found something more to worry about.Luckily, when Raimi and co are dishing out the action sequences things step up a gear into pure popcorn munching fun. In many ways, it all plays like a video game: Level One, high speed chase with the new Goblin; Level Two, security van smackdown with the Sandman; Level Three, guide Spidey through angst-ridden interpretive dance in a jazz club...It's all very silly and won't be winning anything at Cannes by any stretch of the imagination, but then you don't exactly go to watch comic book movies for bold, innovative film making do you? With Tobey Maguire going through a difficult phase, it falls to the rest of the cast to spice things up, with this year's 'Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie' award going to Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marco, aka The Sandman. Raimi clearly has a lot of love for the character as reports of the special effects team studying sand for two years will testify and this is channelled into a moving portrayal of wounded masculinity by the best actor in the film. Given that he's labelled as the real killer of Parker's Uncle Ben, the fact that he's able to wring such pathos from those sad, sad eyes is all the more impressive.If you've seen either of the preceding chapters you'll know what to expect from cast regulars Kirsten Dunst and James Franco, as well as the traditional scene stealing from J. K. Simmons as Parker's boss, so with fanboy speculation driven to breaking point by months of teaser trailers, the bulk of expectation falls on Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, more commonly known as Venom. And aside from the fact that he's not quite imposing enough, Grace does a terrific job. From his first moments on screen, he is delightfully sleazy and just the sort of man who society doesn't want to get hold of super powers. After all, for Parker, great power brings great responsibility whereas for Brock it brings great opportunities for ass-kicking.Sadly though, despite that long waiting period and plenty of build up, Venom doesn't exactly get a lot of screen time. In fact he's barely shown up before the climactic brawl for all that pitches our hero into a match with all three of his foes at once. It's terrific to see Venom on screen naturally but you can't help wishing he were there longer and it winds up feeling an awful lot like a Wrestling Pay Per View which features the long awaited return of the Rock, only for him to fall off the entrance ramp and get rushed to hospital after four hours of matches between less-interesting grapplers.Parents needn't be afraid though, the nippers are going to absolutely love this. It's not half as bleak as you might imagine, has wall to wall action and best of all, will keep them entertained for a full two and a half hours. For those of us who are a bit older than the kids and a bit younger than their parents however, it does disappoint somewhat after the near-perfect Spiderman 2, even if it does boast a trio of cameos which are all memorable for different reasons, namely Bruce Campbell (awesome!), Willem Dafoe (sinister) and Stan Lee (really, really stupid). On the slim chance that any of the producers are reading this however, I'd recommend editing out the 'swing in front of the American flag' bit for the overseas market when the DVD comes out.",6,0,0,10 May 2007
Zodiac," I left my heart (and my sanity, marriage, career and social life) in San Francisco
","Sometimes getting the best out of a film depends entirely on what setting you watch it in. Sit down on a Friday night with five of your mates after a paintball game, a fridge filled with beer and nine boxes of pizza on the coffee table and it's a dead cert that you will not enjoy Zodiac. It would seem too long, too talk-heavy and too dark and after less than an hour, the DVD would go sailing out of the machine and replaced with Blade 2. However, if you watch it alone at night with nobody else in the house, all the lights turned off and your phone switched off and you'll be in exactly the right place to appreciate it fully. And what an experience it is. Zodiac, while not the greatest film in director David Fincher's back catalogue (this is the man that directed Fight Club after all) is like a twenty-first century version of a classic film noir. The lighting is grim, the story slow paced, the male-centric cast obsessive and paranoid and by the time the deliberately ambiguous ending rolls around, your eyes will be gaping wide and you'll be lucky to sleep for a week.Based around the true life Zodiac case the film marks Fincher's return to the serial killer genre he previously did so memorably with Seven. No surprise then that there's a fair bit of expectation resting on it and your response to the movie inevitably depends on how familiar you are with his previous work. For one thing, the murders in this movie are not gory set pieces designed to get the blood hounds hot under the collar, but chillingly executed scenes of real-world horror. The pre-credits attack for instance is pure Fincher; awkward sexual tension hanging in the air as a young couple meet up for an illicit affair only to be stalked and set upon by a shadowy assailant who subsequently vanishes into thin air. Later this scene is echoed as a middle aged married couple are viciously slaughtered while lounging by a lake in broad daylight. Both sequences are tense and slow paced and the director's refusal to make them overly melodramatic adds to the sense of genuine brutality.Furthermore, Zodiac is one of the darkest films released last year and even scenes that take place in daylight have the oppressive feel of shadows moving in. While the investigation into the killer takes up a lot of the running time, the story is mainly focused on how three different lives are affected by the murders. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) is a newspaper cartoonist whose natural skill at code breaking and problem solving suckers him in when Zodiac starts sending cryptic messages to the San Francisco Chronicle. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is one of the paper's most respected journalists who takes a very intense interest in the case. David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the chief police inspector hunting the killer. Each one becomes affected in their own way as the story unfolds and before long, their private obsessions see marriages destroyed and careers ended, their day to day actions haunted by a constant sensation of hooded eyes watching their every move.Naturally, as this is all based on a genuine story there is an added dimension to it and to his eternal credit, Fincher hasn't backed down from his vision in order to please the studios. However, it also means that the killer's identity is never fully revealed, a fact that some will find incredibly brave but others will be frustrated by, especially after the bladder-challenging three hour running time. Of course the director couldn't come out and say clearly who it was but he makes it clear who he believes was responsible and one of the final scenes where Graysmith confronts the suspect with neither man saying more than a few words or indeed, doing anything about it is a classic example of how a few minutes of silence can speak volumes.Zodiac therefore is a film that rewards patience. It stretches on and on but every second is infused with detail and depth. For anyone with a serious interest in cinema as an art form, this one isn't to be missed but even those of you who are rolling your eyes thinking 'pretentious sod' will find much it a rewarding experience, just be sure to book an entire evening off first as this isn't the kind of film you can just put on on a whim.",8,2,3,1 January 2008
The Prestige," Brilliant!
","When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now.",9,8,13,18 March 2007
Cloverfield," J.J. Abrams does the monster mash
","There have been a lot of questions hovering over this movie ever since the first title-free teaser trailer appeared in cinemas last summer. What's it going to be called? What's the monster? Is it a reinvigorated version of the Godzilla franchise? Just what the hell is Cloverfield anyway? You have to hand it to J.J. Abrams really, he knows how to tantalise the Internet like no other, but all that aside there is still one question that was never properly addressed: will the casual film-goer get as much out of it as the obsessive cinema fan who has been following the hype since day one? The answer is a resounding yes as Cloverfield is unlike any film you're likely to have seen since the late nineties when three documentary students went in search of the Blair Witch and promptly disappeared. It's also a pulse-pounding ride through a devastated cityscape as seen through the eyes of the principal cast and while the introduction is a tad slow, once things kick off, they don't let up until the finale.Shot entirely on a camcorder that is passed around a small group of characters, Cloverfield follows the same 'found footage' scenario of The Blair Witch. This is no low budget amateur film though, this is a big money depiction of a single terrifying night when New York city comes under attack from an unstoppable unknown creature and it's smaller, but equally vicious offspring. So far so very Godzilla, but by filming the entire thing with a hand held, Abrams takes the audience right down into the thick of it. This may be a big budget production with a preposterously good-looking cast, but it still feels like a small and personal film. When they run, we run with them. When they hide, we hide with them and on a level that no other film has ever achieved. Furthermore, there isn't a disaster movie-stereotype to be had, each of them is a genuine human being and their fear, confusion and desperation is only too real in this post-9/11 world.Then there's the monster itself. To put paid to any still-lingering rumours, no it isn't Cthulu or any other theory you might have, it's an entirely new creation. The initial glimpses of a hind leg as it darts behind a skyscraper can only tantalise so far but when fully revealed, it's truly terrifying. Cynics may roll their eyes at the idea of a monster-movie nowadays but this is no fifties throwback, it's a wholly modern fear that carves a swathe of indiscriminate destruction through Manhattan and resists all attempts to destroy it. Plus, when it opens it's mouth and screams, you can almost feel your blood running cold.Admittedly, not everyone is going to like this film. Given that the entire premise centres on a frantic battle to live through one apocalyptic night, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Yes, you do see the monster, but you never find out what it is and are left with nothing but theories. Neither do you ever get to see the morning after and discover what has become of the world in the wake of its rampage which is bound to frustrate a few folks. However, if you're willing to accept that not every thing will be neatly categorised then the somewhat abrupt ending might be a lot easier to tolerate. I for one thought it was an incredibly fitting way to end the movie, but walking out the cinema there was more than one voice complaining.Cloverfield then is a film that captures the mood of the times in a disturbingly accurate way. We might not have giant monsters crawling out of the sea to decimate the landscape, but if they did it's hard not to see lines of people gathering with camera-phones at the ready recording a snapshot of the destruction to post on youtube. Abrams has pulled off a remarkable feat with Cloverfield; he has not only made the monster-movie fresh, exciting and action packed again, but he's also made it relevant for the first time since the first Godzilla movie riffed on Japan's post-nuclear anxiety. Given that the last time he teased us with a mystery monster it turned out to be a little cloud of black smoke, it's all the more remarkable.",9,0,2,21 February 2008
Crash," Convoluted but compelling
","One of the most impressive films to come out of America so far this year, Paul Haggis's 'Crash' is a great drama, presenting a series of interconnecting stories in Los Angeles that explore the social repercussions of racial bigotry and stereotyping. Heading the impressive cast is Matt Dillon playing a racist cop with a nigh on terrifying authenticity. Watching him molest a black woman while her husband looks on helplessly in one of the early scenes leaves no questions in your mind that this man is an unimaginable bastard. Yet Dillon never plays it up, never pandering to the camera and instead breathing life into his character in a very natural, ordinary way. In a highly distinguished cast, his is the standout role.It is not the only one to recommend the movie however as the rest of the actors put in terrific performances. Sandra Bullock for instance takes a step away from her 'Miss Congeniality' image as a deeply angry woman making venomous racist attacks to mask her own depression. Watching her tear into Spanish family man Michael Pena while he is fixing her lock, it is difficult to imagine her as the sweet, girl-next-door type she built her early career on. Then there is Don Cheadle, a man who brings great dignity to his role as an Internal affairs detective investigating a shooting between two police officers that may have been racially motivated who comes to realise that his own ethnic background will have political repercussions on the case.What may put some off this movie though is it's subject matter. Racism has forever been a serious issue in today's melting pot culture and one of the main points put across is that for all our protests, we are each of us, racist in some form or another. Like it or not, racial stereotyping still exists among all of us and the director pulls no punches in driving this point home.Even so, for all those put off by the above statement, bear in mind that this is still an utterly terrific film. There may be many story lines crossing over with one another, but it is not difficult to follow and each of them remains compelling viewing. In fact, given the breadth of stories covered, it's surprising it isn't longer than it is, Dillon's hatred and racism and eventual redemption for example could have been a movie in its own right. Highly recommended.",9,1,5,31 August 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A dark comic masterpiece
","Beginning with the most famous auto erotica shots in film history and ending with a nuclear Armageddon serenaded by Vera Lynn, Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb) is a movie that hasn't aged a day. Even now, forty plus years after its debut, it retains a satirical bite that still horrifies and amuses in equal doses. As a parody of the arrogance and insanity at work during the arms race, it rewards repeat viewings and should rightly be considered as one of the director's masterworks. Whether it is better than the likes of Paths of Glory, 2001 or A Clockwork Orange is down to personal choice, but as far as I'm concerned, Strangelove is the moment where Kubrick proved his worth without question.What makes Dr. Strangelove so enjoyable is the combination of the horrific and the hilarious. Nuclear Armageddon was the most terrifying possibility of the Cold War and yet Dr. Strangelove is a comedy. Of course, the idea of all life on earth being blasted into atoms is so terrible it is painful to think about, but Kubrick's film doesn't tackle the subject with kid gloves. Rather, it shows of the folly of human nature that would lead to such a catastrophe which provides a lot of black comedy to the proceedings. Mercifully, rather than mugging the camera, the cast play it straight all the way through and to see the straight-laced Sterling Hayden declaring his resolve to prevent Communism sapping America's precious bodily fluids is just the tip of the iceberg.Everyone in a position of power is mercilessly ripped into. The President (Peter Sellers) is a fussy individual, almost completely unaware of what his own staff are up to and prone to chatting idly with the Russian Premiere as atomic weapons hurtle towards his country. The Generals in the shape of Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) and Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) are paranoid, gung ho conspiracy nuts. The bomber pilot Captain Kong (Slim Pickens) is a decent enough good ole boy but so determined to follow orders that he will embrace genocide and the chief of defence, the titular Doctor (Sellers again) is a former Nazi who has changed his name but not his ideologies. All of them are foolish men, full of pride and ambition but whose shortcomings are all too apparent, an ensemble cast this strong has rarely been matched.Admittedly, Kubrick's anti US military bias is a little overbearing (notice the only man in uniform with any sense is a British RAF Officer) but it doesn't matter in the long run. One sided it may be, but Dr. Strangelove isn't a documentary by any means, it's a satire rooted in reality but sufficiently distanced from it enough to raise smirks when millions of people are consumed in a fiery inferno.If you take anything away from Dr. Strangelove, it's most likely going to be either Peter Sellers embracing three roles at once or a man riding a falling H-bomb to his doom, cheering all the way, but it's well worth watching multiple times as each viewing opens up new layers. The incredibly quotable script is one such joy ('Gentlemen, you can't fight here, this is the war room!') as are such instances as machine gun battles in front of peace signs or the barely contained delight on the staff faces as the 'ten females for every male' plan unfolds.In short then, a parable of fear that somehow became one of the most powerful comedies of all time. It taps into the political anxieties of the Cold War with aplomb and can teach even a casual viewer a thing or two about the period. Highly recommended and if you've already seen it, just watch it again.",9,9,17,17 April 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," The stuff of beautiful nightmares
","Having received a twenty minute standing ovation when it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, Pan's Labyrinth was always going to be one of two things - a masterpiece, or a film that thinks it is a masterpiece and unsurprisingly, message boards up and down the net are already afire with discussions as to whether it deserves all the praise. Which camp you fall in to is all down to personal opinion of course, but nevertheless Guillermo Del Toro should be applauded for bringing an uncompromising personal vision into such a wide public sphere. Pan's Labyrinth you see, is not an easy film to watch. Describing it as a fairy tale may have convinced some people that it will be an adult spin on a children's medium, something the entire family can sit down and enjoy, but this couldn't be further from the truth.Set in rural Spain in the aftermath of the civil war, it shows fascism at its most oppressive. The credits have barely finished rolling before a captured peasant is bludgeoned to near death with a glass bottle, his father screaming in anguish beside him and then both being remorselessly shot. Later, a torture victim is shown dripping in blood, covered in bruises and with his hand slashed right down the middle, begging a sympathetic doctor to kill him. Elsewhere, fascist police officers stroll through the corpses of gun battle victims placing a bullet in the head of each one to ensure that they are dead. And this is without even considering the nightmarish fantasy elements of the plot either. One thing Pan's Labyrinth most definitely isn't, is a children's movie. This is the stuff of adult nightmares.However, there is a certain beauty about it. As the tag-line reads, 'innocence has a power evil cannot imagine' and in-between all the civil strife, beatings and lip slashing wanders Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), the pre-pubescent step daughter of the tyrannical Captain Vidal. With her heavily pregnant mother sick and her step father dismissive of her, the girl finds herself alone in an unfamiliar place. Surrounded by darkness and fear, she stumbles wide eyed into a hidden world, where a faun (the make up clad Doug Jones) informs her she is in fact a princess and the time has to come to return to her true father's side...The result, is a head on collision between Ofelia's childlike wonder and the stark reality of Franco-era Spain. It is never fully stated whether Pan's secret realm genuinely exists, or simply the creation of the girl's overactive imagination (she is obsessed with fairy tales after all), but the fantasy element lends a serene beauty to the proceedings, despite being as vicious in places as the countryside she longs to escape. The faun himself is equally friendly as he is haunting for instance, but this is nothing compared to the nightmarish Pale Man (Doug Jones again). In the creation of the child-eating albino monster whose eyes fit in the palm of his hands, Del Toro has more or less completely debunked the myth of the fantasy genre as harmless entertainment for the kids and fashioned a beast that will cause sleepless nights all round.Regardless of this though, the critics of Pan's Labyrinth still have much to chew on. Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) for instance is sometimes so evil that he gets dangerously close to being a jack booted parody and there is little of the fantasy here that isn't in debt to Grimm's Fairy Tales or Lewis Carroll, but to focus on these things would be to overlook just how perfectly executed the entire movie is. You may be horrified by the Labyrinth, but at the same time you won't be able to look away. True, it is slightly disappointing that the fantasy world does not take up as much of the running time as you might hope, but this is a minor complaint when the film is this impressive. It is both beautiful and dangerous, violent and tender, uplifting and sad and a highly accomplished project for a director who could easily have sat back and made millions with another Blade movie. Just be prepared to be sleeping with the lights on for a while.",9,3,6,6 March 2007
Knocked Up," Judd Apatow's crowning glory
","Cinema in the summer of 2007 belonged to Judd Apatow. While audiences everywhere were becoming excited and disappointed in equal measure to the high-profile likes of Spider Man 3 and The Simpsons Movie, Apatow was bringing truly rewarding films to the table in the shape of Knocked Up and Superbad. Of the two, it seems that Knocked Up had the highest expectations surrounding it as early reports of a never-ending laugh-riot began to circulate amidst some ugly controversy regarding the abortion debate. Now the dust has settled, it's still clear that this funny little pregnancy adventure is an excellent film. Crude, foul mouthed and brimming over with pop culture references, it doesn't provide as many big belly laughs as you'd hope but instead provides a warm and intelligent debate on heterosexual relationships that find themselves having to deal with an unexpected third party.In some respects, Apatow is becoming Kevin Smith's successor - he writes movies that are true to his own experiences which a lot of people will be able to relate to, not to mention returning to the same cast and crew several times over. Stepping up to the plate here is Seth Rogen, best known for scene stealing supporting turns in You, Me and Dupree and Apatow's own 40 Year Old Virgin. He plays 23 year old man child Ben Stone, an unemployed, pot smoking layabout who manages through a combination of alcohol, charm and sheer luck to cop off with TV career girl Alison Scott (Katherine Hiegl) in a nightclub. His intoxicated mix of joy and 'oh thank god it's been a while' relief however results in a miscommunication regarding birth control and two months later, she contacts him again to let him know she's carrying his child.From here, the film charts the giddying highs and terrifying lows of pregnancy remarkably well and it is to Apatow's eternal credit that he manages to voice both sex's anxiety in a convincing way. Ben is distraught that his days of booze, pot and porn may be over but simultaneously determined to stand by Alison and be a good father. Alison meanwhile frets about her looks, career and the fact that she might have to end up with a hairy overweight slob for the rest of her life. This is reflected in the form of Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie 'Mrs Apatow' Mann), a slightly older married couple who provide a snapshot of how Ben and Alison may turn out. This results not only in some revealing insights about modern relationships but also some very funny and touching scenes. Ben and Pete's trip to Las Vegas for instance is terrific, the pair going on a hallucinogen fuelled wander before a freak out in a hotel room that ends in Pete's revelation of his marriage's big picture.That isn't to say Knocked Up is all sensible observations and witty dialogue though and there are still some big laughs to be had, most of them provided by Ben's stoner flatmates. A lot of the jokes are very smutty, but they support the story rather than drag it down and they are never puerile simply for the point of being puerile. Apatow isn't above shocking audiences though and some of the camera angles in the climactic birth scene are likely to elicit howls of 'I can't believe they filmed that,' especially from the women among you.It's a shame then that Knocked Up's reputation was tarnished somewhat by the media as this is neither a pro-life propaganda piece nor a riotous comedy that'll leave you crying with laughter. Just because a film is about pregnancy doesn't mean it has to have an agenda and when it's as sweet, touching and true to life as this one, it's a very pedantic complaint to make. If you want to laugh so much it hurts, go and rent Superbad (trust me, it's awesome) but if you want a romantic comedy that's so good you don't even realise it is one, this is the film to get.",8,2,3,29 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Great stuff, Ferrell hits all moves
","Thus far, if you look at his career, you can plainly see that Will Ferrell has largely appeared in two sorts of movies: those where he's given free reign, and those where he has to prop up the movie and stick rigidly to a script. Examples of the former would of course be Anchorman and Talladega Nights, both of them riotously enjoyable comedies where his improv skills go to town. Examples of the latter would be Bewitched, or The Producers, hardly films to write home about. It is a tremendous relief to say therefore that Blades of Glory, despite seemingly being knocked together very quickly after the wicked one-two punch of Talladega and the pigeon-hole evading Stranger Than Fiction, is just as funny as any other classic Ferrell film you can name and rightly deserves its place on his CV.Of course, anyone who's familiar with his best work will find few surprises in the character of Chazz Michael Michaels, a pompous, sex-addicted figure skating champion who might as well be Ron Burgundy in a leotard, but when the film is this funny it's hard to complain. Just witness the montage sequence where Chazz keeps ringing his friend Jimmy's mobile phone, leaving increasingly stupid answer phone messages through the course of the night. Or the bad-taste but deliriously funny sequence where he visits a sex therapy group (complete with Luke Wilson cameo). It might not be much of a stretch, but he sure makes one hilarious ice-devouring sex tornado.However, this isn't just a one man show and equally impressive is John Heder as rival-skater-turned-partner Jimmy MacElroy; a naive and idealistic foil to Michael's brash egotism. Heder plays Jimmy with just the right amount of innocence and awkwardness but somehow manages to avoid many similarities with a certain Idaho dwelling nerd. To his eternal credit, Heder isn't overwhelmed by Ferrell on screen either and the two's burgeoning friendship forms the basis of a lot of the laughs, as they share a natural camaraderie not unlike that which Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson handled so well in Wedding Crashers.Backing them up is a reliable supporting cast of comedy regulars. Will Arnett appears alongside his wife Amy Poehler as a brother & sister skating team who share a disturbing, incestuous relationship that is even more ridiculous than the leads. Craig T. Nelson plays it straight faced as the stern, no-nonsense coach and even Romany Malco from the 40 Year Old Virgin appears for a brief role. Best of all though is Nick Swardson as Jimmy's obsessed stalker Hector, worshipping his hero by sending him cups of blood and promising to kill him one day. Furthermore, the set pieces come thick and fast, from the outlandishly homo-erotic skating scenes to a strong contender for cinema's most ridiculous chase sequence.You could easily argue that playing the same character over and over again will eventually do more harm than good, but for those of us who still regularly quote Anchorman, Blades of Glory is a triumph. It's relentlessly stupid, packed with memorable dialogue and is another feather in the cap for Ferrell. More please.",8,1,2,17 August 2007
Suicide Squad," Harley Quinn deserves a better film
","Sloppily edited and veering wildly in tone, 'Suicide Squad' is a textbook example of what can go wrong when you try to change the mood of a film halfway through making it. The darkened streets, depressed characters, murderous senators and constant rain give it an especially grim atmosphere. With David 'Fury' Ayer directing, it's clear this was originally meant to be a brooding and cynical film, but every now and then someone will drop a one-liner, or the soundtrack will liven up with 'Ballroom Blitz.' It's almost as if they were verge of calling it finished when someone in Corporate Headquarters decided the burgeoning DC Movie Universe needed it's own 'Deadpool' and called for urgent re-shoots to make it more fun. If so, this was a dreadful mistake. The majority of 'Suicide Squad' is miserable, po-faced and moodier than a fair-weather Goth kid who just spent a weekend reading Nietzche and binging on Opeth albums. The titular squad are essentially a comic book version of The Dirty Dozen, a group of expendable assets brought together to do the Government's rotten jobs in a world where super-powered humans can demolish skyscrapers with their fists. And almost all of them are completely depressed. Deadshot (Will Smith) for example, is a lethal assassin who's killed enough people to fill a football stadium but who really just wants to see his kid again. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) is a heavily tattooed gang member who can summon fire from his fingertips but is tormented by the death of his family, while Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the utterly humourless leader. Granted, in the mission against a crazed Sorceress that takes up most of the movie, he does have a lot to lose, but does he really need to spend so much time furrowing his brow and musing on whether they're doing the right thing?The Government Agents who set up the team meanwhile are ruthlessly sadistic and motivated entirely by self-interest. They're corrupt, murderous and just as bad as the supposed villains. It's a horribly cynical view of the world, but it's not convincing. It's so completely devoid of hope and humanity that 'Suicide Squad' winds up feeling like it was written by depressed 4Chan members. The world is hell man, you snowflakes just don't get it. But strangely, this shadowy and oppressive misery-marathon has the most upbeat and jovial soundtrack this side of 'Guardians Of The Galaxy.' Unlike Peter Quill's mix-tape however, the music here just does not work. None of the songs match what is happening on screen, they're just shoe-horned in haphazardly. Everybody likes 'Bohemian Rhapsody' right? Stick it over some of the prison scenes, 'no escape from reality' totally fits.However, 'Suicide Squad' isn't entirely without merits and there are a couple of decent moments to be found. Some of the acting is pretty good too, Will Smith manages to be effortlessly watchable even when he's in a bad mood, while Jai Courtney actually manages to make his antipodean answer to Snake Plissken likable. Shame he's called 'Captain Boomerang' and has been saddled with a truly rubbish gimmick, he makes a good antihero when not playing square- jawed heroes.If the film absolutely gets one thing right though, it's Harley Quinn. From the minute she first appears, sitting in a homemade hammock in the middle of an isolation block and flirting murderously with her guards, Margot Robie's performance is spot-on. She's equal parts psychotic and childish, as memorable as Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in 'The Dark Knight' and they couldn't have picked a better actress to play her. 'Suicide Squad' might be a long way from perfect, but it does create an instant icon and it's no surprise that 2016 saw legions of lookalikes turning up at Halloween parties.As good as Robie is though, it's impossible to deny that 'Suicide Squad' is a bad film. It's a massive missed opportunity and can't make up it's mind if it wants to be free-wheeling comic anarchy or a deep, tormented soul. Imagine watching a dismal stand-up comedian who looks suspiciously similar to a wanted murderer for two hours and you'll get the idea. It's made enough money to fund a real super-villain however so a sequel is inevitable, let's hope it's better than this turgid effort. Margot Robie really is good though.",4,0,2,28 February 2017
Taxi Driver," A tale of masculine loneliness and one of the greatest films of the seventies
","Taxi Driver is one of those films that a lot of people will be able to relate to. That might sound a bit melodramatic given that it culminates in the main character losing all control, trying to assassinate a senator and then shooting up a whore house, but it's true. Okay, maybe not completely true as its hardly likely that everyone who has ever felt a tad isolated is going to turn into a gun totting lunatic, but nevertheless, Taxi Driver will be a familiar story for any man who has ever felt serious disillusionment about life and a growing sense that something is terribly wrong, but are unable or unwilling to do anything about it. God's lonely men are everywhere, this film is their voice.Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle is a revelation. The Greatest Method Actor Of All Time handles his subject with aplomb, turning Travis into a very believable and troubled man. He is a sad, lonely individual who is also kind of creepy, but nonetheless he is a recognisable and even quite sympathetic one, De Niro all nervous smiles and delirious ranting. When he sits in a café with his fellow taxi drivers for instance, focusing on a set of painkillers fizzing away in a glass of water, the conversation drifting past him and staring into the water's healing potential, his position becomes all too clear - this is a man with nowhere to go, nobody to turn to and who blames the ills of society on his own self loathing.Furthermore, there is a very keen sense of urban paranoia running through. Surrounded by the seedy underbelly of New York city, Travis is faced with violence and sexual depravity every single day. And this turns into guilt on his part too - when a young prostitute barrels into his cab, pleading for help only to be snatched away by her pimp who leaves a crumpled bank note on the seat as thanks, its easy to see Travis's shame catching up with him. Soon, he is ranting about 'cleaning up the mess' and ultimately becomes a vigilante, his disturbed mind resorting to simple, base aggression as he lashes out at the evil around him, trying to atone for his own sins.Needless to say, it is undeniably De Niro's film. Only two scenes focus on people other than Travis but even so, the support actors do a terrific job breathing life into their characters. The then thirteen year old Jodie Foster in particular displays incredible skill and maturity for her age, her depiction of Iris a jumbled mixture of cynical world weariness and teenage naivety. Harvey Keitel meanwhile has never been more sleazy than as 'Sport,' her pimp, a strutting, cocksure and thoroughly detestable scumball. You can't wait for Travis to take his new .34 Magnum to him, but this of course is where things get nasty.Taxi Driver you see is not afraid to show just how ugly violence is. Here, gun battles are gritty, dark and altogether real. Bullets tear holes in stomachs, blow hands apart and rip a man's face into a bloodied ruin, Scorsese may have been criticised for championing violence but such a criticism never really paid enough attention. When the blood flows as freely and bodies reduced to wreckage this easily, you find yourself revolted at the effects of Travis's rampage, despite yearning for it earlier in the movie.In short then, a dark classic and one of the best American movies of all time. Too much has been written on it for me to add anything extra but in terms of addressing masculine loneliness that like as not, strikes all of us at some point, nothing else comes close.",9,1,2,20 February 2007
Predator," This film will make you a god damn sexual Tyrannosaur
","There's a trailer doing the rounds on youtube at the moment for Alien versus Predator 2: Requiem that looks set to readdress everything that went wrong with the Paul W. Anderson directed first installment. Relentlessly gory and violent, it features exploding heads, children under attack from face huggers, a man's nose being burnt off by acid and absolutely masses of blood, guts and bad language. Aside from bringing worry to every puritan mother who lets their kids browse the web unattended, it also shows that with this new movie, a different approach has been taken. For one thing, the producers aren't throwing ideas across the board room table about how to update it for a new audience by making it suitable for children. It also seems as though the director has bothered to watch the originals before he set about making it. In short, it's just the sort of promotional material that gets anticipation building and is precisely why now is the right time to go back and watch Predator, the muscle bound and ridiculously violent rumble in the jungle that became one of the most loved action films of the 1980s.Considering that the film sees an elite commando team being hunted down and killed off one at a time by a ferocious alien monster, Predator's lineage is quite blatantly obvious. It's almost a missing link between the two Alien movies; blending the stalk and slash monster mash of the first with the Vietnam era machismo of the second. However, it also has enough individuality to stand on its own two legs, thanks to the appearance of two iconic individuals.First and foremost of these is Arnie. Good old reliable Arnie, doing what he does best; playing a really big guy with lots of guns who specialises in killing people. Dutch Schaeffer isn't a big step up from any of his other characters from the era: he has no convoluted back-story, no dark secrets in his past, but he is a professional and the absolute best of the best. How do we know this? Because Carl Weathers says so. And then he shoots a bunch of people. He's ably matched against the other icon: the Predator itself. Taking on a more humanoid form than the xenomorphs of Alien, the Hunter is a formidable presence. It stands at seven feet tall, dresses like a cross between a bodybuilding Samurai and a bondage model and its favourite hobbies include ripping the skin from its victims bodies and collecting skulls as trophies. Hell, it's so bad ass that it seems like the only opponent Arnie has ever faced that could conceivably kick the living daylights out of him. Not even the Devil managed that.They're backed up by a colourful cast of supporting characters, among them Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham and Jesse 'The Body' Ventura. Each is unrestrained machismo taken up to boiling point, especially Ventura, who spends most of the film striding around with a ludicrously big gun in his hands, chewing tobacco and reeling off swear words. Best of the bunch though is the character actor Bill Duke as Mac; the imposing man mountain driven mad by the heat and the violence.But there's a third hand at work in the proceedings who isn't so immediately visible: director John McTiernan, his generation's answer to Michael Bay. Considering this was only his second directing credit, he handles the project with remarkable skill. The explosive battle with the guerrillas is a barnstormer of the highest calibre, McTiernan filling the screen with massive explosions and a ludicrous body count. With that out of the way, he changes gears and the whole film shifts naturally into a chase through Central America. He may have a reputation for being most at home with chaotic gun battles, but the second half of the film is remarkably tense. As the commandos are pursued by a foe they cannot see, their bid for survival is packed with suspense.No surprise then that this film is so loved. It's ridiculously silly in every aspect. The men are so macho they're barely a step away from appearing in a gay bar's cabaret act. The violence is so outlandish that shooting people isn't enough, half the time they have to be on fire as well. And the guns are so big that in real life, some can only be used if mounted on the side of helicopters. It may be the Friday night beer and violence flick of choice, but it packs more iconic characters, quotable dialogue and downright cool sequences into it's 107 minute running time than Van Damme managed in his entire career. It's even got a few nods to the ambiguities of the Vietcong apparent in the unseen, alien enemy for cultural studies students to get their teeth into. The second round with the Aliens is due at the end of the year, but my money's on this guy.",9,4,6,2 September 2007
American Pie," Believe it or not, an intelligent look at teenage life
","'Everyone remembers their first piece of pie' says the tag-line to this movie and bar a few folks who have suffered severe amnesia, or were so drunk the only reason they knew they'd done the deed was through contracting thrush, it's a fair point to make. Everybody does remember losing their virginity and while a movie that focuses on four teenage lads dunder-headed attempts to do just that before graduation rolls around might seem crass, this isn't so much a movie about semen jokes as it is about being a teenager, a sentiment I'm sure we can all relate to in some way.The storyline is simple, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are sick to the back teeth of being sexually frustrated and make a pact to help each other like, make it with a girl dude by the time the end of school arrives - a standard racing the clock scenario that everyone who found themselves four months from University and still a virgin can surely relate to. Along the way they make a number of misguided attempts to achieve this which usually result in the luckless Jim suffering severe humiliation.Thus far, so very cretinous, but this is no Van Wilder: Party Liason by any stretch of the imagination. These four guys are not cardboard caricatures whose basic purpose is to serve up fodder for a string of smutty jokes, they are genuinely endearing. Jim especially is a lovable, bumbling clown that recalls the nervous, jittery idiot that all of us once were when first confronted by bare female flesh. Oz is a bit of a weak link as his story is somewhat clunky, but the rest of the lads are just as appealing and Kevin's rather sweet relationship with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid before she set about destroying her reputation) is handled beautifully.Backing all this up is an equally strong cast of supporting characters. The girls that form the object of the boys lust are treated with similar dignity, rather than just being another line of bimbos on their way to exposing their breasts in a shower a la Porky's. Alyson Hannigan as the 'not as geeky as she first appears' Michelle is hilarious, Sean William-Scott is a loud mouthed but ultimately rather charismatic oaf that everyone remembers, but Eugene Levy is the one who shines brightest. As Jim's good natured dad, he shows that parents trying to give their kids a nudge in the right direction can be just as witless as their offspring and he steals every scene he's in and pretty much the whole movie along with them.Sure, this may make it sound like American Pie is too clever-clever for its own good, but don't worry, there are plenty of bodily fluid jokes to keep the laughs coming, including one brilliant moment where a series of mishaps leads to Jim dancing naked on the Internet that had me clutching my sides in pain from laughing too much. This is still a gross out comedy, but it is a gross out comedy that has genuine humanity behind it and if you're in the right frame of mind, is the sort of film that evokes a real sentimentality for the time when raging hormones and adolescent naivety were an everyday part of life.",8,2,4,5 November 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," So derivative it hurts
","There comes a point when the latest trend sweeping Hollywood falls into a specific pattern. Innovation becomes a stereotype and movie after movie seems to simply retread ground already worked by it's predecessors. Genres become stale and boring and right now, it's happening to the old-school Horror film. When movies like Wrong Turn originally came out, their depictions of sadistic brutality and unrelenting violence were a breath of fresh air compared to the waves of little Japanese girls getting Naomi Watts all worked up, but with The Hills Have Eyes the ideal has become overworked, stale and predictable.Set in the deserts of New Mexico, this remake of the 1977 Wes Craven movie features an American family on a road trip to California who find themselves falling afoul of a group of mutant rednecks warped by the radiation from atom bomb tests in the area for generations. And as we all know, not only are rednecks bad, but nuclear radiation also causes super strength, high pain tolerance and an insatiable desire for human flesh.From here on in, the movie seems to be on a single-track mission to outdo all the violence the genre has thrown up recently and in this, it certainly succeeds. The initial assault on the family trailer is horribly graphic but unlike the previously mentioned Wrong Turn, here it seems to go a bit far, as if the director is having too much fun lingering the camera on the sight of a woman being raped while her mother gets a hole blown in her chest only inches away. Sure, there is some fun to be had when one of the protagonists goes nuts and fights back in suitably vicious ways in the second half, but witnessing the earlier scenes is neither scary or entertaining, it's just unpleasant.This isn't the only problem either. In typical Hollywood fashion, the intended scares are mostly created by quick jump shots to disturbing images or by trying to make you jolt out of your seat by having something surprise one of the characters and playing a loud blast on the speakers at the same time. There's even the pre-requisite redneck gas station attendant who could have warned them of the danger and obligatory 'finding the cars of all the previous victims' scene that's appeared in nigh on every single horror film since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Wonder if there'll be a hint towards a sequel at the ending...well dur...To put it simply, this is not a great film. The second half is entertaining enough but unfortunately for Wes and co, it's a case of seen it before too many times. If Hostel and Slither are really going to jump-start the horror genre into unexpected realms of extremity later this year, they're going to have to pull a few pretty impressive surprises out the bag.",4,1,3,15 March 2006
Ender's Game," Gorgeous to look at, but ultimately disappointing
","There's no escaping it, Ender's Game is a fantastically pretty movie. From the opening shots of fighter jets engaging in dogfights with swarms of alien craft, to the ethereal sequences of teenagers in spacesuits drifting through zero gravity gaming arenas, this is one movie that's a veritable feast for the eyes. It's also deeply engaging on a moral and ethical level, raising a great many questions about the ethics of the military, the morality of leadership and whether war can ever be a tool to prevent war. It's a treat for the brain and one that will leave you grappling with philosophical ideas of what civilisation loses when it does what it can to survive.The trouble though, is it doesn't make for an exciting movie. Why? Well because despite all those eye-popping, bombastic space battles that cropped up in the trailer, there's very little war or danger to be found. And despite being just shy of two hours, it also ends in a rather abrupt and unsatisfying way, leaving Enders Game as a very frustrating cinema experience. Set in the distant future, it sees humanity as a mighty galactic power with bases on far flung planets and capable of dispatching vast war fleets in the blink of an eye. But it's a power that's consumed by paranoia. See, there's another race in the galaxy known as Formics who once came dangerously close to exterminating us. Convinced that another attack is imminent, the Earth military led by Colonel Graff (a perpetually scowling Harrison Ford) sets about recruiting large numbers of teenagers to direct their war craft. Because, teenagers are good at Command And Conquer right? There's no holes in that plan, shut up.Best of the bunch is Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield - excellent), a child prodigy being groomed as Julius Caesar for the lightspeed era. When we first meet him, he's beating a bully at a video game, then minutes later beating the living daylights out of him in a biology classroom. Soon, he's being shipped into orbit to complete some intense training and get shouted at by Xaro Xhoan Daxos. And this is where the film ends. Well, not really. It goes on for a good hour and forty minutes longer, but the training never finishes. No matter how many futuristic-paintball games and war simulators he gets into, the war itself never really kicks off. Sure, all the scenes of spaceships bursting into flame, drones zipping through asteroids and lasers bursting through ice look incredible, but they're just war-simulations. And videogames are only exciting when you play them yourself, there's more tension and danger in Ender's shower room brawl with a rival student than in any of the intergalactic battle scenes. ***BIG SPOILER WARNING***Consequently, you spend the entire film waiting for a war that never properly starts. Except surprise! He was fighting it for real all along! From the comfort of a war room. Then comes one incredibly contrived ending with a conveniently-easy-to-find alien and before Ender can even draw breath after finishing the closing monologue, the credits are rolling. Uh...great. All of which makes for an infuriating end to what was a deeply promising film. Given the complexity of the issues it raises, it's even more annoying. This had the possibility of being Starship Troopers for kids but with an intellectual depth beyond that of the average Hollywood movie. Instead it turns out like a two hour version of the Kobayashi Maru sequence from the first Star Trek movie where somebody points out that they've blown up a real Klingon Bird of Prey at the end.",6,5,13,27 October 2013
Jarhead," Sam Mendes goes to war
","The indelible stamp of the classic Vietnam war movies are all over Jarhead, the new movie from Sam Mendes, writer of American Beauty and Road to Perdition. From the opening boot camp sequence that couldn't be more in debt to R Lee Ermey's turn as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, to the boys in the platoon psyching themselves up for the first Gulf war by watching the helicopter attack sequence in Apocalypse Now and joyfully singing along to 'Ride of the Valkyries.' However, the similarities end there, for rather than being a Vietnam movie set in a desert, Jarhead is an altogether different beast.It tells the true life story of Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford, (a fantastic Jake Gyllenhall), a twenty year old marine sniper who gets shipped out to fight the Iraqi army and the experiences he has there. Rather than being met by all-out carnage and bloodshed though, Swofford finds himself faced with many long, boring months sat out in the desert with nothing but his platoon mates for company. Once there, he finds himself falling into a routine of sleep, eat, exercise, masturbate and sleep again, all the while waiting for a war that when it finally does come, is over in a heartbeat ('four days, four hours and twenty minutes, that was my war'). It is no surprise then that tempers become frayed and frustrations come to the surface in many ugly ways (Swofford finds himself ranting at a fellow soldier at one point while sticking an M16 into the terrified man's face) and the end result is deeply uncomfortable. These are men bred for war, who didn't get to have one.In this respect it's certainly an intriguing watch and to add to the experience, the cinematography is stunning. The desert shimmers with such radiance you can almost feel the heat rising from the screen and the sight of a blazing, oil drenched field is a veritable feast for the eyes.If a criticism can be levelled at Jarhead though, it would be that it doesn't have a strong political message. Sure, the American military machine is glorified in the first half then ruthlessly savaged in the second as men who are bred to kill break down in tears or go mad, but given the current political climate, many will certainly feel let down that there aren't more stabs at the nature of the modern day Iraq situation. Peter Saarsgard may provide a angry tirade about how they're fighting for oil, not people, but it's a brief shot in a film that otherwise asks the viewer to draw their own conclusions.",7,0,1,19 January 2006
Independence Day," Look at the size of that thing
","Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90's audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences, it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks, it's an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.",7,215,279,2 September 2007
Alien vs. Predator," A bitter disappointment
","It's been two and a half years since the release of Alien Versus Predator and you can still see the collective fanboy disgust at this film reverberating round the Internet. On the one hand, you've got to thank Paul W. Anderson really for giving fans of the Alien franchise something to talk about besides David Fincher killing Hicks, but on the other it is undeniable that even with the benefit of hindsight, the critics who derided the movie when it was first released were right in their estimations. This is definitely a weak movie and considering the awe-inspiring smackdown it should have been, it's understandable that the geek contingent, myself included, were bitterly disappointed.The chief problem of course is the lingering sense that it was knocked out for a quick buck or two and nothing more, with the target audience made up of hip youngsters who listen to nu metal and have a TV in their room permanently switched to MTV. You know, those idiots who walk around with their jeans slung low so that we can read the labels on their groovy Calvin Klein boxer shorts? Well, in keeping with the music video aesthetic, things move quickly. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me at all if Anderson's directing approach had consisted of him stood off camera, waving his arms at the cast while shouting 'come on come on, faster faster, more flare, more zing, more kapowzer! The Ritalin's wearing off!' We've barely met any of the characters before they're being jetted off to the Antarctic to meet a series of unpleasant endings. The action starts roughly half an hour into the movie and fifteen minutes later, nearly all the principle cast have been killed. Where was the gradual build up of tension? Where was the careful handling of atmospheric unease? Where was the mounting sense of dread? Oh, that was what that penguin scene was all about...right.Adding to this is the fact that you really don't give a damn about any of the people involved, they're merely there to provide explanations and die screaming. As such, none of them really develop any further than the sketch pad and it's amazing they even bothered to take the time to think up names. They could just as easily have been cast as lovable Scottish idiot, spunky tough black girl, dashing Italian know it all, dying old fella, bastard British bloke and expendable extras. An entire generation of movie goers jumped with astonishment when Kane's chest burst open, shed tears when Vasquez blew herself up and punched their fists into the air with reckless enthusiasm when Arnie's final trap worked. All you're likely to do this time around is stare blankly and count the seconds until the next one.Woeful though the plot, characterisation and cheesy dialogue may be (the 'hunter's moon' conversation is the stupidest thing ever. Ever ever ever), Alien Versus Predator does have one thing in its favour...Man, when the two species actually get round to killing each other, it's so cool. Years since imaginations were set reeling by the trophy scene in Predator 2, there is a terrific burst of adrenalin when the two finally collide. The bruising one on one duel at the centre of the film in particular is totally bad ass, with stone masonry and ancient bricks being shattered into dust as the two monsters collide, acid blood spurting, wrist blades glistening and mandibles flailing as they try to wrench each other out of existence. Its popcorn munching mayhem of the highest order and just about the only thing that the movie does well, but still enough to lift it into the realm of passable entertainment.It cannot disguise the fact that AvP isn't the almighty ruckus that teenagers and twenty-somethings have dreamt of all this time. Truth be told, it's not a bad film and if it hadn't contained the two famous beasts, but replaced them with new creations and gone under a different title, it'd probably be regarded as fun little B-movie. Given that the sequel is imminent, you can only hope it improves in the second round but otherwise, fans of both series would be better off seeking out the original Dark Horse graphic novel that was at least as good as the earlier movies.",5,1,2,20 April 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The weakest of the three but still a decent ride
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park has come in for a fair bit of flak over the years from critics, most of whom see it as little more than a shallow re-tread of the original but with more plot holes and less of the charisma. This is true to an extent, but that isn't to say it's a bad film. Approached in the right frame of mind it can make for a great night in, especially if you have a massive television accompanied by surround sound speakers to help you get lost in the thundering carnage, you just have to make sure you switch off those departments in your brain labelled 'cohesion' and 'reason' beforehand.Set several years after the original, it sees park creator John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) coercing the now ruined Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to take another trip to an island filled with monstrous prehistoric reptiles that all want to eat him. This isn't the same island as the first though, this is 'Site B,' sort of a nature reserve to the original's theme park where the dinosaurs roam free with no fences to hold them in and are allowed to thrive in their own right. Malcolm and a small team comprised of zoologists, photographers and Vince Vaughn soon find things going awry when a large group of evil capitalists with no respect for the natural order of the island arrive tooled up to the shoulders with all kinds of expensive weaponry with the intention of capturing enough dinosaurs to start a new park. And faster than you can say 'this takes a few liberties with Velociraptor design' all involved find themselves turning into a delightful buffet for the local dinos.If Jurassic Park was an adventure story and Jurassic Park 3 was a rather fun B-movie, The Lost World is the action hero of the series. Hardly any time is wasted before we see the dinosaurs and shortly after, all sorts of chaos is being unleashed. The highlight of this is an attack by two T Rexes on a trailer which is easily the equal to the first film's Rex assault, it's just a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite match up.Sure, the dinosaur's pursuit of the human teams through the jungle is all very exciting, but there's little of the careful increase in tension that the first film did so well bar the aforementioned trailer scene. It's simply a case of 'show dinosaur, people die' repeated several times over and on closer inspection, is nearly a complete re-tread of 'Aliens,' with the raptors standing in for the aliens and the Rex standing in for the Queen. The ending is even very similar, with the Rex being brought back to an urban metropolis for a final showdown, just as the alien queen was brought back to the Solaco.That said, it's still an enjoyable romp. The plot holes are too numerous to count but nonetheless, it's still easy to get caught up in the quick pace. It also has a top notch cast to back it up; Jeff Goldblum is just as watchable as he ever was, Vince Vaughn dispels with the funny guy routine and instead goes on a testosterone overload as a macho environmentalist and Pete Postlethwaite even puts in an appearance as a great white hunter (his line upon first encountering Vaughn incidentally is worth the price of entry alone). It may tread an uneasy line between the ridiculous and the entertaining, but it isn't half as bad as it's sometimes made out to be.",5,1,4,23 November 2006
Cars," A visual feast with a storyline to boot
","The concept of talking cartoon cars having an adventure doesn't sound like a thrilling premise for a movie does it? Sounds a bit Thomas the Tank Engine without a railway line right? Well you can cast all doubts aside because Pixar have triumphed yet again, proving once and for all why they are the undisputed leaders when it comes to computer generated family entertainment. And by family entertainment I don't just mean to label it as the sort of film little kids enjoy, parents endure and everyone between the ages of twelve and twenty two avoids, because this is a richly rewarding two hours that anyone, regardless of age can enjoy.As always with Pixar movies, much of the appeal comes from the visuals and here, they excel. From the jam packed stadiums at the opening to the gorgeous depiction of the American desert, we are given a lush world that is pure visual candy and it doesn't end with the wide angle landscapes either, for the character design is top notch too. Cars by their very nature may be metallic and featureless, but these are not cars, these are characters and there is a world of emotion etched on their faces which puts most real life actors to shame.However, the reason why Cars triumphs isn't because of the visuals, it's because of the storyline. Sure, the tale of a big headed race car getting stuck in a small town and learning to slow down once in a while is somewhat clichéd, but is imbued with so much depth and characterisation it doesn't matter. You come to care about all these offbeat automobiles and they'll make you laugh and cry in equal amount. Of particular note here is Larry the Cable Guy's work as Mater, the dim witted redneck tow-truck. It is testament to the script writers abilities that Mater is such a lovable fellow and he effectively steals the entire film when he could very easily have been the most irritating character to appear since George Lucas rolled out a certain Rastafarian Amphibian.Of course, you could put the reasons for it being so enjoyable down to the fact that expectations were not as high for this one as they were for the likes of Toy Story 2 or Monsters Inc, but that would do a disservice to the beautifully crafted film on offer. It's not perfect and is let down by a rather contrived romance subplot which relies on the usual tactics of the two leads chatting and laughing nervously together at the same time, but that minor gripe aside, it's second only to The Incredibles. Pixar's track record is still intact and while some of you may be a little put off by the somewhat childish subject matter consider this; at least they're not talking animals.",8,0,0,24 November 2006
Insidious," Did Charlie Kelly write this?
","There's an episode of 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia' called 'The Nightman Cometh' where one of the characters makes a misguided attempt at seducing a woman by writing a musical. The show revolves around a young boy who gets his soul stolen and dragged off to another dimension by the titular Nightman, a Demon with slick black hair and cats eyes who hides in the shadows. It's not very well written, poorly acted and inevitably, winds up being a total disaster.Why is this relevant you may ask? Well because the plot to 'Insidious' is remarkably similar. Sure, it's not a musical and the acting is generally rather good, but the story of a young boy dropping into an inexplicable coma during the night because of a Demon with slick black hair and cats eyes dragging him off to another dimension is uncomfortably close to Charlie Kelly's ham- fisted calamity. That being said, if you're not familiar with said comedy you might still find 'Insidious' intriguing, but only if you've not seen any horror films before. It does a pretty good job of setting up the tension in the early going, but soon loses it's way once you realise that it doesn't have many original ideas. It might not be about a haunted house, but aside from the fact there's one point where the protagonists move, it sure plays out like one. Considering the Demons spend most of the film doing little more than the occasional cackling or running past an open door, it's also hard to feel scared by them.In fairness though, 'Insidious' isn't awful. The early scenes work quite well, the interplay between Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson does make them seem like a convincing married couple and the two bickering paranormal researchers are actually quite entertaining. However, it just feels like it was put together by a committee who wanted bits of 'The Amityville Horror' and 'Poltergeist' stitched together. By the time the finale comes round you'll be humming a song about the Dayman, fighter of the Nightman, guardian of the sun, master of Karate and friendship for everyone.",4,0,1,28 June 2015
The Mist," Oh my god! They killed the Shermanator!
","Before getting into the meat of this review, I'd like to say this: if you're a horror fan and want to experience The Mist to its full potential, stop reading and go see it now. This is an excellent film, the kind of tense, masterful horror you rarely get nowadays but the more you know about it, the less of an impact it will have. I went into this movie blind expecting the latest PG-13 horror sensation but by the time the end credits rolled all the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. Its a creepy, atmospheric little shocker that'll hopefully become one of the sleeper hits of the year but honestly, the less you know, the better it will be.Still here? Well, don't say I didn't warn you.Playing on the idea that to create hell you simply need to put a small group of people in a confined space with no hope of escape, The Mist is a deliciously twisted horror gem that writhes with a nastiness not seen since John Carpenter's heyday. From its deceptively low-key start which sees Thomas Jane taking his son to a convenience store, things soon start to escalate and before long, an ordinary day has turned into a nightmarish experience that doesn't let up for one tense, claustrophobic minute. What makes it truly unsettling is the fact that despite the...things that are walking around outside hidden by the mist, the real menace can be found inside the grocery store. This is a story of humanity under pressure and how ranting insanity can seem perfectly rational when you're cut off from all hope of survival. All it takes for humanity to destroy itself is for no one to answer when you dial 911.Central to this cloying atmosphere of nerves and fear is the cinematography. The film is largely shot in close up and as a consequence, it feels a lot like you're listening in on all the huddled, whispered conversations the characters have. In addition, it means that you don't always get a good look at the wealth of monsters prowling outside, giving them a mysterious and otherworldly air that wouldn't have been possible if the film was better lit.Furthermore, the actors at work here perfectly capture their roles. These are not cut and paste Hollywood stars that are likely to appear in gossip magazines gushing about their new diets, they look, act and feel like ordinary small town folk put in an impossible situation. Even Thomas Jane feels like a mundane, beer-drinking Joe. His performance is one of the film's best, a subtle and carefully nuanced portrayal of a father trying to keep his promises to his son while society collapses all around him, but he does have the unfortunate position of having every scene stolen from under him by Marcia Gay Harden's psychotic Christian bitch-Queen. She is not one of those positive Christians who don't mind if you decide to sleep in every Sunday, she's a deranged lunatic who believes that God is a blood thirsty, vengeful monster. When she takes it upon herself to 'save' the inhabitants of the grocery store things take a very unpleasant turn and every time she escapes death you'll be punching the air in frustration.Amid all the violence, monsters, tension and chaos however, The Mist is still a very human story. It's a testament to the screen writing talents of Frank Darabont and Steven King that Harden aside, you don't want any of these people to die and when they inevitably do (in a multitude of messy, sticky ways), it's all the more devastating. Strangely enough though, the most traumatic moment isn't a character's death but his survival, sometimes saving the world is worse than its destruction. Excellent film, if you're prepared to put up with nightmares for weeks you can't really afford to miss it.",8,1,4,17 May 2008
Stardust," Brilliant! A perfect 'relax and forget the world' movie
","Stardust is the kind of film that reminds you why you keep going down the DVD rental shop, buying Empire magazine and visiting this site: it's a gem that the majority of people will overlook, but everyone who takes the time to check it out will have an absolute blast. It might not have set the box office on fire, but cult devotion beckons, partly because of the Neil Gaiman connection, but also because it's one of those rare examples of script writing where everything fits into a cohesive whole. All the multiple plot strands are wrapped up neatly, the story takes it's time and is in no rush and despite the fantasy setting, Stardust is just as keen to laugh at itself as it is to enchant the audience.Set in ye olde England where the concept of stumbling into a fantastical world of Unicorns, witches, magic and flying boats is the start of a terrific adventure rather than a reality-blurring head trip, Stardust tells the story of Tristran Thorn (Charlie Cox), a likable but aimless country youth. Desperate to cop off with Sienna Miller's village bike, he crosses the wall that surrounds the town in order to find a piece of a star that's fallen to earth and return it to her as a demonstration of love. His efforts are waylaid however when the star doesn't turn out to be a lump of space rock, but a feisty Clare Danes who isn't exactly pleased to be a wedding present. Throw in an evil trio of witches (led by Michelle Pfeiffer) looking for the secret of youth and the dastardly Prince Septimus and Tristran's simple act of crossing a wall, picking up a rock and walking back turns into an epic adventure of romance, swashbuckling and fun.By now, with all this talk of Unicorns and such like, there's bound to be a few people out there whose eyes are rolling at the thought of yet another fantasy adventure clogging up the screens, but Stardust has an edge on the competition. Where the likes of Eragon relied on special effects and wide shots of the New Zealand countryside to enchant people and usually fell flat, Stardust concentrates on the story. The special effects are kept to a minimum and you're encouraged to pay attention to the one-liners and sparkling dialogue, rather than ogle hordes of sword wielding clichés. In this respect, Stardust's closest relative is The Princess Bride, a story that was shot through with a similar degree of knowing humour without jeopardising the central premise.Stardust in short, is a film tailor made for the Christmas television schedules. It transports you to another world and for over two hours, you can sit back, get swept up in it and forget about the mortgage, car insurance and the miserable next door neighbours that keep throwing mashed up watermelon slices onto your patio floor. With a cast that consists largely of British TV comedy regulars, it's no surprise that the sense of freewheeling fun never diminishes. It might be stereotypical, but this is no two dimensional children's movie, it's one the entire family can enjoy: toddlers, sulky teenagers, direction-less twenty somethings, parents and grandparents all.",8,5,7,18 November 2007
I Am Legend," Smithy the Vampire Slayer
","It goes without saying that if you're not a fan of Will Smith, this probably isn't the movie for you. For about ninety percent of the running time, he is the only character to be seen, the sole survivor of a virulent plague that has wiped out the entire human race and left him to spend his days wandering around New York city listening to reggae music and talking to shop window dummies. Doesn't exactly sound like the most entertaining movie in the world does it, I mean how interesting can a two hour film be when all it revolves around is one man and his dog? Actually, it's really enjoyable. In fact it's one of the best post-apocalyptic movies out there. Principally, this is down to Smith's powerful performance, the former Fresh Prince bringing a hopeless sense of loss to his character that makes him a very sympathetic leading man. That and the vampires.Like 28 Days Later before it, I Am Legend is a film where the fall of man brings with it some incredibly beautiful cinematography. The numerous shots of an empty, dilapidated New York where herds of deer race around abandoned cars and thick grass has grown through the cracks in the pavement lend an eerie, sombre nature to the film. As Smith's Robert Neville moves round this landscape, he is surrounded on all sides by towering skyscrapers that have turned into extravagant bird's nests. It's a disturbing setting and the sight of our protagonist dwarfed by the empty metropolis does wonders for the atmosphere. The special effects team deserve a hearty pat on the back for the first ten minutes alone.Pity then that the vampires look so rubbish as they had the chance to be truly threatening. The scene where they are first introduced is terrifying, Neville's search for his lost dog through a darkened building ending in a nailbiting chase back to the light. All the tension is dissipated though when you finally get a good look at his foes, badly rendered CGI clichés who look like Gollum on a protein rich diet. The lacklustre villains aren't enough to sink the movie, it's just frustrating to think that make-up and prosthetics would have yielded far more satisfying results.That aside, I Am Legend is still an incredibly entertaining experience and makes for a worthy last trip to the cinema in 2007. Smith gives one of the best performances of his career and it's worth seeing for the depiction of New York alone. Like all things in life though, it's the little things that make it, a fact made perfectly clear in the opening sequence where an overly confident female scientist appears in a television interview about the miracle cure. She's all smiles and self-satisfaction until the reporter asks if they have found a genuine cure for cancer. For a split second a flicker of doubt appears on her face before the smile returns and she confirms it. The next shot is of an abandoned Times Square that reeks of death.",8,1,6,31 December 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Very well done if slightly run of the mill
","Given that this is the fifth Spiderman movie in twelve years, it's very easy to feel cynical when the clichés start flying out of the screen before the first action set piece finishes. After all, it's not enough any more that Peter Parker is going to pull an innocent bystander out of the way of a car spinning through the air and be late to an important event which his girlfriend has put a lot of emotional investment in to. Oh no, now he's got to have a dark secret at the heart of his family and be the very centre piece of an evil conspiracy as well. Because having him played by an actor who looks uncomfortably similar to Stan Laurel isn't a big enough difference any more.However, one inevitable side effect of the sheer volume of superhero movies being made in recent years is that Hollywood has got very, very good at making them. And The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a very, very good movie. It doesn't get close to the high water mark set by The Dark Knight of course but it's definitely a step up from the first entry in the rebooted franchise and could put in a good case for being superior to any of the Sam Raimi movies as well.Sure, there are faults to be had but the film speeds along on such sheer, good natured fun that it's hard to be bothered by them. As Peter Parker, the annoyingly youthful Andrew Garfield (he's 30 years old people, 30 years old!) is a charming and effortlessly charismatic screen presence. As he zips through New York at high speed, wise cracking at bad guys and high-fiving firemen, you get the distinct impression that he really enjoys being a superhero. There's still time for him to be bothered by guilt and struggle with his responsibilities, but it doesn't weigh him or the film down and he's tremendous fun to spend time with. He's ably supported by Emma Stone as Parker's on again/off again girlfriend Gwen Stacey. The pair's real life relationship translates incredibly well on screen and there's so much chemistry between them, it's hard not to shake the feeling that both actors want to get the scene over and done with so they can go back to shaking trailers together. Dane Dehaan meanwhile makes a bid for this year's Best Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie award as Harry Osborn. Dehaan is making a career out of playing traumatised young men with incredible power, but it's a credit to both the actor and the script that he becomes genuinely likable, even when he's committing appalling acts against the people he loves.On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that Jamie Foxx could ever be a nerd, especially as the guy who bullies him at work looks like someone Foxx could break in two by breathing hard enough, but he makes a formidable villain when he inevitably becomes Electro. His Times Square smack down with Spidey is one incredible set piece and their later ruck in a power plant only ups the ante. If the appearance of Paul Giamatti's Rhino on the posters meanwhile has you worried about villain fatigue fear not, he's barely more than a cameo.So, great cast, awesome set pieces, what's the catch? Well just like the first Amazing Spider Man, this film still can't help but be a bit unnecessary. You'll have seen all of Parker's dilemmas in this before and the needless conspiracy subplot involving his folks never comes across as anything more than a way for the studio to say 'See, completely different film?' The strengths outweigh the weaknesses however and aside from a few uncomfortable points (what's with the Mengele style German Doctor?), The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a fine superhero movie. It's great fun to watch, has an immensely likable duo at it's heart and just when it's getting a bit too familiar, it pulls the rug out from under your feet with a wicked third act. If this is Hollywood at it's money grabbing worst, long may it continue.",7,1,5,28 April 2014
The Illusionist," Don't mention The Prestige!
","If I might start with an incredibly clichéd opening line, you wait years for a movie about magicians (which doesn't include a lightning-scarred moppet as the central protagonist) then two come along at once. And just as Armageddon followed Deep Impact, Neil Burger's The Illusionist followed Christopher Nolan's The Prestige to the screens back in the summer of 2006. Now that both are available on DVD, it gives all of us amateur film critics that populate this website a chance to evaluate them on their own strengths but in truth, the only real similarity between the two is the presence of stage magic as a plot device. And while I must admit to having enjoyed Nolan's movie far more, The Illusionist is without a doubt the more sophisticated of the two.While The Prestige relied on showmanship and a scantily clad Scarlett Johanson you see, The Illusionist relies on acting. To put it simply, there is not a single bad performance in the entire movie. Paul Giamatti for instance is fantastic, a dignified and mature performance who comes to be the on screen foil for all of us watching the movie; perplexed by the magic, he both desires and rejects its secrets, while at the same time wishing the damn magician would just do what he's told, yet rejoicing when he doesn't. Ed Norton meanwhile puts in another reliably magnificent turn as Eisenheim the Illusionist. Norton as should be common knowledge now is one of the finest actors of his generation and he inhabits every inch of his character. As such, Eisenheim is both a brilliant man and a lonely one, with a couple of odd quirks about him, the sort of person you'd go to watch in a theatre but wouldn't stick around to collect the autograph afterwards.They are ably backed up by Rufus Sewell as the scheming Prince Regent of Vienna and Jessica Biel as his betrothed, secretly in love with Eisenheim. Sewell is so deliciously evil he could have walked out of a Sherlock Holmes novel, while Biel shakes off any sense of being a teen pin up icon and handles herself adeptly alongside all the 'proper' actors on screen. She also seems remarkably relieved to be in a film where she can be a little more feminine than usual and not have to worry about blowing things up all the time.Excellent though the acting may be however, the underlying story sadly, isn't as effective as you might hope. The plot synopsis on this page sums it up nicely so I won't bother to reiterate the details, but it unfortunately turns into a rather straightforward revenge drama. Compared to the cat and mouse games of the Prestige, it follows a far more linear path and isn't anywhere near as tense, intriguing or exciting.On the plus side however, the magic tricks are a natural high point, though I'm sure there will be plenty of you out there frustrated by the lack of explanation for all of them. So while we might get a glimpse at the document which explains how Eisenheim is able to grow an orange tree out of a pip in the space of a few minutes, a glimpse is all it is. Even so, this refusal to reveal the secrets perhaps gives The Illusionist a lot of its strength, for it imbues Eisenheim with an otherworldly and supernatural air. Is he really performing all these tricks for real? No, he can't be...Watch it with the lights switched off and a few candles burning and it'll be a delightfully unreal evening.",7,0,1,11 July 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A forgettable but fun sugar rush movie
","Okay, before we get into the meat of this analysis, let's get one thing perfectly clear: the Fantastic Four are NOT cool. They're too wholesome. Their teeth are too shiny and white. They look utterly ridiculous in those stupid blue jumpsuits they wear. Batman is cool. Spiderman is cool. The Fantastic Four, are not. But in some respects, this actually works in their favour.No no, hear me out, the reason why Rise of the Silver Surfer does a good job is because it does exactly what it says on the tin. You go in expecting frivolous nonsense that's cornier than a weekend in Kansas and that's precisely what you get. Unlike the bloated, over-complicated and over-ambitious Spiderman 3, it manages to deliver an energetic and fast paced storyline, decent special effects, eye-popping action sequences and all in a succinct hour and thirty three minutes. There's none of the 'let's cram as many villains in as possible' approach that the web crawler had earlier this summer and while it's undeniable that this is definitely a superhero film with a kids market in mind, it still makes for an entertaining jolt of fun and a decent alternative if you get the family to the local multiplex only to find that Pirates 3 has sold out.Of course, it's not perfect by a long shot. Galactus for instance makes an eagerly anticipated screen appearance...for about thirty seconds, then vanishes. And if that wasn't bad enough fanboys, he's no longer a giant Roman Centurion wearing an over-sized purple helmet but an ominous looking cloud of dust, rock and magma that's come to eat your babies. Plus, there's a wealth of glaring plot holes that even the kids will be able to pick up on, like the American military letting a man who calls himself Doctor Doom into the middle of a top secret research facility. Perfect fodder indeed for anyone who may be getting a bit fed up with the continuing cycle of movies populated by photogenic spandex models and wants to have a good moan.This doesn't count for anything though so long as when you order apple pie, you want to receive apple pie. Rise of the Silver Surfer has flimsy characterisations, cheesy smiles and unnecessary romances aplenty, not to mention a couple of incredibly silly set pieces to get stuck into. The Human Torch's collision with Doom for instance is an absolute riot, as is the high speed mid air chase over the Great Wall of China, while the Silver Surfer unleashing his fury on the army is liable to make jaws drop. Older, cynical audiences may want to stay away but provided you haven't spent all your cash on the previous summer blockbusters, the continuing adventures of Rubber Man (Ioan Gruffudd), Orange Woman (Jessica Alba), Hulk 2 (Michael Chiklis) and Southern Fried (Chris Evans) are still an enjoyable sugar-rush for everyone that's still a kid at heart. Throwaway guff, but arguably better than Spiderman 3.And oh yeah, the Silver Surfer is totally, totally awesome.",7,6,13,17 June 2007
Transformers," Good news everyone, they haven't screwed it up
","Before you read the following review, I want you to be aware of something: I am a huge Transformers nerd. Not big enough to name myself after obscure Japanese Decepticons or anything, but still geeky enough to have amassed a sizable collection of merchandise and regularly cry myself to sleep muttering 'oh Megatron, nobody loves you but me.' Therefore it was with some trepidation that I approached the eagerly awaited live action movie, especially seeing as all the pre-release hype seemed to be focused on Megan Fox bending over a car bonnet. And that it was made by Michael Bay and the last time he made a film with 'tremendous respect for the source material,' we got the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Thus it is with some relief that I can sit here and tell you that the best thing about Transformers is that isn't a complete disaster. In fact it's really very good and one of the strongest no-brain blockbusters to turn up in a summer that's been filled with them. However, it's not without its faults.Now given my little introduction above, you're probably thinking I'm going to spend the entire word limit complaining about the character designs but I'll try not to. This is an entirely new spin after all and moaning about how Ironhide doesn't look like Ironhide anymore isn't going to achieve anything, (did Frenzy really have to be an irritating gremlin with a comedy voice though?). However, what can't be denied is that the majority of the Transformers in this film have zero characterisation and consequently, in the huge mass of violence that closes the movie, it's sometimes difficult to tell who we are meant to be cheering for. In fact only Optimus Prime gets a decent depiction and even Bumblebee, for all his screen time, is robbed of significant development by being burdened with the irritating gimmick of talking through an in-car radio, effectively ruining any chance of a meaningful, ET-style friendship to develop between him and Sam (Shia Lebeouf).On the plus side though, Lebeouf is really good. In fact, he's probably the best thing about the entire film, high praise indeed considering he's been cast as the human foil for audiences to cling onto when all they really want is two hours of robots smacking the living daylights out of each other. As Sam, he is nerdish enough to convince you that he could slip under the school hottie's radar for five years but at the same time, possesses a charm and sense of humour to ensure he doesn't go walking around with a 'gee whizz, how cool' demeanour whenever a car explodes.Furthermore, the Spielberg influence is rife and gives the film a welcome degree of comedy. Sam's attempt to hide five robots that are bigger than his house from his delightfully-odd parents is arguably, the highlight of the storyline. It gives the proceedings a very human element which is lacking in all the scenes where Sam doesn't appear - the attempts to humanise the soldiers in the generic military combat zone at the beginning for instance are horribly cheesy and serve only to let anyone who's seen more than five films know that they'll be dead within seconds.And then there's the action. Where would a Michael Bay film be without action? And Transformers delivers the goods but sadly, doesn't deliver them enough. Three scenes really stand out: the Decepticon helicopter Blackout's introductory rampage, Prime's highway duel with Bonecrusher and Starscream's mid-air scrap with the US air force. Each of these moments is a terrific jolt of adrenalin but by and large, the robot on robot combat is a let down. Credit that to Bay's love of wildly over the top camera movements and inability to stay still for a second, as Bumblebee's ruckus with Barricade, and Ironhide scrapping with Devastator become confusing spectacles where it isn't clear who is meant to be hitting who. Alongside this is the fact that for large portions of the film, the robots, especially the Decepticons, are conspicuously absent, to the extent where your mind starts to wander while waiting for the next fight.Aside from these few complaints however is the sense that they tried to make the scope a bit too grand. The majority of the story is told from Sam's point of view, but at time it veers off to show events from the perspective of the military and a team of code-breakers. This fractures the story development and in truth, the film would have been far better if they'd narrowed their focus a bit and concentrated solely on Sam.But like I said, the good news is that Bay, Spielberg et al haven't ruined the franchise. Indeed, despite the impression I might be giving, Transformers is a very enjoyable movie and I welcome the prospect of future sequels, its just that I was always going to be bit extra-critical of this film. There is an undeniable degree of childhood excitement to be had watching the first transformation sequence and seeing Optimus Prime act like Optimus Prime, while at the same time sounding like Optimus Prime is a pure nostalgic treat. When it comes to it, for all the plot holes and complaints I've picked up on, the only thing that's liable to ruin Transformers for anyone is the fact that the Decepticons are rarely on screen, especially Megatron and Starscream who only show up for about five minutes each. If you're not a geek, add another two stars to the score.",7,1,5,1 August 2007
Children of Men," A strong contender for film of the year
","Let's not beat around the bush here, children are a pain in the backside. Sure, to the parents they might be angelic little beauties wrapped in swaddling clothes with the most adorable sparkling eyes, but to the rest of us they are the tantrum throwing hell spawn that make grocery shopping and bus journeys a thing of misery. But what if they suddenly ceased to be? If women up and down the country started having miscarriages and the pregnancy rate plummeted until it dwindled away to nothing? How long would we last before giving way to utter chaos? This is the premise of Children of Men, a film that manages to encapsulate a whirlwind of emotions in the course of its running time and emerges as one of the most thought-provoking cinema releases in a long time.Set in Britain in 2027, the opening scene is one of sledgehammer like subtlety. Our protagonist Theo (Clive Owen) wanders into a coffee shop to catch a news report on the death of the world's youngest human being. He buys a drink and ignoring the crowd milling around the television, wanders back outside when the relative tranquillity of the scene is abruptly ended when the coffee house and everyone within it is decimated by the blast of a terrorist bomb, followed by screams and the disturbing sight of a woman stumbling out holding her severed arm in one hand. And from here onwards, your attention is fixed.This is a Britain not unlike that seen in V For Vendetta. In the face of social anarchy where activist groups promote their ideologies by blowing up civilians, the Government has responded in true Orwellian style. The pretence of Democracy having long been abandoned, we instead have a world of black suited riot police with machine guns marching in unison beneath the billboards encouraging the civilian mass to report on their neighbours the instant they show any sign of unusual behaviour. One especially jarring moment comes when Theo steps off a train and casually walks past several cages containing East Europeans who have all been rounded up, a moment that is alarming simply for the sense of how normal it is. With violent mobs attacking vehicles for no specific reason accompanied by the surrealism of an early view of a big inflatable pig hovering above an industrial estate, one of the film's many strong points is in crafting a wholly believable world during these initial scenes. It is a chaotic world where dystopic oppression meets indiscriminate violence and it sucks you in completely, frightening in how close it seems.But things really step up a gear when the main crux of the plot arrives. Abducted by his ex-wife's activist group, Theo finds himself meeting with the world's only pregnant woman and soon becomes embroiled in a mission to escort her to the coast to meet up with the Human Project, a shadowy secret organisation who will be able to shelter her and possibly save the whole human race in the process. Hounded at all turns by those who want to use Kee (the magnificent Claire-Hope Ashitey) and her baby for their own ends, Theo's initial reluctance to get involved transforms into a stubborn determination to protect her at all costs and their quest makes for gripping viewing.Holding all this together is a combination of documentary-style film making and some brilliant performances from all involved. Unlike most major releases, the camera is more of a passive bystander and the focus is on a realistic portrayal. There is no dramatic panning or ham-fisted slow motion at all and this calmer, less intrusive approach allows everything to seem more real.And speaking of real, Clive Owen deserves a wealth of praise for his central performance as Theo. He has foregone all pretence of Hollywood glamour and seeing his unshaven, haggard form when it first shuffles on screen it's hard to believe that this is the same man who played Dwight in Sin City. Throughout the course of the film, he provides the audience with a highly sympathetic figure to cling onto. He cries, he bleeds, he even breaks down at one point and his attempts to guide Kee are bereft of any action hero melodrama. As a result, he is so indescribably human that you'd have to possess a heart of stone not to root for him. The aforementioned Claire-Hope Ashitley meanwhile puts in a performance that should hopefully elevate her profile and grant her more roles. For want of a better word, she is fantastic. Kee is at times strong and cynical with a bitter sense of humour about her but altogether very vulnerable and couldn't be more convincing if she tried.This is accompanied by a divertingly cheerful performance by Michael Caine as an ageing hippie who is intent on seeing out the end of the world with a smile, a mountain of cannabis and Ruby Tuesday on the record player. He adds a light touch that provides a welcome break from all the nightmarish scenarios we get elsewhere. What's more, there's another brief but powerful turn from the criminally under appreciated Chiwetel Ejiofor who must surely be one of the acting world's best kept secrets.As a whole then, Children of Men is a commanding piece of art. It creates an enthralling world of humanity under incredible pressure, but does so without over-indulging or playing to the camera. And if there is to be one moment that sums up the entire film, it comes near the finale as Theo and Kee stumble out of a shattered apartment block with the baby wrapped up next to her mother's chest. Corpses line the streets and rubble is strewn everywhere and for a moment, the war-zone grows calm as soldiers and activists alike lower their weapons as the realisation of what has become of mankind sinks in before someone pulls a trigger again and the carnage continues. Highly recommended.",9,8,15,2 October 2006
Event Horizon," A criminally under rated horror masterpiece
","Unfairly dismissed as a combination of Alien and Hellraiser, Event Horizon is one of those films that should be ranked among the classics of it's genre yet has somehow fallen by the wayside to be revered by movie geeks and horror aficionados but ultimately ignored by the mainstream. What's especially surprising is that this excellent film came from the directing skills of Paul W Anderson who was also responsible for such tragic misfires as Resident Evil and Alien Versus Predator and shows that there is more to Hollywood's Generic Director For Hire than first imagined.Set in the year 2047 the story concerns the sudden reappearance of a prototype spaceship (the Event Horizon of the title) which vanished on it's maiden voyage seven years previously. A salvage ship called The Lewis And Clark is sent out to investigate and brings along Dr William Weir (Sam Neil), a physics expert originally responsible for the ship's creation. They dock with the Horizon but find no signs of life and as they set about making repairs, the crew begin to experience hallucinations and sense that they are not alone...So far so very familiar but this is far, far more than a rip off disguising itself as a 'homage.' For one thing there is no predatory alien hunter on the loose and instead the horror is far more psychological. Not that there isn't a fair amount of violence and gore but the gradual sense of unease that builds up to it is crafted more on the crew's growing sense of anxiety and paranoia. Plus, there is no definitive explanation given for what they are experiencing. Just what are these Ghosts from their pasts doing on this ship? And what exists on the other side of the black hole? Another dimension where mankind was never meant to go or as the movie itself suggests but doesn't confirm, the very depths of hell itself? Couple this with the excellent set design - the ship is modelled on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris - and the pulse-pounding moments in the latter half when the chaos sets in and you have one tremendously enjoyable horror film. Best watched alone at night with all the lights off where you can properly get swept up in it's claustrophobic atmosphere, you'll never need eyes to see again.",8,269,340,24 May 2006
Saw II," Decent follow up
","Gory as hell and proud of it, Saw seemingly came out of nowhere to grab cinema goers by the throat, shake them violently and vomit blood into their faces. Thanks to it's success a sequel was inevitable but when it followed the original in less than a year and still turned out to be a decent follow up that in places surpasses it's older brother was about as expected as the Spanish inquisition. And as the tagline boasts the level of depravity reaches all new levels.Setting the tone instantly, the first five minutes sees Jigsaw's latest victim having to make the decision between having his head splattered in a giant metal trap or carve his own eye out in order to retrieve the key to open it. True to the hype's promises the claret is gushing in seconds and when the cops arrive to investigate this rather unpleasant demise, the story properly kicks into gear. Bursting into a warehouse, the police led by detective Eric Matthews (Donnie 'New Kid On the Block' Wahlberg) corner Jigsaw in his den and all seems to be neatly wrapped up. Before you can say 'Gee, that was a very brief and concise short film' however the villain plays his ace in the hole; he has eight people locked up in a house riddled with traps who are slowly dying from breathing in air tinged with a tissue destroying virus and one of them is Matthew's delinquent teenage son.What follows plays out in two separate strands - Jigsaw plays his game of cat and mouse with the police while the eight victims of his scheme try to escape the house and meet all sorts of nasty ends along the way. Revealing too much more would give away too many of the twists and turns the plot takes along the way, but rest assured fans of the original will find plenty to relish in here. Spiked baseball bats, bladed hand traps, booby-trapped ovens and a pit filled with thousands upon thousands of used needles ramp the level of unpleasantness right up and there are none of the irritating flashbacks to disrupts proceedings like in the first film.It's not perfect of course. Grim and depraved it may be but 'Seven' it most certainly isn't and once again, every little twist has to be painstakingly explained but as far as squirm-in-your-seat film making goes, it's certainly effective. Jigsaw himself also has a far more active role this time round and makes a decidedly menacing presence but it is the link to the prequel that really seals the deal, a final act revelation so delightfully messed up it'll be with you for days.",6,0,1,13 May 2006
Jurassic World," Hey man, I only work here!
","'Jurassic World' is one of those movies which is a lot more enjoyable if you don't think about it too much. If you convince yourself to ignore the plot holes, the woman who sprints in high heels and the complete absence of Jeff Goldblum, it's loads of fun. It's two hours of popcorn munching spectacle, full of Dinosaurs ripping people apart and pulse pounding set pieces. It's not as good as the original, but it surpasses both 'Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III' to stand as the superior JP sequel. You'll be riveted to the screen constantly and it'll only be a day or two later that you realise how many cracks there are.Set twenty years on from the original, 'Jurassic World' sees John Hammond's dream as a reality. The park is now fully functional and incredibly successful, with attractions ranging from gyroscopic tours through fields of herbivores to the childish joy of riding a baby Triceratops. According to the people in charge however, this isn't enough and the growing public apathy towards the scientific marvel of 'de- extinction' has seen attendance figures drop. In an effort to keep the crowds flocking in, Dr Henry Wu and his boffins have created an entirely new species - the Indominus Rex. This all new reptilian monster is a mass of teeth and claws that has been bred for the specific purpose of being a total nightmare. Wonder if that'll get out? Surprise, it does! From the initial security guard-shredding breakout, 'Jurassic World' plonks an escalating series of action scenes on top of each other as the Indominus goes on the war path. In true sequel style, the fights are bigger, the body-count higher and while there's nothing to match the tension masterclass of the original's Raptors in the kitchen scene, it's still eye-popping escapism of the highest order. Thought the Rex fighting the Spinosaurus in 'Jurassic Park 3' was cool? You ain't seen nothing yet. Where it falls down though is the characters. Sure, Chris Pratt is effortlessly engaging and Irrfan Khan's upbeat billionaire is a worthy successor to John Hammond, but it's obvious that this script has been written and re-written too many times for anyone else to remain consistent. Bryce Dallas Howard has a good stab as the ice- queen turned worried aunt, but that doesn't explain why she would interrupt a frantic search for her nephews to coo over a dying Brachiosaur. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson meanwhile are likable enough as the kids in peril, but Vincent D'onofrio's military nut has blatantly had a few scenes cut to speed up the running time. It's not the fault of the actors but the numerous alterations to the story during the years in development has left them behaving irrationally, while one plot strand especially has a 'oh, just throw a Raptor at it' feel to it. Plus, the solution to the Indominus Rex problem isn't really a solution at all and it'll be clear to anyone that spends more than ten seconds thinking it over that they've solved nothing. When it comes to pure spectacle though, 'Jurassic World' is going to be a tough one to beat in 2015. The new 'Star Wars' has a fight on its hands if it hopes to beat the Pterosaur swarm, the Mosasaurus leaping from the water and the Raptors taking on the army. In terms of pure visual appeal, this can go toe-to-toe with the likes of 'Pacific Rim' any day and despite the weak script, there's more delights to be had here than in four 'Transformers' movies. Definitely needs more Goldblum though.",7,5,17,19 July 2015
Blood Diamond," Politically charged action thriller
","*Note: This review contains a SPOILER. Not a very big one, hell not even worth ticking the spoiler warning box when typing it up. But if you want to go in completely blind I suggest skipping to the next one. Unless that has spoilers too.* Overly preachy epics about the nonchalance of the Capitalist West when it comes to the suffering of the third world have been getting something of a resurgence of late. First, we got George Clooney pointing an accusing finger at the global oil industry for the radicalised violence of the Middle East in Syriana and just before Christmas, Forrest Whitaker came charging out of the starting gates in The Last King Of Scotland to show exactly what sort of people are supported by Western Governments in order to keep the rich/poor imbalance in place around the world. Next to join this rapidly growing club is Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond. The target this time round though is not corrupt oil barons or African dictators but the diamond industry and their fuelling of third world conflicts by buying up diamonds from combat zone warlords. For those of you worried about another talk-heavy slow burner though then we may have found a solution, for while Blood Dimaond may be so preachy that it's borderline propaganda, it's also an action movie.Yes, Zwick and co have decided to use the civil war that ravaged Sierra Leone in the late 90s as a backdrop for an adrenaline charged gun flick that is reminiscent of John Woo's Bullet In The Head for putting a civilian face on war rather than a military one. The film follows Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a South African mercenary who recruits down on his luck native Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) to help him find a king size diamond out in the bush while the country falls apart around them. This deranged little quest soon turns into an epic journey with them battling from one set piece to another. Thus, we get the pair ducking and diving around street corners as they try to escape the country's capital during the rebel invasion, the city torn apart as gunfire rips into soldiers and civilians alike with reckless abandon. Later, we get a brutal massacre of a group of journalists leading to a fast paced car chase and also helicopter attacks on guerrilla camps. As the duo hurtle in and out of life and death scenarios, you find yourself wondering exactly how much violence an Oscar nominated 'serious' film can possibly contain? Right up until another truckload of soldiers come bellowing out of the jungle with guns blazing...Mixed up in all this is a variety of subplots showing the plight of the country. Solomon's decision to join Archer is fired not by greed but by the desire to find his missing son, who has been captured by the rebels and turned into a child soldier. This provides the most harrowing element of the film, with youngsters barely past their tenth year being brainwashed into killing machines who slaughter their own people without any sign of remorse. It's lifted right from the pages of National Geographic magazine and is all the more haunting for it.Unfortunately, not everything works as well as it should. The running time especially is pushing it, clocking in just shy of three hours which could have been trimmed down by jettisoning the unnecessary ending, a hasty epilogue tacked on when it would have worked far better to end on the mountainside. Whatsmore, Jennifer Connelly's journalist Maddy Bowen is a bit too heavy handed. She works as mouthpiece for the writers opinions and not a lot more, associating love struck men who buy diamond rings for their childhood sweethearts with mass murderers with all the tact and grace of an appropriate metaphor with a tact bypass and no grace.Preachy though it may be though, Blood Diamond is still an enjoyable film and a noble one at that. Like Syriana beforehand, it illustrates how everything in the world is connected and how something as innocuous as going to the shops can lead to hundreds of people in another country being slaughtered by AK totting eleven year olds. It's a very slick, dramatic movie and has another impressive performance from DiCaprio. It might be over the top but when most films would turn a blind eye to the world, this one shoves it right in your face and will leave you with at least a few difficult questions to consider.",7,0,0,26 April 2007
The Descent," The best horror film of the decade thus far
","Neil Marshall's follow up to Dog Soldiers sounds quite similar when you consider the plot synopsis: a group of six female friends on a caving trip in the mountains are attacked by cannibalistic subhumans. But while the same-sex group under attack in a tightly packed space, located in the wilderness motif may be repetitive, The Descent is actually a significantly different film. Dog Soldiers, for all its wanton gore and violence was played as much for laughs as horror, off-setting the werewolf frenzy with bickering between the soldiers and references to the Evil Dead. The Descent on the other hand plays it relatively straight. There are still nods to pop culture but from the horrific opening sequence to the beautifully dark ending, there isn't a laugh to be had. Instead, Marshall plunges cast and audience alike into a claustrophobic nightmare scenario and the result is not only the most relentless horror of the decade thus far, but arguably the finest as well.What is especially striking about The Descent is that you could quite feasibly remove the monsters from the story and still have an hour and a half of raw terror. Central to this is the lighting, the film foregoing all standard light rigs and relying solely on the fluorescent caving equipment and helmet bulbs to illuminate the darkness. When a bulb breaks, the screen is plunged into darkness. As a result, light becomes the most precious commodity in the film and simply watching the cast crawling through tight spaces and narrow tunnels in the rock is a nerve-shredding experience. Dust falls from the ceiling and there is the constant threat of a cave-in looming overhead, providing The Descent with a bleak and oppressive atmosphere even before the first monster comes crawling into view.When they do though, Marshall pushes the tension as close to breaking point as film is likely to get. The teasing snippets of drooling shadows and huddled, shadowy forms give way to some highly effective 'jump out of the seat' scares. And don't think for a second that just because the protagonists are women that the director will be pulling punches, the violence is brutal, messy and grim. While this will be nothing new to genre fans who in the past few years have seen flesh eating viruses, blood splattered Euro-torture and rural massacres brought vividly to life on screen, The Descent is still effective: one scene where a girl trembles in fright, watching the corpse of a friend being ripped asunder through a video-camera lens only inches away finding the perfect balance between old-school claret and white-knuckled tension.Marshall's trump card though is the level of intelligence that he provides, something that is sorely lacking from the large number of mainstream horror films. There is a subtle implication of adultery motivating character actions and an even more subtle hint that the entire scenario may simply be the nightmare delusions of the lead heroine. After all, she experiences hallucinations before the trip and noticeably leaves a prescription bottle of pills behind. This grants the film an edge over its contemporaries, as it rewards repeat viewings by allowing the possibility of multiple interpretations.In short, the best film to crop up from the resurgence in old-school horror. It's definitely aware of its genre heritage, mixing elements of Deliverance (same sex activity trip) with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the blood-drenched lead looks just like the 'final girl' Sally) and even Alien (the trip into the cave resembles the entrance to the derelict) but reconfigures them for an intense and unforgiving ride. Decades from now, this one will be considered a classic and no doubt, the 2030 remake will result in all kinds of derision.",9,1,3,18 August 2007
The Departed," Give the man an Oscar already!
","The Departed is another knock-out blow from director Martin Scorsese. A gritty, fast paced and highly impressive cops versus robbers fable that is reminiscent of his old classics and makes for a riveting cinema experience. With the awards ceremony season in full swing and the Oscars just around the corner, it'd be a real shame if he didn't walk away with at least one golden statue having been denied them so long, as it is a very impressive movie. At turns, it is both tense, violent, funny, dark and packed with so many terrific performances it is hard to pick a standout and should hopefully be remembered as one of the best films of 2006.Returning to gangland sees Scorsese tackling the underworld from a slightly different perspective. Set in the world of the Irish mafia, it differs from his Italian-American gangster pictures by showing us contrasting elements on both sides of the law in the shape of Leonardo Di Caprio's police mole within the gang and Matt Damon's gang mole within the police. As the police force led by Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin struggle to take down Jack Nicholson's kingpin, the two moles become aware of each other's existence and are soon caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse.All of which might sound familiar and to no surprise, for as has been widely publicised, The Departed is a Western riff on the classic Hong Kong series Infernal Affairs that told the same story. It might be a little unoriginal, but with a pro like Scorsese at the helm, it avoids the inevitable disaster that awaits most Hollywood remakes (stand up The Ring, The Wickerman, The Fog, The Omen blah blah blah) by the twin virtues of having its own identity and a terrific cast. For where the Hong Kong original was a slick thriller, this one is covered in dirt.The Boston underworld here comes across as a bleak and unwelcoming landscape with little of the criminal romance of Goodfellas to be found. The gangs do not lounge in jazz clubs or casinos here but dingy, whiskey soaked bars and quayside warehouses filled with rats. Urban decay is all too evident and when the violence comes, it hits you like a jackhammer. The gun shots sound incredibly loud and forceful and when they strike human flesh, heads are blown apart with stark realism and zero fanfare. Fist fights as well remain taut and ugly, Di Caprio breaking his own wrist in a brawl through punching too hard as his foe is rammed through a glass window. Violence here has pervaded even everyday life and when Jack Nicholson emerges from the back of a bar drenched in blood with no explanation, it is treated as just one of those things that needs no questions.As previously mentioned as well, the cast is on fire. Di Caprio has banished all memory of the floppy haired teenage heart throb and emerged as an unquestionable successor to De Niro's place as Scorsese's on screen muse. Faced with a life or death situation, he throbs with nervous, aggressive energy and his eyes have never seemed more dangerous, yet he is supposed to be the good guy. Jack let go Rose, Jack let go. Matt Damon meanwhile proves himself once again, his role as Detective Sullivan overflowing with moral dilemmas as the polar opposites of his situation come into conflict.They are not the only ones to be celebrated though as Jack Nicholson puts in one of the finest appearances of his long and glittering career. As mafia kingpin Frank Costello, he moves from one dirty situation to another, delivering racist barbs to Chinese gang members and having people murdered with a wicked grin etched on his face, displacing his venom with a malicious sense of humour. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver fine performances as reliable old hands but perhaps it is Mark Wahlberg who comes out strongest. His Captain Dignam is one of the most hard-assed police officers you're ever likely to see and he encapsulates him perfectly, as well as getting some of the film's best lines. With this and Four Brothers it could be argued he is trying to cap the market for overly macho, angry young men but it must be said, he is one of the most memorable things in the movie.However, if one thing stands in the way of this film and the Oscars it is the undeniable remake syndrome. For all its strong points, it is still a retelling of an existing story and the lack of total originality might be to Scorsese's disadvantage. Nonetheless, it puts paid once and for all to the argument that remakes are a waste of time and is a very worthy version of the Hong Kong original.",9,3,6,20 February 2007
30 Days of Night," Innovative and atmospheric Vampire movie
","The Arctic circle isn't exactly the place you'd normally expect to find Vampires, but that's where they head in 30 Days of Night, a refreshing take on an over-populated genre that sees an isolated Alaskan town besieged by a pack of bloodsuckers during a month of constant darkness. It's not a classic horror by any means but it has several tricks up its sleeve to ensure that the film remains one of the more memorable of its ilk and definitely a decent choice for a night in with the TV on.What makes 30 Days Of Night so unique is down to several things. Firstly, the setting - the sweeping Alaskan wilderness lends a wonderfully doom-laden atmosphere to the film; the town losing all touch with the outside world as the sun sets. The frozen and desolate landscape makes the battle for survival seem all the more fruitless, as well as lending itself to some eerily beautiful cinematography. Second are the Vampires themselves. On film, they normally seem to be portrayed as tragic figures of eternal darkness (a la Interview with the Vampire) or trenchcoat wearing hedonists that listen to Industrial music (see; the Blade trilogy or Buffy the Vampire Slayer). The ones in 30 Days Of Night however are neither, they're just voracious animals who delight in ripping people to pieces and don't think twice about tormenting young girls for the sake of their bloodlust. Yes okay, the aforementioned trenchcoats are still in place but these aren't a group of hip youngsters who supplement their slaughter with pop culture references, they're pure evil unleashed in its most primitive form. And at least they don't all have New Rock boots on.Thirdly there's the acting. Josh Hartnett is reliably down to earth as the local sheriff but quite frankly, him and his relatives/friends/co workers are all rather dull. Thank God then for Danny Huston and Ben Foster as the villains, Huston going beyond the call-of-duty to deliver a frighteningly convincing portrayal of the pack leader, while Foster exudes menace as his human agent. Foster especially is terrific, giving a deliciously creepy performance that is almost certainly going to get him typecast in similar roles from now on. He's so unsettling in fact that it's almost a relief when the pack turns up and start tearing the limbs off townspeople. Sure, your arm might be gone from the elbow down and the stump is already frosting over with ichor, but at least you don't have to hang out with that weird Southern boy anymore.That being said, 30 Days Of Night is no instant classic by any stretch, but is a taut and effective little shocker with some grisly set pieces to keep the adrenaline going. Mark Boone's rampage with some heavy duty mining equipment at the half way point is the obvious highlight and there's plenty of factory machines for characters to get minced up in. Shame then that pacing of the film is at odds with itself, days flashing past abruptly and without any change to the present scenario. Plus, a sizable portion of the story relies heavily on the 'we've got to get across town, hope we don't meet any vampires' theme. Once they've run to the restaurant, then an attic, then a convenience store, then a factory you'll be screaming at them to simply stay where they are. By and large though, this is a survival horror that relies entirely on the atmosphere and it remains constantly foreboding and oppressive throughout. Well worth a watch indeed.",7,0,3,11 April 2008
Wedding Crashers," Hilarious frat pack comedy
","Given the level of success achieved by previous frat pack comedies like Old School, Dodgeball and Anchorman, it'd be easy to feel a little wary going into this film. Having provided us with so many comic moments that will surely be looked upon as classics in years to come, surely the time has come for Ben Stiller and his gang to deliver a dud amongst all the gems? Maybe it is, but 'Wedding Crashers' isn't it. In fact, this is one of the funniest offerings they've provided so far.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn take their turns at centre stage as two divorce mediators with cynical views of marriage that crash weddings in a bid to seduce girls already half-hypnotised by the romantic air. And their first on screen pairing together is tremendous fun to say the least. Wilson, normally accustomed to playing the dumb surfer dude is here a more realistic character; a hardcore but also intelligent party crasher questioning whether this sort of behaviour is befitting of someone his age. Watching his attempts to get together with Rachel MacAdams, a senator's daughter he has fallen in love with, he becomes hugely sympathetic despite his incredibly immature, roguish actions during the first thirty minutes.Vaughn meanwhile is perfectly cast as Wilson's comic foil. His character is almost the exact opposite of the one he played in Dodgeball, the easy-going underdog charm replaced by a manic, motormouth lady killer. He spits out one liners so quickly, his rants on various aspects of relationships become increasingly difficult to keep up with and before you know it, you've missed many great lines simply because you're still laughing so hard at the other ones. Individually, the pair are both great actors, but together they provide a natural chemistry not unlike that of Laurel & Hardy, Wilson's laid back everyman charm perfectly offsetting Vaughn's misogynist arrogance.The support from the rest of the cast has much to commend as well. Rachel MacAdams as Wilson's love interest is, to put it in it's most basic terms, stunning. She couldn't have put in a better performance as the senator's daughter and it's easy to see how Wilson could fall for her so easily. She is both intelligent, world wise and incredibly pretty as well, with the sort of smile that could light up a room.Isla Fisher on the other hand offsets MacAdams much in the same way Vaughn offsets Wilson, the former Home And Away actress playing the demented younger sister that develops a crush on Vaughn and refuses to let go. She is at turns innocent and sweet, then deranged and perverse, yet handles all aspects of her character with ease and steals several scenes right out from under the other actor's noses. You have to give Fisher her dues that such an unrealistic persona could not only be entirely believable in her hands, but also very sympathetic and incredibly funny as well.That isn't to say this film is perfect though. Christopher Walken remains an imposing presence, but never actually gets to do anything, despite early hints that he will clash with Vaughn in much the same way Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller collided in Meet The Parents. Plus, there is a third act cameo from Will Ferrell which promises much but delivers little, squeezing surprisingly few laughs out despite Ferrell's proved comic abilities.Nevertheless, these are minor complaints in what is otherwise a riotously enjoyable comedy. There are no scenes as inherently stupid as Anchorman's newsreader gang war or Dodgeball's S&M uniform match, but the comic set pieces still deliver the goods and then some. One scene involving Vince Vaughn tied to a four poster bed and a potential homosexual rape from the senator's gay son is hysterically funny, whereas a football match in the first half is classic frat pack comedy. Despite the rapid succession of set pieces piled on top of each other though, there is still time for character development as well, Wilson and Vaughn's characters maturing as the film goes on and the end result is not only the most human comedy the frat pack have delivered thus far, but also one of the funniest as well.",8,1,2,16 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," I find your lack of faith disturbing...
","I bet this was a difficult one to sell; a three hour epic about an oil prospector prowling through turn-of-the-Century California where the lead character is as rotten to the core as they come. Yet There Will Be Blood is not a difficult one to watch and hopefully, in the wake of all the Oscar furore and a well-deserved Best Actor win for Daniel Day-Lewis, more people will be encouraged to go see a film that is fast on the way to becoming a modern American classic.Day-Lewis of course is the heart of darkness around which There Will Be Blood revolves. He plays Daniel Plainview and when we are first introduced to the man, he is alone in the desert digging for silver. He is covered in dust and grime, a sun-bleached man with nothing to his name bar the pick axe in his hand and the bags of blasting Dynamite. That is of course until he strikes oil and his fortunes begin to change. Years pass and Plainview is now a made man, a respected oil tycoon who travels the country with his adopted son HW (Dillon Freasier) offering his services as a businessman promising to expand the fortunes of any community who he believes to be sitting on top of untapped oil reserves. Out of the blue he is visited by an impoverished farmer's boy named Paul Sunday who leads him towards an isolated town where black gold practically gushes from the rocks. Plainview sets up shop and begins drilling, but as he slowly makes his fortune, the lives of everyone around him come to be adversely affected. Daniel Plainview is no bringer of prosperity, he is a man looking to bleed the Earth dry.Needless to say, Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits every inch of the man and puts in yet another brilliant performance in a career that has been built on them. Plainview is given no back-story ('I don't like to talk about such things...') but he is still a captivating presence. His eyes glimmer with Vampiric greed, his voice is a deep Southern drawl and his body language so imposing that he is an intimidating sight, even in the dialogue-free first fourteen minutes where the root of his fortune is revealed. Barely a second of the film goes past where he isn't on screen but he is so naturally magnetic that even given the three-hour duration, you still want it to continue past the darkly-comic finale. Day-Lewis's recent Oscar win was entirely justified and should you need further convincing, pay attention to the scene where Plainview confesses his hatred of humanity to his brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), an exquisitely grim exchange that merely hints at the darkness within him yet provides the most illuminating snapshot we will get.As his wealth escalates though, his soul deteriorates and he comes into conflict with the town's boy Preacher Eli (Paul Dano) and it is in the confrontations between them that There Will Be Blood is at its finest. Eli is no beautiful flip-side to Plainview by any stretch of the imagination; he is a flawed and weak man whose faith in the Lord gives him the strength to command his flock to acts of reverent worship, yet cannot provide him with the intestinal fortitude to truly challenge the oilman. Their final face-off in the midst of the great depression is breathtaking and wrought with nods to some of Kubrick's more absurdly humorous moments, Capitalism and faith colliding head on.Magazines like Total Film in the UK have likened Plainview's story to Orson Welles's masterpiece Citizen Kane but There Will Be Blood is no mere imitator. Kane built a fortune and lost his soul in the process, but you could easily argue that Plainview had no soul to lose in the first place. When his son is deafened in the oil-eruption centrepiece at the half-way point, Plainview carries his son to safety then abandons the infant with a colleague to watch the derrick catch alight and he gazes on the inferno until dawn arrives. This is an outstanding film, a mesmerising sermon on money, faith, family and the madness that lies just beneath the surface, waiting to be tapped.",9,2,5,27 February 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Charming, magnetic, dangerous
","Now that all the dust has settled, Oscar season has ended and the campaign to have Forrest Whitaker walk off with the Best Actor statue has subsided, it couldn't be a better time to re-evaluate The Last King Of Scotland. For when all the media frenzy has ended, the strength of any great film is on how watchable it is when not surrounded by a day to day frenzy of newspaper headlines and gossip columns. Much as I like tearing movies to pieces once the furore has died down though, it's simply not possible with this one, because The Last King Of Scotland is an excellent film that should rightfully be remembered as one of the greatest films of 2006 for years to come.For the unenlightened, this is a fictional portrayal of the cruel Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, as told from the point of view of his personal physician, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). Having graduated from University, Nicholas is unsure of himself and frustrated with the short comings of home life under his over-bearing father, so spins a globe with the intention of travelling where-ever his finger lands. It hits Uganda and the young doctor sets off on a life-changing journey from which no-one emerges with clean hands. He winds up working in a small village delivering inoculations to African children and tending injuries, but a chance encounter with newly appointed ruler Idi Amin (Forrest Whitaker) leads to him becoming his personal physician. But as he is sucked into the charismatic Amin's inner circles, he finds his life beginning to spiral into an orgy of darkness and violence.What makes this an interesting film to watch is the fact that Garrigan himself is not an entirely likable character. Upon arriving in Uganda, his mission seems to be just as much about going on a shag rampage as it is helping the needy and his arrogance makes him the sort of fellow you'd want to punch rather than celebrate. On the other hand though, it is a far more realistic portrayal of a naive, insecure youth and the film makers should be applauded for making this decision. Regardless of his unappealing side, when push comes to shove and Garrigan finds himself floundering in deep water it is possible to feel some sympathy for him, the end result being a fully fleshed out character of which McAvoy should be very proud.Undoubtedly though, the chief focus is Forrest Whitaker as Idi Amin. That's right, big cuddly Forrest Whitaker isn't quite so lovable anymore and instead is ruthless tyrant. He is both charismatic and deranged and even in his early scenes you can tell there is something not right about the man. It's there in that booming laugh, the all-too easy smile and the nervous glances among his henchmen, a predatory monster lurking behind his promises of a free country and food for all. Whitaker deserved that Oscar and no mistake.What ultimately leaves the biggest impression however is in the stark realism of the whole thing. Director Kevin McDonald brings his documentary experience to good use here, filming events in a manner which is frankly, a bit frightening. The sight of Whitaker snarling and ranting at captured resistance fighters before leaving so his bodyguard may machine gun them mercilessly is terrifying in the simplicity of the approach and some of the later scenes are horrific to watch. This is historical fiction in its most violent and unrestrained form.All in all then, a fantastic movie. McDonald welds a fictional story onto a true life series of events and cranks the tension up to boiling point. The performances from the two stars are terrific and they are aided by a strong supporting cast, including a nigh on unrecognisable Gillian Anderson in a brief appearance as one of Garrigan's fellow doctors. And you'll never be able to look at Forrest Whitaker in the same way ever again.",9,1,4,4 April 2007
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Brutal and unflinching portrayal of a nation at war
","The easiest way to sum up Taegukgi is the rather lazy tag of 'The Korean answer to Saving Private Ryan.' It certainly delivers the same epic feel as the Spielberg movie, showing us several years of raw human combat condensed into two and a half hours running time, with plenty of bloody battles filmed with cameras that shake with each artillery detonation. Rather unfortunately though, it also comes with some over-the-top melodrama as well which seems geared to tugging the viewer's heart strings, but instead comes across as rather clichéd and funny, which somewhat spoils the mood.Take for example the early scenes of the film. Brothers Seouk and Tae living carefree lives and running happily on the streets together. Seouk is close to finishing school, whereas Tae runs a shoeshine business and is on the verge of getting married, while their mother runs a noodle stand where business is just picking up. All the while, there is upbeat, 'triumph of the human spirit' style music playing in the background and everyone has smiles plastered on their faces. At one point they even remark how happy they are, their idyllic lives being so overplayed you half expect somebody to say: 'Gee, wouldn't it be bad if a big war suddenly came along and ruined everything?' Later in the running time, Seouk sits in a war hospital a changed man. He has seen his brother driven to the point of insanity by war and his friends dying around him. He is scarred and haunted by what he has seen and his thoughts instantly return to his earlier life, the family scenes from earlier playing in a montage over more highly-strung, sentimental music. The effect is meant to be poignant, instead, it is utterly hilarious.Thankfully though, the film still has much to commend it. For one thing, the director is in no way driven by the same patriotic grandeur that guides many a Hollywood war. In place of triumphant flag waving, we see atrocities committed by both sides. In fact if anything, the ones who come across as worse here are the South Korean army, despite the fact they are the main focus and it's hard not to forget the scenes of young boys being forced into action and the secret police wiping out their own civilians.What's more, when not hampered by the overwrought melodrama, the relationship between the two brothers is handled very well. Tae's decision to take on as many suicide missions as possible in return for Seouk being sent home results in a friction between the two that escalates over time. This is portrayed in an admirable fashion by the two lead actors, both of whom provide terrific performances.Backing this up is a series of spectacular battle scenes. One rather dodgy looking CGI plane aside, the overall result is a startlingly realistic portrayal of combat. Explosions rock the land, dirt and body parts fly in all directions and there are numerous hand to hand battles which could stand alongside Private Ryan's opening beach landing in terms of brutality. War has never looked so horrific.As a conclusion then, Taegukgi is a film of two halves. Two fantastic lead performances and some stunning battle scenes certainly leave an indelible impression on your mind and the film has much to commend it. If you can look past the fact that it sometimes feels like a catalogue of war movie clichés, you will find a highly enjoyable vision of a conflict that has gone largely unnoticed in cinematic history.",6,3,15,20 September 2005
The Iron Giant," A wonderful piece of film making
","It is a tremendous shame that this film has reached such a small audience as in my humble opinion, its one of the finest animated pictures to come out of the US. Sure, it does not pack the epic scope of The Lion King, but it is a very touching (but not schmaltzy) work and is one of those films that can literally bring a smile to your face that will not leave for days.Set in the 1950's, it tells of a young American boy obsessed with science fiction comics and movies, who befriends a massive, alien robot that has crash landed in the countryside surrounding his home. The two form a bond as he gradually teaches the giant about his world and the story then focuses on his attempts to keep the giant hidden from a US government official and the military. Not easy when you're a 30 feet tall, clanking mechanical marvel with footprints the size of cars.Along the way, there are plenty of sly touches. The feel of the 1950's is perfectly realised with milkshake shops, bad horror films and the sense of paranoia that came from being one of two super powers dominating the world. The animation too is beautifully done, with even the metallic eyes of the Giant displaying tremendous emotion behind them. The story at times is very sentimental, but it's also loaded with a knowing sense of wry humour and though this may be a film with a child audience squarely in mind, I defy even the toughest of souls not to feel a little choked up come the ending.",9,2,4,21 January 2005
Iron Man," Hey terrorists, terrorise this
","Given that over the past eight years or so we've seen three X-Men movies, three Spiderman movies, two Fantastic Four movies, Batman, Superman and the Punisher, it's not hard to imagine a few people rolling their eyes as Iron Man, the latest superhero franchise turns up this Spring. Cast all those aspersions aside though folks, years from now people will be talking about the first time they saw Iron Man with the sense of wistful nostalgia usually reserved for the likes of Jaws. This is one of those movies that reminds you why you keep going to the cinema: pure escapist entertainment that for two hours provides the perfect break from Council tax, mortgage repayments and neighbours throwing four month old watermelon slices at your conservatory windows.The somewhat familiar story revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), a billionaire weapons dealer with a penchant for fast cars and loose women. His self-absorbed life comes to sudden end though when he gets captured by Afghan rebels after demonstrating his latest super missile, goodbye California Condo, hello dusty pit of hell. Tasked with building them a missile, Stark turns the tables on his captors by fashioning a formidable armoured suit Macguyver style out of their weapon supplies and smacking them into oblivion. A free man again, he returns to America and brings a burning desire to correct some of the wrongs he's helped to engineer with him. That and a massive great hole in his chest.From here the story follows typical superhero-origin archetypes but is still constantly watchable thanks to Downey Junior's charismatic performance. His Tony Stark is a walking charm offensive without any nauseating smarm (thank the lord Tom Cruise did not get it) and manages to exude chemistry out of everyone he comes into contact with. Nailing every single one-liner, it is abundantly clear why his GI bodyguards in the opening scene are so starstruck; if you're in this man's presence for more than a few seconds you will want to be him. Heck, even the anthropomorphic robots in his lab enjoy his company.Granted, by the time the first hour has gone by and our hero still hasn't put on his iconic red and yellow suit, some of the ankle biters might get a bit impatient but the payoff is well worth it. His brawls with the Afghan militia are eye-popping enough but his closing battle with the Iron Monger (think over-sized alter-ego) is the real clincher. It's a barnstorming highway smash 'em up which puts the ADD camera of Transformers to shame. Parents need not fear though, this is not violence, it's action. There is no blood to speak of and even the potentially harrowing scenes of villages being raided or young American soldiers getting machine gunned fail to put a downer on the colourful escapism.The film also boasts the strongest supporting cast since Batman Begins and they all do their best, but despite Terrence Howard's matey military liaison and Jeff Bridges oozing menace, this is still very much the lead's show. His star quality practically drips off the screen and combined with the outstanding set pieces, turns what could have been yet another production line origin movie into the best blockbuster of the year so far. And make sure you stay to the end of the credits, it's well worth it.",9,2,4,17 May 2008
Casino Royale," Bond gets violent again
","At the time of writing this, Casino Royale is already a triumph. It's been a major box office success across the globe, silenced all of Daniel Craig's naysayers and as hundreds of critics have said, 'returned the series to its roots.' But all hype aside, is it any good? The answer is a resounding, definitive and triumphant sort of. It has much to recommend it and is certainly the best Bond film since Goldeneye, but it's not without its flaws. Given how silly the franchise became with Die Another Day however, its refreshing to see the old familiar Spy in a far more satisfying adventure.Craig you see is a much more rough and tumble Bond than we've seen of late. Throughout the course of the movie, he is more than willing to let his fists do the talking and gets involved in a number of bone crunching rucks. At one point he is captured and tortured violently, at another he is poisoned and nearly dies, he sweats, he bleeds and come the climax, he is covered in bruises and most likely carries several scars from his encounters. In short, Craig makes Bond look like less of an indestructible charm machine and reminds us all just how painful the job really is. What's more, he's given some utterly fantastic action sequences to get grim and gritty in. The first half hour of the movie is a roller-coaster of an introduction with Bond pursuing a African Parkour expert across a city before winding up at an embassy filled with gunmen who would be considerably better at their jobs if they'd included lessons in marksmanship and not standing next to pressurised air tanks in their training schedules. The climactic gun battle in a collapsing Venice tower is also great, with Craig pummelling his foes with fists, knives, electric cables and even a nail gun with ruthless abandon.But Bond is only ever as good as his enemies are evil and given that chronologically speaking, this is his first ever mission it stands to reason that some delightfully slimy little reptile should come crawling out of the woodwork to apply for the job. That man is Le Chiffre (played by the brilliantly named Mads Mikkelson), a corrupt asthmatic banker and mathematical genius who is addicted to gambling and occasionally bleeds out the eyes. Thankfully that little genetic defect is the most outlandish thing about him and rather than having a vast subterranean lair and a penchant for doomsday weapons, Le Chiffre is more interested in saving his own neck from the terrorist organisations whose money he has squandered, an approach that fits in well with the general style of the film. Furthermore, there's also a terrific performance from Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, the most fully realised Bond girl in years. Rather than just being a set of curves, she is given plenty of emotional investment and the character is fleshed out more to the point where you want her and Bond to get together, not just fall into bed and be done with it.But as I've already mentioned, the film does have its flaws and chief among these is the painfully long running time. At 144 minutes in length it feels somewhat overdone, especially when you consider how long it takes for things to get going. Bond doesn't even get to the titular casino until about an hour into the movie and his romance with Vesper is stretched out way too much. There is after all only so many sunsets you can sail into. The other principle reason for it not being the triumph it should have been either is the rather ham-fisted direction the plot goes in towards the ending with twists being churned out so much you start to wonder who the villain really is. Given that this comes immediately after the masterclass in tension where hero and villain come face to face in a nail biting poker game only serves to emphasis the flaws.Regardless of these misgivings though, Casino Royale is still a very worthy addition. It isn't enough to bury the memory of invisible cars, helium breasted nuclear physicists, diamond faced mercenaries and Halle Berry but it still steers our beloved spy back in the right direction. And while some may bemoan the lack of Q or Money Penny, Craig makes a lasting impression as the new face of MI6 and should hopefully return to the role a lot more. This is a very enjoyable film and makes for a terrific last trip to the cinema of the year, it's just a shame projectionists won't let you fast forward through the ending to get to the fight.",7,0,0,23 December 2006
Beowulf," This is not Sparta
","Robert Zemeckis clearly wasn't paying attention the last time Hollywood tried to make 3D films, otherwise he'd have been party to forgettable trash like Friday the 13th 3D or the third Jaws movie and most likely, decided to dismiss it and release Beowulf as a regular film. Regardless of how good you might consider the finished product, sitting in a theatre watching it makes you realise how tacky the 3D gimmick is. Bodily fluids and weapons do not fly out of the screen at the audience, the only thing it adds is a degree of depth perception to the crowd scenes and a decrease in picture quality, where weapon edges are blurry and the screen isn't entirely in focus. Shame really, as a film, Beowulf is quite decent. It's not a masterpiece and there's bound to be a few purists out there driven to fury seeing a classic piece of literary prose turned into a silly piece of pop trash, but it's still quite fun in places. It's also got more brains than you might first realise.The main reason behind this is that Zemeckis hasn't gone for a straight adaptation. The core story of Beowulf fighting a string of monsters one after the other is still there, but the central hero isn't the infallible stalwart he was in the fifth century. Here, Beowulf's mouth is as big as his biceps, his ego is so massive it casts a shadow and the story is as much about the creation of his myth as it is about fist fights with cave trolls. He's also an incredibly randy sod who finds it difficult to turn women down, which gets him into all manner of hot water throughout the course of the film.Aside from the frustrating 3D meanwhile, Beowulf's biggest selling point is the motion capture animation and in close ups, it's remarkably impressive. Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Brendan Gleeson look fantastic, the detail so startling it's occasionally difficult to tell that it's not the real thing. When the camera pans out however, the cracks begin to appear. The extras are bland and ill-defined and in some cases look no better than extended cut scenes from Playstation 2 games. Thankfully, the characters still sparkle with warmth and emotion, but it's not a major leap forward by any means.If there's one place where Beowulf shines though, it's the action scenes. Grendel's initial beer hall rampage is a bit dizzying, but the rest is fantastic to behold. Beowulf's flashback tussle with a pack of ravenous sea monsters is the first high point as he butchers his slippery foes in a series of ingenious ways, turning the sea crimson in a ludicrously macho five minute sequence that gets the adrenaline pumping in time for his naked rumble with Grendel. These are merely the warm up bouts however and his main event battle with a giant, golden dragon is a riot; serpent and Dane spilling down a mountain, crashing through forests, battling on bridges, plunging into the ocean and kicking seven bells out of each other in a jaw dropping brawl that should satisfy any action junkie's fix.Thanks to the delirious violence and overtly macho storyline, Beowulf is perhaps the first film to benefit from 300's success earlier this year but sadly, it isn't as good as the Frank Miller movie. The central premise of a man making his own myth is surprisingly clever and the action scenes are a blast, but it's just not as instantly memorable. It's a fun way to spend a night out, especially if you psyche yourself up by listening to Viking metal like Turisas, Amon Amarth and Finntroll beforehand, but a fun night out is all it is. Fifteen hundred years from now, it's a safe bet that this version will be entirely forgotten while academics still write dissertations on the poem. Go and watch it for the blood, the thunder and the popcorn, but don't expect to witness the future of cinema.",6,2,6,18 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard 4: Revenge of the Nerds
","Prior to its release, Die Hard 4 (Live Free Or Die Hard to you folks on the other side of the pond) seemed like a colossal failure waiting to happen. The bad guys weren't Euro fanatics or Colombian drug lords, but cyber terrorists. The director was Len Wiseman, whose biggest claim to fame are the two Underworld films. Bruce Willis is no longer the sprightly bad ass he was back when he first visited the Nakatomi Plaza and worst of all, the rating was PG-13. PG-13? For a Die Hard movie? The most grimly violent and foul mouthed action franchise of all time? This can't work can it? Well, after months of sitting around with my fingers crossed chanting 'please don't suck,' it is a tremendous relief to say that Die Hard 4 is an absolute blast. Sort of.Now, a plot revolving around 'cyber terrorism' conjures up images of fat, sweaty, science-fiction fans sat in their parent's basements typing for two hours, (and true to form, Kevin Smith makes an appearance, quite a good one too). Certainly, there are points where the entire film seems like one colossal war between the good nerds (those with toy collections that still live with their parents) and the bad nerds (those who hire mercenaries to kill the competition) with John McClane stuck in the middle, but nevertheless this is still an action film through and through. Wiseman handles the set pieces with aplomb and there a couple of sequences so utterly awesome that they could quite easily stand toe-to-toe with the fire hose abseiling of the original. McClane's ruck with oriental lady assassin Maggie Q for instance is a riot, an absolutely punishing duel that culminates in an inventive lift shaft/truck altercation. And then of course, there's the spectacular finale involving a big rig and a jet fighter - without a shadow of a doubt, the highlight of the film and sure to be propping up a few 'best action scene' categories in the end of the year polls, even if it does ape True Lies a bit.Action aside, the biggest reason for seeing this film is to catch Bruce Willis reprising his most iconic character. Appropriately, the new millennium's McClane is bitter and tired. He's still capable of cracking wise and throwing down with the best of them, but he's even more cynical than before. His previous heroism has done him no favours, landing him with little more than a pat on the back, an ex-wife and kids who don't use his surname. Sadly though, he's not quite as vulnerable as the previous entries, coming across more as an indestructible super-cop rather than a blue collar everyman. One scene for instance sees McClane throwing himself out of a speeding car: if this were 1988, it would have been followed by an agonising sequence where Willis pops his shoulder back into place and winces in agony, biting back tears of pain. Now though he simply gets up and proceeds to the next set piece with only a trickle of blood rolling down the side of his head.And this of course is where serious Die Hard fans will have their biggest complaint justified, as this entry is spectacularly blood-free. People tend to die off screen, blasted out of windows or minced up in turbines, Wiseman pulling the camera away at the pivotal moment to show Justin Long's exasperated side kick gasping in disbelief. The chief villain's death in particular is a huge let down: one hastily edited shot and he's down, no blood, no anguish, no anything. There isn't even any swearing, the 'yippee kay yay' trademark edited in such a way as to make it a cute buzz-phrase rather than a glorious victory snarl.That aside, Die Hard 4 is still a hugely enjoyable slice of summer fun. Dave Grohl lookalike Justin Long has a natural charm and Kevin Smith is on scene stealing form. Timothy Olyphant falls short though, stuck in the role of the super-geek bad guy who could only be less threatening if he were made entirely of wet noodles. He's the sort of villain who tries to remain aloof and threatening, but always gets his bigger mates to do the dirty work; a villain for the Ipod generation if you will.Very enjoyable therefore but not the blitzkrieg return to form it should have been. This is Die Hard for the post-9/11 world: the streets are filled with chaos and the emergency services are overwhelmed as the social system collapses, but it's also a politically correct and serviceable portrayal of modern terrorism that twelve year olds could watch with their parents. Terrific fun yes, but it would be nice if they refrained from smoothing down the edges next time.",8,1,3,1 September 2007
Lucy," 'I think we only use ten percent of our hearts'
","Remember that bit in 'Wedding Crashers' where Owen Wilson chats up a bridesmaid by talking about the theory that humans only use ten percent of their brain power? Well that same idea is the basis for 'Lucy,' a sci fi action movie from veteran French director Luc Besson. Sadly the results are a bit more mixed than Wilson's pulling technique but it's entertaining enough to lose an evening with. Scarlett Johansson stars as the titular character, a young woman who gets tricked by a sleazy boyfriend into carrying out a one-off job for a Thailand crime syndicate that quickly goes wrong. Forced into becoming a drug mule, she soon gets a packet of an experimental new drug stitched into her stomach and forced to smuggle it into Paris. But then it starts leaking.With the drugs zapping around her bloodstream, Lucy discovers her powers expanding and sets off on a globe trotting mission of revenge and discovery. And for the first two thirds, it's a blast. Starting off like 'Taken' in the Far East, Lucy destroys every scumbag and low life in her way, casually gunning them down and pulling a bullet out of her shoulder without even blinking. She forces a terrified surgical team to operate on her at gunpoint, tortures a gang boss and as her mind expands, becomes a high powered super genius. Imagine if Black Widow were crossed with Liam Neeson and was powerful enough to wipe out the entire Marvel Universe with a wave of her hand and you'll get the idea.As the film reaches its final sprint though, 'Lucy' loses traction. Hooking up with Morgan Freeman's University Professor and trying to use her full potential to its best effect, the film turns into a weird mish--mash of overblown science fiction and Terrence Mallick overtones. Lucy gains the power to travel through time and across the cosmos while at the same time constructing a futuristic super computer with her mind, all without leaving a swivel chair in Freeman's lab. You'll spend ages waiting for the trippy images to stop and for Johansson to stand up and start punching gangsters through walls again, but it never happens. Instead, the climactic action scenes are left to the French Police Force, led by Amr Waked's 'in-over-his-head' Captain.It's a frustrating finish to a movie that starts off so well but credit where it's due, 'Lucy' at least attempts to be something more than a stereotypical action movie. Plus, Johansson is terrific and manages to make the character's transformation from petrified backpacker to unstoppable force of nature compulsively watchable. The 2001 aping finale, the Dinosaurs and the hint that Lucy might actually be God are too much, but at least it's not another 'Taken' rip off.",5,0,4,9 October 2016
The Truman Show," Cue the Sun
","Back in 1998, the concept of Jim Carrey appearing in a more serious movie than his usual fare was unthinkable. Surely, the man who gurned his way through Ace Ventura couldn't handle a thoughtful, well-written drama without the shadow of those tropical shirts, ridiculous catchphrases and ludicrous facial expressions looming all over it? Well, while the studio may not have thought so either (consider the marketing campaign which focused mainly on the comedy), the results speak for themselves and established the man as more than just a one-dimensional funny man.Carrey is Truman Burbank, a man with a seemingly great life who just can't shake the feeling something is wrong. His world seems so neat and organised, too perfect to possibly be real and when a camera mysteriously falls from the sky for no immediate reason, it kicks off a chain of events that lead to him questioning the authenticity of his very existence. For unbeknown to him, he is the star attraction of The Truman Show, a program all about his life within a sealed idealistic, Eisenhower era world of apple pie and sunshine and everyone around him is an actor. Every second of his life has been watched by millions.With a concept such as this, it is no surprise that the movie raises a lot of troubling issues. The philosophical nature for instance is not unlike that of The Matrix, in that it is difficult to sit through it without wondering if there are limits to the very world around us. Furthermore, the moral issue of reality TV rears its ugly head, asking us what price we pay when we glamorise the ordinary and make everyday people our entertainment? Sure, Truman has had a good life and is totally safe from harm, but how much of that life did he choose for himself? Carrey of course is a magnetic focal point. He was clearly keen to stretch his very capable acting muscles by this stage in his career, but that isn't to say his comic side has been totally abandoned. Just watch his attempted road trip to New Orleans for example, the man barking and ranting maniacally as he careens almost out of control through town in his car with his hysterical wife on the passenger seat trying to reel him in. It is a very funny moment in the film, but his actions here are brought about not by the inherent zaniness in his personality, but more by the growing frustration at his inability to get out of the town.However, the scene where he really comes into his own comes in the moments following his encounter with his supposedly dead father. Driving to work one morning, his radio malfunctions and after beating the thing with his fists like we've all done at some point, he suddenly picks up radio transmissions detailing his every move. He parks his car and wanders the street, trying to draw attention to himself but failing, even stopping a bus in the middle of the road to no reaction, the occupants simply waiting for him to get out the way. What if he really were the exact centre of the universe and everything else just revolved around him? That isn't to say this is a one man show however. Laura Linney as his wife Meryl is also well cast, her wholesome nature at first being very sweet, then growing ever more troubling as Carrey's paranoia escalates. Then of course there's Ed Harris as the eye in the sky directing his every move. At first, he is a benign guiding influence crafting a Utopian vision for his progeny. But then the child begins to resist the father and events spiral out of control, soon Harris has become a fascist dictator denying Truman the choices he so desperately needs to make himself.As a whole then, The Truman Show is a rewarding experience. It contains one of Carrey's finest dramatic turns to date and while we can revel in the philosophical and moral issues at work here, it can also be enjoyed simply as a very charming and uplifting movie. Come the climax, I doubt there'll be a dry eye in the house.",8,2,4,25 August 2005
300," The most macho film ever made
","Loads of people are talking about 300 right now. Having grossed over $70 million, it's already an instant smash and needless to say, I'm sure most of you good people reading this will have seen it already and made your minds up, so my review isn't going to sway your opinion one way or the other. For those who haven't captured it yet however, ignore all that talk about beautiful cinematography, crimson spattered violence and latent homo-eroticism, because what 300 more than any other film has done in the past decade or so, is play up a blood and thunder triumph as the most testosterone laden frenzy you will ever see.Yes folks, once upon a time the likes of Predator were considered tough guy movies revelling in their own machismo. Not any more. Now, thanks to Frank Miller, Zack Snyder, Gerard Butler and a bunch of buff and ripped Americans pretending to be Greeks, there is nothing more manly than 300. Not boxing, not fighting, not driving sports cars, not making love to a woman, just this. And thats all you really need to know. The likes of King Leonidas, Vincent Regan's Captain and David Wenham's Dilios are not so much characters as they are brute force driven to such an extent that it almost feels like a parody; they show no fear, slaughter their enemies with reckless abandon, long only for warrior's deaths and when crouching under their shields as a thousand arrows rain down from the heavens, they laugh with derision at their foe's pathetic humanity.As such, it would be easy to suggest that 300's audience will most likely be 14-28 year old males but in all honesty, its difficult to imagine anyone not liking this movie. The battle scenes are energetic crowd pleasing spectacles, even if Snyder overuses the slow motion a tad and with its pantheon of armoured beasts, mutant warriors with swords for fists and Persian elites who resemble the Uruk Hai more than men, the visual appeal cannot be underpinned. As these creatures suggest, 300 isn't the most historically accurate movie ever made but its certainly a lot more enjoyable to watch than the majority of historical epics I could name.In short then, a highly enjoyable piece of fiction that purists will be pleased to find mirrors the source material quite accurately. With its collection of oddball warriors, CGI blood and a soundtrack comprised of heavy metal guitar riffs, it may date badly and ten years from now be laughable, but right now its an absolute blast. Snyder may be a white, middle class geek with a camera, but having made this and the white-hot Dawn of the Dead remake, he sure knows how to deliver the goods on screen. And as for all that talk of homo-erotic subtexts, I fail to see what they're getting at. I mean, what could honestly be at all gay about 300 scantily clad men getting riled up and penetrating each other with the shiny heads of their elongated spears?",7,3,7,24 March 2007
Ran," A beautiful epic
","Given that Akira Kurosawa's sight had deteriorated so much by the time he made this movie, it's astonishing what a beautiful film Ran turned out to be. Filmed nigh on entirely in long shots, every single frame looks like a celebrated painter's masterpiece come to life, each one bursting with colour. From such examples as the hill top debate which begins the film, where 16th Century Japanese royalty sit in brightly coloured robes before the sweeping green mountains or the sight of colour-coordinated Samurai armies ransacking a fortress in a silent, apocalyptic battle, right up to the achingly sad final shot before the credits, every second of Ran is a beauty to behold. That isn't to say it's a film that'll concern only those interested in poetic visual statements however, because it is also one of the director's best works and a landmark moment in Eastern cinema.Basically an updating of Shakespeare's King Lear, the film sees the elderly Lord Hidetora Ichimonji deciding to hand over the reins of power to his three sons. His eldest, Taro, becomes the new Lord, while his younger sons Jiro and Saburo are each granted a province of their own to rule over. Saburo however protests, believing it to be a foolish decision that will split the clan and Hidetora banishes his third son. It isn't long however until Taro and Jiro's ambitions of power lead them to betray their father and the nation begins to fall apart, spurred on by Taro's manipulating wife lady Kaede.Kurosawa thus blends Shakespearean tragedy with a sweeping historical epic about the loss and gain of power. At the centre of it all is a remarkable acting presence in the shape of Tatsuya Nakadai as the displaced elderly Samurai. At the beginning of the film he is a man of stubborn pride, but as his world crumbles and his people die, he soon finds himself with nowhere else to go. The emotional turbulence of being betrayed by his own flesh and blood drives him to his limits, but nevertheless he still refuses to contact Saburo because his warrior principles will not allow him. As a man in his twilight years, lost in the world, there is definitely some element of Kurosawa himself up there on screen, the director having been near the end of his career with his health failing and his wife having tragically passed away during shooting. Hidetora isn't a perfect ruler but as evidence of his cruelty and oppression during his reign mount up, he remains a sympathetic character, questioning his past decisions and what exactly it is he has achieved in his lifetime. He is the pillar that holds the film together and no mistake.He is aided by some impressive performances all round. Daisuke Ryo's impetuous, outspoken but loyal Saburo is a highpoint of course even if his screen time is limited, spending the majority of the storyline in exile. Jinpachi Nezu's Jiro is another remarkable presence, equally proud and stubborn as his father but beset by insecurities and mistrust. The two that really standout however are Hisashi Igawa and Masayuki Yui as Jiro's General Kurogane and Saburo's Lieutenant Tango respectively. Kurogane is loyal soldier but he is a bit more complex than average because he knows that his master is a flawed and weak man, yet remains by his side to the bitter end. Tango on the other hand is an adviser who gets banished alongside Saburo, but who returns in the hour of need and goes through hell and high water to return his lord to safety.Sad to say though that not every character feels truly grounded in reality as Mieko Harada's Lady Kaede is the film's weak link (and the reason I'm not giving it a nine). Her performance is spot on as Kaede is a cold, calculating woman with vengeance on her mind at the best of times, but there are one or two moments in the script where the writing isn't particularly strong. During one pivotal scene towards the middle, she comes dangerously close to parody, verging from one dramatic emotional outburst to another, ranting, screaming and licking blood from a knife wound.Mercifully though, that is the only bad thing about this movie and fans of historical epics would do well to check it out. The battle scene that forms the centrepiece is absolutely breathtaking, with legions of Samurai warriors storming a castle in total silence. There are no sound effects, no speech, just the sad musical overture for the majority of the fighting, until a particularly important gun shot rings out and we are plunged right into the maelstrom. Bodies are filled with arrows, blood drips everywhere and hundreds of warriors are slaughtered in spectacular fashion. It may be a glorious sight to behold, but it is the closest thing a historical epic has got to showing that war is hell, no matter what period of human history it is set in.The more blood thirsty among us may then be disappointed by the second clash towards the end, a far more unremarkable skirmish that promised to be incredible after several scenes of armies manoeuvring in anticipation but even so, Ran is unquestionably a masterpiece. It gets into the heads of men who hold tremendous power and puts all their complexities and failings under a microscope for the world to see. Like a watercolour painting that moves, it is beautiful to watch time and time again.",8,1,3,12 July 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Not bad, but way too late
","There's an advert doing the rounds in the UK Odeon cinema chain at the moment proudly proclaiming 2007 to be the best summer of movies ever. Having seen it several times, I'm beginning to think I might be getting too cynical to go and see films anymore, because so far this year I have ho-hummed my way through Spiderman 3, sat befuddled through Pirates 3, smirked occasionally during Shrek 3 and failed to see what the fuss was with Transformers. And now, having seen the Simpsons movie, it pains me to say it but the best thing I can bring myself to say is that it's okay. It's not outlandishly brilliant, or a complete disaster. It's just average is all. Six stars out of ten which passes an hour and a half quite nicely but doesn't leave you craving the DVD release. But, at least it's better than the Family Guy movie.On the plus side, the kids are going to love it. The screening I attended was packed out with ankle biters and they laughed every second, but for the seasoned Simpsons fanatics there is a definite sense of slight disappointment. The jokes are funny and the characters are as charming as ever, but it doesn't quite make the big enough leap to qualify as anything other than an extended TV episode. Sure, the animation is better and the colours sharper, but it's hard to shake the impression that it's merely an overlong TV script, knocked out quickly on a Friday afternoon so as to meet a deadline.The obvious comparison points would be the South Park and Family Guy movies. The Family Guy one was a disaster - three episodes strung together with no funny jokes and an overwhelming air of self satisfaction. The South Park movie meanwhile was terrific - it took the formula that made the show so great and amplified it to every extreme. The Simpsons movie falls somewhere between the two; it's still a step up, but ever since the series got increasingly outlandish, having Homer and co embark on an epic adventure to save Springfield isn't quite so dramatic anymore. If this had come out around the time of the eighth or ninth seasons when the show (arguably) was at its peak, it would have felt more like the event it always should have been.What's more, there's Homer. Let's be honest about Homer Simpson for a minute here, he's not that great a character anymore is he? He's crass, self-centred, bigoted, stupid and has so many mood shifts he's teetering on the brink of having multiple personalities. And in this film he's a complete jerk who becomes increasingly difficult to cheer on the more the plot develops. The lovable but dim-witted buffoon of the early series is now gone, replaced by a lumbering imbecile that sings an unfunny song about Spiderpigs.Considering how beloved the Simpsons are however, none of what I'm saying ultimately matters. It's going to make millions and keep on making millions and while it is occasionally so funny I was in pain, it still feels like a let down, probably because it overdoses on slapstick and a large number of jokes might as well consist of Matt Groening shouting: 'Look everybody! Homer Simpson is an idiot!' It's okay, but sadly is just the latest average film in a summer that's overflowing with them. I really, really hope that The Bourne Ultimatum is incredible, or I'll have to give up on multiplex blockbusters and start going to independent cinemas, wear berets and take up chain smoking.",6,5,7,11 August 2007
V for Vendetta," And the frozen mask just smiles
","How do you go about adapting one of the greatest comic books in history without alienating the long time fans who've worshipped the pages it's printed on since day one? This is a question that has to have troubled Hollywood execs a lot given the number of comic-to-movie conversions in the past few years, but the pressure must have really been on for the Wachowskis when making V For Vendetta. The original graphic novel is an adult oriented title about a masked madman terrorising a futuristic fascist England written during the Thatcher era and as such is bristling with political vitriol and a twisty-turny plot packed with intricate detail, lovingly crafted with such passion it has become one of the industry's most hallowed titles. Thus, it is a tremendous relief to say that after the disaster of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the 'I can't believe this is based on the comic' misfire of From Hell that writer Alan Moore has finally had a work translated perfectly to the screen, even if he did insist on having his name removed from the credits.But then, V is a million miles away from the likes of The Punisher or Spiderman. The comic existed for one run only and had a very concise story to tell, rather than having numerous incarnations and interpretations of the same character, so the move from page to screen would be slightly easier to make as the boundaries are more clearly marked. However, if it had been an exact re-interpretation, the movie would have been about nine hours long, full of slow moving conversational scenes and rather painful to sit through (what makes a good comic does not always make a good film), but the end result is near perfect in its execution.The Wachowskis you see are not afraid to hold back the venom. Their futuristic England is a nightmarish dystopia that seems unbearably close as families gather round comfortable middle class homes to watch the latest propaganda spin, ministers spouting hate-fuelled rants about the evils of foreign nations, terrorists, free-thinkers and homosexuals in the name of safe-guarding the public. Kudos to them too for having the sheer audacity to continue making the film in the wake of the July 7th Tube bombings which has major resonations in the plot; the scenes of the enigmatic vigilante tearing London apart with explosives worryingly near to home.And yet, despite witnessing this lunatic blasting our capital to smouldering ruins, V is an electrifying focal point. His face is never shown and while his highly intelligent rants are always tinged with madness, he remains a captivating anti-hero. After all, can he really be considered an 'evil' terrorist when the regime he is fighting is corrupt, paranoid and willing to lie repeatedly merely to cover their own tracks? Yes, he murders his enemies, but as his story unfolds it's hard not to feel some sympathy for him.Not that V for Vendetta is all heavy-handed politics and debates on the blurring boundaries between hero and villain. While the likes of Munich and Syriana tackle the current world state with gritty realism, V for Vendetta is considerably more vaudevillian. One slow motion knife fight near the climax is jaw dropping and scenes like Natalie Portman's baptism in the torrent of rain plunging from the sky become increasingly melodramatic as the running time ticks by. But then, this is a film more likely to reach a mainstream audience than Syriana and the integration of damning cultural criticism and theatrics-ridden entertainment is expertly accomplished.Sure, quite a lot of the comic book is left out. The internal party rivalries are abandoned almost entirely, many of the supporting characters don't appear at all and the ending is slightly different, but the differences between the two mediums are not so great as to distance them entirely. And fans of the original wondering about the torture scenes need not fear, they are included in near identical shot-for-shot translation. This was an excellent film, tremendous entertainment and intelligent to boot; my friends and I lasted a mere four minutes after the end credits before having a political discussion. For now, Alan Moore can sleep safely.",9,0,3,18 March 2006
