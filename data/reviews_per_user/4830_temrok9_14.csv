The Lobster," Avoid at all cost!
","This is probably the worst movie I 've seen for years.I suppose I should support the film since I am Greek and Lanthimos is Greek too, but I'm afraid I 'm tired of this pretentious and meaningless cinema we are producing that gets its foreign distribution and recognition now.I thought that Dogtooth was a terrible movie too, but I was hoping that something might have changed with this one, especially as Colin Farrel-whom I like very much-was the lead actor;unfortunately, this is a dreadful movie, full of stupid dialogs, pretentious and pointless, stupid, and it asks to be taken for surreal or weird but Lanthimos is neither Bunuel nor Lynch.It even begs to be taken seriously as a symbolic comment on relations, which makes it seem even sillier. There are and there were great directors in Greece(Nikos Panagiotopoulos, Vasilis Vafeas and, most of all, Stavros Tornes, to name a few) but Lanthimos is not one of them ;he is a fake and I was angry I had to watch this trash of a movie. I'm still angry, so I wrote this review.",2,207,373,25 October 2015
Captain Phillips," Seasick
","I really can't understand what one can enjoy in this movie.It is almost unwatchable thanks to the constant movement of the camera that is supposed to take us into the very reality of the situation, and, if we want to be honest, this is a trick that directors use very often today to avoid the trouble of thinking how to shoot the plans and how to give pace to their movies through more skillful ways.To me the film was a pointless torture of my senses and I strongly recommend avoid at all cost!The plot is so predictable that you only wait for the things you know will happen to happen, and scene after scene the repetition is so annoying that the only reason I didn't leave the theater was that I was with some friends and we couldn't all agree to leave.And don't forget the message in the end!",2,37,87,16 November 2013
The Prestige," nonsense
","Rewatching The prestige on TV affirmed in the most definite way the impression I've formed regarding the cinema of Christopher Nolan:very ambitious but not having the faintest idea where it is heading.One should compare Nolan with Lynch(though I feel I'm getting blasphemous here) to understand how to tell the authentic and ingenious from the trivial and fake.Nolan comes again and again with ideas he believes are groundbreaking, and he finds his audience, I understand, but the whole concept of his movies is so pointless again and again (take Inception, The prestige, even the Batmans for examples), the final result incoherent for no reason at all(for there is incoherence that is meaningful, as Lynch and other great modern directors teach us), but for the reason of impressing the audience that buys the product the way they would eat up a blockbuster that is made following certain codes.To me it is a mystery how Nolan gets funding for these ridiculous scripts, and a greater mystery how he finally meets commercial success. But about this mystery I would like Lynch to make a movie, and definitely not Nolan himself.",2,1,5,19 July 2013
The Hateful Eight," Pointless, as always
","With so many reviews already, I guess there aren't many chances one will read this one;despite the fact I found many things in other reviews I agree with, I wanted to put down some thoughts of mine regarding the cinema of Tarantino.From my rating, it is obvious that I am not among those who loved the movie;yet, I think we should take into account what he does in a general context which may explain the reason he enjoys a cult status and has so many devoted fans.To begin with, the cinema of Tarantino reflects a certain personality(of himself), it is recognizable at once, the way one immediately recognizes a Woody Allen movie;even the actors speak in the same way, not to mention the things they say and the pose they take to say them. To me, the dialogues seem pointless very often;I do not believe that phrases, even in a movie, serve only as information vehicles, but I do believe that they must bare a certain load of meaning, so I find small talk(as in some praised Linklater movies), or pose-talk(as in Tarantino movies) boring. I admit that every movie of his has a certain charm, and this is also true about these Hateful Eight, but this charm is based mainly on the concept(the basic idea) and his very interesting mixing of actors, music and other film memories in his own way that is sick with verbalism and pointless violence.When I say pointless violence, I must stress the fact that I do not object to it morally, and that I like a lot of movies who go for the gore, even having fun with it , as Tarantino does, but somehow in his films(in this one, for instance)he seems to do it in an exhibitionist way, not serving the purpose of the film, but trying to show off, to convince everyone, including himself, that he is clever. This way, his movies retain the personality I mentioned but they never have any meaning at all.What I mean by the word meaning is not some great statement about life(we hear many such things during his movies)-since I declare myself a fan of b-movies- but a certain attitude towards life every piece of art(adventure movies too) holds.From time to time, there are glimpses of meaningfulness, but the general feeling is of the narcissistic enjoyment of a supposed meta-look. What is the purpose of the 70 mm, for example, in this movie, since there is no meaningful use of it(watch the movie of John Carpenter or Robert Altman to see what cinemascope means)?So, was it fun?to me, so and so;sometimes I got bored, sometimes a little engaged. I guess others found it more suitable to their taste(and that is in no way objectable).Tarantino has a certain place in the contemporary cinema, and this movie is no stranger to this place.Every time I say to myself I won't watch his next movie, but every time I do.",6,3,17,9 January 2016
Interstellar," Glory!
","With so many enthusiastic reviews, I thought I might not have to add one more, but I felt I owe it, in a way, to Nolan,as I have been very harsh with his movies up till now, considering Inception and Prestige almost silly and the Batman trilogy average but not great at all.Well, in Interstellar, which I went to see fearing the worst(clichés of sentimentalism and incoherent-in a bad way-plot), I was very pleasantly surprised.From the beginning, I found I was very fond of the way the film was shot, and in the long run I watched with undiminished attention, feeling that I was sorry the film was going to end at some point. I do not care if at some moments some scenes were not as convincing or as spectacular as they might have been, because I really was inside the movie all the time, a movie that gives back to science fiction cinema the glory it deserves.I even found some comments of critics-especially here in Greece-that were suggesting that the movie becomes melodramatic and weak as it unfolds, as untrue, although I would be the first to condemn such characteristics in a movie-and I was afraid Nolan would easily succumb to them.Instead, I felt deeply moved by the connection between the cosmic and the personal Nolan offers, in a screenplay that, at last, shines, not with cleverness, but with true wisdom, a perfect incorporation of astrophysics theory(that could again get easily ridiculous,if not properly handled) and even glimpses of humor.An epic that deserves its place in film history as an absolute winner!",9,1,8,11 November 2014
Man of Steel," A fiasco
","I don't know why I had expectations about this movie as I 'm not fan of any of Snyder's movies, yet maybe because he tries to be different than the average professionals that deliver us the Marvel projects-others good, others so and so, others bad-I keep an eye on him, waiting for something good to come.Unfortunately, this Man of steel is, in my opinion, his worst movie up till now(I suspect Nolan, whose concepts I find silly, gave a hand here). So we get started with some nice differentiation of the plot we used to know, set in the planet Crypton, which is OK, and even made me think that Snyder could be a good candidate for the upcoming new Star Wars series.Then our future Man of steel lands on earth-at least that happened at some time-and we have to deal with a script that thinks it gives the kiss of life to the myth of Superman, when it is almost incomprehensible(if you want to track down some logic), serious- like(this is different from serious),and totally silly.The lines of the actors make no sense, the plot doesn't really stick together, and there are only meaningless scenes in succession that bored me to death.What's more, the actor who plays Man of steel is presented(I think the movie has a bad effect to all the actors but he is the worst of all)as a muscle man with elementary expressions(that, unfortunately, are not explained by his extra-terrestrial background), and for anything that happens to him we-at least I- couldn't care less;at some point, early enough, Snyder thinks he's making modern cinema, when he mixes scenes from different times of the story line, reminding us of,say, Roeg's- who's that?-playing with time, only he does it so clumsily and with such bad taste-and ever slightly unstable camera to stress the tension, as it is the trend the last decades(aren' t they fed up yet with that overused effect?)-that only harms the final result. I know that there are people who liked the movie and, of course, there is no objection to that(movies are made to find their audience, anyway), but I cannot omit to conclude that very often these days I go back to the renovations directors like Carpenter or Cassavetes(although I am not particular fan of him) or Altman or De Palma or Romero and others brought to cinema in the 70s , things that made me enthusiastic about cinema and today they have degenerated to a pointless seeking of speed and reality impression, whereas back then they were the stuff of dreams.That's why I think that Snyder and Nolan are bad directors and for their visions-as they seem to have some-I have no interest at all!",2,2,7,9 June 2014
The Revenant," Into the wild
","This was the most anticipated movie of the year for me, for several reasons.Truth is it starts impressively, for almost half an hour, maybe more, it stands as a unique cinematic experience, an immersion in an almost savage stage, brilliantly directed, where the characters seem more parts of the situation than people who are good or bad. On the way, as the plot unravels, however, you get a feeling of repetition, plus a tendency to leave a message(about the Indians and the white invaders of their land), which comes a little unconvincing(Dancing with the wolves was more convincing in such an attitude).Worst of all, the plot left me indifferent.I didn't care at all about Di Caprio's pursuit, and I even found Fitzerald(maybe because he was Hardy, but not only for this reason) a more interesting character, and a more savage one, but not at all the bad guy the movie finds at the end to be its convenient scapegoat. Not a wise finale for such an ambitious film that might have been the best Nature movie ever.But as the value of a film lies not only in the production virtues, or even in the virtuosic direction, but in its general attitude, the Revenant lacks, in my opinion, the greatness of a Hertzog film(with whose films has a certain affinity).In fact, after Birdman, I expected more from Inaritou.He has evolved as a director(he is very impressive)from the times of 21 grams and Babel, but he still has to avoid the simplicity of the supposed messages he wishes to convey. Unfortunately, the Revenant turned to be, for me, a dramatically uneven movie, and the pace was somehow lost in the way.Yet, there is some greatness in part of it;maybe my ambivalence clears out with a second look.",8,1,2,24 January 2016
Warrior," Angry
","It is not that Warrior is not a good film;in fact, from a point on it grabs you in continuous commitment with your heart pumping fast and helplessly.The truth is that at the start it looks like it wants to be something more than another fighting movie, with the roles of Nolte and Hardy, and the reading of Mobby Dick, some kind of elegy.And it could succeed at it, as the Hardy character-in one of Hardy's best performances-is built masterfully;yet, the other characters of the film gradually become banal, and whats worst-please do not read further if you have not seen the movie-at the end there is the most conservative choice one could imagine, as the winner is the family man who fights in order to pay for the home of his family, whereas the heroic-and anti heroic-veteran, looses everything.One could argue that the end is about reconciliation and the return to the unity of the family;in my opinion, it is a total fiasco that let me down and made me really angry. There should be some other way to discourage violence without letting down the most interesting character of the movie.His defeat is the failure of the film to be anything more than a family fighting movie to watch at home.Yet, for Hardy alone, I would very much like to watch it again.",7,15,23,10 September 2015
Lincoln," the great masters
","Back in the seventies and eighties I admired Spielberg for Jaws and The raiders of the lost arc, which were among my favorite movies of their time, and I must admit I even now consider them classics. But when I had to choose I would always prefer Carpenter to Spielberg, as much of his cinema suffered, in my opinion, from melodramatic tones I used to consider unwanted (and I still do).In the passage of time, Spielberg moved on, showing his expertise as a director in movies like Schindler's list and, especially, Munich(maybe his best film), but it was only with the last Indiana Jones that he entered my pantheon of most beloved directors.From that point on I experienced his series of movies(Tintin, War horse and now Lincoln)as pieces of pure art, in the way we talk of art when we refer to great painters.In my opinion, Lincoln wasn't simply worth all Oscars;it deserved to be out of competition, as its director has moved to a sphere of his own, there with the great masters.The movie glows from beginning to end with perfection and makes us happy and proud to be human if such an accomplishment can one of us achieve.",9,1,4,17 March 2013
Elysium," Where have all the good times gone?
","I'm so terribly sorry-or should I say angry?-to go to watch a supposed sci-fi or whatever movie and end up with this!Why? Because it cries out:I have a meaning to deliver.Because it does so in the most simplistic possible way and doesn't even care for some script plausibility that seems rather too much to ask for(many great movies of the genre lack seriousness in the plot and the dialogues but they turn this weakness into appeal).Because it thinks it is clever when it is melodramatic and silly, boring, and follows the rules of blockbustering with no visual charm(apart from the city-from-above-pictures) and with no directional authenticity(I 'm sick of watching movies directed in exactly the same way).I wonder why the director has chosen this genre(it's his second movie,as far as I know), instead of being honest about it and go for the Ken Loach themes.Anyway, to wipe out the effects of the film, I went home and watched on DVD Mad Max II, which I had seen many years ago. That was real cinema, folks:subtle, genuine, poetic.An adventure to fire your heart.Where are movies like this these days? Really!Where have all the good times gone?",2,2,7,25 August 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," marvelous
","This is a movie that feels different from the start, and that's relieving among the various blockbusters that recycle the same images and themes.I'm glad that, according to the reviews I'm reading and the general score, it gets the appreciation it deserves(which means there is enough good taste left).I have to admit that I admire Cruise's choices, so much that I often go to see his movies having trust in his choices(although, of course, there are occasional disappointments, such as last year's Oblivion).But usually he scores high(Jack Reacher, Mission Impossible, and, of course, Eyes wide shut).Edge of tomorrow is an excellent movie that can be seen as a sci-fi action comedy, with wit and playful character, that is pure joy to watch from beginning to end.I also liked Godzila for the visual style and the respect to the original Japanese monster, and Captain America was fine as an action movie (I cannot say the same for Spider man, whereas X-men seemed to me satisfactory enough), but I think that the real winner of the contest-if there ever was one-is Edge of tomorrow, a movie that also reminded me of the cinema of Verhoeven(Starship troopers and Total recall).I only give eight stars because this is my limit for any movie that doesn't go deep down to my heart or my mind;and I think that what we have here lacks the ambition to be something more, something to stay in the mind(although after leaving the theater I was a little taken away by the film's concept and images).Time will show if it will get a cult status or stay just as a nice memory.As the memory is recent I vote for the former",8,1,3,10 June 2014
Inception," Dear god!
","I tried to watch Inception again on the TV one day, to give the movie a second chance, mainly since I lately discovered Tom Hardy and I wanted to see him in there.Tom Hardy was-as usual-a delight to watch, but unfortunately he was the only one not to be ridiculed by the stupid dialogues of this movie.I know Inception has many many fans, but I can' t really understand why.I suppose that many will tell me I did not understand the movie. I do not think I have such problems, especially with movies so naive and pretentious such as this total fiasco that instead of passing for masterpiece in film history should find its place in the panorama of biggest failures in film history, together with much more valuable movies that went overlooked.The way Nolan-who must take himself for a genius-heads for the dream world is superfluous, nonpoetic, mechanistic, and incoherent(he jumps from one idea to another leaving them all in suspense and we are supposed to buy that this reflects the nature of the plot).Perhaps his original idea was an interesting one but he needed a scriptwriter to make something of it.He preferred to do it all by himself, filling the story with clichés and dialogues so stupid that they are unbearable to watch and listen to.There is no philosophical background, only a pretentious plot that is supposed to mean something, and most of all it is aiming at impressing the audience, and in that it succeeded perfectly.I consider it a blasphemy to put Inception next to 2001 or Blade runner;instead I would suggest a comparison with David Cronenberg's Existenz;it's not Cronenberg's best film but it gives Nolan a lesson what messing with another reality means.Finally, I understand that these views I expose here are about to be the target of attack by many devoted fans.I can not but accept this position.PS. I am heading for Intersterlar one of these days, I never learn;I already read people are in love with this movie too.I hope I fall in love too, but I have great reservations as I do not trust the director at all!I'll be back, however, with another review, since I've decided to fight for what I consider right these days(and to support great films I still have the pleasure to watch,like- very recently- the Judge and the Drop)",3,2,2,8 November 2014
Her," bored to death
","What people may find in this movie I can not understand;you experience endless closeups of Mr. Phoenix talking with his supposed OS, and saying things so banal and so boring that you want to just close your eyes or , even better, leave the theater.I suppose it was meant to be clever, sentimental, atmospheric, beautiful, but I found it unbearable.I really wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad with all the prizes and the reviews it receives, and the director whom I never considered great but promising yes.It just makes me wonder how people liked the film.I'm not raging against it;it was just an experience I would very much like to have avoided.",1,125,243,8 February 2014
The Martian," The Big Other
","At first look, I dismissed The Martian as a boring, repetitive,and overfilled with blah blah and clichés film that could be classified as average the most.At second thought-and view-I discovered that there was a certain logic, and a certain attitude and pace underneath the surface of the movie, a certain way of becoming entertaining in its own way. After reading the book, I return with some remarks regarding what I consider The Martian to be.I believe that the adaptation on the screen is a very faithful one, and despite the arguments about not being explicit enough(or at all) regarding the solutions the main character finds out to the problems he encounters, I think that it captures the essence of the book perfectly. Yet I have to add that in my opinion this essence is not survival, or even science(these are obvious themes, and, of course, targets of the story), but rather Communication, and, as Jacques Lacan would put it, Communication is always a matter of speaking with the Big Other.So, what I first thought of as repetitive-the continuous talking of Mark-turns out to be a means of showing(not necessarily on purpose)the mechanisms of language and the nature of being human. The whole movie and the whole book are a series of distant communications-Mark's discourse at the centre of them-and the main invention of the writer-putting Mark in the place of an evertalking subject-is a brilliant one that does not only enable a narration that would otherwise be impossible(all these actions and events while alone on Mars), but also stresses the need to be tuned to Someone(from the point of view of Mark, it is his need not to feel alone;from our point of view it is the need to be his constant listeners, his others).Being human is being translated through the Big Other, one could say, and that's what the movie and book show, using technology as the mirror through which this translation occurs. So, despite the simplicity of the look-sorry, this is no match to 2001-there is some complex form here that works well, becomes more obvious in the movie, is more powerful in the book, and is perfectly stressed in the ending of the film, when the whole crew of the mission-and the film-are on stage, one by one:the actors in a joyful play that's called Life.There's a starman up there indeed!",8,2,5,2 November 2015
