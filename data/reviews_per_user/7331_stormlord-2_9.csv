Alien 3," Gets Better With Time
","Actually Alien 3 gets better with time. I recently re-watched the film and I have to admit that I quite enjoyed it. This movie is very creepy and atmospheric, and looks quite beautiful in many places.. OK the story was pretty lame but the story originally done by Vincent Ward had been gutted and only a shadow remained of the original concept. It's not a perfect film by any means, they killed off Hicks in the first 2 minutes (my favorite character from Aliens)and overall the story and character development is very weak. Non the less give it another try. I hated Alien 3 when it first came out, however this film grows on you with time. A worthy addition to the Alien franchise, heck it looks like Godfather pt 1 compared to AVPR.",6,2,50,22 December 2008
Cloverfield," Better Than Expected
","I must admit that I went to see Cloverfield not expecting to much. The old American city gets trashed has been done quite a lot over the last few years.However I was happily surprised to find myself quite riveted to the screen as events unfolded. However let me say this, Cloverfield has not one shred of originality in it. The old 'Monster attacks city' has been done countless times in the old Japaneses Godzilla films, and the hand held camera work is a direct rip off of Blair Witch. Non the less the story was very intense, the effects very good with even the CGI monsters looking very real, and all the young actors turned in solid performances. Cloverfield may not be original in any sense of the word but it is a very well made movie from a familiar style of film.6 out of 10",6,3,6,5 February 2008
The Village," A Letdown
","**Spoilers**I had to admit that the trailers sucked me in. Being a big fan of Unbreakable and Signs I was very keen to see the Village. On the whole I enjoyed the movie, it was well crafted and all the actors gave great performances. I guess that I felt let down with the fact that the monsters 'the ones of who we never speak' don't actually exist, they are just a huge con- job created by the village elders to stop the other villagers pushing the boundary of their world. And since the movie was sold on the sole fact of a monster that never even existed in the first place spoiled a otherwise excellent film.",6,0,0,23 September 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Not Bad At All
","Actually I think that AVP is not a bad attempt at such a film. The characters while unremarkable are fleshed out pretty well in most cases. The trouble of course is that there are to many people in this film. The reason Alien worked so well is because there were only 7 people in the whole film and as such you could spend some time on them. When you have large number of people running around and getting killed it's impossible to feel anything for them.Anyway on the whole this film was OK, not great but OK. The visuals were good with the Aliens and Predators looking as mean as ever, the pyramid was dark and atmospheric and the introduction of Lance Hendrecson as Weyland certainly gave the film a great deal of credibility. I have just come back from watching AVPR and believe me this film is a masterpiece compared to the latest attempt to continue this shrinking franchise.6 out of 10",6,1,2,11 January 2008
I Am Legend," Fantastic
","I went into I Am Legend expecting to like this film. Being a big fan of the 70's version with Charlton Heston The Omega Man I was hoping that this version would hold up as well. I wasn't disappointed. Will Smith does a fantastic job of portraying a man trying to survive in a world gone mad. His performance is even grander when you consider that he has to carry almost the entire film single handed. Almost 90% of this movie is with Smith on his own with no one to talk to but his dog. OK the zombies looked a bit CGI but CGI creatures never look as real as solid creatures, and OK the ending is a little soppy, a bit like the ending of Blade Runner but overall this is one great film. The scene where Smith has to put his dog down, his only friend left in the world after she is infected with the virus is truly heartbreaking. It;s good to see that Hollywood can still produce fine films when it puts it's mind to it.I am Legend, 9 out of 10.",9,1,4,5 January 2008
Transformers," Boy Was This Film Bad
","This review contains spoilers.I have to admit, I should have not expected anything more. This film is based on a kids show all about giant robots that turn into cars. However I went along hoping to be surprised by something new....I wasn't. The first 15 minutes is quite good with the attack on the air base and the soldiers and Pentagon trying to figure out what these hostile robots are all about.However things go all downhill from there. The final 2 plus hours boil down into geeky boy trying to get laid by impressing tarty girl (who is obviously in the film far more for her look than her acting ability) getting caught up in some robot war simply because his great grandfather accidentally discovered one of these things in the antarctic ages ago.Toss in a few fed guys who don't know who's side they are on, a few soldiers who are always in the wrong place at the wrong time, and of course the cute geeky computer nerd girl and a fat black guy for comic relief and you have one hell of a rotten film.The cgi was OK but to be honest since the last hour of the film is all shot at break neck speed and very close to the action I coudn't tell the bad bots from the good ones. Anyway after a very looooong battle sequence the goodies win for no particular reason, the geeky guy gets the tarty girl and all the others simply vanish never to be seen again.A great film if you are 15 with raging hormones and only think about hot cars and girls, otherwise don't bother.",3,7,14,24 July 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Why Did They Bother???.
","That was the question I continually asked myself while sitting through this film. I'm not a huge fan of remakes, especially remakes of films that were very good the first time around. Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory made in 1971 is a classic film of it's time. Gene Wilder led a great cast in a movie that continues to be very enjoyable up to the present day.Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this movie as a remake, I just found the whole thing totally unnessisary. This film pretty much follows the original down the line and adds nothing more to the story. Depp is a creepy and unlikable Wonka as opposed to the quirky one played by Wilder and the all to predictable CGI fest drowns you with special effects instead of trying to create a new and interesting story.Much like Burtons horrid remake of the classic Charlton Heston film Planet Of The Apes i came away after watching this movie with only one thought, 'Whay Did They Bother'?",4,4,7,30 January 2009
Into the Wild," A Difficult Lesson
","While I have to admit enjoying the film as an adventure tail on the whole I found the main character of McCandless totally unlikable. Despite the directors best efforts to portray him as some kind of charming rogue or anti hero. This guy is perhaps the most selfish individual I have seen on film in a long while. He basically walks out on his parents including his sister who loved him to death, he also turns his back on everyone who is kind to him in the film so he can live like a bum for a couple of years and die of starvation in the Alaskan wilderness due to lack of preparation. And some how we are supposed to think this guy is some kind of hero?No, I'm sorry, I have no sympathy for this kid at all. It's a great tale of adventure and exploration, but a very poor tail of forgiveness and understanding of the mistakes made by others. This brat thought he was better than society, than the rest of Humanity, and it cost him his life because in the state of nature Humans are very small insignificant things. Without our technology, without our culture and working together we are at the total mercy of nature. Humans can survive in nature, but we will never thrive in it. Also I love how this guy despises society, yet is more than happy to use society's tools to help him survive. Guns, knives, oil lamps, and blankets are not a natural state of the environment last time I checked. Watch this film if you like a good yarn about exploring the world, but don't try to emulate this unfortunate fellow, or the unforgiving wilderness will claim another victim.",5,3,7,9 July 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard or 007
","I have to admit I am a big fan of this series, well the first 2 at least. However the latest installment of John McCaine saves the world is a bit to much even for me. This guy puts James Bond to shame with the death defying feats and body count he accumulates. The trouble is of course that is not what made the first film such a classic.Bruce Willis plays his character as well as always but in truth the first die hard was about an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. By sheer force of will, luck and guts he gets through the ordeal, just. However watching Willi's character in this film you felt you were watching a superhero who regardless of the impossible odds placed against him would emerge with a cocky one liner and save the day without a problem. For me that is not what this movie should be about, if I wanted James Bond I would watch the dozens of 007 films.",5,2,4,12 August 2007
