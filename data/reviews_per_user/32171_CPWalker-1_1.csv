The King's Speech," A real snoozer!
","Are you all serious?! If you're suffering from insomnia, this is the movie for you.The entire movie could have been done in 15 minutes--instead we treated to a more than 2 hours of the same thing--over and over. Each scene is 'ground-hog' day until the end.It's one of those movies that you feel you must say it's good just because it's the 'Best Picture'--you'll look foolish if you say it's awful.Well, I'll bet if you gave each person that rated this movie a 10 sodium-pentothal, they would tell you the truth--it's BORING with a capital 'B' and that rhymes with 'D'--for Dismal!",3,9,22,25 April 2011
