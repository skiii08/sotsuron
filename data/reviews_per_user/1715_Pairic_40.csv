Blade Runner 2049," Flying Cars Are Here!
","Blade Runner 2049: Flying cars, lots of flying cars. Flying in formation; crashing through windows; crash-landing after being shot with an Emp enabled harpoon; involved in dogfights; sinking in the sea; providing an arena for fights to the death. Yes! The Flying Cars are here! If anything we have an even darker, gloomier setting for this sequel. There are snowstorms in LA, there are sandstorms. Traditional farming has largely collapsed, replaced by Synthetic Farms introduced by the Great Saviour Nilander Wallace (Jared Leto) who has also acquired the remains of Tyrell Corporation.The film opens with Blade Runner K (Ryan Gosling) tracking down a replicant on a farm, a Nexus 8 model which has an open ended life span. The replicant has been hiding out there for 30 years. As he terminates the farmer we learn that K is himself a replicant. A new, obedient model which is subjected to regular loyalty tests. K faces prejudice from other police officers, at home he has a holographic wife, Joi (Ana de Armas). He also encounters a pleasure replicant, Mariette (MacKenzie Davis).The remains of another long dead replicant are located on the farm and they point to a biological mystery which causes K's boss (Robin Wright) to send him on a quest. This will takes him from LA to a largely abandoned and ruinous San Diego and from there to a radioactive Las Vegas where her encounters Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) and engages in a fistfight with him as holograms of Elvis and Liberace perform in the background. But Wallace's killer replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is on a similar quest.An SF thriller which lives up to the magic of the original but leaves some question tantalisingly unanswered. 9/10.",9,3,8,7 August 2018
First Man," Great Human Story
","First Man: Death is ever present, other astronauts, test pilots even Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling)himself faces it several times. But perhaps the most important death is that of Armstrong's daughter Karen, he hasn't grieved properly at his and his families loss, doesn't talk about her. But she is always present in his mind. This affects his relationship with his wife Janet (Claire Foy), son Rick and the other astronauts. The frail human Armstrong is revealed as well ad the test pilot, engineer and astronaut. The toll on his family and the families of other astronauts is also explored. While it is very much a film about Armstrong, the fact that it was an effort involving thousand of people is acknowledged.Opening in 1961, Armstrong goes to 140,000 feet in an X-15 jet, but bounces off the atmosphere on re-entry and barely regains control. Another two astronauts die in a plane crash. There are problems with Armstrong's Gemini mission and contact is lost for a time. This incident causes Janet to forcefully confront NASA officials about how the astronaut's families are denied information. Three more astronauts are killed in the Apollo One fire and Armstrong is injured testing a mock up of the lunar landing module. Janet confronts neil and demands that he talk to their sons about the possibility that he might not return from the moon mission.We are also constantly reminded of the lack of computers which we take for granted. Astronauts have to make their own calculations at the last moment, their lives depended on it. A great story about a voyage beyond the sunset and it's effects on human lives. 8/10.",8,0,1,21 October 2018
Hereditary," A New Paradigm In Horror
","Hereditary: Tolstoy wrote: 'Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.' In this film each member of the Graham family is unhappy in their own way. Annie (Toni Collette), the mother, grieves for her own recently deceased mother. But she was estranged from that difficult, domineering woman for years only reconciling towards the end. Her father starved himself to death, her brother committed committed suicide. All of that trauma seems to have driven Annie over the edge. Charlie (Milly Shapiro), the daughter, is unhappy in herself, gorges on chocolate, sketches continuously, cuts the heads off dead birds, sleeps in a treehouse. Peter (Alex Wolff), the son, is a pothead, he feels unloved by his mother, as the film unfolds he develops a crippling guilt over an accident he feels responsible for. Steve (Gabriel Byrne), the paterfamilias, has a countenance as dour and world weary as we've come to expect from Stephen Rea. He carries out the mundane tasks of cooking and trying to keep the family together. A counterpoint to the craziness of Annie.One of the most shocking scenes in the film has no explicit supernatural cause but it left me gasping. There are plenty of shocks provoked by strange entities though and none of seem forced. Spirits possess Seance participants, messages are written on chalkboards by invisible hands. Murderous spirits are summoned up. Levitation and Spontaneous Human Combustion All of this is somehow related to secrets kept by Annie's deceased mother.Annie builds dolls house's, meticulously detailed, she is even working on a model of the hospice where her mother died. This is used by director Ari Aster to frame many shots as the action moves seamlessly from model to the real house and back again. The Graham's residence has the appearance of a dolls house, the furniture layout, shots along corridors. While Aster is at the helm and delivers a witty but scare inducing screenplay, cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski, editing by Lucian Johnston and Jennifer Lame, production design by Grace Yun and set decoration by Brian Lives all contribute to success of this unique Horror Film. I see elements of A Dark Song, Kill List, The Exorcist and even Rosemary's Baby but this is very much it's own film. Pacing is perfect. A new paradigm in Horror. 9.5/10.",10,25,51,16 June 2018
Rocketman," Good Musical Biopic
","Rocketman: A musical biopic in the form of a Musical! And a fantasy musical at that. Elton John enters an AA meeting clad in an orange devil suit, confessing to alcoholism, being a cokehead, addicted to prescription drugs, bulimia, shopaholic, sex-addiction. His six tear old self appears in the room and everyone goes singing and dancing back to the 1950s. The AA room is used as a framing device for flashbacks. This being a musical anyone can burst into song and start dancing. An Elvis quiffed 12 year old Elton plays Saturday Nights All Right For Fighting, naturally fights break out and the segues into a 20 year old Elton at a fairground. Other great numbers are Crocodile Rock where Elton and the audience levitate and Rocketman, underwater and with him on a stretcher. Pretty good musical and it's warts and all about John's excesses at just about everything. Taron Egerton as Elton, Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin, good acting, directed by Dexter Fletcher. 8/10.",8,2,6,28 May 2019
Train to Busan," Zombie Fun With Social Commentary
","Train To Busan: It got a mediocre review in FT magazine, 5/10. From the opening scenes of a cynical farmer who is told of a minor leak from a Bio-Research Laboratory this film scored high imho. The farmer runs over a deer and after he leaves it comes back to life! He's beHind you!Most of the story takes place on the eponymous train. A Bond Trader is taking his young daughter to his estranged wife in Busan when the Zombie outbreak occurs. These are fast zombies who bite and chomp and swiftly turn their victims into the undead. A School Baseball team use their bats to good effect. Some social commentary as well which would be worthy of Ken Loach but its not laid on with a trowel.The Zombie action works well and we mostly encounter fresh Zombies as they haven't had time to deteriorate. They run, they swarm. Nothing original but its used to good effect as is the character development of the (still) human characters. 8/10",8,2,3,14 July 2019
Captain Marvel," The MCU has expanded
","Captain Marvel: Goose the cat is all important to this film as he adopts Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in 1995. Vers (Brie Larson) is an elite Alien soldier, a member of Starforce, on Hala she trains with her commander, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) as she prepares for a mission. She and the rest of the team are ambushed and she is taken captive for interrogation by enemy shape-shifting Aliens. Escaping she lands on Earth (1n 1995) where she links up with Fury in a search for the Holy Grail of power sources as the planet becomes a battleground for two competing Alien races. But Vers also has memories of a time when she was a USAF pilot, Captain Carol Danvers. We also learn how NIck lost his eye.The planet Hala is brilliantly imagined, a brighter Los Angeles from Blade Runner, advanced by centuries of development. The flying vehicles and spaceships convince as do the armour/suits of Starforce, they transform into aquanautic outfits as Vers and her SEAL Team plunge into the sea as they head towards their target. The fights are well choreographed but perhaps go on too long on occasion. Brie emerges as a new Superhero as she learns how to tap into her inner resources, powers she gained through an explosion rather than a bite from a radioactive insect. Some real comedy as the shape-shifting Aliens morph into surfers as they emerge from the ocean on Earth. Vers causes consternation on a train as she punches an old lady who is in fact an alien.The storyline remains coherent and the effects are consistently powerful and convincing (especially in IMAX 3D). Directors (and co-writers) Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have delivered a worthy addition to the MCU. 8.5/10.",9,4,11,11 March 2019
Us," An original Tale Of Existential Terror
","Us: A family comes under attack from doppelgangers who intend to kill and replace them. You may think you know a lot about this film from the trailers but you don't. There is so much more to this film than than one family being under siege. While Us might lack the very obvious social commentary and irony of Get Out it does deal with the fear of The Other and how some people literally live an underground existence.1986, Santa Cruz Beach, the Fun Fair, eight year old Adelaide wanders off from her parents and encounters her double in a Hall of Mirrors, this leaves her traumatised. 2018, Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o), her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex) return to her family home in Santa Cruz for a holiday. Things soon get weird with four figures, a family, appearing in their drive. When Gabe attempts to confront them, the two strange children lope off to the sides, almost like rabbits, the male approaches Gabe and the attack commences.The doppelganger family can't seem to speak properly, they communicate in the open by whistling and through animal-like howls. Each of them carries a large pair of scissors which they use to stab people. Even the children are murderous, killing whoever gets in their way. All prove very difficult to kill. When the Wilson's neighbours house comes under attack from their own doppelgangers it becomes clear that this is a wider problem.After this the film literally goes down the rabbit hole, we are dealing not just with existential terror and a killer cult but something far stranger. A horror story straight out of an unexpurgated fairy tale. Jordan Peele has written and directed this alarming tale which will have you mulling over it's meaning long after the final credits roll. 9/10.",9,4,7,28 March 2019
Aquaman," Great Effects & Action But a Bit Overlong.
","Aquaman: The Aquaman I knew and loved when I was a comic reading kid had short hair, was clean shaven and wore spandex. Now we have a hydro-hippie who looks like a young, well fed, Willie nelson. This is a good film but is overlong and contains some terrible dialogue. The general acting and effects make up for this though.The wonderful undersea city of Atlantis could be a submerged L.A. from Blade Runner as mini-subs ape the actions of flying-cars. There are Merpeople, Lobster lads and lassies, even creatures from the Trench who resemble Giger's Alien. These are regressed tribes of Atlantis who exist alongside the Human tribes. We see the fall of Atlantis in thew distant past when man's hubris brought about it's destruction. Striking back at te surface-dwellers the Atlanteans send tsunamis crashing ashore, wrecking naval ships and returning decades of pollution to the land.Aquaman wants to prevent war between the occupants of the land and the denizens of the depth, but to do this the half-blood prince will have to claim the throne of Atlantis. Meanwhile he's managed to annoy a pirate who pursues a blood vendetta against him. All good fun if a tad drawn out. 7/10.",7,2,3,3 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Gags both verbal and visual abound. Good fun
","Deadpool 2: Full of jokes, visual gags foul language and extreme violence (which is a bit tongue in cheek). Deadpool/Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) tries to commit suicide after his wife Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) is killed by an enemy but Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) puts him back together again. Dopinder (Karan Soni) is also back as Deadpool's reliable driver and wannabe superhero, he longs to be Kirsten Dunst to Wade's Tom Cruise.The Cyborg Cable (Josh Brolin) arrives from the future, intent on killing the young mutant Firefist (Julian Dennison). Deadpool gets a new mutant group together: The X Force! Best of which is Domino (Zazie Beetz) who is very lucky. 
Megasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) returns, still with lots of attitude and a new girlfriend: Yukio, another X-Men trainee.Deadpool is blown to pieces, cut in half, sent to a mutant prison, pursued by evil mutants and Cable. Brolin is quite funny with his Terminator take off but being half-human is pragmatic enough to compromise when needed. Some great car/prison truck chase scenes, a mutant rison high in the Rockies and an orphanage for mutant children run by a sadistic headmaster (Eddie Sarsan). Some of the action takes place in Professor Xavier's School for Mutants where the gags both verbal and visual abound. Good fun. 8/10",8,2,6,26 May 2018
Ready Player One," A credible Science Fiction Epic,
","Ready Player One: It opens with a washed out filter scene of stacked mobile homes and portacabins. 18 year old wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) descends by rope from his aunt's home, passing many people in VR goggles gaming away. This is a society without hope, pollution, climate change and economic crashes have produced a dystopian world. Wade's parents died in the aftermath of a cataclysmic cyber event when many systems failed.The only escape is through the online VR world, OASIS. Within that universe there is a game Anorak's Quest, invented by the late creator of OASIS, James Halliday. The goal is to find three keys and thereby win the 'Easter Egg' which will earn the winner half a trillion dollars and full ownership of OASIS. Wadeis Parzival in the game and has friends and fellow competitors such as Samantha/Art3mis (Olivia Cook) and Helen/Aech (Lena Walthe). But there is also Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), the CEO of Innovative Online Industries, who seeks full control over the OASIS. IOI is a video game conglomerate and manufactures most of the VR equipment used to access the OASIS. Sorrento has amassed an army of debt-indentured gamers to seek the keys.Similar to Blade Runner in some aspects, run-down cities, economic/environmental collapse but differing in an absence of androids and most of the action occurring in VR. There are many cultural references, ranging from the gamers having to fight King Kong and Jurassic Park style dinosaurs to the Iron Giant battling Mechagodzilla.There is also a game sequence set in The Shining where , Aech encounters the Twins and is drenched by the blood filled lift. Coin earned in the OASIS not only allows gamers to build equipment and artifacts in VR but may also be used in the real world. Being killed online has serious consequences in both worlds as it reduces the gamers status and holdings to zero. 'Dead' gamers even attempt suicide.The evil IOI Corporation looks somewhat like the Scientologists. Slave-labour gamers in it's Loyalty Centres whilst planners/researchers wear suits and ties. It's Security Chief (Hannah John-Kamen) is suitably ruthless like a higher level SeaOrg Hubbardite. Evil and cruel but not pantomime villain depraved.Steven Spielberg has directed and produced a credible Science Fiction epic, scripted by the novel author Ernest Cline (with Zak Penn) with many filters and hues by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Too many involved in special effects to know who to thank. My only quibble with Ready Player One is it's 140 minutes running time, it could have lost 15 minutes and been a better film. 8.5/10",9,3,9,1 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Tour De Force by Lee
","BlacKkKlansman: A comedy but a very serious one. Director Spike Lee bookends this film with documentary footage, from the 60s at the beginning and ending with with 2017 footage of Neo-Nazis marching through Charlottesville chanting: 'The Jews Will Not Rule Over Us' along with an interview with David Duke who features throughout the film.Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) becomes the first Black undercover officer in the Colorado Police Force. Initially he is sent to infiltrate a meeting where a former Black Panther leader is speaking. Here we come to the first dichotomy: Stallworth very much wants to advance Black Power but he also believes in Law and Order, something which will cause divisions between him and student leader Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier) who he encounters at the rally.Stallworth moves on to infiltrate the Klan, fooling both local Klan leaders and Imperial Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace) over the phone. His partner Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) takes the part of Ron in actual meetings. Gradually they get more involved in the Klan and uncover a plot to bomb Black targets. Duke may not have been aware of this, make your mind up.Here we have a history lesson about some dark deeds in the recent past and as the ending shows: they haven't gone away you know. At the times it is only the vein of dark humour which runs through the film which makes it watchable. We come across not just racism but hatred of Jews with one character wanting to make Flip take a lie-detector test to prove that he's not a Jew. Zimmerman's life is constantly under threat through the risk of the exposure of his real identity. Serving members of the military are involved in the conspiracy. There are racist cops in the film and it shows institutional racism in areas of Law Enforcement but Stallworth and Driver and eventually the Police Chief emerge as the heroes of the film. The identities of the villains are all to clear throughout BlacKkKlansman and they are still there at the post ending documentary coda. Made on a budget of only $15 million this is a tour de force by Spike Lee. 9/10.",9,5,9,1 September 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Dark Story With A Quirky Vein Of Humour.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: A dark film with a quirky sense of humour running through it. Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has had enough, months have passed and the police are no closer to catching her daughters killers so she rents billboards haranguing the local police for their lack of action and singling out Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). This swiftly brings her into conflict with the police and in particular Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell).This is a story about small town Southern life, it would be easy to characterise some of the characters as slack jawed idiots but perhaps their apparent stupidity is due to limited horizons and insular thinking. Dixon in particular comes across as rather dumb and racist but develops when given an opportunity. Much more of the films spleen is vented on the town's authority figures such as the Roman Catholic Priest who calls around to chide Mildred about the billboards. In one short scene she destroys his arguments and knocks him from the moral high ground he thinks he holds.Chief Willoughby is a far more complex character who we learn is suffering from terminal cancer. He has sympathy with Mildred and shows his support in practical ways. Mildred herself is no saint and some of her demands are impractical and authoritarian. She is prone to violence with a fiery temper but then has also suffered from domestic abuse. No one has an easy life in Ebbing. There are dark, disturbing and violent scenes throughout the film but the vein of humour which runs through it is uplifting and counters the sadness. A central message is that redemption is possible. There are no Angels in this tale and perhaps just one Demon. Superb acting from McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell with a convincing script, dialogue and direction by Martin McDonagh. 9/10.",9,2,6,4 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disappointing but better than no Star Wars!
","Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker: Starts off nice and dark, the Emperor Palpatine is still alive! Kylo Ren slays multitudes to get his hands on a Sith Wayfinder and thus locate Palpatine. But the dark Monarch reveals that he had shaped Ren to bring him to the Dark Side! Ren then undergoes a temptation: Palpatine will give him a fleet of Star Destroyers if he kills Rey! By the way there is a secret about Rey... Too many bloody secrets in this film: Finn has a spy in the First Order! Meanwhile Rey is working on developing her control of the Force and on fighting techniques with the Light Sabre. Ren is able to affect her abilities through telepathic contact, Anyway Rey, Finn, Chewie et al head off on a quest.I just feel that I've encountered all of this before, secret family links, a Jedi undergoing training, even races with speeders, causing the pursuers to crash. Some good Light Sabre duels and spaceship battles but nothing new. One bonus is that we get to see the wreckage of the second Death Star which crash-landed on a planet. Plenty of adventure and quests across the galaxy but the film is overlong and could easily lose 20 minutes in it's running time. Director/Writer J.J. Abrams delivers a disappointing conclusion to the Star Wars sequel trilogy. We need more like Rogue One and Solo! 6/10",6,1,6,21 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Storming!
","Bohemian Rhapsody: You don't have to be a Queen fan to appreciate this warts and all memoir of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek in a storming performance) and Queen (covering the period 1970 to 1985). Bookended by the 1985 Live aid Concert we see how throughout his life Freddie had to deal with taunts of Paki from his days as a baggage handler at Heathrow to his first appearance with Queen to the tale telling by his sacked personal manager Paul Prenter (played by the aptly named Allen Leech). The development of Queen's unique musical style is well captured and how a move away from it caused fractures within the band. While Mercury was the showman, the roles played by May (Gwilym Lee), Taylor (Ben Hardy) and especially the non-flamboyant Deacon (John Mazzello) in the writing and arranging of their songs is outlined in amusing sequences, very much synergy at play.Mercury's relationship with Mary Austin ( Lucy Boynton) is central to the film, even though they ceased to be a couple after Freddie explored his bisexual nature and took male partners, their friendship continued until his death. With fame came the vampiric hangers-on and chief among these was Prenter. How all of this led to the temporary break up of Queen is in the film. But the Music! Oh the Music! See and hear how Bohemian Rhapsody was put together along with other Queen classics. The film ends with a re-enactment of Queen's twenty minute set at Live Aid.This wonderful musical biopic is brought to us with Bryan Singer at the helm as Director but the efforts of Writer Anthony McCarten, Cinematographer Newton Sigel and Editor John Ottman are crucial to it's success. 9/10.",9,0,0,5 November 2018
Bird Box," Good SF/Horror Film
","Bird Box: A different sort of Apocalypse, mass suicides are taking place, it gradually emerges that this is due to some entities which cause people to envision their worst fears. Some are just driven crazy and attack others at random but others embrace the change and see it as the new reality, forcing others to take off blindfolds.In the early stages, survivors including Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich take shelter in a house, only venturing out when supplies run short. They discover that viewing the entities even through CCTV footage results in suicide. The survivors are divided about admitting newcomers as they suspect that the change has resulted in new normative behaviours in humans who survived exposure to the entities. Birds give an early warning of the entities approach.Later Bullock s shown travelling down a river with two children as she seeks a supposed sanctuary.A pretty savage aftermath to the fall of civilisation is portrayed in Bird Box, the suicides begin in Europe before they spread to America and presumably the rest of the world. There are three fears, seeing the entities and being changed, being attacked by the psychotic changees, being forced to change by those who now worship the entities.Susanne Bier has turned Eric Heisserer's script into an intriguing new addition to the Post-Apocalypse genre. 8/10.

Justice League," An OK, enjoyable film which could have been so much better.
","Justice League: Nowhere near as bad as many critics have alleged. But there is a hole in this film into which much of the story has disappeared. Its original running time was 3 hours and was cut to 2 hours. Likely losing screen time for Lois Lane, Steppenwolf, Cyborg, even Superman and the plot in general.But it is a stirring adventure infused with humour but perhaps The Flash overdoes that a bit. New villain Steppenwolf returns after millennia to once again battle the Amazons, Atlanteans and Mankind. Hes an alien which suggests that the Gods who fought him in the past are also ETs, putting an SF rather than Fantasy tinge to the affair. He comes in search of the Mother-Boxes, Extreme Energy sourcesAquaman resembles a young Billy Connolly rather the clean cut superhero I remember from the comics of my youth but he is effective against Steppenwolf's flying Bugmen, Zombiesque creatures. As is Cyborg who also provides technical support in the hacking of the Mother-Boxes.An OK, enjoyable film which could have been so much better. 6.5/10",7,0,0,19 November 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Great Film Not Just Great Animated Film.
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse: Not one but many types of Spider superheroes, there must be a lot of radioactive spiders out there. We are dealing with The Spider-Verse, Spider-Man might be Peter B. Parker, 15 years older, cynical and washed out; could be Peter Porker/Spider-Ham, a pig from a cartoon universe; Gwen Stacey/Spider-Woman; Spider-Man Noir from a Monochrome 1930s universe; Peri Parker from an anime universe with her bio-mechanical suit - Sp//dr. Last but certainly not least we have Miles Morales who is bitten by a radioactive spider while tagging with his uncle.This is all brought about by Fisk/Kingpin who has built a particle-accelerator to contact alternate versions of his dead wife and child in parallel universes, his actions are wreaking havoc in the Multiverse (and local earthquakes) allowing the Spiders to cross over. This universe's Spider-Man tries to halt this but battling Doc Ock, The Goblin and The Prowler he is fatally injured, meeting Miles he passes his mantle on to him.And so the adventure is afoot! Will Miles with the aid of the four Spider heroes defeat Kingpin and his motley crew? With the aid of Aunt May and the deceased Spider-Man's vast underground HQ they might have some chance. Truly great animation which takes things to a new level, if there is any justice then Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse should be competing for Best Film Oscar and not just Best Animated feature. The only cartoonish thing about this project is Spider-Ham and he makes anvils appear from nowhere to squash villains in the best Roadrunner traditions.The new Spider-Man, Miles, has a complicated life, he attends a boarding school for talented teens, he feels isolated from his family and old friends. But Gwen (Spider-Woman) is also a pupil and a potential romance may lie in the future even if she returns to her own universe. Hopefully this will be the first in a series set in the Marvel Spider-Verse. 9/10.",9,3,6,25 December 2018
Yesterday," Great Universe Slip Story
","Yesterday: A struggling singer/songwriter Jack (Himesh Patel) is transported into a parallel universe where The Beatles don't exist. The transport McGuffin is well handled: a global power outage during which the cycling Jack is struck by a bus. Waking up in hospital he is comforted by his roadie/manager/agent Ellie (Lily James), there is unrequited love between them which is central to the film's narrative. Jack first realises something is odd when he discovers that none of his friends recognise the song Yesterday. This scene is beautifully shot at a riverside location with a setting sun capturing the mood of the song. Going online he finds no mention of The Beatles, this universe has a good side as well though: there is also no Oasis (it also lacks a few other things).So jack sets out to rewrite the songs of The Beatles, not always getting the order of words just right. Indeed Ed Sheeran (himself) persuades Jack to rename Hey Jude as Hey Dude. Jack gets to open for Sheeran on a World Tour and his road to success seems assured when Sheeran's manager Debra (Kate McKinnon) agrees to represent him. McKinnon is crazed and quirky in the role but very convincing. The move from busking and playing in bars to incipient Superstar isn't easy for Jack, director Danny Boyle effectively uses devices such as having an awestruck Jack surrounded by multimedia images of his growing fame and shows him dancing through the Mersey Tunnel as he researches songs. The capstone is perhaps when Sheeran describes himself as Salieri to Jack's Mozart.A witty, touching, enjoyable film of potential greatness thrust upon an ordinary person who is riven by self-doubt. Great cameo by Robert Carlyle as an elderly John Lennon. Wonderfully delivered by director Danny boyle from a screenplay by Richard Curtis. 8.5/10.",9,11,20,3 July 2019
The Favourite," Darkly Comical Period Drama
","The Favourite: Queen Victoria is staple of 19th Century drama whether as a character or the subject of a feature portrayal. However the reign of another female Monarch, Queen anne is largely forgotten. Director Yorgos Lanthimos now remedies this with The Favourite, set in 1708 when Queen Anne is distressed and a newly arrived servant raises her spirits. On a superficial level the film is similar to Mrs Brown and Victoria & Abdul, Lanthimos brings his own inimitable style to it.Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is depressed, suffering from gout and other ailments. Not caring for Affairs of State she allows her friend (and secret lover) Sarah Churchill (Rachael Weisz) to rule in her stead. Sarah uses this power to advance the military campaigns of her husband, the Duke of Marlborough (Mark Gatiss). Sarah's impoverished cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives seeking a position in the household. At first she is a menial maid but when she provides a herbal remedy to ease the Queen's gout she is promoted and soon comes to vie with Sarah for Anne's affection and confidence.A darkly comic tale of a battle of wills. For Abigail to lose means be returned to penury but for Sarah defeat will result in the loss of her (de facto) absolute power.Anne's Court can be a odd place, courtiers race ducks and lobsters for amusement, indeed the Prime Minister (James Smith) walks his pet duck around on a leash. Anne herself keeps seventeen pet rabbits, one for each of the children she has lost through miscarriages, still-births and infant deaths. The adventures of the Queen, Sarah and Abigail unfold in a manner which at times seems farcical but always advances the films inner logic. 9/10.",9,2,3,5 January 2019

We even get to see how Thanos got his start.Crackling dialogue, wisecracking from Ironman and smartaleckery by rocket are counterposed to Thor's solipsistic godliness. The Guardians are successfully assimilated into the Avengers storyline as is Dr Strange. Maybe a confusion of characters at times but great fun. 8/10.",8,2,7,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Meditation On The End Of An Era.
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: There are elements of this film which could be described as fantasy, alternate history or even Forteana but I'll settle for Action/Comedy/Drama, with an emphasis on dark comedy. It's the end of an era in 1969, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is pushing 40, a former film and TV star with his own show, Bounty Killer, he now depends on guest-starring roles in TV Series' and Pilots. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Dalton's friend and stunt double. Booth now mainly works as a gopher and driver for Rick. Film Agent Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) tries to convince Dalton to go to Italy to make Spaghetti Westerns. In the background is the Manson Family, we see the girls dumpster diving and one of them, Pussycat ( Margaret Qualley) catches Cliff's eye. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski are Rick's neighbours so a collision between these three groups seems inevitable.
Tarantino captures what seems to be a pastiche of the late 60s, people dance in the bar of a 747, everyone (even the Manson Family) watch Mannix and The FBI Files on TV. Tate goes to watch her own film, thrilling to the audience reactions. She was trained in martial arts by Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) whose run in with Booth resulted in Booth being blacklisted for stunt work. The film within in a film (Lancer pilot show) is hilarious as Dalton plays a villain, when he is reading from a Western novel to precocious child actor Trudi (Julia Butters)about an ageing cowboy he breaks down but goes on to have an inspired scene in the show when he is her kidnapper.Some great scenes at the Spahn Ranch, a former filming set for Westerns, where the Manson Family now reside. Booth gives Pussycat a ride to the ranch where he meets Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning), Manson's lieutenant, who later tried to assassinate President Ford. Cliff is worried about Spahn (Bruce Dern) but finds that he is having a good time with Squeaky. An ever increasing number of Family members watch Booth as he enters Spahn's shack but only Pussycat is outside as he exits. The rest are in a line on a porch barracking him as he departs resulting in brilliant shots.There are a few surprises and some savage violence as the film heads towards it's seemingly inevitable conclusion but the antics of Dalton and Booth provide laughs and entertainment along the way. Especially the sequences from Bounty Killer and Dalton's films. Writer/Director Tarantino delivers a meditation on the end of a Hollywood era. 8.5/10.",9,7,19,20 August 2019
Aladdin," Fun musical comedy
","New Aladdin film is good fun with Will Smith hamming it up as the Genie, Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine. A musical/fantasy/comedy with some good song and dance numbers. Don't start thinking about the plot, just enjoy it. A great thieving monkey and an anthropomorphic flying carpet. Cool tiger as well. 7/10",7,0,2,30 May 2019
A Quiet Place," A Dark SF/Horror Masterpiece.
","A Quiet Place: Being quiet is a necessity not an option. AQP opens in a post-apocalypse deserted village, a family are (silently) foraging for medical and electrical supplies. They communicate via sign language. Father, Leo (John Krasinski) seeks out radio components, mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt) locates medicine for sickly son Marcus (Noah Jupe), sister Regan (Millicent Simmonds) minds toddler Beau (Cade Woodward). But the toddler manages to hide a battery operated toy and after the family leave the store he turns it on. An arachnid creature with an Alien style head swiftly appears and carries the boy off.Yes, the Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials who want to serve humanity - for lunch. The creatures are blind and use sound to locate their victims. It is not clear if they are more intelligent than Earthly predators such as lions or cheetahs, they might be sentient or a hunting pack used by masters. Old newspaper front pages give warnings to remain quiet and head underground suggesting an interim period before civilisation collapsed. Families appear to survive on isolated farms, who knows what is happening in the citiesA year after losing Beau, life continues for the family at their farmhouse, the quietest pathways are used outside, footprints are painted indoors so that creaks may be avoided. When a lamp is knocked over the family wait in terror as they hear noises on the roof but it just turns out to be raccoons. Leo is attempting to contact other survivors through morse code on a radio and making a better cochlear aid for Regan who is deaf and at risk of not hearing the aliens approaching. Evelyn is pregnant and the family prepare a soundproof room for the impending birth. The family appears to be traditional with Leo teaching survival skills to a reluctant Marcus and leaving Regan at home with her mother but as the film develops Evelyn's inner Emily Blunt emerges and Rgan shows that she is capable of fighting the creatures.This is a Horror Film which is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. You gradually see more of the hippos sized predators as they snatch humans and dismember eat them. There are many shocks which will have you jumping out of your seats or cowering. A disturbing scene of an old man, stricken by existential despair after his wife has been killed shouts so that the aliens will also find him. This is very much John Krasinski's film, he directs, co-writes and stars but Blunt also puts in a strong performance. Millicent Simmonds, who shines as Regan is actually deaf also starred in Wonderstruck and is very much a rising star. 9/10.",9,3,7,6 April 2018
1917," Powerful War Film
","1917: The trenches are narrow but crowded, some soldiers on one side waiting to go over the top, some crouched on the other side, eating, smoking, crying, in shock, petting a terrier. When you're moving fast through a trench system tempers are short when you bump into troopers, they are likely bereaved of friends, seeing their mates lose limbs. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are on a mission to inform two isolated battalions of the Devonshires to call off an attack due the next morning, the Devons will be advancing into a trap. The stakes are higher for Blake, his brother is in one of the battalions. The messengers cross no mans land, bodies caught on the barbed wire, rats gnawing on corpses, dodging snipers, booby-traps once they reach the abandoned German trenches. Watching an aerial dogfight. This is truly a journey into the heart of darkness for Blake and Schofield.Wonderfully filmed by Roger Deakins in subdued colours with shades of brown, tan, green and khaki predominating as the soldiers progress through the mud and fields. Also some great scenes underground and in shelled out buildings lit by flares. The script is spare but gripping as not just MacKay and Chapman put in great performances; there are also great supporting turns by Mark Strong, Colin Firth , Nabhaan Rizwan and Benedict Cumberbatch. Director/Writer Sam Mendes delivers a film which will remain in your memory long after the final credits roll. 9/10.",9,7,10,17 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A satisfying film but some scenes are a tad drawn out.
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Cranky nuns look after the ancient Jedi buildings on the island Luke retired to (reminded me of primary school). Rey drives them to distraction with her attempts to reinvigorate Luke, to get him to take up his Light Sabre in defence of The Republic. Luke is rusticated, his daily routine consists of kamikaze style fishing and drinking milk fresh from a dino/seacow. Just like a typical hermit. Oh, and he also haunted is by the ghost of Yoda.Kylo Ren is on the Dark Side but has some qualms, even hesitating to destroy the Rebel ship his mother is on. Lela shows her mastery of The Force by surviving in vacuum and even flying, looking like an aged Tinker Bell. Kylo and Ren are quantum-entangled by The Force, communicating over the parsecs.Some great space battles and ground war involving creaky fighters. Indeed much of the Rebel equipment looks aged and well used. This retro feel extends to their space bombers which appear to rely on hydraulics. The 1970s Battle Star Galactica stole spaceship designs from Star Wars but now in an 180 degree turn the 2004 BSG has influenced the look of SWTLJ. An explosion on the Flight Deck is straight from a Galactica episode as is the destruction of a battleship.A satisfying film but some scenes are a tad drawn out. 8/10.",8,0,2,17 December 2017
Cold War," Touching Love Story
","A love story set across 15 years and many countries. The film opens in 1949 with Wiktor (Tomas Kol) and Irena (Agata Kulesza) collecting folk songs and music in the mountains of Southern Poland. Along with administrator Lech (Borys Szyc) they set up an Institute to form a Folk Song and Dance Troupe. During the auditions for students Wiktor notices a student, Zula (Joanna Kulig), who though not technically a perfect singer has something special. Two years later They become lovers and admits that she has spied on him for Lech (she is still on probation from prison), a party hack. Lech has already persuaded the Troupe to include songs praising Stalin into their folk song repertoire. When the Troupe visits East Berlin Zula agrees to defect to the West with Viktor, but changes her mind.Over the following 12 years they meet at intervals, pursuing a love which never seems to properly work out. Two artists, occasionally working together even living together in Paris, striving to find that perfect synthesis of love and music. Wiktor makes great sacrifices to try and be with Zula but he doesn't fully appreciate the losses she also suffers from pursuing their seemingly doomed relationship. Zula would always be scarred by her early life experiences and her doubts that their relationship could ever work. Great performances from Kulesza and Kol as the star-crossed lovers and Szyc as the scheming bureaucrat who carries a torch for Zula. Filmed in sparkling monochrome, director Pawel Pawlikowski delivers a veritable saga in Cold War's 85 minute running time. 8/10.",8,5,12,23 October 2018
Midsommar," Folk Horror At It's Best
","Midsommar: The Paganism in this film is very much of a Shamanistic type, differing in many aspects from the Celtic varieties. The ingestion of magic mushrooms is central to the rituals portrayed in the film and how the mushroom tea is filtered is made clear in a banner panel. A 'May Queen' is chosen at the Midsommar, the winner of a dance around a pole, you dance until there is one woman left standing. In the old days The Dark One forced the young to dance till they died, now the young women dance in defiance of Him. These practises are carried out by a Cult in Northern Sweden at Midsommar when the Sun never sets.The contrast between the dark and snow of the U.S, as the film opens and the eternal sunshine of Sweden is vividly conveyed. Another darkness clouds Dani's (Florence Pugh) life as her sister kills their parents and commits suicide. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) wants to break up with Dani and is encouraged to do so by his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Harper) but Christian feels a responsibility towards her. When classmate Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites Mark, Christian and Josh to join him at a midsummer celebration that occurs once every ninety years at his family commune, the Hårga, in Hälsingland, Christian cannot exclude Dani from the trip. When they arrive, they are all welcomed as if they family themselves. But there are warning signals which should have screamed 'Get Out Of Here' to them, especially to Christian and Josh who are Anthropology postgrads.The Midsommar Ritual begins placidly enough but soon takes on an aura of strangeness. By the time the first scenes of violence occur they are perhaps not so shocking because of the developing eerie mood but they are quite gory. There are episodes of savagery and sadism throughout the second part of Midsommar but they are all related to The Ritual. Far more import to the the narrative's development is the uncanny feeling which permeates the entire the film. What happens to the characters after they arrive at the commune is perhaps preordained, every action they take is in some way related to The Ritual, In this manner, ritual development, Midsommar resembles Kill List and The Wickerman though the storylines and outcomes differ.Midsommar is not a film you will easily forget, several viewings may be necessary though for you to catch every fine detail. Director and writer Ari Aster has delivered another Folk Horror masterpiece. 9/10.

The Shape of Water," A Masterpiece.
","The Shape of Water: A Horror Film but also SF Adventure, Spy Thriller, Love Story, directed, produced and co-written (with Vanessa Taylor) by Guillermo del Toro. Beautifully filmed by cinematographer by Dan Laustin in so many shades of green, teal, aquamarine, tans, brown, gold and red which give it a 50s/early 60s feel. Wonderful production design by Paul D Austerby with a subterranean laboratory and over cinema apartments in which most of the action transpires.Mute janitor Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work in a military run research facility when a strange Creature (Doug Jones) is brought to the laboratory. The Creature injures Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon) who was torturing it. Strickland captured the Creature in the Amazon and hopes to exploit its amphibious nature to advance the US Space Programme. Falling in love with the creature, Elisa enlists the help of Zelda, her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and a kindly scientist, Dr Bob (Michael Stuhlbarg) to free him from the laboratory.The Creature resembles the 1950s Creature From The Black Lagoon with aspect of Predator and ALF. Jones brings the creature to life and you can truly believe in the love which develops between them. Inter-species sex results which strangely doesn't strain credibility due ti the acting skills of Hawkins and Jones but will no doubt outrage some. Its not so long ago since director Tim Burton in Planet Of The Apes avoided a romance between Astronaut (Wahlberg) and Chimpanzee (Bonham Carter) as he feared that such a film would be shunned by cinema chains.This is also a film about loneliness, that of Elisa, Giles who is gay, Bob a stranger in a strange land, Zelda who is estranged within her marriage and of course the Creature himself. The Civil Rights struggle takes place in the background as the film is set in 1962 Baltimore. Sometimes it comes to the fore as when the man Giles longs after refuses service to a Black couple in a café. Also, all of the janitors/attendants at the research facility are Black or Hispanic but the scientists/technicians and military police are White.All of this is expertly juggled and mixed together by del Toro to make a masterpiece. 10/10.",10,39,72,31 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," The film is a story of friendship between Tommy and Gregg as well as the filming of The Room and a zany comedy.
","The Disaster Artist: 'I don't want a career, I want a planet'. So says Tommy Wiseau, Director/Producer/Writer of The Room, arguably the worst movie ever made. The film opens with Tommy (James Franco) literally climbing the walls in an acting class. He convinces a fellow student in the class, Gregg Sestero (Dave Franco) to move to Los Angeles with him, to become stars. Gregg makes minor progress but Tommy's total lack of talent and weird behaviour brings on disaster, he insists on performing Shakespeare when his acting coach tells him he would make a good villain or monster. He cannot accept rejection, when a movie producer tells him he could never succeed in a million years, he responds: 'but after that?'.Undaunted, Tommy decides to make his own film, eventually producing an incoherent script for The Room in 2001 which will star himself and Gregg. Tommy's bizarre directing style alienates both actors and film crew. But pouring $6 million of his own money into the film he finishes it.Tommy is an enigma, he claims to be from New Orleans but has an Eastern European accent. When he first meet Gregg, who is 19, he also claims that he is a teenager but looks 40. With his flowing long black hair he looks like Byron (think Gabriel Byrne in Gothic) or a Vampire (think Tom Griffith in John Carpenter's: Vampires). He has apartments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, putting Gregg up for four years there. No one knows where Tommy's money cones from but as a bank teller comments, his account is a 'bottomless pit'.The film is a story of friendship between Tommy and Gregg as well as the filming of The Room and a zany comedy. Tommy's behaviour has to be seen to be believed, incapable of altering or even modifying his accent, hamming up every scene. He is jealous of Greggs relationships because it means he gets less attention. But they are still friends today.The film became a cult classic and even turned a profit eventually. Tommy went on to claim that he had always intended the film as a comedy rather than a serious drama.James Franco deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of Tommy but this film may be too bizarre to attract the necessary attention.",9,1,4,10 December 2017
The Witch," Savage Folk Horror
","The Witch: Intriguing film. Was this about the literal appearance of Satan and actual Witches in thrall to him? Or could it all be the result of ergot contamination of the crops causing hallucinations? I'll be mulling this over for a while to come.A religious zealot and his family are forced to leave a New England colony in 1638 and set up a homestead on the edge of a forest. A newborn baby disappears while in the care of her adolescent sister. We 'see' a witch making off with the infant and sacrificing him but the father insists a wolf was responsible.More strange occurrences and the blame continues to attach to the the young girl. Echoes of The Crucible here in the behaviour of her two youngest siblings.Wonderfully filmed in a bleak landscape, with attention to historical detail.The diction and grammar used is that of the 17th century and at times may be difficult to understand. 9/10.",9,6,11,12 May 2018
Joker," Dark, Savage Origin Story.
","Joker: Gotham City is a grim place to live in, refuse collectors on strike, social services being cut back, widespread violent crime, a sharp divide between the rich and the poor. The Joker works as a clown at an agency where the clowns have to punch in on a time clock. He gets the worst gigs, beaten up by kids when he's advertising a closing down sale. Loses his psychiatrist and medication due to the cutbacks. He has to look after his crazed invalid mother who writes to billionaire Thomas Wayne begging for help as she worked for him decades ago. Then he loses his job. All of this pushes him to breaking point.We have a killer clown pursuing his prey along subway trains and platforms. Long corridors in hospitals, apartment buildings, steep sets of steps. A city on the brink of class war. When three of his employees are slain by the Joker Wayne decides to run for mayor, on a 1% platform, calling the poor clowns. He gets his answer as mobs riot while wearing clown masks. They see the Joker as a hero. Some scenes of savage violence as the Jokers break from reality continues and his new villain persona emerges. Great scenes of hordes of clowns travelling by subway trains to protests and riots. Very much an adult version of the Joker with an outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Robert De Niro plays Murray Franklin a talk show host originally adored by the Joker. We get to meet Alfred and the young Bruce Wayne but this is the Joker's story. Writer, director and producer Todd Phillips delivers a dark origin tale which likely puts himself and Phoenix in the running for Oscars. 9/10.",9,1,1,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Is IT Alf?
","It Chapter Two: Derry, Maine is a nasty place even leaving aside IT, we're reminded of that by a vicious homophobic attack in which the victim is thrown in the river. IT then emerges, after 27 years, to claim the unfortunate as his own. The Losers return to Derry but have to overcome their amnesia. IT can be destroyed but it requires a Ritual, each must go through a trance/ordeal to recover artefacts for the Ritual to work. Horror ensues for each individual member.Mike had stayed in Derry and went through ceremonies with an American Indian Tribe, using hallucinogens he had a vision of IT arriving on Earth from the stars. This is reinforced by the Giger like structures underground implying that IT is an alien entity, making this Scff-Horror rather than Fantasy-Horror. Great flashbacks, especially of Henry Bowers being literally vomited out of a pipe along with corpses. In present day Derry, Henry is sprung from a Psychiatric Prison Hospital by one of his (now) undead gang. Great to have a Zombie driver! Even great horror scenes can drag at times and it would have been a better film with 20 minutes cut. Good fun though. 7.5/10.",8,3,5,13 September 2019

But the real culprit is the ( English) Chief of the Palestine Police!Branagh's Poirot was a bit brash for my liking.

Parasite," Brilliant Dark Satire
","Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10.",9,24,39,26 January 2020

Holds up well, especially Piper Laurie as the crazes mother, even an otherwise mundane scene like her chopping vegetables and then continuing to chop the board can be really disturbing. I still feel that the car with the bullies being forced to crash and ignite was done too quickly, still good though. The hand! That arm emerging from the grave! Maybe the hairstlyes were the most terrifying thing in the film!",8,0,0,30 June 2020
Black Panther," Action Mixed With A Critique Of Colonialism.
","Black Panther: To the outside world Wakanda is a struggling country, caught in the past, dependent on agriculture with little to export. Little does the West know that in fact Wakanda is an advanced technological society, its industry and wealth built on the Alien metal Vibranium. The Black Panther gets his power from a flower grown in soil tainted by Vibranium ore. (This being an Absolute Monarchy only he gets to ingest the flower. Don't ask this is comic book territory).Following the death of King T'Chaka in the attack on the UN, T'Challa ( Chadwick Boseman) the Black Panther prepares to assume the throne. The kingdom maintains agents (War Dogs) in the outside world, one of whom is Nakia (Lupito Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover, who is currently undercover fighting slavers. This allows BP to show off his powers in a fight with the slavers aided by Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira) leader of his female Special Forces, the Dora Milaje. The DM protect the Royal Family and Wakanda from internal and external attack (and presumably disembowel any uppity oiks who are looking for an elected president and parliament).T'Challa and his sidekicks return to Wakanda for the Coronation ceremony where he has to take a potion stripping him of his powers before any possible challenge. He is challenged by M'Baku (Winston Duke), leader of the Mountain People. T'Challa triumphs and allows M'Baku to live. But there is a lost Prince of Wakanda on the loose abroad, N'Jadaka (Michael Jordan) AKA Killmonger. This Prodigal Prince teams up with the murderous Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) a B List Bond Villain. They loot/liberate museums in search for Vibranium and N'Jadaka returns to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa for the throne.Wakanda is a beautifully imagined country surrounded by mountains and rain forest, hidden by shields which cloak the true nature of the country. Challenges for the throne take place at the edge of magnificent waterfalls, top class CGI for the most part. Apart from it's War Dogs occasional interventions, Wakanda has stayed aloof from the struggles of the oppressed. N'Jadaka wants to change this by sending advanced weapons abroad. Civil War ensues, with even Vibranium clad rhinos involved.The Wakandan technology ranges from dragonfly like attack craft to maglev trains and photon/energy powered Vibranium weapons. There is a vast subterranean cavern complex where the manufacture and R&D takes place. Chief Scientist is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's teenage sister. In supporting roles we have Angela Bassett as the Queen Mum, Forest Whitaker as Zuri, a wise old Counsellor and Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. Ross is the butt of jokes as M'Baku roars: 'Silence or I'll feed you to my children! Only Kidding, we're vegetarians!' Shuri comments: 'another broken white boy to fix'. as Ross arrives for medical treatment.This film works on several layers with the spectres of Colonialism, Neo-Colonialism hanging over the action sequences. The meaning and natures of International Solidarity is also examined but sadly the anachronism of an Absolute Monarchy existing in an advanced Technological Society is left unquestioned. Good fun though. 8/10.",8,1,6,18 February 2018
Mother!," Themes of rebirth and renewal merge chaos and fire in this Beckettian drama.
","mother!: Poetry lovers battling riot police. A house under attack not just from the police but from military forces is shelled, burned, ripped apart by a mad mob.

First one, then two, then four strangers arrive, violence erupts. Now a mob is present as a wake turns into a fanfest for the poet.This film by Darren Aronofsky has the structure of a bad dream, nay, a a nightmare. Themes of rebirth and renewal merge chaos and fire in this Beckettian drama. Some scenes of extreme violence and one particularly disturbing sequence involving human sacrifice cannibalism.

The Greatest Showman," Good, but Barnum deserves a better musical biopic.
","The Greatest Showman: Interesting songs and good dancing but The Book (connecting pieces) is a bit weak. A section regarding Jenny Lynd could have been discarded to allow more time to develop the central story of the 'freak show or as Barnum called them: unique people. They include: Dog Boy, Bearded Lady, Irish Giant, Siamese Twins, Tom Thumb, Tattooed Man. Rebecca Ferguson is good as Lynd, The Swedish Nightingale but the structure of the film suffers from this aside.Even though Barnum brings the unique people into the light, even he is a bit embarrassed by them when a 'better class of punter' comes to see Lynd. In a wonderful song and dance number the performers refuse to be excluded and burst into a champagne reception. Perhaps the unique people are too forgiving too quickly of Barnum afterwards. Strains credibility a bit.Hugh Jackman is impressive as Barnum and a good dancer but perhaps a body double was used for some of his high kicks. I have no such doubts about Zendaya who plays a trapeze artist, her dancing and rope acts look like her own work.  Good, but Barnum deserves a better musical biopic. 7/10",7,1,2,16 January 2018
Jojo Rabbit," A Triumph!
","Jojo Rabbit: How to describe this film? A serious comedy infused with elements of fantasy? It will have you laughing but the chuckles will die in your throat as you observe the final weeks of the Third Reich in a German town. Pensioners and children are armed with panzerfausts and rifles, 'traitors' are hanged, the Gestapo hunt Jews until the very end. These could be scenes from Downfall.Ten year old Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is an ardent member of the Hitler Youth who has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). This comical Hitler hangs out with Jojo, encourages him in his efforts, comforts him when he is bullied at the Hitler Youth weekend camp. The camp is run by invalided Captain Klenzdorf (Sam Rockwell) along with his shell-shocked assistant Sub-Officer Finkel (Alfie Allen) and the crazed Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who has borne 18 Aryan babies for the Reich, a great comic trio. The bullying is by teenage HY members though and Jojo suffers injuries from a premature grenade explosion.Jojo's mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) appears to be a model Nazi but she is hiding a Jewish teenager, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), and engaging in resistance activities. Jojo discovers Elsa's hiding place and at first his simple nazi ideology is to the fore but they gradually develop a tentative relationship. Elsa showing that she is no victim but someone whose people wrestled with angels and killed giants. Truly great performances by McKenzie and Davis.The humour ranges from a Tommy Cooper style skit where Rosie plays two parts to Mel Brookes type humour: (i) his slapstick mode where the imaginary Hitler is hamming, recoiling from a wall in case Jews are hiding in it, (ii) the serious comedy of To Be Or Not To Be when Jojo must fool the Gestapo. But these comparisons don't take away from the genius of Waititi's script, timing and direction.Writer/Director/Actor Taika Waititi has delivered a comic triumph which literally and metaphorically deposits the nazis in the dustbin of history. 9/10.",9,1,3,10 January 2020
