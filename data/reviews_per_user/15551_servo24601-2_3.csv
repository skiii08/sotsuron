Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This should not be part of your Star Wars collection
","Just because you have the first 3 Star Wars movies does not mean that you need to purchase this piece of trash.  Lucas has lost his direction- he has no idea what made the first 3 films great.  He needs to understand that the script is 1000% more important than all the special effects in the world.If you re-watch 'Star Wars' or 'Empire' after wathing 'Phantom Menace' you see that the first 2 had CHARACTERS.  The interaction between the characters, especially Han and Leah or Han and anyone is the reason why the movie worked.  All the interaction is gone in this film because everyone and everything is a special effect.   And regarding Darth Maul, has there ever been a less effective character in a major picture?  Unlike Darth Vader, we never know who this Darth Maul is or why he is trying to kill the heroes, thus we don't care about him. And Lucas should know that when you don't care about the character, the scenes become useless.   This movie is an embarrassment!",3,1,2,1 May 2000
LÃ©on: The Professional," could not buy it
","I tried, I really tried to watch this based on a friend's recommendation and the fact that it was the same director that did 'La Femme Nikita'. Unfortunately it was also the same director who did the 'Fifth Element' which goes to show that 'Nikita' was a creative fluke.
    I am sorry, I just could not buy the premise.  When you cannot buy the story from the first 15 minutes, then the whole movie is lost.   One more thing, can we nominate Gary Oldman for the 'Overacting Hall of Fame'.  Between this and 'Fifth Element' he shows just how much a waste of talent he really is.  I think he could be great but he takes these nonsense roles and then overplays them.",2,8,31,3 May 2000
Dark City," Dark City is what Phantom Menace will never be
","****'Dark City' is what the 'Phantom Menace' will never be; a movie that took time to write a story to go along with the special effects.  It is a visual stunning film but the movies real asset is its terrific plot.  It stays deliberately vague at the beginning and it forces you pay attention and focus on the plot- not the special effects.  This film is a modern day masterpiece.  George Lucas lost his vision in making the 'Phantom Menace', he should view this film and it may put his priorities back in line; plot first, then special effects.",10,0,1,21 June 1999
