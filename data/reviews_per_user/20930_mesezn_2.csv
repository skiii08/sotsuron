","It is an American supernatural horror film from 2017, based on Stephen King's 1986 novel of the same name. Directed by AndrÃ©s Muschietti, the script was written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman. It is the first film in a series of two films.The film is about seven children living in a small town in Maine. This is a group of seven friends excluded in schools. But these are not the biggest problems. Friends on the one hand while dealing with the problems of life, on the other hand, while dealing with adolescence, they turn to another trouble they do not expect. Pennywise, who can take shape according to the victims' fears, begins to scare these 7 children disguised as an eerie clown. Now their problems at school will be quite insignificant compared to their struggle for survival...I like the movie. It's interesting and exciting. It's not like any other horror movie I've seen. I haven't seen chapter 2 yet, but I will. I hope it's nicer than chapter 1.",7,0,0,21 October 2019

It is very interesting and exciting. It is not like the horror movies I have seen before. I could not fully understand the film because I did not watch the chapter 2 yet. But I will watch it as soon as possible. I hope it is as beautiful as the chapter 1.",7,0,0,21 October 2019
