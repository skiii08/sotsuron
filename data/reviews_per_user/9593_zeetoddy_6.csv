The Avengers," Far too much going on to pay close attention
","You will be dazzled and ultimately somewhat exhausted by all the characters and story lines. I love each one of these heroes individually, but I have to admit it was all too much for me. And then, for sentiment, they add a gratuitous scene (which is real sad) when a minor character dies to give context to it all. It was dashed together, crammed together, and bashed up all together. I am glad I went to see it but I was a bit bewildered and my butt hurt. I was overwhelmed and underwhelmed. I think that is really all I have to say but this site wants me to write much more and I think I have said enough. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing it especially if you are a fan, but this is really how me and my friends felt. It made a billion dollars on its opening weekend so there is no slowing this movie down. I could have skipped it and felt all the better for it had I trusted someones opinion, but everyone is rushing around trying to laud this monster hit so my voice is not going to be heard in this din.",6,2,7,17 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," 50 minute wedding followed by 50 minutes of birthing pain!
","Yes, it IS awful! The books are good, but this movie is a travesty of epic proportions! 4 people in front of me stood up and walked out of the movie. It was that bad. Yes, 50 minutes of wedding...very schlocky accompanied by sappy music. I actually timed the movie with a stop watch I was so bored. There is about 20 minutes of action and the rest is Bella pregnant and dying. The end. No, seriously. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. If it didn't have such a big budget and hype it would rank with one of the worst horror movies out there. The movie is plain stupid and cheesy and by far the worst of the series. The first two movies were nowhere near this awful!",1,27,39,3 December 2011
Hugo," Has all the bells and whistles of a great movie, but doesn't deliver!
","Is it the story? No. Is it the actors? No. Is it the cinematography? No. Just what is it that makes this movie so hard to sit through or not take a little nap in? Well, I am not sure exactly, but to put it crudely: its just too long and boring. It is also a bit misleading. You are expecting something magical and more fantastical. You are expecting the clockwork man that Hugo finds to reveal perhaps something else and come alive. Yet, it never really does. Its very sad to come away with a feeling like that with so much substance and so many great performances. My advice is to rent it when it comes out on DVD when you have time to pause or stop it and make a snack or go to the bathroom. Its very hard to sit through. If you are thinking to take your child to it, forget it! This is an adults only movie because it is somewhat sophisticated and somewhat artsy...and yes, long and boring!",6,4,7,3 December 2011
Mama," A Gem
","This little horror movie is a gem. I didn't expect much, but when my ten year old niece was excited to watch it I decided to see it. Apparently younger folks knew all about this, but I didn't. It is a simple story. A father murders his wife and goes on the run with his kids. His car crashes. He walks to a deserted cabin in the woods with his two girls. It is there that mama appears when he tries to kill his children. Mama is a ghostly caretaker. She is the ghost of a woman who jumped to her death in the 1800's. She cares for the two girls for several years before they are found (she did away with the murderous father). The father's brother is searching for the kids and when he finds them he brings them home. However, mama comes home with them as well. I haven't seen a good horror film like this is years. For the most part it is understated. You only see glimpses of mama until the end of the movie. The creepiest part is how the younger daughter has not acquired social skills. She is literally an animal and walks on all fours. Unlike many horror films, the characters are intelligent and don't go around opening doors they shouldn't. The flashbacks give mama her back story. There are a few unexplained things such as the children surviving on gathered cherry pits and moths, but nonetheless it is interesting. Definitely see this movie. It's on the top of my list for a thriller.",7,1,3,19 January 2013
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows Dud
","Everything, I mean everything that is good about this movie is in the trailer. Then end! Full stop! Well, there was the obligatory atmosphere and setting which I loved. The story and characters were there which I love. I love Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter. I love Tim Burton and Danny Elfman. I **did not** love this movie. In short, it was so disappointing and purported to be much more than it was. Besides big names, and big advertising, it was a flop. I did like some twists in the movie where Dr. Hoffman uses Barnabus' blood to make herself a vampire instead of giving him transfusions to correct his 'condition'. However, I thought it silly that the daughter Carolyn was a werewolf which was suddenly and ridiculously sprung on us at the end of the movie. Do not expect anything and you will be much happier for it because you will be disappointed like my friends and me.",4,1,4,17 May 2012
Cloud Atlas," Pointless. Confusing. Time Consuming. Money Pit.
","What is this movie about exactly? It is a meshing of several stories. Six and a seventh. You will ask yourself, how do I keep track? The trouble is, you can't. I suggest going to Wicki on the Internet and read the synopsis. Only then will you glimpse the meaning of this movie. A science fiction piece? Perhaps. It is about lives intertwining through time by karma or something else. It's just shy of three hours. Think you can sit your way through something that long before you begin to ask yourself, what am I doing? Granted, the acting is great. The cinematography is great. They spent oodles of money on this project. About 140 million. It shows. You can't complain about the production being of quality. But if you are no nonsense and demand clarity of a storyline, this won't easily yield anything. You are going to have to come up with significance for yourself. This isn't going to tell you what to think. The most interesting story of the six is the one of the futuristic Fabricants. Now, that is science fiction and that 'part' was edgy and captivating. It could stand alone as a small movie by itself. Of the six this is the one worth mentioning. I suggest you ask yourself if you can afford three hours of your time without really having any satisfaction. If the answer is yes, go ahead and watch this. I had nothing better to do so I don't feel that bad, but I wonder how is something this schizophrenic can be made? Apparently Tom Hanks is the answer. He really pulled for the movie and was also granted the majority of the acting parts.",6,3,7,10 February 2013
