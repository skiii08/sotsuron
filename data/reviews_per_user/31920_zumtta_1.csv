The Avengers," review
",The avengers was the best action thriller i have seen after a long while. I absolutely loved it and recommend each and everyone of u that its a must watch in cinemas. one more thing...... cobie smulders and scarlet jhonson <3 ;) All the characters including hulk iron man and captain America are portrayed to their full potential which is the most exuberant part of the movie. the team of superheros have been given a unique shape with a diverse story throughout the movie. i absolutely loved hulk and iron man as they were simply awesome! Most of all i saw it in 3D and i suggest to each and everyone of you go and surly watch it in 3D for an exciting experience. I'm hoping it will b the movie of the year.,10,2,7,27 May 2012
