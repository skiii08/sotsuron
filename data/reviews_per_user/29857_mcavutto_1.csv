Black Swan," Pretentious, boring, very bad movie.
","What? This movie is simply awful. I don't believe how it may have been so well regarded. It makes no sense, the script is confusing, I don't know what the purpose of this film, the only good thing that makes a difference are the excellent performances of Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, the rest is sheer waste of talent. I wanted to see this movie because I believe Darren Aronofsky is a good director, some of his movies are memorable, as The Fountain. There is also the presence of great actors like Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey, but honestly, it was a total disappointment. I expect this tendency to give very high grades for mediocre movies on IMDb does not extend, this would break the very reliability of the site.",4,10,34,1 January 2011
