Hereditary," Stunned
",Shockingly pretty good. How good? In everybody's top 15 horror movies of all time good. If you want real horror and twists this movie is for you! Very disturbing film in the best way possible.,9,0,2,31 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Better than expected
","I don't know why the film is getting all the bad press. It's better than Black Panther I mean c'mon that film was straight garbage to be honest...Jude Law was a nice touch, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos was smart, Gemma Chan was beautiful, Samuel L Jackson was great as usual and Brie Larson was far from subpar. Very kid-friendly and no typical sex appeal from a lead female character.All in all a great informational movie on the events that lead up to the formation of the Avengers and the initiative. Excited for Endgame!",8,3,10,28 March 2019
Aquaman," Amazing film, one of a kind! Worth all your money to see it in theatres
","The film was in sum, incredible and breathtaking. You will be entertained 95% guarantee.Memorable and emotional with an intricate plot.The action? Some of the very best, rivaling any Marvel movie to date. Jason Momoa is a stud guys.Visuals and sounds? Comparable to Avatar if you have seen it (The Trench and Karathen/Trident scenes alone are worth an Oscar my goodness) The soundtrack is addictive and amazing probably my favorite in the DCU.Acting was great and fitting especially Patrick Wilson, Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe.James Wan is simply a genius. Made Black Panther and Ant-man look like B-movies in my honest opinion.",10,3,7,27 January 2019
The Prestige," WOW
","Jaw-droppingly good. This film will take you on a twisted, emotional, fun, intense, mysterious, and incredible journey.Christopher Nolan is a genius, don't think I've ever disliked any of his works. This is a hidden gem in Hollywood.",10,0,2,27 January 2019
Tangled," Ahead of it's time
","One of the best animations of all time. Children and adults can still enjoy it today even though it was made 10 years ago (which is absurd)!Soundtrack is awesome, details are there, story is fitting, very comedic and fun. Very close to a perfect film.",10,1,1,8 January 2020
Interstellar," Don't let him leave, Murph!
","Quite possibly one of the greatest pieces of film of the decade? Century?
Breathtaking in summary.",10,3,4,27 January 2019
Get Out," Decent
","Love the director but his movie not so much. A solid 7 but was a little overly dramatic and predictable. Love how White People are depicted as the villains though hahahahaha, not surprised (by the way I am not white)",7,0,2,31 January 2019
A Quiet Place," A solid 7
","Decent movie, concept is great, ending not so great. Not as brilliant as it could have been but nonetheless entertaining to an extent",7,0,1,31 January 2019
Gran Torino," The film was supposed to be good, but in reality it wasn't
","First off I want you guys to know that I am hmong and this film is comically stereotypical. We're all different and are drawn to different things just like anybody else. In fact, I was born christian as were my parents. The movie portrays the modern hmong family only about 25% accurately and truthfully, backstage during filming there was racism going on even though the movie's main inclination is to KILL racism against the hmong people like seriously. What the heck? Clint Eastwood, you have lost my respect. Please stop trying to portray yourself as the great white hero we minorities need when in real life you wouldn't even genuinely converse or participate in activities with the hmong people except when you're 'on camera'. The lead hmong actor himself (whose name is Bee Vang for the 95% of you who didn't know or cared to know) said in an interview that Clint Eastwood kept his distance from the hmong people when they weren't filming. It was as if he thought the hmong actors were ACTUALLY like how they acted in real life.I'd also like to point out that most hmong gangs don't directly attack or prey on their family members. Most gang fights I've heard about and seen have always been other races pitted against the hmong. I have plenty of cousins and uncles who are still gangbanging and although it's ;inherently wrong, they do this for protection and racism in the ghettos of america. I'd like to say it occurs most often in the hyperghettos, a term coined by professor Eric Tang. Somehow, american society thinks asians (mainly the men) are inferior and so to show they're hard and tough, some asian males do stupid things like join gangs to prove their masculinity. 100% true coming from a hmong citizen who has experienced racism countless times in the midwest even to this day. You'd think this stuff would have died but it still exists. I do not support gangs but I understand why they exist. Poverty, money (lack of) and quality of life is to blame for most gang formation and crime.",1,2,3,26 July 2019
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not too shabby
","Potential for a great movie, the Surfer is a great character and has underrated and amazing abilities. I'd say he's one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The chase scene between the Human Torch and Surfer was amazing.Overall, the movie touched a bit on that greatness but fell short. My personal rating is probably leaning more towards a 6.5 than a 7.5 but obviously we cannot include decimals in our rating so the movie earns a solid 7. Perhaps production costs prevented what could have been an amazing movie.Anyone saying, 'it sucked' are exaggerating but those saying it was amazing have probably not seen many films to judge appropriately.",7,2,2,11 February 2019
Midsommar," Was an okay horror flick
","If this movie traumatized you, you haven't seen that many horror/disturbing films tbh. The story was non-existent and was sadly everything I expected; which is a messed up cult film with some gore and nudity thrown here and there. This movie is simply a mashup of The Wickerman, V/H/S, Sinister and SAW along with the stylistic filming of Hereditary.",5,2,4,24 July 2019
La La Land," Ok.....
","I don't understand the hype of this movie.Singers were sub par like the acting.Songs were not memorable or entertaining.Cliche, cliche, cliche.Ugh, get me out. Walked out with about 30 mins left of the movie as my girlfriend herself was not enjoying it as well! Just sad.",1,3,5,27 January 2019
Mystic River," Ending was terrible
","Of course as per usual the bad guys (mobsters) get away with it and the technically good guy dies (even though later it's revealed he killed a molester) and we're supposed to feel like it was a great story because it's a tragedy? Huh? The tragedy is I'm glad the daughter died in the first place! Jimmy (Sean Penn) really deserved it! What this movie showcases well is that God will bring justice and take your daughter if you make stupid decisions! Hahah. This movie also shows that there can be a cast of characters and you will root for none of them. No one is likable sorry!Let's talk about certain individuals and inconsistencies...Jimmy (Mobster): Why is he portrayed as a guy we should sympathize with if he has killed many people before? (you can assume so and he admits it) Is he that cold-blooded that he doesn't even feel much guilt towards the end of the film? What of Dave's widowed wife and his son? Does losing his daughter now make him a mafia boss? What exactly does he 'do for a living'? Is he really straight now or in the illegal drugs business? Was he ever really straight if he was sending a dead guy's family 500 bucks every month?Sean (Cop/Detective): Why does he say he would arrest anybody even if it's his friends when speaking to the Sargent but hesitates to do so when confronted with basically an admission of guilt from Jimmy? Does this film imply that cops are afraid of mobsters? Is he for or against justice? What the heck does that ending scene mean as he finger shoots Jimmy? 'Hey, you got away this time but next time I'll get ya! Soon as I'm done being a father and a husband to my wife who came back home?' Does he feel sympathy for Dave's son or now is he taking a break and happily ever after?Dave (Tim Robbins): Do we assume he's an intelligent character? He certainly knows how to respond to the police when interrogated. Besides the stories that don't add up, wouldn't it be logical to believe that at some point he would have admitted to his wife that he beat up a molester and placed the body behind the bar before his wife left him or accused him of murder of a friends daughter? Is their relationship in that much turmoil that she confides in other men besides her own husband? Dave is obviously traumatized but he's not stupid. There is no reason to be lying and making himself look like a suspect in the murder case. At least keep the story consistent! As I was watching the movie I hypothesized that Dave KNEW who the killer was that fateful night (the mute boy) but was not going to snitch on him out of pure pity. It turns out he didn't tell the truth because he wanted to save his own ass from the discovery of a molester who he had beaten up? Then at the end he's going to save his own ass again by admitting to something he didn't do?Celeste (Dave's wife): Okay, her character is pretty stupid. Would any wife on
Earth tell the victims father, 'Hey I think my own husband murdered your daughter and I'm afraid of him'? Why not tell the cops this and stay quiet in the meantime? Why not relay this information to the cops and extract the truth out of Dave? She has no refutable evidence besides her gut feeling and some minor circumstantial evidence. Does she not believe in her husband or in a fair trial? Does she feel guilt in her husbands disappearance and 'eventual' discovery of his death?Also, Sean Penn and those mafia goons are just downright pathetic! What is this the 1940's? If you're going to intimidate someone bring more men and firepower! The Japanese Yakuza would make these guys look like bickering children! I mean they played tag with the cops in the opening scenes trying to get to Jimmy's daughter...they wouldn't dare lay a hand on the cops and now all of a sudden we're supposed to assume that the cops can't catch any of these dimwitted goons? They can't stick any charges on them? It's not like they're geniuses and run an organized crime syndicate now c'mon...This film really did suck I'm sorry to say Clint.",1,1,3,19 December 2019
Joker," We are all Jokers
","If you find yourself understanding and feeling sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck, it's because his story is sadly what could happen or has happened in today's day and age. The rich are getting richer and the poor, poorer. The middle class is shrinking and suffering. We all really try to fit into society and see those who stick to the status quo but when we have our alone time we begin to ponder and ask why we're all so different. Why are we treated different? What is wrong with me? Of course the 'Joker' is an extreme scenario, but we can begin to perceive the root causes of all human problems; and that is pure evil, greed and inequality.Joaquin Phoenix is a good man. He's a phenomenal actor and most of the story was told through action and not words. It is quite frightening how a large majority of us would be rooting for a man like this at the conclusion of this film.Heath Ledgers Joker was amazing. His joker was evil because he wanted to prove that all humans are evil and trying to create stability in society is fruitless. He was insane but rational. He was a highly intelligent man with a plan. A plan to murder the mayor. A plan to blow up a hospital or test the moralities of innocent civilians on a boat. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is evil and twisted because he had reached a point of actual insanity. Nothing he does is expected anymore and predictable. He was freed of his chains and he has no social skills. He is both intuitive and naive like a child.In 'The Dark Knight', the story was clearly a good vs evil theme but in 'Joker' we are unsure of what to label Arthur (besides being brain damaged, depressed, and suffering from PBA, psychosis and being delusional). Is he truly evil or just the result of being dealt terrible cards in life?",10,1,3,8 January 2020
The Lion King," 1994
","I was born when this movie was released. I am, therefore, blessed. One of Disney's finest productions ever 'nuff said.",10,2,2,8 January 2020
Wonder Woman," WOW
","Better than expected, theme song is great and of course Gal Gadot is 'bae'",9,3,4,11 February 2019
Black Panther," Overrated
","The overhypeness of this film killed it. Very predictable and not very entertaining. No memorable 'superhero' theme songs and a lot of plot holes. What was the point of this movie and how was it related at all to Captain America Civil War?? I have to say, I had to fight the urge of walking out of the theatres. T'Challa, Shuri, Klaw, Nakia, and W'kabi were phenomenal but this film felt like the white man's version of Africa and tried to somehow put Black Lives Matter into it? Very embarrassing. Michael B Jordan I hate to say it was sub par and overly dramatic even cringy at times.Would not watch again, I'm afraid. Would forget this movie by next year. Belongs imo in the category of one of the worst Marvel movies along with Daredevil, Fantastic Four and possibly the Ant-man series which were quite boring as well.",1,43,77,27 January 2019
The Greatest Showman," WOW
","Saw it in theatres. Honestly, 10 times better than Blah Blah Land. Worth every cent!!I love Hugh Jackman and the cast was phenomenal as well. Real talent whereas La La Land I could barely hear the music and vocals.Oh surprise! Amazing story as well!Well done.",10,1,1,27 January 2019
Fantastic Four," Not terrible
","Title says it all. Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Ioan Gruffudd prevented me from downgrading the movie to a 5/10.",7,1,4,11 February 2019
Annihilation," Uhhh
","Ending wasn't as great as it wanted you to think it was. Overall story was meh and predictable. Had great build up and suspense but lead you nowhere. Disappointing overall, but deserves a 4 out of 10 at least for the creepy and mysterious aspects. Also, I respect Natalie Portman so I won't give a 1-star rating!",4,0,2,31 January 2019
