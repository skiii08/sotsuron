Casablanca," Mesmerizing
","There are a lot of things that make this movie stand out in my mind. The first is the cast. Humphrey Bogart was never as cool as he was in this movie. Even stinking drunk and feeling sorry for himself, he oozes a kind of cool that not too many other people can match. Add to that a radiant Ingrid Bergman, and a great performance by Peter Lorre also.The second thing here is the script. A great story -- a man rediscovers his conscience by putting an old hatred to bed. Sure, Ilsa betrayed Rick in Paris, and comes to Casablanca with another man. But when Rick finally realizes that they would die for each other, he becomes a changed man, inspired by their love and willing to 'stick his neck out' to help them.The third thing, which actually is the most important thing to me, is the look of the film. The lighting is so good, and you know when you watch it that proper film lighting is a lost art. When Sam appears on screen for the first time, and the spotlight goes on him, and everybody else in the room disappears...it's just magic. It is probably one of the best-looking films I've ever seen, and even in black-and-white it is as gorgeous a film as, say, American Beauty.",Null,0,2,23 June 2004
The Godfather: Part II," Astonishing, lush film
","Godfather Part II is one of the real highlights of all film literature. Coppola manages to take a great original and somehow add to it in a way that elevates it from simply a good movie into true art.The story of Michael Corleone is dramatic in that it explores very seriously some themes that, by comparison, the first film only touches upon. Sure, it explains that Michael had a strong chance to make something of himself very far away from his father, and that he threw it all away. But in Part II we finally see the real reason why Michael's path was doomed to failure: He and his father were very different men with very different lives.The finality and veracity of that message is so effectively transmitted in film that it comes off looking like an adaptation of ancient Greek drama. And like Greek drama often does, Godfather II dramatizes a particular moral idea by taking it to extremes. The simple version of the message: Tradition itself is worthless. You can try to hold the same values from generation to generation, but times change and those values don't guide you through every new situation. Vito Corleone's experiences as a Sicilian immigrant to New York are one thing, but Michael learns some dramatically different lessons in Batista's exploited Cuba.The storytelling is so great, and so effective with the cast (especially with regard to Robert de Niro's historical reconstruction), that you can almost feel yourself walking down the streets of the Lower East Side around the turn of the century, and the memories evoked seem to erupt from your own head rather than from the screen. Great script and an even better cast make this one a must-own for true movie fanatics.",Null,0,3,2 June 2004
