The Ring," DAMN GOOD MOVIE!
","I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and thinking 'wow that movie looks creepy. Well I wasn't a bit disappointed. There are those moments (those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about) when you had to kind of ask you're self 'did I just see what I think I saw?
May contain some spoilers:From the death tape images to the 'faces' of samara's victims. Who didn't find Katie's face scary? That freaked me out the first time I saw it. I highly recommend this movie. If your going to buy or rent try to get the DVD it contains some extra footage that I think they should have kept in the movie but you know how they love to snip snip on the cutting room floor.My rating 10/10 This movie rocks!!!!",10,1,1,30 June 2003
