Frost_Nixon," Brilliant portrayal, stellar acting!
",I watched this film without knowing almost anything about the actual events that are depicted in this film. What a surprise it was! The cast did an amazing job to reflect the actual characters in history while the director did a stellar job in representing it.Would I watch it again? I don't think so. Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely!,8,0,0,21 May 2020
The Finest Hours," 9/10 for the action, 5/10 for the story
","The film really keeps you on the edge of your seat when it comes to the intense action scenes, brilliantly coupled with some great special effects. However the story, despite it being a true story, lacks anything special. I also didn't see the need for the 'love story' within the story. It could well be without it.",7,0,0,19 January 2020
