Source Code," Just to clear the confusion among audience for this excellent serious sci-fi movie
","Let me try communicate well. Quantum parallel universes are the premise of this movie and the machine built by the physicist in the movie. The thread that the soldier asked for executing the mission is in one quantum universe. He had the opportunity to enter another quantum universe in which the explosion has yet to happen. This opportunity is introduced due to the fact that the scientist is able to capture the overlap between multiverse after seizing the brain state of Sean just 8 minutes before the explosion. Multiverse overlaps when their states match at one time instance. The scientist will be able to hold on 8 minutes of another quantum universe and call the soldier back to the reference thread, as long as Sean exits the other quantum universe in a death state at the end of the 8 minutes. Otherwise, there will be difficulty, as shown in the movie. It all occurs as planned since the soldier is called back. However, the last time the solider enters a (not the) quantum universe that overlaps with the reference universe, he was terminated at the reference thread by the captain. Once the reference quantum universe vanishes according to the soldier brain state as he was put to death at the end of the 8 minutes in the main thread, the other quantum universe departs the overlap instance and Sean continues to exist in that quantum universe with all memory acquired from the reference universe (multiverse communication succeeds). Of course, once he texts the captain in that alternative quantum universe, the captain in that quantum universe will receive the text message before she actually proceeds with the mission. In the ending, the soldier realized that and informs the unaware captain and the scientist in his alternative universe about this aftermath of a successful multiverse joins and departs that is a successful multiverse communication.The movie is an accurate depiction of multiverse communication.",10,2,4,29 September 2011
Zootopia," Utopia indeed but still a masterpiece
",It's funny. It's happy. It's smart. It's nuanced. The story has all the good twists and turns. The acting voices are amazing. It has liberal propaganda but you'v got to admire its upfront attitude. It is full of detailed imagination. And scores are really good. It is maybe a bit scary for kids though. But it gives kids and adults positive attitude. I'd say it is one of the best animation of all time.,10,0,1,2 January 2020
The Village," Failing to understand the depth of this movie
","This movie has been significantly underrated because that the majority of the early critics have been failing to understand the philosophical depth. This movie uses an analogy to subtly challenge the logic, sanity and reality of predominating beliefs, if not only religious beliefs.The meetings of a group of authority figures resemble the form of church rulings. The personal tragic stories of a group of people have been exaggerated to impose a general religious-like beliefs, which resembles the witness in church phenomena. The turmoil of the ruling resembles the failing of such illogic predominating beliefs. The manipulation of the authorities indicates the reluctance of evidence-examining process for religious beliefs. The movie also show that good-wills combined with irrational interpretations could result in dysfunctional social behaviors.The director has handled the movie with all above elements and express it through conversations and actions and twists.Audiences should not approach this movie as a thrilling movie, if one does not feel or reflect on the thrills of such social unrest and religious insanity.",9,0,1,9 May 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," It's a joke
","After I finishes this one, I am thinking: this movie is produced in Hollywood? And this movie is widely praised by the American audience? This is a joke! I see many bad movies. But rarely I can find something like this: conceptually stupid, action-wise naive, and even produced with a lot of hard work!!! It's not a comic-like action movie. It looks like this movie is produced when the director has never known how to make it. Avoid this. You will find nothing inside. No emotion, No action, No inspiration, No conversation. It's just somebody doing some scratch. (I really hate to say anything more about this junk. Just to condemn it and let you guys save sometime to get movies with more meanings or more actions or more entertainings. I hope this will fill up to 10 lines for my comments.)",1,15,25,12 May 2005
