Blade Runner 2049," A diamond in the rough
","This isn't a good movie............it's a GREAT MOVIE!but, sadly it may not be for everyone. It doesn't have as much 'action' as you may think it does from the trailers and tv ads. Yet, it still manages to keep a good pace and thoroughly engaged from start to finish.The visuals and cinematography is A+, no question. Perfection.The acting/characters are great too. And, the best thing - You Don't 'Have' To See The First One To Enjoy This One",10,1,11,1 February 2018
The Hateful Eight," Great, but not his best
","I love this movie, but I still feel Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained are his best. People say it's a 'very long' movie, but me personally, I don't care as long as the movie is good. People only hate long BORING movies. With the dialogue and action that you usually get with a Tarantino movie, there's rarely ever a dull moment. The cinematography (70mm) look is just immaculate. It all looks so good. The writing/dialogue, well it's by Tarantino so obviously A+ BUT my slight issue with the film is in the 3rd Act. There was a hint of an even bigger shootout than the one you initially get in the cabin. The Domingo Gang if I remember correctly. I was getting even more excited when the villainess-Daisy of the story brought them up because I rather enjoy the Tarantino carnage. But, they're foiled as a lie and that never happens... a bit of a let down in my opinion. Still, there's so much tension in the plot once they're all in the cabin that you're wrapped in and trying to calculate what's going on along with Sam Jackson's character. It's a great movie, even though I just have a few complaints about the 3rd Act and ending. They probably won't upset anyone else and even with those complaints it's still a movie I really enjoyed and would see several times.",8,1,4,8 October 2016
Prisoners," An very under-rated film
","There are so few bad things to say about this movie, if any at all. Come to think of it, none come to mind. This film is masterfully well done in every way; from the directing, writing, acting, sound design, cinematography on down to the editing. Trust me when I say, it's a film with very few noticeable flaws. Hugh Jackman gives an insanely good performance as the father desperately searching for his daughter. Jake G honestly wasn't as stellar as Hugh, but his character was that of a calm detective trying to find the kidnapped girls. I wouldn't say he phoned it in, because his character had noticeable ticks and mannerisms that remained consistent throughout the movie. In my opinion, it's just hard not to see Jake G instead of his character like he transformed in both Nightcrawler and Southpaw. But still good acting all around. Can't forget Paul Dano and David Dastmalchain, both did stellar work. The cinematography... it's done by Roger Deakins so yeah, it's phenomenal. Denis Villeneuve proves to be a directing we all should be on the look out for in the many years to come. The writing, done by Andy Guzikowski is great. It surprises me that this isn't based on a book judging by how deep the plot goes with mystery and 'mazes'. This guy is one damn good mystery/crime writer. Basically, to sum it all up. SEE THIS MOVIE THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET! It's not good, it's great.",10,0,0,7 October 2016
