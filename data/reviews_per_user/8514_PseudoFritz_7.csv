50 First Dates," About As Good As Could Be Expected
","The only two Adam Sandler movies that I really, REALLY like are 'The Wedding Singer' and 'Punch-Drunk Love', and much of what I like about them is that Adam Sandler is in them; I can't imagine anyone other than Sandler playing either Robbie Hart or Barry Egan. With the exception of, say, the first 20 minutes, I don't see why somebody else couldn't have played Henry Roth in '50 First Dates'. Mind you, I don't necessarily think that that's a bad thing; that first part was for me the least engaging piece of this movie.What worked for me here was the romance, not the comedy. Given the rather ridiculous premise they had to work around, I thought that Henry's attempts to court and, later, to help Lucy were really rather touching. I also felt that the way their relationship went up and down and up again was honest for the situation (again, granting the the premise was absurd), and I thought that the ending was both emotionally satisfying without being a cheat (given that they could have taken the easy way out).Of course, I could have done without the puking walrus and Rob Schneider, and Henry crying his way through 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' felt like a rip-off from 'Wedding Singer', but Willy the penguin more than made up for all that.7/10 for Drew and Adam's second pairing. If they do another together, I'll make sure to see it in the theater.",7,0,0,14 September 2004
To Be or Not to Be," Fun Film! (But...)
","While I enjoyed this movie a lot, there's one thing which REALLY bugs me. The IMDb editors wouldn't accept this as a 'Goof', but I can't let it pass without comment...The plot requires that Maria meet with Sobinski in her dressing room while Joseph is delivering the 'To be or not to be' soliloquy from HAMLET, III:i. But since since Maria is playing Ophelia, THIS CANNOT BE. Ophelia is IN that scene, both immediately before and immediately after Hamlet delivers this 33-line speech. It's doubtful that she leaves the stage at all (there are no stage directions calling for an exit and re-entrance), and she would CERTAINLY be no further from the stage than the wings.OK, OK, I'm being anal. It's creative license, and like I said I DO really like the movie. But still, it seems like this ought to fall into the category of 'Factual Error', even though it's a forgivable error.",8,2,4,15 July 2009
The Great Dictator," This Movie Has Lumps.
","Maybe this was *An Important Movie* and that's why people rank it so highly, but honestly it isn't very good. In hindsight it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos, so you can't fault him TOO much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnect remains.More disappointingly, the movie is just clunky; it's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era. The set pieces, those involving both the Jewish Barber and the Dictator, don't flow into each other; they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts, moving SOMEWHERE but never arriving at resolution. Some are funny, some less so.What charm the movie has is strictly in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing, and there's no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch. But virtually everything he surrounded himself with was ANNOYING. Hannah was TOO DAMN American. The Storm Troopers were TOO DAMN American.Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I don't know what purpose was served by having Garbage be the source of evil behind the throne. It almost seems like the film is saying that, if it weren't for malign influences like Garbage, Hynckle wouldn't have been that bad a guy.",4,24,51,8 August 2006
Pi," Just a Thought
","I watched 'Pi' for the first time in a number of years yesterday, and I was struck with a reference that I had never noticed before.In Max's first meeting with Sol over the Go board, Sol asks Max whether he had gotten around to reading 'Hamlet' (which Saul had previously recommended, presumably). It can't just be coincidence that 'Hamlet', like 'Pi', is ALSO about a 'haunted' young intellectual who THINKS TOO MUCH.Both Shakespeare's play and Aronovsky's film deal with the frustrations of trying to understand the fundamentally-irrational through the use of reason. In Hamlet's case, it means trying to reconcile a supernatural call for vengeance with Rationalist philosophy. In Max's case, it means trying to reduce all of Nature - even the True Name of God! - to a mathematical principle. Both Hamlet and Max are driven to (beyond?) the edge of sanity by their labors.So Sol's recommendation that Max read 'Hamlet' is not merely to give him something to take his mind off his work, but is in fact a veiled warning against the path he sees Max heading out on.PS: I also wonder if it's a coincidence that Max's mentor is named 'Sol'; Max is too close to 'the sun', after all.",10,2,5,20 January 2009
Blade Runner," Some Thoughts After Viewing the Final Cut
","Blade Runner in any version is an excellent movie, and I've now seen 4 versions - the original theatrical release, the little-seen 'compromise cut', the Director's Cut, and now the Final Cut. If you've seen the DC, there's not much in the FC which makes it essential, other than a few digital tweaks and some polishing of continuity.One reason I'd feared the Final Cut for two years is that I'd heard that Ridley Scott definitively resolved the question of Deckard's own nature (making the movie conform to statements he's made in public), but I prefer to leave the issue ambiguous. I needn't have worried, it seems.Anyone who has seen the movie and still thinks of Replicants as 'machines' is repeating Deckard's own mistake from early in the movie. 'More Human Than Human' is an apt description. They have been engineered, while we in 'real life' have been assembled haphazardly over millions of years, but they rely on the same physical, biological processes we do. If you prick them, do they not bleed? If you wrong them, do they not revenge? The Tyrell Corp. does not manufacture robots, it creates human life. But instead of our own three-score-and-ten, Replicants are 'born' and die in only four years.I've never taken Bryant's explanation of the 4-year lifespan, as he explains it to Deckard, as truth. From Tyrell's meeting with Roy, I believe that HE speaks truth - 'You were made as well as we could make you.' The nature of Homo fabricans, though, is such that it CAN'T live longer than 48 months. So Tyrell took what had been an unavoidable limitation in his creation, and sold it as a Special Design Feature - the fail-safe.So in the end, it really doesn't matter whether Deckard is or is not a Replicant. Either way, he and Roy are the same, and the end comes when both of them realize that.If my theory is true, of course, then the happy ending tacked onto the studio release 'Rachael is a special case - no termination date' is unsupportable. As the couple flee, there's no hope for 'happily ever after', but there remains the prospect of being together for as long as they both shall live, and of course EITHER of them could get hit by a truck next time they cross the street... 'It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?'",10,4,9,2 September 2009
Toy Story 3," To Finality (and Beyond?)
","To admit that 'Toy Story 3' wasn't quite everything that I'd HOPED it would be doesn't mean that it wasn't as good as I EXPECTED, and my expectations were high. Of course, eventually Pixar will put out a bad movie (at least bad by their high standards), but I was confident that this wouldn't be it. 'Toy Story' is the franchise, and more importantly it's John Lasseter's baby, and John Lasseter would not have allowed a bad 'Toy Story' film to be made.The first 20 minutes or so, as the gang's current situation was being explained, had me fighting back sobs (I was far from the only one in the theater struggling so), and in the last 20 minutes (from the 'circle of hands' moment until the end of the movie), I stopped fighting. But the hour in the middle left me kind of...'Well, OK, I guess we HAVE to have a plot.' There were plenty of good moments during that hour, but the whole struck me as somewhat recycled: the 'Do we trust Woody or not?' moments were too reminiscent of the first movie, and the early arguments about whether they owed it to Andy to escape from the Day Care center were too similar to the ones in 'TS2' (even though the speakers were reversed). Lotso's backstory wasn't nearly as powerful as Jesse's song about Emily in '2', and I think Lotso would have been MORE compelling as an adversary if he were MORE tragic.Again, though, it started strong and ended PERFECTLY, and whatever I felt was weak about the middle I can easily overlook.Those who've said that the movie might not really be appropriate for younger kids have a point, I think, but while it could perhaps be argued that the movie should have carried a PG rather than G rating, I wouldn't for the world have wanted Pixar to tone it down to make it kid-safe. Yeah, if your 5 year-old loves the first two films from watching them at home, it might still be a good idea to wait a few years before exposing him/her to this one. Despite leaving the door open for 'Toy Story 4: A New Beginning', this is a movie about endings. It's about change and loss and saying goodbye, and this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody because these seeds were sewn in the previous chapter.I said earlier that it's inevitable that Pixar will eventually make a bad movie, but when they do I hope they fail by trying something too different, rather than by playing it too safe. I'd love to see Pixar make a movie that's DELIBERATELY not intended for children. As it stands, the name 'Pixar' means both 'You know it's going to be good' and 'Bring the kids.' But there are things they could be doing with digital film-making other than making 'Family-Friendly' entertainment. You know, something like 'Avatar', maybe, except GOOD. Disney established Touchstone as a separate imprint so they could put out movies that were too 'adult' for the Disney signature. I'd like to see them try some things that would be more appropriate for 'Touchstone/Pixar' than 'Disney/Pixar.'",9,0,1,19 June 2010
The Wedding Singer," The Ups and Downs of Love
","To repeat a theme, I'm not a big fan of Adam Sandler, but I love this movie.Robbie Hart is a genuinely likable character; he's a person I would like to have as a friend, and he's a performer I would gladly hire to sing at my OWN wedding (Sandler also seems completely comfortable with his character, while even Drew Barrymore sometimes sounds like she's merely reciting written dialogue). Yes, he's a capital-R Romantic, but that seems like a strong qualification for someone who makes his living at other people's weddings. I like the whole idea of a romantic comedy being set behind the scenes of the whole wedding game, and some of the most telling scenes involve Robbie guiding Julia through the preparations with an insider's eye.Probably the funniest parts of the movie (to me) are those that play to Robbie's broken heart; it's probably the best depiction of the depression of the newly-dumped I've ever seen (in particular, I love the 'Kill Me Please' song). Hey, I've been there.This all being said, however, I think the touch-all-the-landmarks-of-the-mid-'80s approach gets awfully heavy-handed at times. The musical choices, though, were excellent.",9,44,59,31 August 2004
