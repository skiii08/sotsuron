Black Swan," Psychological thriller
",How cinema really makes an impact in life! Some story may give you some messages or some may be the real life implications. Some touch your mind and make u realize some fact. But rarely some touch your soul and make u feel of being human. Black swan is a cinema sculpture which touches your inner soul with its feathers. It's a real psychological thriller horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky. This film is about a struggling dancer who dedicates her life to dance. She works hard for d role of swan queen in the starting play of the season And she gets it quite easily. But the real problem begins after getting the lead role. She gets sick because of her continuous practice. The story tells about how the pressure of the role affects her mental and physical health. She feels the feathers of black swan growing on her own body. Before the stage show she cut herself and presents the dance very gracefully. It's one of the most impressive films I have ever seen in my life. -MJ,10,0,1,29 July 2014
