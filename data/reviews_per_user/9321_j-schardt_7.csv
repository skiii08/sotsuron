Casablanca," I'm Lost
","Im lost; is pretty mush the feeling I had until about an hour or so into the movie.You can figure out some part's, like rick owns the club, and the Germans are invading, and there some girl that he use to know has just returned. Thats about all I understood until ricks little flashback scene to Paris. I enjoyed Rick's character and the character of the piano player but other than that I was not impressed. One thing this movie made clear is that they use to drink and smoke a lot. Just about every scene there doing both, constantly. The relationship between Rick and Ilsa Lund does get a little more interesting when you find out there history but in the end Rick doesn't end up with here so who care's? yeah he did the right thing because he knew she'd have a better life with Victor Laszlo but that just ruined the movie for me. Maby is just me but I wanted Ilsa to end up with Rick. I thought movie should have given a little more background info a little earlier and the film would have been much more enjoyable.",3,4,13,1 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Too high of expectations
","If one of my friends had called me said lets watch this cool famous movie I would have enjoyed it a lot more. Instead my friend called me and said lets watch the greatest film ever made. Thats what I was excepting and I felt It caused me to judge the movie to hard. The film is great, the fast-past plot that jumps from past from present almost every other scene. Normally that would be sort of confusing to the viewers but this director did it. How he did that may be the reason this movie is considered so great but there's more. The cinematography in this movie is done just as well as the film jumps from past to present. In fact the wonderful cinematography is one of the main reason it jumps from past to present so well. The cinematography really makes you feel like your looking in on this actual mans real life. The story its self also makes this a great film. Who wouldn't be interested in a story about an extremely wealthy man who ends up with nothing. The acting is also top notch in this film. From Orson Welles character to the butler who was with him at the end all deliver powerful performances. All these things I picked up on and enjoyed yet Citizen Kane(1941) still didn't live up to my expectations. I wish no one would have ever told me about this film before I saw it, but overall i defiantly enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again.",7,0,2,8 March 2010
Taxi Driver," De Niro I've never seen
","Taxi Driver had Robert De Niro play a role I've never seen him play before and maybe thats why I found this film so unusual. For the first twenty minutes or so you really have no idea what is going on, and that sort of the feeling I had through out the whole film. Yah there's this crazy guy who can't sleep, and wants to kill some important political figure, and is crazy about this girl. Thats about all I got from it. Id really need to watch this film a couple of times to try and grasp the message but as of right now I have no idea where Scorsese was trying to go with it. The things that just didn't sit right with me is why he brought the girl to the porno theater. Yah he might be a crazy mentally disappeared guy, but he still should have the common sense to not take a girl to a porno film. That part just drove me crazy. The second issue I had was how the hell did he survive that ordeal when he went in to free Jodie Foster character, and if he did survive how could they let him back into civilian population. Just didn't make sense to me. There were some positives I like all the POV shots and for a color film. I thought they did a great job of lighting, and all though i didn't understand De Niro's character I though he did a great job of making a believable crazy person. All though from first impression I didn't enjoy this film I would like to watch it again and maybe more grasp the message Scorsese is trying to send.",5,3,9,28 April 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Oh my God
","I had seen parts and heard sound clips over the years in different types of media of some of R. Lee Ermey famous role in Full Metal Jacket, but watching the whole thing go on in on is a totally different experience. I haven't heard one man express so much hate in my entire life, I think every man should be required to watch the scene before the sign up for the Army. He is so intense and crazy that can you really blame Pyle for snapping like he did I know I couldn't. Not only is the dialog in this movie well done the cinematography is breath taking. Even the shots at boot camp are done well, the scene shot is the sunset orange is beautiful. When the actually get to the war its even better. I don't know where they shot but it looks perfectly like the wore torn Vietnam I imagine in my history classes when we learned about the chaos that took place. Not only that but this film is probably the first War film to perfectly capture the feelings soldiers feel while at war since All Quite On The Western Front. Powerful scene of death and people losing control it countiue on throughout the film and they perfect capture the feeling of the soldiers at the time at the Vietnam war ; Shouldn't they fight there own war. The different character the come in and out of the film really captures all the different types of soldiers there are. The first scene of the film is extremely intense and long and it sets the tone for the entire movie. The scene when Joker shoots the girl sniper is so long and played out to really drag out the emotions in you. This is a very powerful and well done film that I would recommend to anyone.",7,0,0,10 May 2010
Fargo," good film
","This was one of the first Coen brother film I had seen and now want to see more. They did a great job verisimilitude or making everything seem real. When the bar owner shoveling his drive way has the conversation with the cop, I could have swore that neither of them were actors and there just happened to be a camera there. The film has a very simple vibe where nothing dramatic ever happens that often yet when it does happen it makes it that more dramatic which may sound silly and obvious but if you watch the film you'll get what I'm saying. The film has the wonderful mid-west vibe to it which the over exacerbated accents really add too. It adds this great humor to the film which really helps you get through all the slower more informative parts of the film. Not only that but the story it self is all over the place leaving you thinking there no way this simple pregnant women can solve this murder. Yet when it all come together for her you get to really see how she just slowly but surely figure out every little detail to the case. Then they add mystery too it because they never even address the money once the only character who knew it was there died. Great acting, great plot, great story and all the other things I address's add up to make this one of my all time favorite films.",7,0,0,10 May 2010
The Graduate," loved it
","Just a great film, and by far my favorite film I have watched yet in my American cinema history class. Right away you get a taste for what great cinematography your going to experience, the shot where Dustin Hoffman first arrives at airport and the camera stays with the his luggage bag for an extended period of times. Thats just the beginning and its gets better from there. Right away you also notice the great photography every shots lighting perfectly fits in with the scene. The editing tricks in this film are also mind blowing. The scene when he jumps on the raft, then it cuts to Hoffman jumping in bed with Mrs. Robinson, then back to him when you hear his dad voice. That was just one of the few examples of fantastic editing. The acting was also great in this film. Have only seen Hoffman before in his role as Rain man, I was already a fan but his performance in this may rival his performance in Rain man. Mrs. Robinson was just as good and I was even more surprise to see her daughter actually look like a younger version of her. The film was funny, dramatic, sad, shocking, and the list could go on and on. This film had a little bit of everything and thats is just part of the reason why it was so go. The film had a strong social message that at the time an entire generation could relate to, and the youth of today can still relate too. I related to it just because of the pressure I feel from my parents is very similar to what Hoffman was going through. Not only did this film reach out to youth, it show to parents that they need to be careful how much pressure they put on there kids. I wish films like this were still made today, and I feel everyone at someone point should watch the Graduate.",10,1,1,28 April 2010
Psycho," Hitchcock at his best
","Alfred Hitchcock was knick named the master of suspense and he definitely lived up to it. Psycho possibly one of the most famous thriller films of all time is a classic that should be study by all film makers. The editing with the combination of the photography and cinematography and the music score is what makes this film so good. The music is what jumps right out you and you wont ever forget. The film gives off a extremely creepy, scary vibe through out the whole film. The shower scene when the girl is murdered still gives me the chills and I've seen it millions of times. This classic Hitchcock has you terrified of a mean old mother that you barely see through out the film. The house Norman lives in set the standard for what creepy old house's should look like in Hollywood. The creepy vibe Norman gives off is not as powerful but you still feel it. Having him chew on candies was the perfect touch. The low angle of him with the stuffed birds over his head really add to his creepiness factor. Hitchcock in this excellent film also throws in a huge twist that no one ever see's coming. I really felt like Norman stole the show as far as the acting went, but I thought Lila Crane was also very believable. A very scary thrilling film that will leave you on the edge of your seat, that is a must see for any scary movie fan,",Null,0,1,28 April 2010
