Casablanca," A Classic Love story
","Not truly a fan of Love stories like these, very dramatic and for me that can get kind of annoying after a while, personally I felt like it dragged on for a little to long. Though I can see why so many people fell for i, trust me if I would have been more into romantic stories I would have fallen for this one and possibly even called a favorite, the story was really well written with a lovely twist at the end that would make any girl swoon.There was lovely use of Lighting, like really good, with showing both characters and their emotions by the darkness, the lightness, the different shapes the lights took on the characters, all of it was so well put together it definitely helped make the movie. The cinematography and setting also created the alluring romance of the movie. With the great bar scenes and busyness of the town, as well as the airplane scenes, it was all really well done.",7,0,1,21 October 2015
Chinatown," It's Chinatown
","The way this movie was shot was so good. I learned about a few of the ways they took the advancement in technology in the 70's and used it in this movie, it all fit the time period though very well, like nothing to fancy all of it was just right. For example one of the techniques was using a hand-held camera to really get in on tight spots so you could feel as if you were with the characters as they experienced some moment. The acting by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson was really great and the chemistry they had on screen was flawless. And the movie was supposed to take place in the thirties so you'd think they wanted to go artistic and make it black and white, but the color looked really good and suited the movie just fine. A really good movie overall.",8,2,3,17 December 2015
The Graduate," The best coming of age story
","Just after watching I see why this movie is a classic. Really it was such a treat to watch this, and now I can say I've watched this, it just feels special. The story was intriguing and oddly relateable (only some parts of course. the acting, especially Dustin Hoffman, was remarkable, really believable, just hearing the awkwardness in his voice made all the jokes and jabs in this movie even more hilarious. Also so many iconic shots finally explained to me. Seeing it later in life, I had seen so many spoofs or parodies of the shots in this movie I had felt like I'd already seen the whole movie. But such great technique, a must watch for all.",10,1,2,17 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Singing in the rain, and other places too
","Not a fan of musicals really, but this movie was an exception. The songs were so catchy, and the choreography and settings were executed really well. The acting was also done really, really well, Gene Kelly brought the whole movie together with his wonderful moves, and great voice. The other main character Debbie Renolds totally didn't show her green-ness at all, her moves and voice went right along with Kelly, she did really well keeping up. The movie itself had really great bright colors, and memorable settings and backgrounds that were just as colorful and belonged in that movie.The directing you could tell was done so well , to really make the movie a masterpiece.",9,1,3,17 December 2015
