Hereditary," This film is dark
","Crushing sense of dread. The twists and turns in the plot are excellent. The story is truly horrifying. Not recommended for people who want a fun time with jump scares. This movie is like Rosemary's Baby turned up to 11. Don't think I'll ever watch it again, but in a way I feel that's a compliment to the filmmaker.",8,1,3,23 April 2019
Train to Busan," One of the best modern zombie movies
","Train to Busan is a simple yet effective film. The visual storytelling is excellent. Objectives are clear, great pacing, the characters make decisions, decisions that have some semblance of internal logic guiding them. The main characters have arcs, and the action is tense and exciting. There are a few memorable and well written escape/tactical scenarios that are lacking in a lot of action movies today.",8,1,3,23 April 2019
Lost in Translation," Beautiful Colour Palette
",Japan is stunning. Breathtaking shots of the city peppered throughout the entirety of this melancholic and romantic film. Amazing shots that other directors might overuse. However Sofia Coppola applies such moments sparingly to encourage our desire to see more. Perfectly complimenting the understated nature of the film. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are both easy to love. The way they hold back and playfully engage with one another and their surroundings is enjoyable to watch. Beautiful movie.,9,1,4,31 July 2019
Get Out," Really fun, definitely creepy
","The dialogue can feel a bit clumsy and not as nuanced as advertised. The subtle racism isn't all that subtle and cheapens the desired affect. The first 40 mins are a bit slow and by far the most conventional. However, after this point the film really begins to take stride and Peele begins to amp up the growing sense of anxiety of Chris' situation. Satisfying resolutions.",8,1,6,31 July 2019
The Lion King," Disappointing
",CGI animation is impressive. But this movie prioritizes sensory stimulation and neglects the heart.,5,4,6,11 August 2019
Mother!," Great filmmaking, cynical worldview
","Brilliantly made film, however it spreads a cliche, hackneyed worldview. It reminds me of a much less sophisticated version of Samuel Beckett's 'Endgame'. God is made out to be an arrogant, blind, insane, extremely narcissistic figure. Humankind is utterly chaotic and nothing more than a self absorbed plague on the planet designed to obsessively praise a mad God with total disregard for the planet, which houses, and feeds them. What is the implication? Genocide? Suicide? The development of a secular value system that would undoubtedly devolve into the same dogma and radicalism that we all despise about religion? The film is clever and even true on some levels, but has no grasp of how deep evil runs in world. Blaming environmental catastrophe on religion is cute. This film is so frustratingly cynical, nihlistic and worst of all, one dimensional. As all propagandic material is. I don't like the content of the film, but the technical skills like cinematograpghy, pacing, and acting are all excellent. And of course there is value in having your own worldview challenged.",5,0,2,23 April 2019
Life," Entertaining but frustrating
","There is some devestating body horror and the story moves along swiftly. For sci-fi it's not all that thought provoking, but the action works and all the cast take their roles seriously. I'd say the running time is just short enough before becoming overly tedious.",6,1,3,23 April 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," One clever idea
","In a time where horror is so poorly executed so frequently, perhaps unparalleled by any other genre for sheer number of replicate movies with all the same beats and all the same scares and all the same characters; this film tries to poke fun at how mundane it's all become. This movie relishes messing with audience expectations and disrupting the casual way we consume such unoriginal content. However, the ideas underpinning the subversion are not as strong as Whedon and company have convinced themselves. There's no weight to this film, it feels cynical just for the sake of being cynical. And while justly pointing out the flaws of the genre, offers no scares, no horror in return. It's just a parody with a big budget and perhaps would have worked much better as a short film.",5,3,5,11 August 2019
