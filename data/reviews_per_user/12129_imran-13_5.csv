Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sacha is funniest
","I'm a hard core Sacha Cohen fan. I'm watching Ali G / Borat long before this movie was made. This movie imports many ideas from the Ali G show, e.g. pubic joke, learned etiquettes, using his sister etc. etc. He still added some new jokes and movie is hilarious. That's the point.I don't see movies to get educated. I don't see Borat as a documentary. I don't care if it is politically wrong. I don't like overnight experts of Borat who watched his movie only. It made me laugh, just like Ali G show. I don't care what any body think of me or him. I like Borat humor, how offensive he is and how he can say just any thing. I'm from a Muslim family and I was taught, subtle and not-so-subtle way that Jews are 'very bad people'. Maybe Borat drive little close to home? Maybe I see myself in Borat (what I could've been, if I didn't get educated), Maybe I see my relatives in him. Whatever, I find myself laughing uncontrollably when I saw Borat.Sacha remains my favorite comedian. And this DVD goes in my collection, along with Borat clips in my youtube account. Sexy time.

Inglourious Basterds," Better than other movies nowadays, but still, meh
","Hollywood ran out of good ideas last year. This year they have some good ideas which they blow completely. (District 9, Gamer) but this, oldest idea, WW2 movie turned out not that bad!

Not my thing but I knew it would be there - Fun dialogues - Brad Pitt. Ladies dig him. Still. And he is bit above average performer</li></ul><ul><li>A farmer sheltering Jews.

2012," I loved this
","It is an awesome movie!! I read some comments that it's all about special effects and nothing else. Baloney! FX are great but story, character building is better. Lots of jokes, serious stuff, good, bad, conspiracy, selfishness, selflessness, all is in there. A good story to the point of disaster is very interesting, and the disaster after disaster...oh man. It is like Armageddon. Cinemas are still running show after every hour. Yet for a week it was sold out. Now I know why....2 solid hours of breath taking entertainment. If you want that go see it.",9,1,3,21 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Watch ONLY if you've read the book and have NOT seen trailers
","I watched this movie with my wife, who is a fan and have read the books. Pace was slow, and fast. Romantic wannabe scenes were drawn too long, plot details were skipped too fast. Trailer had 'adrenaline'. Movie had none. Most of the movie I wish I was somewhere else. Some jokes were funny but that's it. I knew Jacob is a ware wolf. Trailer gave away the only thing that I'd love. If I wanted to know, I would've read the book....I kept asking my wife when we came home about unexplained plot details and she explained that Vampires:<ul><li>Every vampire had certain powers, which they sorta did when they were human. Now as vampires they're 10 fold</li></ul><ul><li>Alice can see future, bits and pieces. She was considered a witch and tortured until she was made a vampire and those powers became 10 fold. </li></ul><ul><li>Edward could read minds except Bella's, which intrigued him</li></ul><ul><li>Jasper can lighten or sadden the mood of room. He was newest hence couldn't resist human blood as well as other Collins...</li></ul><ul><li>They chose frock because it's the wettest place in America and very less sun will keep them disguised. </li></ul>Werewolves: <ul><li>Mother nature balance, they're vampire killers. Kids of town having vampires start turning into ware-wolves after they hit puberty. </li></ul><ul><li>Vampires could NOT feel their presence (genetically or something, Ware wolves can fee vampire's) and hence Alice could NOT see them in her premonitions. That is why she saw Bella falling down, Victoria swimming towards her but couldn't see Jacob saving her.</li></ul><ul><li>Jacob's father didn't become ware-wolf because there were no vampires when he hit his puberty. </li></ul>The ELDER Vampires (whatever their name was) wanted to kill Bella because even as a human, she's so powerful that vampires like Edward can't read her mind or cause her pain, imagine those powers 10 times with Bella as a vampire may not be too good for vampire clan, and may become obvious. That's why they were curious to see her and then were convinced to kill her. After knowing all this, movie made some sense to me and I kinda like it. Else it was 1 / 10. That's why I recommend read a book or know book summary, THEN see this movie. I love portrayal of mythical creatures like harry potter / LOTR, even if it's for vampires. Book to Movie Adaptation: It's no Lord of the Rings.What I do NOT understand, why they wanted to kill Edward? And how long a distance vampire / ware wolf can detect another vampire? Town? From Twilight, why Jason, Vistoria's love, HAD to eat Bella and Bella only? Somewhat that protected food? What I wanted to see was Victoria scaring us all by kidnapping Bella (who loves to walk alone in spooky forests), standing over her, a little beating, tasting her 'dessert' a bit as revenge, then Edward and Werewolves joining powers to rescue her. Or at least in Bella's window for a scare. Not stupid elders and boring love trio. It is a chick flick, and lot of noisy chicks were in the theatre. It was fun to watch movie with hard core fans.",5,0,3,21 November 2009
Garden State," Unforgettable
","This movie rocks!!! Reason: Natalie Portman! She is the best actresses of our time.Other cast is not bad, but she overshadows every one. In fact movie becomes interesting after her appearance. Fact that I'm still chuckling thinking about it means it rocks. And I watched it a week ago. Art of story telling is revived. Simple story about ordinary people. No explosion, no murder, no guns. Lots of 'losers'. Still rocks. You'll laugh. You may cry. But you'll love it. Definitely a collectible DVD.",10,0,2,9 August 2006
