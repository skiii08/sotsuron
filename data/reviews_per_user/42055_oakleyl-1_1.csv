United 93," A tribute to the heroism and courage of the passengers of Flt 93
","No one should be afraid to see this movie. It is truly an emotional ride, but the courage and presence of mind of the passengers/hostages of United Flight 93 makes them, in my mind, true heroes. They were not victims of a hijacking. They were the true martyrs for a higher cause, not the terrorists. They gave their lives as a sacrifice to save others on the ground from what the terrorists had planned. Their families should be proud of them. The only criticism I have is the use of the 'f' word by one of the actors. The character the actor portrayed was a man of faith and the actor did him and his family a disservice by uttering that word. I can't imagine the real person he portrayed would have uttered it, even under those circumstances. Except for that, the movie was a very moving tribute to 40 (minus the terrorists) very brave people.",10,2,5,1 May 2006
