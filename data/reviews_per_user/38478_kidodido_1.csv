Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Only redeeming feature is the fight scene!
","There are two kinds of people - those who love Jar Jar Binks and those who hate Satan Incarnate. Needless to say, I'm one of the latter. It is impossible to believe that anyone who wrote the first three movies could write this tripe. They went through all that trouble to paint Darth Maul's face intricately and promote him heavily in the trailer and then he spits out two lines and is dead. His last fight scene is the only thing worth watching.",4,0,1,11 December 2000
