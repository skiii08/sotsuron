Deepwater Horizon," Now this is a good movie about a real natural disaster!
","Here was a movie that I was hyped to watch. I mean it has some bad ass actors in it, plus it's about a natural disaster that still has impacts on the ecosystem and society still to this day. We get to learn about a stupid company and watch a great movie at the same time. It's a win win right? Hmmm.Pros: This movie had some great dialogue and scenes throughout, not to mention the acting was great too. The action scenes were done nice and had some spot on music to go with them. It was like you where watching it happen when it happened, it was a cool an angry experience. The moments when Kate Hudson was in the film she did a great job with her emotions. Director Peter Berg is coming along very well as Michael Bay 2.0. Cons: Dammit people why not over 2 hours long. I can think of 3 or 4 more scenes that could have been added into the film to make me go from an 8 to a 9 instantly. Honestly like I said Kate Hudson was so good during her scenes she deserved more of them too. Some of the music was re-used for a few action sequences, made it seem like I was watching the same scene twice.",8,1,2,11 January 2017
