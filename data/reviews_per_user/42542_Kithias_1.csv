The Blair Witch Project," Scariest movie...ever.
","Man, what a scary flick. How subtle, how slick. How well thought out and how very well acted. This movie gripped me deep inside and wouldnt let go. Every passing minute the movie got more and more intense, and all I can say about the last 20 minutes is: woah. I have never sweated fear. If you want to be terrified, if you want to lose some sleep, then see this movie!",10,1,2,23 July 1999
