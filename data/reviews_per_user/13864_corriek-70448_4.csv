Audience REACTIONS at its North American PREMIERE:
😄😄😄😄😄 (5 laughs)
😱 (1 shock)
🏆 (strong Oscar potential)Joker (Todd Phillips) provides a divergent take on perhaps the world's most famous fictional villain. Incredibly adept at world building, the film portrays the spirit of the character and the society that failed him through the imagery of the dark city, Gotham. The director described the film as a 'slow burn', and it was indeed a very slow burn. One should go into the film expecting something very different than the superhero movies we already know the Joker from. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal provides a humanizing origin for the villain. While the viewer knows the character ultimately becomes a villain, it is easy to forget that, seeing instead a troubled man in a broken society; someone who just needed some compassion and kindness. Raising questions about the failings of our own society, it calls for introspection. Joker can first appear bland, but the more one considers it, the more deeply it is felt.",7,1,1,13 October 2019

🏆TIFF Peoples Choice 1st Runner Up
🏆(strong Oscar potential for: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress - Scarlett Johansson, Best Actor - Adam Driver, Best Supporting Actress - Laura Dern, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing)Marriage Story (Noah Baumbach) is a raw and deeply real portrayal of love, divorce, and family. It is a combination of a love story, screwball comedy, musical, and procedural drama. While the blend of styles at a point comes across as forced, the film as a whole is a brilliant work, telling a story rather than following the genre troupes many films fall into. This is a simple story originally executed.Extremely character driven, the cast play their roles perfectly. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver lead the balanced portrayal of a divorcing couple. This film will impact viewers differently depending on many factors, especially their life stage and past experiences with relationships, marriage, and divorce. The film is so well balanced that one viewer will relate more to one character while the person beside them may be more drawn to the other. Regardless of which lead you relate to more, you are bound to be shaken by the deeply emotional performances of both.A nod to the cast would be incomplete without a special mention for Laura Dern and Ray Liotta whose characters come to life in significant scenes of their own. The director shared at TIFF that at many times during filming he felt like he was watching the actor's movie rather than his and this truly shines through in their collective performance. Out of the many films we saw in Toronto over two weeks, Marriage Story likely has the best odds for this year's Oscar wins.",9,6,18,30 November 2019

🏆Strong Oscar potential
🏆TIFF People's Choice Award WinnerJojo Rabbit (Taika Waititi) is brilliantly funny, securing it the Grolsch People's Choice Award, an obvious choice based on audience reaction during the screenings. There were more scenes of audible laughter than in any other film we saw. Our last film of the festival, we were watching this film as it was being awarded the landmark award of the festival; a consummate way to close off the festival!Set in Germany during the Second World War, Jojo Rabbit is vastly different than the films we think of from this setting. Some will argue that it makes light of the horrors of the time. It is frivolous in its interpretation of the superhero status of Hitler (portrayed as the young character's imaginary friend Adolf) as well as the horrid descriptions of Jews. Some viewers may find this unsettling.While it is certainly much lighter than we would expect from a film on Nazi Germany, there are lessons of acceptance under the humour. From a child's perspective, we can see the effects of propaganda and brainwashing by the state, and the power of personal relationships in changing that narrative. With witty pacing and a dynamic cast, the characters become larger-than-life, but balance with each other in the point of view of a young boy.While this film will be one of the more controversial of the year, it is undoubtedly funny, and is sure to be a crowd pleaser. You are sure to laugh your way through the film and discuss it long after.",9,42,110,13 October 2019
