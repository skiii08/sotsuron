Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I loved it
","Borat was a great movie, in my opinion. It was crass, rude, vulgar, contained nudity, and was very well done.This was probably one of the most pro Semitic movies i have ever seen... the stark contrast between the sweet older Jewish couple in the B&B when compared to Borat's racism showed just how silly racism really is. Bigotry was a source of humor in this movie because it shows how petty it is, and so don't be so easily offended. Sometimes, it's good to have a movie that allows us to laugh at our prejudices, as a means of cutting them down. And it was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life.",10,1,21,9 January 2007
