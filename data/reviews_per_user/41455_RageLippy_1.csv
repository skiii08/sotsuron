Lucky Number Slevin," Painfully overdone.
","This movie tries entirely too hard to be clever. Everything that comes out of Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, or Lucy Liu's mouth is clearly written with the intent of attracting reviews that describe the movie as 'witty' or 'clever'. There's no real substance to this movie, or anything the characters say. The way the characters present themselves is unbelievably annoying. If you enjoy *good* movies, I don't recommend this. If you enjoy slashers, teen comedies, or possibly romantic comedies, this might be more up your ally. I'm not saying it's *terrible*, I'm saying it's trying WAY too hard to look clever, when it's just... well... it's not.",5,4,9,14 March 2007
