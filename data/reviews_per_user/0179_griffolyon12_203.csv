The King's Speech," Talk like a King!
","Most men can speak, though not many actually have a voice. Now, take this for example: What if one has a voice, but is unable to speak? What does one do? That is the central idea of director Tom Hooper's movie, The King's Speech, featuring magnificent performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, as King George VI (Firth), the King of England who stammered, and speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Rush).George VI was the King of Great Britain during the second World War, and well known for being the father of current Queen of England, Elizabeth. What this movie deals with isn't the usual propaganda material to try and make you think how majestic or grand a king he was, but it is the opposite, it shows all of his weaknesses to let us know that even someone as great as that is still human, that the human triumphs of bravery and determination can overpower any of our own shortcomings. Yes, even a stutter.The most magnificent part of the movie is the relationship between George and Logue, as the two men develop a friendship whilst Logue tries to teach George how to talk like a king should. The saddest part, is that people don't want to hear a king who stutters, so he must agonizingly torture himself in his own fears and self-pity, but that is a different matter altogether, what is the matter of the movie is how the unorthodox relationship between Logue and George is what actually makes George the king he becomes. Yes, George manages to overcome his stutter when it comes time for him to deliver his first wartime speech deriding Hitler in the climax, but Logue actually gives George the confidence that he is a brave and strong man worthy to be king. George is continuously throughout the movie plagued with doubts about whether or not he could be king because of his disability, but Logue manages to use psychology to get to know the man beneath the stutter, and we as the audience agree with Logue when George's brother, David abdicates the throne of England in order for George to be the king England deserves.Sad to say, the movie often drags in the moments where it deals more so with world history and less with George's impediment, in particular the long scenes in the middle when George's father dies, which could have easily been handled in a simple line of expositional dialogue and kept us more so in the story of George's and Logue's friendship. Regardless, this is a special movie that is uplifting, enjoyable, and filled with marvelous acting performances, myself being quite frankly stunned by Guy Pearce's portrayal as George's brother David or Timothy Spall's invigorating role as Winston Churchill.I give The King's Speech a 9 out of 10!",9,1,3,20 January 2011
The Avengers," Earth's Mightiest Heroes Unite, and it is Awesome!
","Imagine taking only the best parts of each individual Marvel superhero movie, and then putting them all into one movie. That is Marvel's The Avengers, the first ever superhero cross-over movie. In The Avengers, Thor's brother Loki comes to Earth, seeking a cosmic cube known as the Tesseract, which acts as a doorway between realms of reality. Loki steals the cube to unleash an alien army, bent on trying to take over the world, and the Earth's Mightiest Heroes: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk, must unite to stop him as The Avengers. It's a simple plot, and writer/director Joss Whedon doesn't try to make it any more complex than it needs to be, because he would rather shift the focus to bringing the characters together and giving each character significant development. That is what is so spectacular about The Avengers, it is like the superhero equivalent of Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven. Evil bandits (aliens) are going to attack a town (Earth) and the town must recruit a series of defenders (The Avengers) to protect them when the attack comes. What separates The Avengers from other superhero movies though, is the fact that it is bringing together Robert Downey, Jr.'s Iron Man with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, and Chris Evan's Captain America. The movie gives each character an equal amount of the spotlight, allowing each individual character a moment to shine, and shows an arc for each character as the movie progresses. Whether it is Iron Man realizing that a true hero must be selfless and not self-obsessed, or Captain America realizing that his blind faith in the government is not always the right way. Joss Whedon deserves huge kudos for making this all work, with a sizzling script that is clever and witty, and a great directorial hand coming up with comic book panel-style shot designs, the movie excels from start to finish. And the action, if you want explosions, The Avengers has them, and plenty of them, but to be honest, I was most enthralled by the moments when the characters were in a room talking, arguing, and revealing backstories about one another. The dialogue was so crisp, and the acting so marvelous, with a surprising turn by Scarlett Johanson as SHIELD spy, Black Widow, The Avengers is never boring, even when there is no physical explosions to be seen, but rather explosions between the character relationships. Most importantly though, the movie speaks the message of unity, of disparate people having to come together and set aside their differences to fight a common threat, and there is no greater message that can be delivered to today's children with this movie.By the end of The Avengers, there is a realization that superhero movies have forever been changed. Never has a superhero movie been made on such a large scale and been successful. As great as Joss Whedon and all of the actors are -- in particular my favorite performance being Chris Evans as Captain America -- the real winners are Marvel Studios. No movie studio has ever rolled the dice this big on a series of movies. They made five individual movies that all come to a head with this one, gigantic epic, and the pay-off is more than worth it, not just making this the best Marvel Studios production since they started with Iron Man in 2008, but it's one of the best superhero movies in general. This is Marvel's finest hour. Avengers Assemble!!!I give The Avengers a 10 out of 10!!!",10,3,7,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Movie Review: 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1'
","Continuing the trend of Harry Potter and Twilight, the third and final Hunger Games book, Mockingjay, has been split into two movies because it's, 'So much story to be told in only one movie.' Yeah, I'll let the filmmakers live with that explanation as long as they make Mockingjay - Part 2 as good as they have Part 1.Picking up literally right where Catching Fire left off, Mockingjay - Part 1 very quickly dispenses any pleasantries and jumps right back into Katniss's struggles and psyche, with Jennifer Lawrence once more proving that Katniss may just be her role of a lifetime. Katniss is now in the long thought destroyed, District 13, and is being used by their President as a figure to rally all of the other districts to rebellion against the Capitol. With war almost all but a certainty, Katniss still finds herself unwillingly thrust in this larger than life game for not only her life, but the lives of all those she cares for.This is a film about war, not only the costs and horrors of war, but also the way that media and propaganda are used in war. Watching Katniss being directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee for a propaganda video they are making -- which is ridiculously stupid, yet authentic in the way our own media represents figureheads -- is one of the few genuinely funny scenes in what is a very tense two hour movie. As it is, what keeps you trucking through some of the horrors that these characters go through is the humanity of the characters and their little quirks that often lend themselves to a little laugh here or there to alleviate the tension happening all around them, because as I've already mentioned, this is a war film.Mockingjay - Part 1 harbors shades of some of the great war films of the past few decades, with one scene in particular that reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty. These scenes, while being played out in a science fiction world, feel startlingly real because of the similarities that are easily seen between the world of Panem and our modern day world with all of our wars and injustices. However, this isn't an anti-war film, nor is it pro-war, it just shows the harsh realities of the world. Sometimes we have to fight for the things that we cannot afford to lose. While peace is a great ideal, as long as there are those who are causing unrest and want to kill all who do not bow to their whims, wars will be fought. It was that idea that I thought was the most poignant thing about Suzanne Collins' book when I read it, and that is an idea that director Francis Lawrence and his screen writing team of Peter Craig and Danny Strong have managed to keep intact for the film. If The Hunger Games crew can continue to build off of the ideas presented here and deliver a moving finale next November, we may be looking at something genuinely special with Part 2. As for now, Part 1 is definitely worth the time of any fan of these books, films, or good science fiction stories in general.",10,5,32,21 November 2014
Vertigo," A Sad Disappointment
","It's always tough to be the odd man out, it's even harder to be just that on a film by one of your favorite filmmakers. Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is often considered one of the all-time greats for the Master of Suspense, and it really pains me to disagree with the vast majority, but that is how these things often go.Vertigo tells the story of a retired San Francisco detective played by Jimmy Stewart who suffers from vertigo. Stewart's character is hired by an old friend to tale the friend's wife who has been exhibiting odd behavior recently, her husband believing she is channeling the spirit of a 19th century woman. The premise is well set up, and the starting paces play out superbly, but when the story starts trying to explain all of the supernatural with a Sherlock Holmes-style deduction, I find the film hard to swallow. The film becomes more far-fetched when it tries to explain realistically all of the supernatural events rather than just letting it be a ghost story. As well, the romance between the characters played by Stewart and Kim Novak, who portrays the woman Stewart is following, just develops too quickly to be believable.As I said, it pains me to talk such as this. The film had been so built up before I finally saw it, that I guess I expected something completely different than what I got, but what I got was something that started out as one thing, and then midway through the film transformed into another that just negated all of the things I loved about the first half of the film. Want my advice, if you love Hitch, try Rear Window or North by Northwest. Way more suspense, way more mystery, and way more fun.I give Vertigo a 4 out of 10!",4,25,44,27 June 2010
Black Swan," Technically Good, But Too Racy for its Own Good
","Few movies can make you question your own sanity, and Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is such a movie. The movie is a loose adaptation of the ballet Swan Lake. The film follows the story of ballerina Nina Seyers (played by Natalie Portman), her own tale mirroring that of the White Swan in the ballet that she is performing in. But in the film, the Black Swan lurks in the wings in the form of a rival ballerina at the company (played by Mila Kunis), everything that Nina is not, and could she be trying to steal Nina's role from her? Black Swan paints a picture of an obsessive art form. A strive for perfection and emotional release, and if you can no longer perform, you are washed up and no good. Black Swan fires on all cylinders and technically works. The direction of Aronofsky is engrossing, drawing you into Nina's claustrophobic world of paranoia, the performances from the actors are daring and immaculate, and the cinematography is stunning, in particular the beautifully photographed dream sequence that opens the film and is the highlight of this psychological thriller. Where the movie slips for me, is its racy material, where in the middle of the film it seems to lose itself in this odd perverted journey that is close to soft core porn. While it works to fit into the story, was it necessary to go as far as they do? I think no. These moments seem more a detriment to me, and hindered my enjoyment, seeming as if they were pure grabs to try and make some bank. This is a film that is so well made, it is a shame to see it dip into such waters that lose it much credibility in my book.I give Black Swan a 4 out of 10!",4,6,22,21 December 2010
Changeling," A Terrific Film!
","Changeling is the new film from director Clint Eastwood. It is based on a true story that takes place in 1928 L.A.The story is about a woman who returns home one day to find her son missing. Then a few months later the police return a child to her, but it isn't her son. The woman keeps on telling everyone that this child isn't her son, but the police keep on claiming that it is her son and are calling the woman crazy.The film is a wonderful study about police corruption in L.A. in the late 1920s. The film is emotionally gripping, and at times disturbing.The film was superbly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was working from a terrific script by J. Michael Straczynski. Not only that, but Eastwood also wrote the film's score, which was very good as well. Of course the acting is what truly stole the show for me. Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mother of the missing child, but what truly surprised me was how good these children in the cast were. All of the child actors were very well cast and all delivered amazing performances.As a whole Eastwood's Changeling is one of the best films of the year, and should be up for some big-time Oscars at year's end.A perfect 10 out of 10!",10,139,186,3 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Swashbuckler without the Buckle!
","Disney keeps sailing with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, sans-Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but the end result does little to change some of the underlying problems to the second and third installments. While the movie manages to keep from dipping into the levels of absurdity of the third film, On Stranger Tides lacks any real energy, excitement, character focus, or for that matter, character development. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns in classic Jack Sparrow action. His comedic beats still work as Jack embarks on an adventure to find the Fountain of Youth, where he runs into an old flame, Angelina (Penelope Cruz), who just so happens to be the daughter of the villainous pirate, Blackbeard (Ian McShane). As it is, this movie does not drown, but it barely stays afloat as the old characters do not go anywhere new, and the new characters are not given enough to do in the story. The potential in the relationship between Jack and Angelina was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie as we were supposed to start caring for these two new characters, a missionary and a mermaid, who just so happen to fall head over heels in love with just a few soap operaish looks to one another (I know, tough to believe). Series stalwarts, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush (Captan Barbossa from the first three) phone in their performances, while Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane look as if they had fun, and I guess that is what counts. Some of the action sequences are enjoyable to watch, in particular the spectacular mermaid attack sequence, but without strong sense of character, much of the action lacks excitement, thus it is hard to care anymore.I give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides a 5 out of 10!",5,0,1,24 May 2011
Men in Black 3," An Unwarranted, yet Harmless Sequel
","Agents J and K return for this third outing in the Men in Black franchise. While Men in Black 3 does not feel warranted, it's a harmless enough movie that somewhat makes up for the horrendous Men in Black 2.When an alien named Boris escapes from a prison on the moon, he travels back in time and erases K from modern existence, with J being the only person remembering K. Like Back to the Future, J must travel back in time to save K, and alas this is all you need to know about Men in Black 3.There really isn't much more depth to this movie, and there are many plot holes to the time travel presented here. Why is J the only one that remembers K? Sure, they say that's because he was there in the past when what happened to K happened, but it still makes little logical sense. Time travel is tricky, and if you can't iron out the holes, perhaps it's best not attempted. Even still, it gives us the joy of seeing Josh Brolin play a young Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K in 1969. What's most impressive is that Brolin actually manages to make the character his own, while still honoring Tommy Lee Jones, and in many ways he's actually more charismatic and more likable as the character. As for Will Smith, his schtick is starting to get a touch old, with a few too many wisecracks that don't really hit their mark, as well, the action is fairly trite and uninspired. Even with all this said, it's still a mildly entertaining film (key word: mildly).The jokes regarding Andy Warhol and Mic Jagger are spot on, the character of Griffin the alien who can see all possible futures is original and is the highlight of the film thanks to the humor he evokes, not to mention the fact that the ending is actually quite emotional and feels earned. However, none of this really answers the question as to why this movie exists in the first place. While the first Men in Black was fairly good, the second one wasn't, and it's simply because the characters of J and K were so one note to begin with, there wasn't much more room to go. While the characters don't get many new layers in Men in Black 3, they get just enough to make this movie watchable, especially if you have an affinity for the original, such as myself, and if you don't, this one's going to do nothing for you.I give Men in Black 3 a 6 out of 10!",6,0,2,3 December 2012
Howl's Moving Castle," Another Fun Trip into the Imagination of Hayao Miyazaki!
","Every now and then I watch a movie that simply blows me away, and Howl's Moving Castle is one of them. I am no stranger to the films of Hayao Miyazaki, but for some odd reason I seemed to have always managed to have missed this particular Miyazaki classic. I finally picked up the film, and I can definitely say it doesn't disappoint.The big draw of this film is the imaginative animation. The animation is as fluid as ever, just like every other Studio Ghibli production. The animation under Miyazaki's direction is simply perfect, creating certain shots where you are simply left in awe, wondering how someone could have come up with a shot that is so fantastical. Of course what truly keeps you captivated to these tales crafted by Miyazaki is the story. This film's story is a surreal love story about a wizard and a bewitched human; it is a quirky, yet lovable premise. It is lighthearted and fun, featuring quirky and unique characters, alongside some breathtaking fantasy, both staples in Miyazaki films. The story of the film is complex, but never gets convoluted, it is well paced and never feels as if it is rushing or going too slow. Two more things worth mention is the magical score from Joe Hisaishi, and the wonderful voice acting; in particular from Christian Bale, who steals each scene as the voice of Howl.Howl's Moving Castle is easily one of the most imaginative films ever made. Every time you see the gigantic lumbering castle, made up of rundown houses and pieces of scrap metal, you get this great feeling of excitement and wonder which truly takes you back to the days of your carefree childhood. Hayao Miyazaki has done it yet again, it is another instant classic.A perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,6 August 2008
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," More of This, More of That...
","There are three things that make for a good sequel: more, more, and more, and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows does just that. Is there more action this time about? Yes. Is there more character and relational development? Yes. Is it more faithful to its literary counterpart? Yes.Robert Downey, Jr. returns with charisma as the sleuth, with Jude Law not far behind as Dr. Watson, the straight man of the duo. Watson is getting married this go-around, which does not sit very well with Holmes, conveyed well by Downey, Jr without ever coming across as unnecessarily jealous. However, Watson's whole Honeymoon runs amok when him and Holmes must embark upon one final case to prevent Professor James Moriarty from manipulating the world powers -- via acts of terrorism -- into starting a World War.Moriarty is every bit Holmes's equal, and Jared Harris manages to be as cool and collected as Downey, Jr. is as Holmes. However, what makes both portrayals work, is the emotions flashing behind their eyes that are masked by their demeanor and the way they deliver their lines, resulting in a lot of sophisticated set pieces that are more Hitchcock than what one tends to associate with the films of director Guy Ritchie.The flick has fewer plot holes than its predecessor, though it lacks much of the crackling pace and energy of the first installment, often moving a touch slow for such an action heavy piece. Same as the first installment, there are a few scenes that just felt unnecessary and bogged down the flow of the story, such as the scene with Holmes's brother, Mycroft, in the nude.Even through all of the slow moments, Ritchie manages to keep the audience in the story through the verbal sparring that is always enjoyable between Holmes and Watson, and taking us into Holmes's mind by not just hearing Holmes's thought as to how he is deducing his environment, but by also visually representing these things through camera movement and reactionary point-of-view shots.The action as a whole develops organically throughout the story, with the story dictating the action rather than the action dictating what the story is about, and this is where A Game of Shadows is a step above so many other action films. The action is cleverly woven to where Ritchie can do a breathtaking chase sequence through the woods entirely in slow-mo, detailing every minor graze of a bullet and explosion, and then dial back to have a chess match between Holmes and Moriarty as the climax in a Hitchockian fashion. It is in moments like these that A Game of Shadows is the most successful, and it is why it builds upon the framework of its predecessor and surpasses it.I give Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows a 9 out of 10!",9,1,5,20 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," The Most Incredible Movie of the Summer so Far!!!
","I am not going to lie, I really was not that excited for this film when it was first announced, simply because the last time the Hulk made it to the big screen it was such a disappointment. Ang Lee's Hulk film from 2003 was a poor adaptation of one of my favorite comic book heroes. I have always loved the comics, but felt that the film didn't do the character justice, where as this new Hulk film, which is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, finally took advantage of the Hulk franchise and delivers an adaptation that is both truthful to the comics and entertaining at the same time.Within the Incredible Hulk, we get a story that is more in keeping with that of the original comics from the '60s, and it also has a lot in kin with the T.V. Show from the '70s as well. The story begins in Brazil where we meet Dr. Bruce Banner, who has already been infected by the Gamma Rays which make him become the Hulk when he becomes angry. Here in Brazil, Banner is trying to discover a formula to cure him of his big green menace, as well he is undergoing treatment sessions to try and understand a way to control his anger. Banner is currently marked as a fugitive from the United States, and is constantly hunted by the military. All of this is familiar territory to anyone who liked the old television series, or the original comics. Of course the story really doesn't punch into high gear until Banner must return to the U.S. in order to meet a scientist who claims he can help Bruce to possibly find a cure for his problem. Once Bruce returns to his home country, he reunites with his love interest Betty Ross, and together the two try to thwart the ever persistent government and get to New York to meet the scientist who wishes to help Banner.I will be very truthful here, this is my favorite film of the summer so far, and in retrospect it might just very well be my favorite film of the year thus far. As a fan of the comic I am a little bit biased, as I always am with comic book movies, but this one really is a great film. Now this film is by no means going to be an Oscar contender next year, except maybe for Special Effects, but it is by far the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time. What this film delivers is a Hulk film with tons of action and explosions, that has a terrific story to go along with it, but it also is able to finally deliver audiences a Hulk story that allows the Hulk to be a hero, and not just a guy who destroys stuff when he gets angry.As previously mentioned, the story is terrific, with a terrific script that obviously benefited with Edward Norton's help, especially when it comes to the tight dialogue. As well the directing by Louis Leterrier was really great for this particular type of popcorn movie, successfully delivering both the great action of the story and the more intimate dramatic sequences to the audience. Then the acting was really superb as well, in particular Edward Norton as Banner and Liv Tyler as Betty, both of whom clearly have real chemistry and work really well together on screen. After that it is just a role call of well executed production values, nothing was really that weak; but the one other production value that truly stands out is the Special Effects. The CGI is some of the best that I have seen in a long time, it would definitely be a shame if this film doesn't receive an Oscar nod for it Effects.Overall the Incredible Hulk is an amazing film that definitely lives up to its Incredible title. The action is amazing, each action sequence among some of the best I have seen in a while; in particular the final fight scene between the Hulk and the Abomination, which has gone down in my books as one of the finest superhero vs. super villain fights in movie history, and the fight literally, I am not exaggerating, goes on for close to 10-15 minutes. After seeing it I can see why many critics don't like it for it focusing more on action and spectacle than its 2003 predecessor, but what it does deliver is a crowd pleasing Hulk film that is sure to please both audiences and die hard comic book fans alike. I can not wait for a sequel, I am definitely hoping it makes enough money at the box office to allow it.I give the Incredible Hulk an Incredible 10 out of 10!",10,14,25,15 June 2008
Captain Phillips," A Phenomenal Film
","Ripped straight from the 2009 headlines, Captain Phillips tells the story of the Maersk Alabama cargo freighter that was taken over by Somali pirates, off the coast of Somalia. The titular captain, is the real-life captain of the Maersk Alabama, Richard Phillips, portrayed in this film by Tom Hanks. Often a movie star can ruin a film that is trying to be as real as this one, but in this particular case, it's that anomaly where the movie star portrayal actually makes the film.Captain Phillips is shot in a very gritty, realistic way. The lighting is often underexposed and the camera-work is shaky, making it seem like you're watching an observational documentary of the real-life event, with only occasional Hollywood flourishes of subtle soundtrack to amp up tension. At first glance, you might be fooled into thinking this was a documentary, relaying the brilliance of director Paul Greengrass, making the material seem more real and not so Hollywoodified. As such, though, that is why the inclusion of a movie star, like Tom Hanks in the main role, was so important.As an audience, we already have a pre-existing relationship with Tom Hanks. By having an Everyman like Tom Hanks on screen, it allows us to understand who Richard Phillips is without having to really tell us much about his personality or how he got to this point in his life. It's one of those cases where a film takes place entirely in the present, with no flashbacks or long monologues to create character, so we needed a movie star, and Mr. Hanks knocks the role out of the park. He's not so good looking it's distracting, and he is made up like a guy you could see on the street or walking around your local grocery store. That's what makes him immediately believable. Then, there's the simple fact that this role could have easily been one that a lesser actor would have chewed up all the scenery to try and realize, and you start to really appreciate the subtlety of the performance more and more. While the supporting cast of relative unknowns and seasoned character actors are believable in their roles, this is Hanks's movie. Though, newcomer Barkhad Abdi does get a few choice scenes as the leader of the pirates, Muse, even if that's the most any of the pirates get to do other than shout and point their guns.While many of the characters in Captain Phillips lack much depth, in particular the pirates, the documentary-like approach to the material, and the sensational performance from Tom Hanks, make this film an intense cinematic experience. As well, with a film such as this, where it's more about the now and the horror of the situation at hand, any detours to beef up characters, would have felt forced and untrue to what the goal of this film was. This is a movie meant to give you the experience that Richard Phillips and his crew went through, and it excels in that arena. This is why Captain Phillips is a film that should be experienced by any and all looking to have a little bit of thought provoked. This is a serious endeavor that should be taken seriously.I give Captain Phillips a 9 out of 10!",9,3,9,11 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good movie,but just can't quite live up to the originals.
","The Star Wars franchise is back with this prequel to the old films from the 70s and 80s.This movie overall is good.The acting is the best out of the new trilogy.Liam Neeson is the best,but the others are great as well(minus Jake Lloyd).Also for a movie in the 90s the special effects are amazing!George Lucas has written a great script and has sat back in the director's chair and did a great job.John Williams has returned and has written another amazing score,all of the great themes are back including spectacular new ones like Duel of Fates.The action is awesome(mainly because of Darth Maul),the lightsaber duels are lightyears ahead of the ones in the originals.The only real notable problems are Jake Lloyd's bad acting,occasional cheesy moments and special effects,and sometimes weak dialogue.Overall it is a great film and is real fun and really is going to create a whole new generation of Star Wars fans.A great: 9/10!!!!",9,7,11,15 May 2006
10 Cloverfield Lane," An Intense Thrill Ride
","Don't get confused and think that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a sequel to 2008's found footage monster movie, Cloverfield. While both movies have Cloverfield in the title, these really are more like sister stories produced by the same production company.The movie kicks off with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a car crash. When she awakes she finds herself in a fallout shelter belonging to survivalist Howard (John Goodman), who claims that there was an attack that left the world outside irradiated. Everything beyond the basic set up is best left to discover on your own, because this movie truly is an edge of your seat popcorn movie.The whole movie has this sense of paranoia that really oozes off of the screen and infects you as you watch it. Is Howard telling the truth? If there was a cataclysmic attack, who did it? And even if both of these things are true, is Howard an evil man? I remember reading that J.J. Abrams likened these two Cloverfield movies to The Twilight Zone, and 10 Cloverfield Lane does feel very much like a more intense, modernized Twilight Zone episode. There are enough twists and turns here that keep you riveted till the credits roll, with a lot of the credit belonging to the slew of writers and first-time feature director, Dan Trachtenberg. Almost all of the movie takes place in Howard's fallout shelter, which for a ninety plus minute movie, is a writer and director's nightmare. It would have been very easy for the movie to have grown stale and boring, but the writers and Trachtenberg manage to keep the tension up, and Trachtenberg continues to find interesting camera angles. As well, the movie has occasional fits of humor amidst the darkness to alleviate the tension, which is where having a talent like John Goodman makes the movie work in a way it wouldn't otherwise. John Goodman is better here than I've seen him in years, and that's all I'll say about his performance, cause you need to see it for yourself.All in all, while I admit this movie may not be for everyone, if you live suspenseful sci-fi movies, this really is a no-brainer must see. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a unique and intense movie that answers just enough to be satisfying, but leaves enough questions hanging to have you theorizing long after the movie is over.I give 10 Cloverfield Lane a 9 out of 10!",9,1,2,25 June 2016
The Finest Hours," A Fantastic History Lesson
","On February 18, 1952, the SS Pendleton oil tanker broke in two just off the coast of Cape Cod during a violent Nor'easter. The Finest Hours is the heroic tale of the four Coast Guard crewmen who defied all odds and pulled off one of the greatest rescue missions of all-time. Starring Chris Pine as soft-spoken Bernie Webber, the Coast Guard Captain who piloted the tiny rescue boat into the storm and came back with 32 Pendleton survivors aboard, The Finest Hours is a beautifully realized history lesson that is full of emotion. While some might call this movie old-fashioned, that is the reason I like it. This is a movie that represents everyday men and women full of courage in the face of insurmountable fear. In short, if I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be bravery. From the bravery displayed by Bernie Webber and his fellow Coast Guardsmen, to the crew of the SS Pendleton led by Casey Affleck's Ray Sybert, all the way to Holliday Grainger as Miriam Pentinen, Bernie's fiancé who is doing everything on land to make sure Bernie comes home safely, it was the bravery of all of the individuals involved that created such a fascinating story. Of course, what makes The Finest Hours stick with you is the relationship between Bernie and Miriam. Pine and Grainger have a magnetic chemistry that has you rooting for them to be together, with Grainger exuding a screen presence not too dissimilar from many starlets of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is this ability to emotionally connect that makes The Finest Hours more than an interesting true life adventure story.I give The Finest Hours a 9 out of 10!",9,1,5,4 June 2016
The Expendables 2," Explosions, Dismemberment, and Hilarity
","With The Expendables 2, it's exactly what you'd expect it to be. It's Sylvester Stallone on screen with Arnold Schwarzenagger, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris, all kicking butt and taking names as this gang of guns-for-hire work to bring down an evil madman, played by Jean Claude Van Damme. There isn't any real depth to this movie. It's wall to wall action with tons of explosions, dismemberment, and over-the-top jokes. If you come into this film just looking to have a good time and to be thrown back to the 1990s for an hour and forty minutes, then you'll enjoy The Expendables 2, but don't expect much more than that.I give The Expendables 2 an 8 out of 10!",8,2,2,5 December 2012
Skyfall," 50 Years and Still Strong
","It's James Bond's 50th anniversary, and the 23rd Bond film, Skyfall, proves that there's still some bullets left in his Walter PPK. The plot of Skyfall is simplistic, a hard drive containing the identities of every secret agent embedded in terrorist organizations around the world is stolen, but it's how director Sam Mendes turns the film more so into a chess match than a whodunit, that marks this entry. The flamboyant villain, Silva, is an aggressive mastermind, manipulating the actions of MI6 through cyberterrorism, forcing M, MI6, and Bond to play defense the entire film, trying to keep out of checkmate, and in the end Bond and M retreat to Bond's boyhood home, Skyfall, to try to get Silva to drop his defenses.The thing about Skyfall, is that it is different than any other Bond film before it. It's a somber experience, almost melancholy. It's not cranked up to 11, it's not a simple bad guy wanting to take over the world story, in so many ways it's a character piece. The biggest action sequence is the Istanbul opening where 007 chases a bad guy across cars, motorcycles, and trains, and the rest of the film gets gradually smaller and smaller in scale, until all that is left are Bond, M, and Silva. It's the way their pasts come back to haunt them that is the spine of Skyfall. Bond still clings to the death of his parents, M is questioning her past decisions to sacrifice agents when the ends justified the means, and Silva is bitter over M having sacrificed him on a mission long ago, like she does with Bond in the opening. Unlike any other Bond film, it's about the relationships that these characters have with one another that shapes the narrative and the action. Bond's trust in M is tested, leading him down a certain path of action, but then it's reinforced, and then he stops at nothing to protect her from Silva. That is the true brilliance of Skyfall, it doesn't shy away from showing the humanity of these characters, or how their actions have repercussions, but rather it shows how they use those repercussions to carry on and finish the mission.Daniel Craig proves he is once more a more than capable 007, utilizing a dry sense of humor to deliver lines that Roger Moore would have hammed up. Like he did in Casino Royale, Craig finds a way to make Bond relatable and human to the audience. In the film, James Bond is portrayed as slightly older, having lost his edge, and not necessarily hip with the times where espionage is mostly done by computers and not field work. As a matter of fact, Bond is injured throughout most of the film, not at his physical peak, due to gunshot wounds sustained in the opening. Therefore, he's not really a superhero, but rather a human being who is constantly outmatched throughout the entire film, but as he proves by the end, it's not age or old school methods that define the job, but his commitment to see it through. As well, Judi Dench delivers her best turn since Goldeneye, Bond girl Naomie Harris really adds some much needed levity at times to keep things from getting too dark, and Ben Whishaw fills Desmond Llewelyn's shoes as Q. The true standout performance though is Javier Bardem as Silva. He's not just creepy or flamboyant, though he is a man whose sexuality is in question, but it's the way that he fully commits to the role that makes every line and action that he performs creepy and flamboyant. His performance has been likened to Heath Ledger's Joker, but I really think Silva is his own messed up breed that Bardem plays so brilliantly, perhaps besting his performance as Anton Chigurgh in No Country For Old Men. Not to mention, the fact that the script really builds up his character, where everyone talks about him in fear, with him manipulating in the shadows for the first half of the film, so that when we finally meet him, we're terrified of him.All in all, Skyfall is a marvel. Featuring superb action scenes, a traditional Bond theme song supplied by Adele, one of the better scripts ever written for a Bond film where every character has an arc and a purpose in the story, and some of the most stunning cinematography ever shot for an action flick, Skyfall is a home run. Not only that though, it's a great, personal film that is smart, tense, exciting, and surprisingly emotional. It uses the 50 year history of these characters to stir the emotions in the viewer, and in so many ways, if this isn't your first Bond film, you will be even more rewarded for it. But quite simply, the Bond family has outdone themselves here. Skyfall is a true blue James Bond adventure that surpasses nearly every other film in the storied franchise.I give Skyfall a 10 out of 10!",10,67,115,8 November 2012
Iron Man 3," This is not the Iron Man film you were hoping for
","The thing with Iron Man 3 is not that it's bad, it's actually enjoyable and quite good as a whole, but after following up The Avengers, it feels as if it's a little bit of a let down.Iron Man 3 picks up right after The Avengers, with Tony Stark experiencing post traumatic stress disorder from the events of that previous movie. When a terrorist calling himself the Mandarin, who is like Bin Laden's evil twin, starts wreaking havoc, Tony Stark embarks on a manhunt to bring the Mandarin down.The returning cast is all exceptional, with Robert Downey, Jr., once more anchoring the film with equal parts wit, charm, and heart. The new cast members, from Rebecca Hall to Guy Pearce, are all good, but none of their characters are really quite as charismatic or as likable as the returning characters, or the supporting characters from the previous Iron Man movies for that matter (I personally miss Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer). As for Sir Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, he turns in a really great performance, but I'll just say this, if you're a fan of the comic books, you will be flat out disappointed by this representation of the Mandarin. Let's just say Marvel really let one of Iron Man's most iconic villains slip through the cracks here. He could have been as awesome of a villain as Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, but Marvel just wasted the brilliant set-up for the character.While the film often struggles to justify why this movie is the perfect follow-up to The Avengers, Iron Man 3 excels in asking the central question: Is Iron Man the suit, or is he Tony Stark? This is the most character centric of all of the Marvel movies made thus far, and in that arena it does not disappoint. I would wager at least 90% of the movie, Tony Stark is without his Iron Man suit and is having to save the day using just his wits, this leads to the greatest moments of the film where Tony Stark crash lands in small town Tennessee and recruits the help of a young boy to get back on his feet again. These are the moments where Iron Man 3 feels the most true and authentic to what I think Marvel and director Shane Black were going for, unfortunately the script often feels the pressure to make this a Summer blockbuster and therefore flips back into relentless action mode without ever truly giving a definitive moment where Tony gets over his PTSD. Plus, am I the only one that thinks the way Tony's suits fly around and attach to his body is getting a little ridiculous? Sure it looks cool, but come on.When it's all said and done, Iron Man 3 is a worthwhile Summer blockbuster, featuring inventive action sequences and some genuinely funny moments, but it doesn't quite measure up to the previous three movies featuring Iron Man. As is evidenced by the brilliant post- credits scene, perhaps it's best just to only make more movies starring Iron Man when he's playing with the rest of the Avengers.I give Iron Man 3 a 7 out of 10!",7,9,19,3 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," They just don't make 'em like this anymore.
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly one of the greatest films of all-time. This was the first film to introduce us to one of the best film characters of all-time, archaeologist Indiana Jones, played by the one and only Harrison Ford.The story of Raiders follows everyones favorite whip-totting archaeologist as he battles Nazis, woos the beautiful Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and discovers the lost Ark of the Covenant. The story begins when Indy learns that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant. Indy can not stand the thought of the Nazis gaining possession of such a powerful, and holy artifact, so he agrees to go after the Ark himself to protect it from evil. Across Indy's adventure we meet his colorful sidekick Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), his feisty love interest Marion, and watch him in a deadly struggle against the Nazis for possession of the Ark.As I mentioned in the tag-line above, they just don't make them like this anymore. This is pure, high octane adventure every step of the way. The film is superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, and the script by Lawrence Kasdan is marvelous, perfectly balancing the comedy with the action and drama, something that today's directors and screenwriters should take note of. As well the acting is amazing, Harrison Ford is the only man on Earth who could have played the character of Indiana Jones with so much conviction. Then of course John William's score was just truly amazing, one of his finest he has ever produced. Everything else: production design, cinematography, special effects, etc., all top notch.This film is truly a classic in every way. The action is unlike any other action I have ever experienced on film, each action sequence was scripted to perfection (in particular the boulder chase, the plane fight, and the truck chase). Then of course the end when the Ark is finally opened is truly amazing and captivating to watch. Though what makes me love the film so much more is the last shot of the film, when the Ark is placed in that huge warehouse, it makes my jaw drop every time.If you have never watched this film before you don't know what you are missing. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest, most exciting, and fun stories ever told on film. Every time you watch it you feel like a little five year old kid again.Raiders gets a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,2,4,17 February 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of the Most Heartwarming Films in Movie History!
","How can one describe the experience of watching E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial? It's almost impossible, there does not seem to be a word in the English dictionary that can fully describe the total experience of watching such a masterful film. It is moving, heart-wrenching, funny, optimistic, and exciting, all in one.One would think when they hear of the simple premise of a young boy befriending an alien from outer space that not much drama or emotion could be evoked, but that person would be wrong. E.T.'s true heart lies in its simplicity, through a child-like view of the world. As this is rightfully how this film should be, since it is told from the perspective of a child. I think it is because of this simplicity that E.T. has gone on to become one of the greatest films of all-time.When one debates about whether or not which film is director Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, talk quickly begins to circulate around Schindler's List, but in this filmgoers mind E.T. is just as beautiful and poignant as the story of Oskar Schindler. What Spielberg did with this film was simply magical; no other human on Earth could have made this film other than him. E.T. is a lovable character, even though he is so ugly. Spielberg made us care for a character who in the wrong hands would have just ended up being an ugly Muppet that'd terrify children, but thanks to the classic Spielberg touch E.T. was brought to life.While many cynics may bash the film for its all-out sentimentality and gentile nature, I must always hold my tongue from saying something in which I will later on regret. E.T.'s greatest strength lies within its sentimentality and its optimistic nature. It is just another testament to Spielberg's wonderful talents.Overall, I think E.T. is one of the most beautiful films of all-time. It is a film that'll make even the most hardened moviegoer cry, but never tears of sadness, but tears of joy and happiness. When you come to the end of E.T. you feel as if you just got off of one of the best emotional roller coaster rides of your life, and it never changes each time you ride it. This is one of cinema's finest achievements.I give E.T. a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,1,2,11 March 2009
Casablanca," A timeless classic, that is one of the finest films of all-time!
","Casablanca is one of those rare films that truly qualifies as a perfect film. There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, this is a timeless classic that is still as relevant to today's society as it was back in 1942. Many of the themes in Casablanca can still be seen in action in today's world, but what truly makes Casablanca transcend generations is the love story. The love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Laszlo is one of the finest triangles in movie history; as much as you want to hate Laszlo so Rick and Ilsa will get together, Laszlo is just such a likable character you can't hate him, and you just know deep down Rick will not take Ilsa away from Laszlo. Of course what truly keeps this film from being a monotonous three-way love story, is the colorful cast of characters surrounding the three leads, in particular the scene stealing Captain Renault played brilliantly by Claude Rains. Of course what has always made me love this film isn't the brilliant characters or the love story, it is in fact the screenplay. The screenplay is one of the finest ever crafted in the history of film, each scene flows perfectly, never feeling too long or too short; as well the film features some of the finest dialogue ever spoken in a movie, there are just so many quotable lines from this movie. Overall Casablanca is just truly a masterpiece, and if you have never seen it I suggest you do because it is one of the greatest films ever made.I give Casablanca a flawless 10 out of 10!",10,2,3,19 June 2008
Finding Neverland," Few Films Captivate the Imagination Quite as Well as this One!
","Finding Neverland is a heartfelt film that captivates both the heart and imagination.The film follows the biographical story of 'Peter Pan' author J.M. Barrie. The story is about Barrie and how he came up with the idea for 'Peter Pan' through his friendship with a widow and her four boys.This film was superbly directed by Marc Forster, who is truly one of the finest young filmmakers in the modern day film industry. Forster was able to deliver a film that was both visually stimulating and truly emotional at the same time. He should be commended in particular for generating such great performances from his remarkable cast, in particular Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie and Freddie Highmore as Peter. Both actors played their contrasting roles perfectly; Depp as a man who doesn't want to grow up, and Highmore as a child who is growing up way too fast. As well the film's score by Jan Kaczmarek is truly one of the finest I think I have heard in a long time, it's magical tones engross you within each and every scene.Finding Neverland is a highly enjoyable film that is both imaginative and touching at the same time. The film manages to tug on you heartstrings more so than any other film in recent memory. It sweeps you up into Barrie's imagination and never lets you go. This film is definitely one of the finest I think I have seen in a long time.I give Finding Neverland a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,2,2,4 October 2008
Gravity," Believe the Hype, it's that Good!
","What more can be said about director Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece, Gravity, that hasn't already been written by almost every single other person that writes about movies on the planet? In the film, Sandra Bullock portrays Dr. Ryan Stone, a first time astronaut on a routine space mission that turns to disaster when she is disconnected from her space shuttle by space debris. It's one of those amazing films that has you thinking the whole time: How did they do that? The combination of the real with the computer generated is so seamless, that you can never tell what's physical and what isn't, because it all looks so real. To say that this film lives up the hype would be an understatement, so as I sit here writing, adding to the neverending parade of noise surrounding this film, I figured I'd take an atypical approach with this review. I'm going to sum up what I thought about Gravity in a game of word association, rather than going into depth on the story and how emotionally powerful it is on all of the base human emotions, from fear to a will to live, because otherwise I could keep writing all day long. So, without anymore preamble, here's what I really thought of Gravity:Space -- Beautiful. Alfonso -- Genius. Sandra -- Phenomenal. Disaster -- Suspenseful. Humanity -- Triumphant. Oscar -- Guaranteed.I give Gravity a 10 out of 10!",10,5,12,4 October 2013
Star Trek," Classic Old School Adventure!
","Star Trek is one of those rarities amongst films nowadays. It is tense, exciting, and emotionally involving all in one. What J.J. Abrams and company have done is reinvigorate the dying Star Trek franchise and have made it better than ever.Now I'll start by saying I have never been a Star Trek fan, I was always one of the people who'd rather watch Star Wars growing up as opposed to Star Trek. This is by no means to say I hated Star Trek growing up, it just never seemed to truly appeal to me as well as Star Wars did, but I've gotta say, upon viewing this latest Star Trek film I have become a big fan.The story of Star Trek goes back to the beginnings of the U.S.S. Enterprise, creating an alternative universe to the original Trek series (and I mean that literally). Throughout the film we see exactly how all the things of the classic Star Trek series came to be and watch how James T. Kirk assumes command over the Enterprise.Star Trek is by far the best film I have seen this year so far. It was wonderfully directed, superbly scripted, and excellent overall. J.J. Abrams deserves a huge pat on the back for taking quite possibly the geekiest franchise of all-time and being able to maintain what the fans have always loved, while also being able to create a film that plays extremely well to the casual audience. The script was terrific, crafted to perfection; it was one of the first sci-fi films in a while to utilize time travel in a unique and intriguing manner. The other stuff, such as the special effects and production design, are all top notch, but the two more things worth mention are the score and the acting. The music by Michael Giacchino is amazing, it manages to capture the beauty of his music from LOST combined with the best of John Williams. Finally the acting in this film was stellar, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto steal the show as Kirk and Spock respectively, though it is Simon Pegg as Scotty who manages to generate the most laughs.Overall Star Trek was a terrific film. The action within the film was exciting, at times channeling the best of classic adventure films like Indiana Jones, and dare I say it, Star Wars. Though the film's emphasis on its characters draws you into the emotion of the story better than pretty much any other film I have seen this year. Overall Star Trek was amazing, I loved it. The film managed to superbly draw me into its world and instill a sense of childlike wonder in which is a rarity in these days. After it was all over I think Star Trek was awesome and is the best sci-fi adventure film released in the past decade (yes, better than even the Star Wars prequels).One final mention, the prologue with the U.S.S. Kelvin and then the spacediving sequence, are among two of the finest action sequences I have seen in a while.I give Star Trek a terrific 10 out of 10!",10,2,13,7 May 2009
Citizen Kane," Orson Welles's Masterpiece!
","Citizen Kane is commonly known as one of the greatest films of all-time, and while it isn't my personal favorite, it is undeniably one of the most original, innovative, and unforgettable films of all-time.The story follows the life of newspaper tyrant Charles Foster Kane. With his dying breath he uttered a word that leads to a mystery that might possibly unlock the hidden secrets of his life. One reporter goes on a wild goose chase, trying to piece together the pieces of Kane's life in order to understand truly who the man was.Orson Welles shines as the title character Charles Foster Kane, his performance is one of the most remarkable in the history of film. The main reason Citizen Kane is such an unforgettable experience is for its technical mastery. The cinematography, makeup, art direction, costume design, etc., is among some of the best I have ever seen. Though this film would have been nothing were it not for writer/producer/director Orson Welles's vision. This was Welles's masterpiece through and through. Welles managed to create what I think could be considered as the first modern film.Even though Citizen Kane may not be my favorite film of all-time, it still is undeniably one of the best made films of all-time, and is worth seeing for all of its innovation and beauty.I give Citizen Kane a 9 out of 10!",9,0,2,31 January 2009
Amistad," A Definitie Must See!
","Steven Spielberg's Amistad is one of those forgotten films. A film that actually details a fairly important event in American history that is typically glossed over in the history books.The film relays the tale of the ship, La Amistad way back in the 1830s. While on its journey towards the Americas, the ship, which was carrying countless illegal slaves (because the slave trade had already been disbanded), was the site of a bloody slave revolt. Of course, the United States could not let this insurrection pass and they hold a full on trial to decide the fate of the slaves, and all that is there to defend the slaves is one abolitionist's determination and a young real estate lawyer who team together to try and free the slaves.The film is a solid entry into Spielberg's filmography; while it lacks the gut punch of some of his more popular works, it still is a beautifully told story with marvelous performances. Anthony Hopkins shines as John Quincy Adams, Morgan Freeman is his usual charming self as the abolitonist fighting for the slaves, but Matthew McConaughey surprisingly delivers as the real estate lawyer defending the slaves, and Djimon Honsou is spectacular as Cinque, the inadvertent leader of the slave insurrection. These four performances form the foundation for this film, and without any one of these actors, I don't think the film would have been the same.Now, Amistad is a far more political film than say Schindler's List, though it is less graphic, so it makes up where it lacks. Amistad is more interested in the legal proceedings of the slaves rather than showing more about how the slaves were rounded up and shackled upon ships. The few scenes we get though of their tragic journey across the Atlantic is heartwrenching to watch, but ultimately adds that extra layer that is needed in order for you to actually feel anything when injustice is slapped against these innocent slaves who just want to return to their homes in Africa. The courtroom scenes are all handled with fine precision, and it is here that the core of the film lies.Spielberg has not really made a film about slavery, but more about the justice system in the United States at this period. Now, take from that what you will, but I was satisfied as to how the legal proceedings played out and I think it makes it different than just about any other film on the subject of slavery. What is evident here in Amistad though is Spielberg's usual energy and charm, and that is what takes it that final step. No one can manipulate the emotions or tug on the heartstrings quite like Spielberg, he is a pupeteer, and a master at that. He does not overplay the emotional scenes. He creates an ethereal beauty that ensnares you within and when Cinque learns how to say, 'Set us free,' in English, it is the stand-out moment of the film that would not have been the same had it been done by any other director.I give Amistad a 10 out of 10!",10,1,4,13 March 2010
Iron Man 2," Are Two Iron Men Better Than One?
","Check your mind at the door, and you'll enjoy Iron Man 2. While not as good as the first, it is still a fun, entertaining sequel that gets the job done and has enough explosions to start the Summer off in style.The story picks up right where the first left off. Tony Stark reveals his secret identity to the world, he is Iron Man, leading to complications for the billionaire playboy. Robert Downey, Jr. was once more in top form here as Stark, but his snarky quips seemed to lack the same heat that they had in the first film.Meanwhile, the U.S. government wants Stark to share his Iron Man technology, while Stark is dealing with a rival business tycoon Justin Hammer who wants Stark's tech to ensure his contract with the government. Sam Rockwell does a marvelous job as Justin Hammer, and actually steals the show, kind of playing that geeky guy that everyone says ya better not pick on cause they'll be your boss someday. Now, on top of all that, Stark's arc reactor in his chest that is keeping him alive is also killing him cause the element it's made of is toxic, which I thought was an extremely nice touch that added some much needed drama to the story.As you can see, this is a busy story, but director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux managed to keep the film from feeling all cluttered, giving it some room to breath, which is something that a certain webhead failed to do in his third outing (--cough!-- Spider-man 3), but it does feel jumpy at times and certain plot threads seem to be left dangling for a touch too long before they return to them to tie them up. Of course, this is an action movie, and the action in the film ups the ante from the original, having more explosions and giant iron fists of fury. If anything all of the action sequences were so well executed that they left you wanting more, but it is sad when the most show stopping scene of the entire film occurs a mere thirty minutes into the film at the Monaco Grand Prix, but the finale was still well executed.Spinning all that into a frenzy, Stark must confront a villain named Ivan Vanko, a.k.a. Whiplash, who uses these awesome electric whips that he wraps around Iron Man and electrifies him with in the awesome action sequence at the Monaco Grand Prix. Vanko, played by 'it' actor Mickey Rourke, was not as menacing as the trailers led one to believe, but he serviced the job well, but ultimately I missed Jeff Bridges from the first film. Regardless, Vanko is bent on vengeance for his father's misfortune which was at the hands of Tony's father, which I felt was not really touched upon all that much, and I think Rourke's character was actually the most underused of the film.Perhaps there was no way for them to capture lightning in a bottle again, after all, seeing as how the first film did feel so fresh and original, but they did a good job of continuing the story, giving some more character development and such. As well, there were many nods to other Marvel characters like Captain America, Thor, and The Avengers, not to mention the film featured Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson who looks just like a comic book vixen ripped straight from the pages, and Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson himself. In the end, it managed to be a worthy successor, and makes me wanna see more from this iron clad superhero on the big screen.I give Iron Man 2 a 7 out of 10!",7,0,1,8 May 2010
World War Z," The First Surprise of 2013!
","World War Z is one of those rare films that is so terrifying and thrilling, that even through all the panic inducement, you can't stop watching. Brad Pitt is believable as Gerry Lane, an ex- UN investigator who quit to spend time with his kids, but when the zombie apocalypse begins, Lane is re-enlisted to investigate the source of the zombie outbreak. You may say you've seen zombie movies before, but you've never seen one like this before. This film has such a massive scope and scale, and that's what separates it from every other zombie movie I've ever seen. The film plays out on the world's stage, with Lane jetting from continent to continent in his investigation, seeing how different parts of the world have been ravaged by the pandemic. This large canvas allows World War Z to induce a greater feeling of hopelessness than if we simply were told the rest of the world was dark, but actually seeing it creates more fear in the realization that nowhere is safe. The other factor that marks World War Z as a benchmark in the zombie genre is the way the zombies are represented.While this is not the first time we have ever seen zombies run and not shuffle, the way director Marc Forster chose to have the zombies working together in ravenous packs, to where they're more like starved animals hunting prey, makes the proceedings actually feel more realistic. By infusing the zombies with real animal-like behavior found in nature, Forster simply reverses the notion that becoming a zombie makes you a brainsucking goon and rather reverts humans to animals. Of course, this a Summer blockbuster, and what really makes this worth the admission are all of the aforementioned things coming together to create large action set pieces that are memorable and frightening.The action in this film is on par with any major Hollywood action movie, with tons of explosions, destruction, and mayhem. Forster edits the film in such a way that we don't really get a very good look at the zombies till nearly halfway through the movie, creating this fear of what we don't know, wreaking havoc in the world that we do know. It was a brilliant move that may not payoff for folks wanting to see the zombies in full the moment they first appear, but these cryptic glimpses make the action all the more intense. Plus, it helps that pretty much everything bad that could happen in a zombie apocalypse, does happen. Such as zombies on an airplane, or zombies climbing on top of one another to vault over a wall, or a ton of zombies ramming into a bus.World War Z is just a great film that is packed with thrills from start to finish. I've never felt more anxious while watching a film, and yet I would gladly watch this movie again. While I have not read the book, and can understand why a person who has would be disappointed, I was thoroughly impressed by World War Z. I think it's the story that really intrigued me, the way that the filmmakers cleverly created a large scale tale of survival and desperation that pays off in the end with an ending that is not cheesy, but believable and feels well earned. For a film that had so many production woes, with countless rewrites and pricey reshoots, World War Z actually works and manages to be emotional, scary, and cool.I give World War Z a 9 out of 10!",9,8,23,22 June 2013
The Hunger Games," An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Thriller!
","With The Hunger Games, audiences are treated to a dystopic sci-fi adventure that is suspenseful from the first frame to the last. A simple story of a fight to the death between twenty-four kids between the ages of 12 and 18 may seem like a gory blood fest, but the story never glorifies the violence and is more about survival rather than killing. Director Gary Ross keeps the story with heroine Katniss Everdeen through a clever use of close ups and out of focus background, rather than often revealing what is transpiring all around her. This is not an entertainment, and it is not intended as such, but rather as a harrowing journey of wills that ask the audience members to often wonder how would they respond if they were forced to kill to live. Overall, The Hunger Games is a well made sci-fi thriller that features larger than life situations with genuine suspense that does not let up, and really expands and visualizes the world of the novels by Suzanne Collins in a satisfying way that makes The Hunger Games worth watching for the thrills and thought it provokes.I give The Hunger Games a 10 out of 10!",10,3,18,23 March 2012
Zootopia," A Surprising Joy
","Disney has a long history of talking animal movies, and with their latest animated movie, Zootopia, they manage to go beyond the usual trappings of almost every other talking animal movie to make the strongest movie Disney Animation has put out since the Nineties. Now I know that's a bold claim, considering in just the past three to four years alone we've had the likes of Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6, but there is something special about Zootopia that makes it such a strong entry in the Disney canon.The titular Zootopia is an animal metropolis in a world where all animals have evolved to become anthropomorphic beings who dress, act, and live like the humans of our world. Our heroine is Judy Hopps, the first rabbit cop Zootopia has ever seen. Judy is belittled by her superiors and only has 48 hours to prove herself by solving a missing animals case or else she'll have to turn in her badge. With the help of a con artist fox named Nick Wilde, Judy just might be able to do just that. What follows is a story that is as warm and fuzzy as anything that Disney has ever done, but with more shades of our real world sewn thematically throughout the narrative.The whole of Zootopia is about the concept of prejudice against others, or more particularly, our stereotyping people and wanting to put them in a box, saying they cannot go beyond those limitations. We see that everyday in our real world and it's heady stuff for an animated Disney movie, which is why it is great that the movie is as funny as it is. Seriously, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, animated or live action, which allows the larger ideas at work in the story to never feel preachy. The greatest feat of this movie is how gracefully it skirts around its real meaning without feeling as if the movie makers are pushing their own personal agendas. The movie is made in such a way that moviegoers can graft their own experiences onto these characters because we've all felt the ways that these characters have felt at one point or another -- bullied, underestimated, and misunderstood. In doing this, Zootopia becomes something special, that rare breed of movie that makes you think, feel, and have fun, all in equal measure, with a lot of the fun part coming thanks to the sheer originality at every turn.Zootopia is one of the most original movies Disney has made in a long while, with the city of Zootopia being such a unique creation. All of the different ecosystems in Zootopia are a joy to see, from a rainforest area, to a tundra area, all the way to Little Rodentia, where the mice live in miniaturized skyscrapers, the animators, led by directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore, really capture the essence of both city life and the animal kingdom, in a perfect design meld. Then there are the countless jokes that play off of all the unique traits that each animal species is known for, such as bunnies being good at multiplication or there being only sloths working at the DMV. You can't help but laugh and be amazed at every turn at how nimbly the movie keeps clipping along. Then there's the fact that Zootopia is also a mystery yarn, with the movie often mimicking old detective flicks in the way that Judy and Nick try to solve their case, adding elements of suspense to an otherwise traditional animated movie.So if you can't tell, I loved Zootopia and thought it was a real joy from start to finish. From top to bottom, this is just a well made movie, featuring exceptional writing, directing, voice acting, animation, and music, with Michael Giacchino's musical score infusing lots of tribal African instrumentation to create a score that is different and engaging. While the movie is a little rougher than most parents might expect, due to some frightening moments involving bullies and some rabid animals, kids about seven and up should have a blast with it. I know this big kid did.I give Zootopia a 10 out of 10!",10,5,16,6 March 2016
The Impossible," It's All About the Actors
","Director J.A. Bayona's survival film, The Impossible, tells the harrowing true story of one family on vacation in Thailand on December 26th 2004, when the historic tsunami hit and separated this family. The whole film follows two different stories: the oldest son (Tom Holland) with his injured mom (Naomi Watts), trying to get her to safety, while the other two sons and their dad (Ewan McGreggor), search for his wife and son.The Impossible's script never really fleshes out the backstories of these characters, but what makes the film so affecting are the in-the-moment performances by the actors and the tense direction from Bayona. The way Watts, McGreggor, Holland, and the other two child actors that make up the family, play their roles is where the film lives. They take the events that they're given, and even though there is nothing to their characters that inform how or why they'd make decisions, the actor's decide to make their decisions based upon primal instincts of what one would do if their loved ones were lost or in danger.All of the child actors are perfectly cast, and teenager Tom Holland actually has the largest role in the film, delivering a soulful performance showing an emotional maturity that few actors in his age range have. Then Watts and McGreggor both re-enforce why they're two of the premiere actors in the industry, with one close-up shot where Watts is being dragged to safety through the disaster area, being a moment worthy of Oscar contention.While The Impossible's script is lacking in depth of character, the raw nature of the performances and the directing, as well as the beautiful cinematography, makes The Impossible a film worth seeing, but be warned, the rawness of seeing such devastation and physical injury could be unsettling for some moviegoers.I give The Impossible an 8 out of 10!",8,2,4,4 January 2013
42," Not a Complete Home Run, but it is Inspiring
","42 tells the story of famed baseball player, Jackie Robinson, and his becoming the first major league black ballplayer for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 42 checks all of the boxes expected from a biopic such as this, it's historically fascinating and inspirational, featuring solid performances from its cast. Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Jackie Robinson, but the real standouts in the cast are Alan Tudyk as racist Philadelphia Phillies' manager Ben Chapman and Harrison Ford as Dodger's owner, Branch Rickey. This is the first performance I have seen Ford do in nearly a decade where I actually enjoyed the choices he made as an actor, though I still can't figure out that growl. While the movie takes a long while in the first hour simply laying out small one minute scenes to give the historical facts necessary for the rest of the movie to work causing the film to have a lack of focus as to who the real main character of the movie is, Robinson or Rickey, once Robinson joins the Dodgers, writer/director Brian Helgeland finally takes the time to take root in scenes and explore them in great detail to create emotion rather than just hammering home a fact like a history book. Even though 42 is not a complete home run, it's an enjoyable movie that is affecting and will win over crowds.I give 42 a 7 out of 10!",7,2,4,13 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good.but not as good as the first.
","When this film was announced I was very skeptical,I thought the first one didn't need a sequel.So going into the film my expectations were somewhat low,but a repeated viewing of the first one before I saw this one got me excited about seeing it.When I finally saw it I have to say it met my expectations.Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest was a good movie,but just not as good as the original.The film starts with Will and Elizabeth being arrested on their wedding day by Lord Becket(a British officer)for assisting Jack Sparrow in escaping in the first film.Becket makes Will go find Jack and take Jack's compass and bring it back to him in exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom.As Will searches for Jack we learn that Jack owes a debt to the squid faced Davy Jones and the only way to get out of it is to find the Dead Man's Chest.Probably the most interesting aspect of this film is the story,it is both the strongest and weakest part of the film.I loved how it expanded on all of the characters from the first film,and the plot is very original and unique.The plot was amazing,but the execution of it in the story was not as amazing.The pacing was at many times bad,and I found the story very confusing at times and hard to follow(part of this problem comes from some of the actors hard to understand accents).Everything else in the film was all top notch.The directing was wonderful,and the special effects were superb(a big pat on the back for ILM).The acting was just as good as it was in the original(partly because most of the cast returned).My biggest problem with this film was the lack of action.I know in a sequel you must have more story,but there was very little action.One of the biggest problems with the action was the bad pacing of the action.There was very little action until the very end,but the action at the end was really great.My only other gripe is Jack Sparrow,now he is hilarious but they basically put this film on his shoulders and his slapstick jokes got old after about halfway through the film.All in all this film is a really good popcorn movie,and many will watch this and love it but I just wanted a little more from it.I loved the first film and was sadly disappointed with this sequel.It is still way better than most other films this year(except Superman Returns which is still my favorite).Score:A good 7 out of 10!",7,0,1,8 July 2006
Argo," If only History class was like this...
","In the film Argo, Ben Affleck plays real-life CIA agent, Tony Mendez, during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, when Iranians took over the United States embassy in Iran. It was during the chaos, that six Americans escaped from the embassy, taking refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. That is where Mendez comes in, trying to get the six Americans out of Iran before they are found and killed, by using the cover that they are members of a Canadian film crew, making a Star Wars rip-off, called 'Argo.'In so many ways, where the film works best is in dealing with the historical aspects of the hostage crisis and utilizing what was happening in the world at that time to create a history lesson for people, who like me, were not alive then. From a production standpoint, the film is meticulously crafted, often using 8mm photography mixed with the 35mm cinematography to create the look and feel of 1970's films like Dog Day Afternoon or All the President's Men. The cinematography definitely mimics such films, with its emphasis on natural light and hand-held camera work, making the scenes often feel like they were shot by a news cameraman in the real-life field. As well, the production design is staggering. Very often you see films that are set in the past that look as if they haven't been lived in and were built yesterday, but Argo actually shows these environments in a more real, lived in fashion. Of course, when Argo starts to deal more so with the film cover story, it often falters.While this is all part of the true story, when Mendez is dealing with Hollywood producers trying to create this fake movie as a cover, the film loses some of its propulsive intensity, languishing in humor, rather than the suspense of the other nine-tenths of the film. However, these Hollywood scenes work on their own, thanks in large part to John Goodman as makeup legend, John Chambers, and Alan Arkin as an aging movie producer, both in top form, essentially portraying their charming selves. However, when Argo returns to the matter of the hostage crisis at hand, it excels with many scenes of white knuckle suspense. These are in fact, the finest moments of the film, when director Ben Affleck works to create a news-like feel in the hostage situations -- such as the embassy takeover or the escape from the Iranians at the climax -- by using minimal music and no Hollywood thrills to create a truly authentic, and terrifying glimpse at this event. For these reasons, Argo works brilliantly as a suspense thriller and as a time capsule, and that is why it must be seen, especially if you were not alive during the event and have limited knowledge of its history.I give Argo an 8 out of 10!",8,1,3,14 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Spoiler-Free Review of an Awesome Movie
","I am going to do something different than I normally do when I review a movie. I am not going to give any specifics as to the plot of the movie, for this is a movie best experienced as spoiler free as possible.Director J.J. Abrams' follow-up to his 2009 Star Trek reboot, Star Trek Into Darkness, is Abrams and company's equivalent of The Empire Strikes Back, or The Wrath of Khan, as you will. Like the two aforementioned films, Star Trek Into Darkness is not without wit, charm, and humor, but by the very nature of the life-and-death stakes of the story, it is far darker than its predecessor, but also more emotionally rewarding.This film has Bad Robot's DNA all over it. J.J. Abrams' production outfit, Bad Robot, has produced a film that is as full of twists and breakneck turns as their TV shows. Suffice to say, if you are a fan of Bad Robot productions, in particular Lost, Fringe, and the first Star Trek from four years ago, then you will be right at home here and will love everything about this film. This is a sequel that maintains the character relationships that made the first film work so well, and deepens them even further in this film, to where you are actively engaged in the fates of each and every character.While I would say the first film had more energy and bigger Summer thrills, this film has more character and more emotion, making the two impossible to compare. It's like trying to compare the original Star Wars to The Empire Strikes Back. They're two completely separate types of films, both are adventure films, but one is more lighthearted and one is the most moving Star Trek film I have ever seen.Actor Chris Pine delivers a hero's performance as Captain James T. Kirk that is every bit as charming and soulful as Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Then there's Zachary Quinto as Spock, who continues to make you ask, 'Leonard Nimoy-who?' I actually believe that I am liking this crew of the Enterprise more and more than any other incarnation of Star Trek. I don't think there has ever been this good of chemistry between the actors as there is in this series of Star Trek films, and it shows in every single frame of this film. From the laughs, to the thrills, to the... Oh, come on. Just see the movie already! I give Star Trek Into Darkness a 9 out of 10!",9,5,15,16 May 2013
Public Enemies," The Tragedy of John Dillinger
","Public Enemies, the latest film from director Michael Mann, is a film that is entertaining, but comes short of true greatness.The film chronicles the adventures of bank robber John Dillinger in 1933. Dillinger is portrayed here by Johnny Depp with the right amount of wit and charm. As a matter of fact all of the actors in the film turn in credible performances. Though what makes this film worth seeing is for the thrills. The action in the film is exhilarating and fast paced, keeping you on the edge of your seat. Mann handles the action sequences extremely well. Only problem with the action is that the film was filmed entirely with hand-held cameras, giving it this naturalistic feel that I am not usually a big fan of; I tend to prefer the more glossy-styled film-making.My biggest gripe with the film though comes with the fact that none of the characters truly have any depth to them. There are times where it looks like Mann is going to take the time and explore who the characters truly are, but he just introduces it subtly and then moves on without really harping much on it. Still this doesn't really affect the film that much, I was just expecting something a little bit more from someone of the caliber of Mann.Overall I enjoyed Public Enemies. It was a tense, action packed thrill ride that was in the end quite good, but just short of genuine greatness.I give Public Enemies a good 9 out of 10!",9,4,6,4 July 2009
Ted," A Quick, Nutshell Opinion of 'Ted'
","Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane makes the jump to features with his movie, Ted, telling the story of a boy's teddy bear who came to life, but now the boy is a man, and the bear has become a dirty mouthed, pot smoking slacker. Like all of MacFarlane's work, Ted is rude, crude, and socially unacceptable. Some of what MacFarlane finds funny could be seen as poor taste, but occasionally there are moments that are so ridiculous they are funny, such as Sam Jones, the actor who played Flash Gordon in that ill-fated '80s movie making a cameo appearance. Bottom line, if you're a fan of MacFarlane's television work, then you'll be at home with Ted, where MacFarlane can push the envelope even further at times with an R-rating. Personally, I find MacFarlane's sense of humor often offensive, in particular his religious jabs and his jokes about those with mental handicaps, but as I said above, often Ted is just so ridiculous, it is funny.I give Ted a 6 out of 10!",6,0,0,7 January 2013
Spider-Man 2," Even better than the first!
","Spider-man 2 is one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better than its predecessor. The continuing story of Peter Parker is one chock full of action, comedy, romance, and drama. Just like its predecessor, what truly makes this film shine is its genuine heart. This film has a ton of heart and by the end of the film when Peter and M.J. finally kiss, you can't help but feel your heart lift. As cheesy as that sounds its true. Though, not only is Spider-man 2 a very heartfelt film, but it also has terrific action. The action sequences are scripted to perfection. The reasons for the film's success lie in many areas, first because of the acting. All actors are terrific. This is Kirsten Dunst's best performance as Mary Jane, and Tobey Maguire is still the fanboy's dream version of Peter Parker. Though the greatest element of Spider-man 2's success is its director, Sam Raimi. It is clearly obvious that Raimi has a lot of love and respect for this character, only a true fan such as this could coax out the most magnificent portions of this world and its characters.Overall Spider-man 2 is easily one of the best sequels of all-time. With an even more awesome villain than in the first in Doc Ock, and with even more heart than Spidey's previous outing, Spider-man 2 is a true winner.I give Spider-man 2 a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,13 March 2009
127 Hours," An Absorbing Tale of Perseverance!
","127 Hours is a simple movie. There is only one real prominent character, for the most part one location, and one major action that takes up nearly the entire movie, so how does this movie remain a riveting experience? A perfect collaboration between actor, director, and writers.Danny Boyle directs the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston who gets his arm pinned beneath a boulder and ultimately resolves to cut his arm off to survive and find help. Boyle, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy, pumps his kinetic visual style throughout the entire movie, using split-screen to marvelous effect to show Ralston's fast-paced, ADD lifestyle. I mean, no one other than Boyle would take shots inside Ralston's arm, or inside Ralston's water bottle. Not only that, Boyle manages to keep this movie from being simply about the situation of being trapped beneath a boulder by including video messages that Aron makes on his digital camera to his friends and family, in case anyone ever finds it, but where the movie really finds its heart and its message is when Aron starts slipping in-and-out of consciousness and blurs his dreams, memories, and reality, all into one.Actor James Franco plays Ralston as a self-absorbed man, who finds pathos in the end realizing he can't do it all on his own. The greatest thing about Franco's performance, is it feels real, it actually looks and sounds as if he is in the same pain that Ralston most likely was in this situation. Franco holds nothing back and it is primarily because of his reaction that makes the scene where he actually cuts through his arm so tense, not to mention the precise editing and building music by A.R. Rahman.If there is one thing that 127 Hours is about is the perseverance of the human soul to continue living, even in the most extreme circumstances, and to find that this near death experience only humbles Ralston and makes him a changed man makes the movie all the more affecting and uplifting.I give 127 Hours a 10 out of 10!",10,1,8,9 February 2011
Batman Returns," The Dark Knight Returns in this sequel to the 1989 film, Batman.
","Batman Returns is the second film in the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman franchise of the late 80s, early 90s.In Batman Returns it is Christmas time in Gotham City, the Batman (played once more by Michael Keaton) has become an established force defending the city. Then suddenly this new vile group of insane circus freaks come onto the scene and begin wreaking havoc, they are led by the deformed freak, the Penguin (Danny DeVito). At the same time a female cat burglar comes onto the scene pulling off many small time robberies, she ends up joining forces with the Penguin, this woman is known as Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman has to naturally battle these two foes to try and protect Gotham City, when in the meantime the Penguin runs for Mayor of Gotham City, with the help of corrupt business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). In the end, though, we learn that the Penguin has much more on his mind than just becoming Mayor, this results in Batman having to use all of his cutting edge technology and all of his wits to stop the demented Penguin and his gang.I think this comment should first focus on what is good about this film, rather than focusing on the negative. First, the Gotham City that has been made within this film is truly unique and is one of the best versions of Gotham ever captured on film. Second, the production values are very good, Tim Burton's directing is good, and the script is fairly well written; as well the acting is top notch, this film was very well casted. All of the other stuff, like cinematography, score, and such are all really good as well, but that stuff is really all that is good.The problems with Batman Returns are many. First and foremost the film focuses too much on Batman's villains rather than Batman himself, now this was a problem the first Batman had, but this time around, with an extra villain, Batman has even less screen time. Another major problem with this film is it took way too many departures from the comic books, there are many points in this film that I wonder if I am even watching a Batman film. As well, this is an action movie with very little action within it, and the little you do get is not engaging at all, you just want the action to end once you get to it.Overall this is just not that great of a movie, and is really only a Batman film by name only.Score: A decent 6 out of 10.",6,1,2,18 February 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Slightly Better Than I Thought
","Why this movie was made as opposed to another film which brought the X-Men team back together again, I don't know. What I do know is that while I had my reservations about X-Men Origins: Wolverine, overall it turned out to be an O.K. movie. I'm not saying that this film is as impressive as Iron Man or the previous three X-Men films, but it still gets the summer movie season kicked off on a fairly decent note. While I was entertained, the movie was not without its problems. Firstly the special effects were really bad by today's standards, as well the story never seemed to build up to anything; it's comparable to an orchestra playing a symphonic piece and playing it as loud as possible for the entire time. Still, with these few minor gripes aside the film still managed to satisfy the audience.The action was entertaining to watch unfold and also the dialogue in many spots was quite clever. Overall I'd recommend seeing this film. While it is a far cry from any of its predecessors, it still packs enough punch to let the audiences know that summer is finally here.I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine a 6 out of 10!",6,0,3,3 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Is the Rebirth of the Terminator Franchise what many were Hoping For?
","When many people think of action movies, the Terminator films are usually among the first to cross the mind. The Jim Cameron creation is synonymous with both the action and science fiction genre. Now I never thought that there should have been another Terminator after the third film, then I heard that they were making a fourth and were planning to have it take place post-Judgment Day. Now I never really felt we needed to see what happens after Judgment Day, the little we saw in previous movies was enough for me, but lo-and-behold a fourth film was made. Terminator Salvation is the fourth film in this classic franchise, the main question is whether it manages to live up to its lofty name? Sad to say the answer is not exactly what one would expect.While Terminator Salvation is not a horrible film, it just lacks any real characters or an intriguing story. The characters in this film are two-dimensional, a large part of this is due to the fact that the script is constantly switching back-and-forth amongst the multiple characters, never truly taking the time to develop any of these said characters. Due to this fact it is often hard to tell who the true protagonist is; Kyle Reese, Marcus Wright, and John Connor all have the same amount of screen time, and depending upon your view any one of them can be the protagonist. Perhaps the weak characters can explain the so-so acting, which is sad cause the film is chock full of terrific actors. Christian Bale was never given anything to work with as John Connor and comes off as just an angry uncle; Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright has moments of near brilliance, but the scenes usually end before he can reach it; and Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese is the only one who manages to break out past the rest and stand out, all simply cause his character is the closest any character in the film comes to having three dimensions. Still, rocky characters can be overlooked with a dynamite story, but sadly the story is not too much better. The story is chock full of good ideas, but the execution of these said ideas is not exactly what one would hope for; what these ideas needed was more development in the pattern of the story to truly come to fruition. If only the film ever slowed down long enough to take a breath perhaps we might have ended up with a genuine classic, but instead the film tries to rely on subtlety without any development within the story and the characters.Now while I may have some problems with the story and the characters, I must say that the action in the film is good overall. This is by far the most entertained I have been by this type of meat-and-potatoes action movie in a long time. Throw in some awesome special effects and an amazing cameo from Arnold, and the film has the makings of a terrific summer blockbuster but ultimately it fell flat.Terminator Salvation in the end had tremendous ambition, the entire time you're watching this film you see where they wanted go, but it never seemed to get all the way to the top. Perhaps just one more rewrite of the script could have fixed my quibbles with the film, cause despite a weak story and characters, the film's action and special effects are truly superb. All-in-all it simply boils down to what you want when you go to see a movie. If all you want is great action and big explosions, then this film is for you, but if you happen to want just a little bit more from a film, or if you happen to be a big fan of the Terminator franchise, you may ultimately come away disappointed.I give Terminator Salvation a slightly disappointing 6 out of 10!",6,16,30,21 May 2009
My Neighbor Totoro," A Truly Heartfelt Adventure!
","Hayao Miyazaki's films always seem to amaze me. Whether it be the dense and extremely poignant Princess Mononoke, or the beautiful and deeply affecting Spirited Away, he always manages to capture the viewer's imagination, but no other film in his catalog manages to ensnare the viewer quite like My Neighbor Totoro. In a way it is very different than many of his other films.My Neighbor Totoro is a simple film, but told in a very affecting way. It's the story of two young girls who move to the country with their father so that they can be near their ailing mother in the hospital. While at their new home the girls discover an ancient forest spirit called Totoro that can only be seen by children, and Totoro helps them to find hope within all their inner turmoil.It is safe to say that My Neighbor Totoro is quite possibly Miyazaki's most human film he has ever made. While there are many other Miyazaki films that are perhaps more breathtaking in scope and may have far more intriguing plots, My Neighbor Totoro puts all of its focus on the characters rather than the fantasy. As a matter of fact the fantasy within the film is very sparse, and appears at all the right moments to strike the perfect chord with your emotions. Though this should not lead one to believe the film doesn't have some awe-inspiring fantasy. It wouldn't be a Miyazaki film if it didn't. There are many sequences, such as the catbus scenes or the flight with Totoro that are simply magical and help solidify this film amongst the pantheon of other Studio Ghibli productions.Miyazaki makes the smart choice of telling the story through the eyes of the children rather than giving it a cynical adult spin. In doing this he draws us into this world; you literally feel as if you stepped in a time machine and went back into your childhood. The children treat the world as if it's this magical place, full of mystery and wonder. We never see the dark side of human nature within this film, cause as children we never did. What Miyazaki does show is how to enjoy life and its simplicities, but not only that he makes us remember that it's alright to feel emotion; to be scared, to laugh, to cry. As adults we very often forget these simple things, bottling everything up, making us bitter and cynical beings.Of course My Neighbor Totoro is just as gorgeous as any other Studio Ghibli production. My Neighbor Totoro features some of the finest hand-drawn animation I've ever seen. It's amazing that this was done back in the days before computers. Many of the shots are so complex to draw that most animators would shy away from doing without a computer, but not Miyazaki. Now while some fans may despise the dubbed versions of Miyazaki's films done by Disney, I've never minded them, and this is easily one of their better dubs thus far. Dakota and Elle Fanning are perfect as the two sisters. Their authentic chemistry really comes through on screen.Overall My Neighbor Totoro is a funny, heartwarming film. Miyazaki perfectly struck a chord with the audience on this one. It's an innocent look back at childhood, bringing back the sheer wonder that following a mysterious animal in the backyard could have. Though what this film truly does is make us as adults forget what we are truly missing, but as Totoro does with the girls, Miyazaki shows that there is hope in us rediscovering that innocence and simplicity once more.I give My Neighbor Totoro a beautiful 10 out of 10!",10,1,2,27 July 2009
500 Days of Summer," All in 500 Days!
","500 days. Doesn't sound like a very long period of time, but when given the right circumstances those days slowly creep by. A lot can happen in just a mere 500 days, one can find love, lose it, and then discover their true happiness and have their beliefs completely reaffirmed. That is the film (500) Days of Summer in a nutshell.(500) Days of Summer is the story of Tom, a greeting card writer, and his romantic relationship with Summer, his boss's assistant. The story follows the ups-and-downs of their relationship over the course of 500 days. Tom, a hopeless romantic, hopes to find true love around every turn, while Summer doesn't want a serious relationship.The film unfolds in a nonlinear fashion, beginning at the end, then skipping to the middle, and then back to the beginning again. At first it catches one by surprise, throwing all anyone has ever known about story structure out the door, but after the midpoint of the film these transitions simply feel natural in order to tell the story the way it was meant to be told. Director Marc Webb infuses the film with a very pleasing visual style, giving the film this dream-like feel. As well the acting from the two leads, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel is fantastic, in particular Gordon Levitt. Gordon Levitt's performance as Tom is deeply affecting. He is funny while also being the everyman. Gordon Levitt at times reminds one of a young Tom Hanks or Jimmy Stewart, and I feel with the right role he can become a mega star.(500) Days of Summer is a film that feels as if it is a modern day fairy tale, while also being highly realistic at the same time. The dream-like look of the film and the hilarity that ensues in many situations is not always channeling realism (not to mention the omniscient narrator who comes in from time-to-time), but what makes this film feel real is the emotions of the characters and their relationships. I think every guy can relate to Tom and his pursuit of true love. Every guy has known a girl like Summer, a girl that they wanted but could never truly have. It is because of this I believe that this is not your typical romantic comedy. It's actually a romantic comedy told for men rather than women, and it's from this viewpoint that I managed to identify with Tom so much. Of course what this film offers most importantly is hope, letting us realize that there truly are other fish in the sea.(500) Days of Summer is a highly entertaining film. It is funny, charming, and hopeful all in one. While this film will ultimately not appeal to all, it is definitely worth a look.I give (500) Days of a Summer a 10 out of 10!",10,4,8,10 August 2009

","I loved the first Pirates film,it still ranks as one of my favorite films of all-time which is why it makes me so mad that they made these lackluster sequels.Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End was a decent movie,but seemed to miss the mark even more than the second one did.The film starts with Will(Bloom),Elizabeth(Knightley),and Barbossa(Rush) traveling to Singapore to request the aid of the pirate lord Sao Fang(Chow Yun Fat) to go to Davy Jone's Locker and rescue Jack(Depp).My first big problem with this film was that they finally 'jumped the shark'.They went too big,and handled it in the entirely wrong way.Secondly they tried putting humor in the entirely wrong moments.There were many dark moments in this film and to try and lighten them up they threw in jokes that felt out of place.Because of these two points they destroyed parts of the movie that had potential to be cool,but just came out cheesy and annoying.Another complaint with it was the lack of action,there was very little action in the whole movie,and the little you got wasn't very gripping.Another small complaint was the choppy editing and hard to understand accents.Because of these two reasons I was lost throughout much of the movie not knowing what they were doing and why they were doing it.My last complaint is that the tone of the first film seems to have been completely lost.By the time this film ends it feels like you were watching a completely different franchise just with similar characters.The filmmakers seem to have completely forgotten what made the original so great and entertaining.Now I know I have many complaints with it,but that isn't to say all was bad.Although he was working with a poorly written script director Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job,and the actors as well,although most of them had hard to understand accents.The real highlight of the film was the marvelous special effects and the superb cinematography.The creative cinematography was definitely the highlight of the film.All in all it was a very disappointing end to what started out as a great franchise and has ended up as this bizarre,and lackluster film that seems to be in an identity crisis.With a hard to follow story,very little and poor action,and the sheer bizarreness of it all made this film a very bad conclusion.Now it's decent enough to see maybe 1 or 2 times,but after that there is no real lasting impact.I give Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's a disappointing: 6 out of 10!",6,0,2,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Failed to live up to the hype!
","Upon first viewing Spider-man 3, I must say that it was one of the bigger disappointments I've ever had upon viewing a film. The first two Spider-man films were both great films, but this one just seemed to lack that magic that made the first two so enjoyable. From the very first frame of this film I could tell that that something was missing, then as the film progressed the film just got more and more disappointing. First off the film was too jampacked, there were too many villains for one film, then on top of all that the film turned in the smart and witty comedy of the first two for cheesy comedy in this one. I mean the scene where Peter Parker dances down the street dressed as an Emo kid is one of the most painful scenes to watch in any film. Overall Spider-man 3 was a huge disappointment and I'm not really sure that I can recommend it to any fan of the webcrawler.I give Spider-man 3 a disappointing 5 out of 10!",5,0,1,13 March 2009
Yes Man," A Terrific Comedy from Carrey!
","Yes Man is Jim Carrey's latest comedy, and I have got to admit I was not too terribly excited before viewing this film, but upon seeing it I was pleasantly surprised.Yes Man's premise is simple and direct. Jim Carrey's character basically attends a self help seminar that teaches its participants to say Yes to everything in life. As Carrey begins to do just that it leads to many funny and endearing sequences, resulting in him not only learning to live life, but also finding love as well.Yes Man was a truly terrific time at the movies and was quite possibly my favorite comedy I have seen in sometime. Jim Carrey was as usual terrific in this film, but the other supporting players, such as Zooey Deschanel, were excellent as well. Thanks to the film's terrific cast the laughs continued to come. My only minor problem was that the film is very slow to the start, it takes nearly 15-20 minutes for it to really have its first good laugh, but once you reach that point the laughs do not stop till the credits roll. Putting it simply, if you are a fan of Jim Carrey's other comedies such as Bruce Almighty and Liar, Liar, you will feel at home here and love this film.I give Yes Man a hilarious 9 out of 10!",9,1,2,3 January 2009
Midnight in Paris," A Straightforward, Modern Day Fairy Tale from Woody!
","Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a decidedly simple story of fantasy and romance in Paris. When the clock chimes midnight in Paris, a writer with writer's block, witnesses the city turn into 1920's Paris right before his eyes, meeting F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and many other prominent artists from the era. Owen Wilson plays writer Gil Pender with charm and wit; the whole movie is filled with the same amount of charm and wit, as Gil, tired of writing Hollywood movies, wants to be a real writer, while his fiancé, played by Rachel McAdams, is about as opposite of a girl from Gil as any guy could imagine dating. What Gil finds when he travels back in time isn't just the key to unlocking his own writer's block, but potentially true love when he meets flapper, Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard. The charm of the story really lies in the segments taking place in the past, and most of the good humor comes in the modern day scenes when Gil tries to cover up where he is going each night. While no explanation is given as to how or why this time travel works, the charm overpowers the questions as to how and why (though these questions never leave the back of the mind either). As it is, without the occasional interlude into unnecessary politics, Woody Allen has written and directed an old fashioned fairy tale bridging modern day with that of the past, and what one can learn about their own time and appreciation of it through nostalgia. Like the romantics, it is straightforward. Is it too straightforward? Sometimes, but not enough to keep Midnight in Paris from being entertaining.I give Midnight in Paris an 8 out of 10!",8,2,4,23 June 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Phoned in Spielberg and John Williams
","Like a Saturday morning cartoon, The Adventures of Tintin is brisk entertainment that is easily digestible, with plenty of excitement and laughs. Director Steven Spielberg crafts a children's film about a young intrepid reporter, named Tintin, and his uber-smart dog, Snowy, working to unravel a mystery involving sunken treasure. Simple enough concept, and Spielberg rarely strays from it to delve deeper into the emotions of the characters and add anything beyond standard stock characters -- in particular Tintin and the villain, Sakharine. However, The Adventures of Tintin flies by at a nice pace, with just enough missing pieces to the mystery -- and some highly imaginative action sequences every few minutes -- to keep the audience from zonking out. Spielberg deserves huge props on the masterful staging of a sequence where two construction cranes battle, smashing into one another. They cross in midair like large sword blades, one piloted by Sakharine, and the other by Captain Haddock, Tintin's sidekick. The imagination on display here and the near flawless animation and motion capture work from WETA, make The Adventures of Tintin an enjoyable thrill ride. Even if there is a lack of suspense cause we are never given enough time to delve deeper into characters and develop any real emotional connection, The Adventures of Tintin is a theme park ride. Short and enjoyable, but the thrills will most likely be forgotten a short while later.I give The Adventures of Tintin a 7 out of 10!",7,0,2,21 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," One of the greatest endings in movie history!
","Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, more commonly known as just Return of the Jedi, is the third and final installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, and the sixth Star Wars in chronological order. This film is a definite showcase of how the third film in a trilogy should be, it maintains all of the things that made the original two so amazing while adding more on and ending with a very satisfying conclusion. As always the acting, special effects, directing, editing, production design, etc., it's just all top notch, easy to say it is a well made film. There really isn't anything bad to say about this one, everything is just perfect like the other two in the original trilogy. A new addition to the Star Wars universe is the teddy bear-like creatures known as Ewoks, they add some great comedy and in the end help deliver a great message. Overall it is another great installment of the Star Wars franchise and concludes everything in one of the greatest, most joyous endings in movie history, it's just perfect.Rating: Another Star Wars movie with a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,2,5,15 October 2007
The Expendables," Was there any story? And do I care?
","I very often sat there during The Expendables wondering if I missed something in the story, but I didn't. The story never felt connected, and it really seemed as if it was just there to give a video game like mission so we can see some explosions. Regardless as to the debate whether or not there is a real story, The Expendables is an hour-and-half thrill ride that sometimes has plot holes in the little bit of story that there is, but this tale of a group of mercenaries, hired by the CIA to assassinate a drug dealing ex-patriot and his puppet general, is too enjoyable to pass up.Sylvester Stallone co-wrote and directed this romp that is filled with gore and immense amounts of blood splatter. Stallone headlines an impressive cast of action stars from Jason Statham to cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzeneger. As can be gathered, there is little acting in this movie, just a bunch of shoot-em-ups and beat-em-ups, save for one scene where Mickey Rourke (the names keep rolling) reminisces about how he lost his humanity when he let a woman kill herself. Regardless, the action sequences are brimming with so much adrenaline, it's hard to be fazed by the shortcomings of the story.As a whole, The Expendables is a mindless action flick with very little depth and ripe with political incorrectness (seeing as how every Jet Li joke was about his height, etc.), but the action is so unique, terrific, and nonstop, it's impossible not to get a kick out of The Expendables.I give The Expendables a 7 out of 10!",7,2,8,15 August 2010
Nacho Libre," Wow this was bad!
","When I first saw this movie's trailers I thought it could be good(because I am a Jack Black fan),but then I saw from the makers of Napoleon Dynamite.Now I didn't like Napoleon Dynamite at all and after seeing that I was convinced I didn't want to see it,but I thought it is a completely different movie and I should give it a chance.I was awfully mistaken.To start the story was choppy and confusing,I was at many times wondering what was happening.I am a big fan of story and character in films and this had none of that.Now I wasn't that surprised when this happened though because Napoleon Dynamite didn't have any of this,but I was shocked about Jack Black.Jack is a funny man and I thought well he could maybe redeem this movie from being awful and he let me down.There were only one or two funny scenes in this movie.Now there may be fans of this movie out there,but I am not one of them.Now this would be a great dollar movie(if you have one near you),but is not worth your money for a full admission's ticket.There are hundreds of funnier comedies out there.Score:A 2 out of 10!",2,8,17,30 June 2006
Suicide Squad," Not Bad, But Not Great Either
","It was a bit of a surprise when DC and Warner Bros. announced a Suicide Squad movie a few years back. While the team made up of super villains forced into doing good by the US government has long been a fan favorite, it was an odd choice for the third movie in the shared DC universe of movies following Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I still personally feel that way after seeing Suicide Squad. While the movie is leagues better than most critics want you to believe it is, it's also not as good as most fans were wanting it to be either. Instead, Suicide Squad is a flawed, yet occasionally fun comic book movie that will appease some, but not all.The movie opens with a series of vignettes setting up the primary members of the Suicide Squad: Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang, Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje's Killer Croc, and Jay Hernandez's Diablo. They are all brought together by a morally dubious US agent by the name of Amanda Waller (played exceptionally by Viola Davis), to go into the fictional metropolis of Midway City to stop a supernatural threat that threatens the entire world. Once the Suicide Squad sets down in Midway City, the movie really starts to take off with wall-to-wall action, but the first forty-five minutes of set up really keeps the movie ever from gaining much momentum upfront. On top of that, as a DC Comics fanboy, I found many of the portrayals of the characters lacking.While it is fun to see the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, on the bigscreen for the first time, I don't think writer/director David Ayer handled her well. Personally, I feel Margot Robbie was well cast, but she lacked the right material to make Harley the Harley from the comic books. The way Harley is written in this movie is a little too flirtatious for my liking, missing that naive quality that makes her so irresistibly entertaining in the comics. Then there is the bigger issue of the portrayal of Harley's puddin', Mr. J himself, the Joker. Actor Jared Leto and Ayer seemed to want to turn the Joker more into a gangsta rather than a gangster, and I'm not really sure I like that angle, with the metal teeth just annoying me as a fanboy. Of course I could live with the appearance of the character if he acted like the comic book Joker for most of the movie, but the way the character is portrayed, he rarely does. He often comes across serious in most of his scenes, which is in stark contrast to every other Joker portrayal ever. Honestly, Jared Leto was always going to have a tough row to hoe with him being the first actor to follow Heath Ledger in the role, and unfortunately, while they tried to differentiate Leto's Joker from Heath's Joker, in the end, they might have tried too much. Now while I took issue with some of the characterizations in this movie, there were some that were spot on.Viola Davis is absolutely perfect as Amanda Waller, getting the authoritative swagger of the character down pat. Then there's Will Smith as Deadshot, who is essentially being Will Smith as a hit-man for hire, but his Deadshot works in areas where some of the other characters don't by injecting appropriate doses of humor and empathy into the role. And I can't go on without mentioning Karen Fukuhara as Katana, the sword- wielding ninja that comes in to protect Waller's liaison, Rick Flagg, from being turned on by the squad. Katana is not handled with as much attention as I wish she would have been, but Fukuhara makes the most of her limited screen time and really nails the silent, but deadly demeanor of the character. As well, while Ben Affleck is literally only in about two to three minutes of the whole movie, he continues to make a good impression as Batman. Sprinkle on top some action that is fun to watch unfold, and you have a Summer blockbuster that is more entertaining than it's not.All in all, Suicide Squad is a movie that is enjoyable enough to warrant seeing if you're a fanboy, but you'll still probably come away with a few quibbles of your own. I am still baffled as to why DC isn't choosing to be like Marvel and be more faithful to the comic books with most of their characters, but Suicide Squad does manage to get right more than it gets wrong. As far as the three movies currently in the DC Extended Universe, I'd have to say Suicide Squad is the weakest of the three, weaker than both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, which I still personally feel is the best of the flawed bunch.I give Suicide Squad a 6 out of 10!",6,0,1,6 August 2016
Taxi Driver," Genuine Madness!
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is an intriguing film. The story of a New York taxi cab driver whose dislike for society drives him to madness. In a way it is the story of a psychopath, but then it turns out to be the story of a vigilante. It's safe to say Travis Bickle is one of the more complicated characters in cinema history.Travis Bickle, the taxi driver himself, played chillingly by Robert DeNiro, is like a ticking time bomb. You're just waiting the entire film for him to snap, and when he does it is very disturbing, almost too disturbing for me. The true brilliance of the film lies within DeNiro. While I find it disturbing, you can't help but be entranced by his remarkable performance.The film was directed by legendary director Martin Scorsese. Here, like in so many of his other works, Scorsese glorifies the violence within the film, and if I had a complaint that would be it. The violence is grotesque at times, while some of it adds to the story, I find it more artistic when the violence is merely suggested within a film rather than brutally presented. Even still, Scorsese presents the film with magnificent visuals and terrific performances from his actors.Taxi Driver is really a unique film, it broke the mold as to what one expects out of cinema. It's still to this day a daring piece of work, one that you can't help but admire. As well, it is probably the best character study of a person driven into madness ever put to film.I give Taxi Driver an 8 out of 10!",8,0,0,27 October 2009
Shutter Island," Far From Scorsese's Best, But Definitely Not His Worst
","Director Martin Scorsese weaves a tale that I can't quite place words upon. Shutter Island is part drama, part thriller, part horror. It is a touch film noir, while also being a pinch trippy. Regardless as to what it truly is, the mystery of Shutter Island is one worth seeing, but perhaps not the director's best in his long pantheon of work.On an island off the coast of Boston, engulfed in the fog and on the rim of a hurricane, there lies a mental hospital called Aschliffe. The hospital only takes the most dangerous, most mentally unstable patients. A patient has recently escaped, and no one can explain her mysterious disappearance. Two U.S. Marshalls come to the island, our hero Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner. But is there more going on upon the mysterious Shutter Island than meets the eye? That is what Teddy is trying to find out, while also searching for his wife's killer, who is an inmate in the institution.This film is what one would call a mindbender, and for that Scorsese should be duly applauded. While I figured out the big twist at the end about halfway through the film, I was severely impressed at how well Scorsese painted a portrait of insanity in this film. To call this film crazy would actually be a compliment and not a detriment to its storytelling abilities. It is an insane film, making you feel as if you ventured inside a crazy man's head for 2 hours. Dream sequences, hallucinations of the ghosts of his past, Teddy is our guide through this look at sanity and its breaking point, and it is there that the film is the most stunning.The dream sequences highlight Teddy's past, his traumatic history. The death of his wife, his time serving in World War II where he came across a graveyard of dead bodies in a Nazi concentration camp. A man with such a tragic past, it is very easy to see how he eventually snapped. Though, it is with these dream sequences that Scorsese evokes his adoration for film noir. Teddy is the quintessential film noir protagonist. He's a troubled man, haunted by his past, and he is madly in love with the elusive woman he can't have. DiCaprio is stunning as Teddy, delivering a timeless performance that at times is reminiscent of Bogart or Cagney, but he always remains true DiCaprio and makes the emotional scenes between Teddy and his deceased wife all the more believable and heartbreaking.Martin Scorsese instituted his trademark visual flare here with the marvelous dream sequences and well done flashbacks, but as a whole the film lacked that special something to make this one of Scorsese's best. The film starts off riveting, dripping with suspense, and oozing with mystery. The latter half of the film is not as strong as the first, and it is debatable as to whether or not the ending was the right one for the film, because it kind of feels as if the story kind of just comes untied and feels incomplete rather than satisfying. Regardless, the film is a visual feast and is a cinephile's dream, and don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and mindbending, but it does not manage to live up to the suspense, nor the mystery set up at the beginning of the film.I give Shutter Island an 8 out of 10!",8,3,7,19 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Cap is Back!
","Captain America is finally back in the most awesome Marvel film since The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is everything that a fan could have hoped for with Marvel tackling this source material, and yet it is so different than any of the other films that Marvel has ever made. There is a more down to Earth, realistic aesthetic to this film. While there is still tons of sci-fi/fantasy concepts on display here, they're done in a nice real world way that keeps the film grounded in its political thriller aspirations. However, where this film really manages to distinguish itself is in the fact that this might be the most intimate Marvel film made thus far.Set almost entirely in Washington D.C. this go around, the film picks up roughly a year after the events of The Avengers. Still a man out of time, Cap finds himself working for SHIELD, doing special ops missions with Black Widow, all the while finding it harder and harder to distinguish the right from the wrong in today's morally neutral society. Of course, Cap's moral compass puts him at odds with some of SHIELD's more gray area ideas, but when a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier arrives and starts wreaking havoc, a whole big conspiracy involving SHIELD, and just about everything else in Cap's world, starts to unravel.When I mentioned earlier how intimate this film feels, it's because it truly is a character piece and is more about Steve Rogers' action/reaction to all of the events that unfold in this film. While there is a large spanning conspiracy that unfurls and bucket-loads of action that represent Captain America in a far more acrobatic way than we've ever seen him before, everything that occurs in this film, occurs not because they wanted action or explosions, but because it is driven by the characters' actions.Once again, Chris Evans proves he's the right man to wield Cap's shield, with Scarlett Johansson really starting to make the Black Widow more and more her own. Originally just a piece of eye candy in Iron Man 2, Black Widow's character evolved in The Avengers, and here in The Winter Soldier, Johansson and the folks at Marvel finally deliver the Black Widow of the comics. There is a cold, cerebral quality to her that contrasts with her desire to do good and to be more human. Sure, she doesn't have a Russian accent, but who cares when the core personality of the character is there. Rounding out the superb cast is Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon, and the gravitas-lending Robert Redford as a mysterious government man who helps run SHIELD, to say anymore might give away a few good surprises for moviegoers.That is really the most exciting thing about this film, it's that there are constantly twists and turns, and you never really know where the film is heading next. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo really surprise here with a very taut directorial style that still manages to have life seeping through the cracks due to their natural affinity for comedy, injecting a nice sense of humor into some very dark moments to keep the ten year old boys relaxed and still having fun even when some intense stuff is happening. The Winter Soldier is a villain to be reckoned with and is almost like Jaws in the way that whenever he is on screen, he is wreaking as much havoc and destruction as possible. You never quite know when the Winter Soldier will show up, and there is something so mysterious about the way he's represented that makes him genuinely terrifying whenever he comes out of nowhere. However, when more and more is revealed about the Winter Soldier and his origins, just like everything else in the movie for Captain America, things aren't so right and wrong and Cap must fight in that gray area himself in an emotionally powerful final fist fight with his enemy.Overall, Marvel has delivered one of their finest films with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is intense, funny, emotional, and gives your brain a nice workout because it's also very smart and full of nice twists and turns. Not to mention, it's an action movie, things go boom, punches are thrown, and people fly and shoot stuff. The fact that there's an emotionally charged story underneath all of the awesome action is merely icing on the cake. Marvel fanboys are going to love this one, with Marvel fitting in more villains and characters from the comics into this one film than perhaps any other superhero film before it, and it all works organically, these additional characters only show up when it is required to tell the story and not just to be a fan service. Bottom line is, just buckle up and enjoy the ride of this one. It's rare to get a film like this in April, so definitely relish in its awesomeness, and also, as always with Marvel, stay till the very tail end of the credits if you want the whole experience that this film has to offer.I give Captain America: The Winter Soldier a 10 out of 10!",10,5,10,4 April 2014
Life of Pi," A Boy, a Tiger, and God
","Within the first ten minutes, the titular protagonist of Life of Pi, Pi Patel, tells a writer that this story will make one believe in God. The story that Pi tells, is that of a shipwreck, which claims a teenaged Pi's family. Amidst the chaos, he found himself the sole human survivor, now floating across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Part survival story, part rumination about one person's faith and their attempts at understanding why God designed nature to do the things in which it does, Life of Pi is an emotion-filled journey that places the viewer within these events and has them pondering the same questions that the film's lead, newcomer Suraj Sharma, does.In a great many ways, Life of Pi requires an open mind from its viewers. It is not a film about one particular religion, as Pi is a combination Hindu, Catholic, and Muslim. He has always been fascinated by God, whether it be Christ, the many Hindu Gods, or Allah, Pi believes they're all the same. The film does not ask the viewer to believe this same idea as Pi, his beliefs simply serve as the impetus to understanding the gentle, soul-filled character that is Pi Patel, and understand how a 16-year-old boy could survive not just the elements and starvation, but also a man-eating tiger.The set up of the film is filled with life and energy, detailing the source of Pi's name, his fascination with religion, and his loss of innocence, before the ship wrecks and the real story begins -- Pi's journey to understand God. To his immense credit, young actor, Suraj Sharma, manages to hold the film together thanks to his revelatory performance. Sharma is the heart- and-soul of Life of Pi. He has a wide range of emotions that make him believable as a teen pondering such large questions, keeping the viewer engaged rather than allowing their attention span to wane. Which is good, seeing as how Life of Pi gets narratively murky around the midpoint, with some of the confrontations between Pi and nature running together by that point. Thankfully, the thematic ideas are what I feel that Ang Lee and company want the audience to take away from the film, and the emotions and ideas are so strong, it is very easy to overlook its narrative shortcomings.Visually, Life of Pi is a marvel. The animals in the life boat are entirely computer generated, and there are many moments where it is hard to find the glossy edges that CGI leaves behind. As well, director Ang Lee uses visual effects and the camera's depth of field to create a more immersive, dream-like feel. Almost every shot seems to have been digitally altered to make it seem more unreal, to make the water more reflective, to make the sky more beautiful, or to make dream and reality often collide. In particular, the way that the camera was always focused on Pi, with most of the other actors out of focus, it really draws one into Pi's state. However, I cannot figure out why Lee changed the aspect ratio in a few scenes. There is no evidence in the film itself to suggest why, leaving me confused. It's only for two scenes, and both are scenes meant to be emotional beats, and yet the film goes from widescreen to fullscreen to letterbox format. It jars the viewer and takes one out of the filmgoing experience.All in all, Life of Pi is not perfect, but it was a film I do not regret seeing. Thanks to a strong performance from Sharma, marvelous effects work, luscious visuals, and a thematic consistency that never falters in affecting the viewer, Life of Pi is a flawed, yet must see film that will be nominated come Oscar night.I give Life of Pi an 8 out of 10",8,4,8,30 November 2012
Tangled," A Blast from the Past, but Nothing all that New
","Tangled is another animated motion picture in a long line of Disney movies trying to recapture their past glories without really stepping out to reclaim the animation field. We all know the story of Rapunzel, how she's locked away in a tower and such, but Disney gives it their trademark fairy tale twist (and I almost thought that they'd run out of fairy tales). Rapunzel was long ago kidnapped from her King and Queen parents by a wicked woman who wanted to use Rapunzel's hair to stay young. Of course, this is a musical, with music from Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid), so it makes sense that whenever Rapunzel sings a certain song, her hair has the ability to heal or make one youthful once more, but if Rapunzel's hair is ever cut, she will lose that power forever. Thus her abductee of a mother locks Rapunzel up in a tower all her life till the paths of Rapunzel and the country's most notorious thief, Flynn Rider, cross and romance ensues as, with Flynn as her guide, Rapunzel finally leaves her tower. Tangled does feel Disney throughout, but it just feels as if we've seen this same Disney movie at least ten times by now, which I think goes against its goal. Tangled desired to be an update on the age old Disney princess-fairy tale formula, and I don't know if it worked entirely. The animators seemed to focus more so on action and adventure and more slapstick-like comedy than ever before, coating it in glossy CG-animation that just made me pine for the good ol' hand drawn days again. The music was not as memorable, nor as enjoyable as that of previous Menken/Disney collaborations; while the songs were solid, there was never that tune that you just couldn't get out of your head like 'A Whole New World' or 'Beauty and the Beast'. Regardless, Tangled still managed to be a movie that is entertaining and funny throughout, in a large part due to their fresh takes on the stock Disney characters of the Princess and Prince Charming.Rapunzel was a very different kind of Disney Princess than we're accustomed to seeing, less sure of herself and more of an innocent child who can't make up her mind between her dreams or her loyalty to her abductee of a mother. Her beau is Flynn, the kind of swashbuckling Prince Charming that the old Disney movies lacked, a thief with a soul and charisma behind those good looks. Unfortunately, the weakest character was the villainess of Rapunzel's adoptive mother, whose character never seems to fully commit to her villainy, starting out as merely a person possessed by greed and not fully transitioning into a force of evil. I feel much more could have been done with her character in playing with the idea that she only pretends to like Rapunzel and doesn't actually love her, which was hinted at a lot through the character's facial expressions. I will say, the silent animal characters of Maximus the Horse and Pascal the Chameleon make up for any shortcomings with laughs, these two characters having benefited the most from this more slapstick-Emperor's New Groove-style approach.So what can I say, Tangled maybe tries too hard to be a blast from the past and it never really comes into its own. There are many great ideas played around with here, and this really is the most entertained I have been by a Disney animation since Tarzan, but Disney tries to hold onto the past too much here and doesn't let the past go to try and usher in a new era of Disney animation. So what if Tangled feel so familiar that I can pretty much predict what will happen? There is a reason the Disney formula from the '80s and '90s worked, and there's a reason it worked way back in the '20s with Snow White. It's heartwarming, and the big duet between Rapunzel and Flynn on the lake surrounded by glowing lanterns is Disney magic, no matter how you feel about the rest of the movie's execution.I give Tangled a 7 out of 10!",7,1,6,26 November 2010
Doctor Strange," Another Success for Marvel
","Marvel continues its hit streak with Doctor Strange, the most peculiar movie to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Guardians of the Galaxy. As far as superheroes go, Doctor Strange is easily one of the more obscure. While many die-hard comic book fans know who Doctor Strange is, the average person doesn't and that was clearly going to be the biggest hurdle for this movie to overcome. As a fanboy who never really read much Doctor Strange, I went into this movie without any preconceived notions of what to expect and was more than satisfied. I believe others who know nothing about Doctor Strange will be as well.The titular Doctor Strange is a world famous neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange. He is arrogant and exceptionally good at what he does, however when he injures his hands in a car wreck, he can no longer do his job. Strange starts searching the world for a cure, eventually meeting the Ancient One, a sorcerer who trains him in the mystic arts. Throughout the course of Strange's training, he discovers a new purpose for his life and realizes that there are larger things at play in the universe than just himself, placing him upon a path to safeguard Earth from supernatural threats.The greatest thing about Doctor Strange is how mindblowingly original it is. The action in this movie is not merely two super powered dudes slugging it out, it's not even two wizards casting spells at one another, this is sorcerers warping the realities of time and space with magic. Streets fold in on themselves, portals to other dimensions are opened, and time is manipulated routinely throughout the movie. Then there is arguably the coolest fight sequence of the year when Doctor Strange's astral form does ghost battle with a bad guy's astral form.Director Scott Derrickson and his screen writing partners, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, deserve huge kudos for being able to think outside the box. Doctor Strange goes beyond most of the action movie norms to craft action that occasionally has shades of other movies, but cranks it all up to eleven. Of course the biggest kudos should go to Marvel Studios' president and Doctor Strange producer, Kevin Feige. Doctor Strange has long been a passion project for Feige. He saw something in the comic book adventures that many others throughout the years didn't and his determination pays off for the audience.When you really get right down to it, Doctor Strange is another base hit for Marvel Studios, if not completely a home run due to the usual trappings of superhero origin stories and being part of an interconnected universe of movies. If Sherlock didn't already make Benedict Cumberbatch a mega star, his work as Doctor Strange will. In a great many ways, Cumberbatch almost brings more cheek than Tony Stark, with a little more likability to boot. Then there is Rachel McAdams who is likable as the obligatory love interest, Dr. Christine Palmer. While McAdams essentially plays a role we've seen her do many times over in other movies, she helps further ground Strange's humanity. Rounding out the cast are the likes of Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Baron Mordo, Benedict Wong as Wong, and Madds Mikkelsen as the bad guy, Kaecilius. All play their parts well and further ground the absurdity through their acting. All in all, Doctor Strange is a fun time at the movies. The movie takes itself seriously enough to make it seem like the stakes matter, and yet it has the good, winking sense of humor of the first two Iron Man movies or Ant-Man to keep the movie feeling light.I give Doctor Strange a 9 out of 10!",9,1,3,8 November 2016
Interstellar," Movie Review: 'Interstellar'
","Director Christopher Nolan's new film, Interstellar, examines the macro-size of the universe by observing the micro. Having more in common with works like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Tree of Life than the works of Steven Spielberg, or even Nolan's previous films, Interstellar is a film that takes you on an interdimensional journey across the stars.Matthew McConaughey portrays Cooper, an ex-pilot/engineer, who is now reduced to being a farmer on a not too distant future Earth, that is slowly dying. Basically think of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression times ten and you get the idea of Earth at the start of Interstellar. However, while the film is about the dire straits Earth is in at the start of this movie, we never see the global impact of this almost apocalypse. Told entirely from the point-of-view of Cooper and his family, in particular his relationship between his 10-year-old daughter Murph (played exceptionally by Mackenzie Foy), the film relays the larger story of what's happening on Earth through the microscopic lens observing this one family struggling to survive. When Cooper is eventually recruited by NASA to pilot a last ditch effort to find a new habitable planet out in space by traveling through a wormhole by Saturn, Interstellar maintains its macro through micro approach by keeping the story firmly engrained within Cooper and his relationships, and that is where the bulk of this movie transpires, in deep space with five astronauts and two robots.Interstellar plays a lot with the theory of relativity, so it should be no surprise that there is a little bit of time manipulation that goes on in this story with Murph aging on Earth, while Cooper stays the same age. This is probably the most unique aspect of the movie, and it lends itself to some of the more emotional moments of the film when Cooper gets video messages from his adult children who are filled with a lot of resentment at his having left them to more than likely never return. It is these emotional aspects of the film that keep Interstellar from feeling too much like a physics class and being human. As a matter of fact, while this film deals heavily with exploring the cosmos, it's pretty clear that the film is more about exploring ourselves than it is in what lies all around us.The two human concepts of love and truth are probably the most prevalent themes in a film that has a great many themes that it is juggling at all times. Even when you get lost in all of the science mumbo jumbo, that often goes beyond simple theorizing to just pure science fiction itself, it is these themes that keep you watching, even if it feels a little like a chore. The biggest thing with Interstellar is just that it's so darn serious. There is very little levity, and not a whole lot of fun going on, which makes it more of a $200 million art film than a blockbuster. I don't know what the box office prospects for this film will be, but I can say that most average moviegoers should probably just skip this one, because this is a long movie that favors talking over action (though the few action scenes we do get are some of Nolan's more thrilling). If you are a moviegoer that loves films like 2001, or the work of Terrence Malick, where you have to think about what's transpiring on screen, then you will more than likely love Interstellar. I am in a camp somewhere in the middle. As a fellow filmmaker, I can appreciate everything here that Christopher Nolan has done with Interstellar, but I really have no desire to see this one again, because it just doesn't do for me what I tend to want out of the movies I see, which is allow me to escape from my reality and have fun for a few hours. This is a movie that is constantly reminding us of our reality, and you couple that with the beautiful, but overbearing organ music from Hans Zimmer, and you can very easily get antsy and nervous before all is said and done, and not in a good way, but in an oppressive one. So it's safe to say this is not my favorite Christopher Nolan film, in all actuality it's probably my least favorite of his films, but with that said, this very well may be his most ambitious and thought-provoking film he's ever done. As far as my recommendation goes, go see Interstellar if you love your sci-fi as realistic and thoughtful as possible.",5,1,3,7 November 2014
Pacific Rim," A Spoiler-Free Review of 'Pacific Rim'
","As a kid growing up, a lot of the times during the Summer I would get bored with no one else around to hang out with. I mean, what else does a film obsessed kid do when he's bored in the Summer? Well, he makes a movie of course. However, what type of movies? There were no other kids around in my neighborhood to use as actors, so I made monster movies. Some of the times these movies starred our cat, but seeing as how living creatures were more difficult to work with, most of my monster movies starred a marionette creature or stuffed animals, with action figures playing the human roles. There were no scripts, just my imagination literally making everything up as I went along with our Hi-8 video camera in tow. All of this to say, I've always loved monster movies, and Pacific Rim may just be one of the best, if not the most original monster movies ever made.What makes Pacific Rim so original is that it mashes up two Japanese film genres, those of the giant monster and the giant robot, and creates a movie that is unlike anything that Western audiences have ever seen before. Pitting giant robots versus giant monsters was a genius idea that I wish I had come up with, and screenwriter Travis Beacham deserves huge kudos for coming up with the idea. The thing is though, this film wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't manage to have more going for it than just giant robots and giant monsters. Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro go beyond that simple idea and actually have created likable characters and an involving story to go along with the awesome spectacle, and that's why Pacific Rim should be considered one of the best monster movies ever made.If you've ever seen any Godzilla movie or episode of Japanese animation (i.e. anime) featuring giant robots, then you will recognize all of the character types that exist in this movie. Pacific Rim is really like anime brought to life in live action, and if this movie can achieve such believable results, then can a live action Mobile Suit Gundam movie be far behind? One can only hope, but for right now, as a fan of anime and Japanese entertainment, Pacific Rim manages to introduce American audiences to all of the Japanese film and anime tropes that many of the kids in my generation have been in love with for our entire lives. However, I don't want anyone reading this who has never seen any anime or previous monster movies to think that this movie is not for them.Pacific Rim is really a movie for anyone who just loves a good time at the movies. It's fun, action packed, and is emotionally involving. Unlike so many Summer blockbusters that take themselves too seriously, Pacific Rim manages to balance the humor with the seriousness to create a lighthearted adventure film that still carries weight and consequence through the character's actions, but you're having a blast while the world is literally on the brink of destruction. Guillermo Del Toro treats this film as if it's like a propaganda film from the WWII days, where he's idolizing the pilots of these giant robots, trying to inspire humanity with hope and optimism to actually rise up and meet the monsters rather than getting crushed under their feet. Of course, I'll reiterate this point, had the characters not have worked, neither would have this movie. The characters and their relationships with one another are what gives this movie dramatic heft when it most matters, to where when we reach the action, it's not just mayhem for the sake of mayhem, it actually means something.In case you haven't noticed, I loved Pacific Rim. Few movies are this imaginative and this much fun, and that's the main thing to take away from this movie. From a design standpoint, this is one of the more meticulously crafted made up worlds I've seen in recent years, and that is a testament to Del Toro's gifted cinematic eye. The action is stand up and cheer awesome, thanks to amazing FX work from Industrial Light and Magic. As for the characters, none of them would work if the actors playing them weren't so likable, from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Charlie Day, to the emotionally vulnerable performance from Rinko Kikuchi, they're the ones that actually make us care about the story. Bottom line, this isn't another Summer blockbuster trying to play off of post-9/11 fears and anxieties, it's literally a movie about the goodness of humanity and the power of the human spirit to work together when it's most needed, and who doesn't want to see that?I give Pacific Rim a 9 out of 10!",9,17,32,12 July 2013
Empire of the Sun," A Superb Artisitc Achievement for Spielberg!
","Empire of the Sun is a marvelous film about a young boy making the transition from child to young adult against the backdrop of the Second World War. The film is the story of Jim Graham (Christian Bale) and how he basically became a young man. The story begins in the British controlled Shanghai shortly before the Japanese invasion in 1941. Here we see that Jim is the son of a rich British business man and that Jim is essentially your typical spoiled rich kid who doesn't really care that much for anyone else. Jim is fascinated with planes, each day Japanese fighter planes fly above the city, and while everyone else is scared to death Jim is in awe at what he thinks is a beautiful sight. Soon though the Japanese invade thus shaking up Jim's life forever. In the midst of one of the many emotional scenes in the film Jim is separated by a crowd from his parents and becomes lost without anyone to help him find his way. The rest of the film is about Jim on a journey to survive in this dangerous Japanese territory while trying to find his parents.All in all this is another amazing film from the great Steven Spielberg, definitely one of his best artistic films he has done (except maybe for Schindler's List). The film-making is simply beautiful and breathtaking, and so is the amazing score by John Williams who expertly blended choral music with a huge Hollywood orchestra to create something that is truly unique. One of the greatest things about this film is the amazing acting. The film has a superb cast including John Malkovich as a friend to Jim who later double crosses him, and Miranda Richardson who acts as a sort of mother figure to Jim, but the true stunner in the cast is Christian Bale. This was Bale's first film, but you can't even tell, he delivers one of the greatest performances, if not the greatest performance in the film. Bale is able to show both vulnerability and strength in this role and perfectly carries the film upon his back.Overall I am surprised this film didn't sweep the Oscars the year it came out, it's just superb. As I've mentioned it is a truly beautiful film including some truly breathtaking scenes, such as my favorite when Jim sees what he thinks is a heavenly light, but is really the Atom Bomb dropped on Hiroshima. If you haven't seen this yet you need to right away.A perfect 10/10!!!!!!!!!!",10,3,7,13 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The weakest film in the saga!
","Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the second film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and is the fifth film in the overall Star Wars saga. To start Episode 2 is in my opinion the weakest out of all 6 of the Star Wars films, and the reasons for this thought are many. Although it's a well made film it just mainly lacks the energy and excitement of the other films in the saga, and most notably the original trilogy. Part of the reasons for this is the weak acting by almost every member of the cast(minus Ewan McGreggor), and the occasional flat dialogue. Still minus all of this, there is still lots to enjoy about this one. The special effects are all top notch and the action is good, and the new planets and environments are very imaginative. If only a few bugs were worked out in the screen writing process, and a little better acting from the performers, this one could of been on the level of the originals, but it falls short. The action is there, but it just lacks energy.Rating: A 7 out of 10!",7,0,1,13 October 2007
Ant-Man," Superbly Entertaining
","It almost seems like people are just waiting for Marvel Studios to stumble at this point. Well, those people will have to wait even longer cause Marvel has done it yet again with Ant-Man. Ant-Man is perhaps Marvel's most unique movie to date featuring a superhero who can become the size of an insect at will and use his special helmet to control ants with his thoughts, not to mention the fact that our hero, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), is an ex-con trying to go on the straight and narrow. We first meet Scott as he is being released from prison for basically playing Robin Hood with a major corporation. Now vowing to go straight so that he can reconnect with his daughter, Cassie, Scott finds it harder than he initially thought to get a job thanks to his past, ultimately resorting to thievery yet again. Scott and his hilarious pals (led by a scene stealing Michael Pena) break into Dr. Hank Pym's house and crack open his safe to find what appears to be a weird motorcycle suit. Later, when Scott puts the suit on and shrinks, he realizes that this is no ordinary suit and that the man they stole from, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), is no ordinary man. One thing leads to another and Hank recruits Scott to help him and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), save the world by stealing a dangerous piece of technology that Hank's former protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has developed, and thus, Ant-Man is born.I really don't think there has ever been another superhero movie where the hero started out as someone who would ordinarily be the bad guy and by the end has become the ultimate good guy. That must have been a tough feat to pull off for the writers and director Peyton Reed, and yet they did it, they made Scott Lang such a likable guy that you are rooting for him the entire time (of course it doesn't hurt that the crimes he committed were ones of an altruistic/Robin Hood nature). However, the real x-factor in regards to Scott Lang is Paul Rudd. Rudd infuses his natural everyman vibe with his charm and goofiness, making Lang a character we care for in regards to achieving his goal of overcoming his past to be closer to his daughter. In a nutshell, that idea of either overcoming or succumbing to your past is the thematic spine of the whole movie.Scott wants to actually earn the look in his daughter's eyes by being a better man than he was in the past, while Hank Pym is trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter and come to terms with what happened with his wife's death, and Hope and Darren are both trying to wrestle with their complicated feelings toward Hank's treatment of them growing up. Ultimately, with Scott, Hank, and Hope, being the good guys, and Darren being the bad guy, you know who overcomes their past and who doesn't, but the fact that a superhero movie features such ideas as redemption and atonement as well as the dangers of hate, is a great added bonus. When it's all said and done though, the main reason I absolutely love Ant-Man is because it's just so much fun.This movie is chock full of jokes and even in the dramatic moments there is humor to keep things from ever getting too stuffy. Few movies nowadays are brave enough to just be silly and have a good time, and that's what Ant-Man does. You can tell the filmmakers know that this whole concept is absurd and they don't care. The characters take their situations seriously and believe in what they're doing, but they also make jokes at almost every turn because that's just who these characters are and that is, in my opinion, the mark of every Marvel Studios movie thus far and why I like what they're doing more than DC. So if you just wanna have fun at the movies, go see Ant-Man, cause I can guarantee you wont regret it.P.S., the musical score by Christophe Beck is sick!!!I give Ant-Man a 9 out of 10!",9,2,9,19 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Sometimes you've gotta love America!
","As just a kid from Brooklyn, Captain America makes a name for himself in this extremely entertaining and engaging superhero flick. Like Superman, Captain America is Marvel Comics answer to the Red, White, and Blue, and while this movie could have been a simple set up to Marvel's The Avengers, it manages to be its own movie. Part of this is because it takes place first in the timeline of all of the Marvel Studios' movies, so there are fewer references to the other heroes who come later down the line, but this movie also focuses on showing the transformation of Steve Rogers, from scrawny kid getting beat up in the alleys of Brooklyn, to the symbol of hope for America in World War II.The movie is almost entirely set in the 1940s, featuring the Greatest Generation in all of its glory, with this movie somewhat playing as a love letter to that simpler time where evil was evil, and good was good. When a small fry guy named Steve Rogers gets rejected five different times to be enlisted in the Army, he gets a lucky shot from a military scientist, Dr. Erskine, who tests an experimental super soldier formula on Rogers, and voila! We now have a superhero. But it takes more than muscles to be a true hero, and even though Rogers managed to impress Erskine with his compassion, fortitude, and morals, he must do the same for the big guns at the military if he wants to see actual action aside from being a part of song and dance numbers and movie serials to sell war bonds.Director Joe Johnston plays around with the 1940s setting, with the whole movie filmed in sepia tones evoking the look of the pop culture from the period. The story plays like one long Saturday matinée serial, filled with tons of pulp and improbable science fiction, but those were stalwarts of the adventure stories of the time. What Johnston does best though, is mastering Rogers' journey from zero to hero. As Captain America, Steve Rogers uses his compassion, fortitude, and morals, to do near impossible missions, as is seen in a scene where Rogers saves over 400 prisoners of war all on his own, proving to the Army that he should be on the front line of the war effort and not helping with morale back home. Throughout the whole movie, Rogers bonds with an American agent named Peggy Carter, winning her heart through the same inner heroism that made him Captain America. Carter is a pin up girl in looks, but a girl who can show up the boys in attitude. Add on to this all, a great maniacal villain in Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving in some of the greatest make up work in a while), and you have a solid adventure yarn.While the final scene left me scratching my head a bit, feeling tacked on, and the scene before giving the real closure to the story, I think Marvel was trying to pump up The Avengers even more, so I get it, though it still deterred from an otherwise emotional ending. Even with this small bump in the road, it's really the only blemish in this extremely well made and polished superhero flick that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but neither breaks it. Solid, entertaining, and heroic, everything a good superhero movie should be, which is exactly what this movie is.I give Captain America: The First Avenger a 9 out of 10!",9,9,24,22 July 2011
American Hustle," Not Perfect, But Well Made
","Director David O. Russell's new film, American Hustle, may not be Russell's best film, but he has clearly hit a stride in his career. American Hustle tells the inspired by a true story of a group of con artists in the late Seventies, coerced by the FBI to help them bring down crooked politicians. Like most films like these, the plot is labyrinthine, often hard to keep up with, and thusly has a few plot holes for such reasons. Here's the thing, American Hustle is a well made, well acted film with some of Russell's trademark quirkiness creating laughs here and there, but the characters never become likable. These characters are all fairly deplorable and I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who'd honestly enjoy spending time with these people. With that said, Russell is at the top of his game in his shot design, further expanding upon the visual ideas of The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook with this outing, then there are the performances. While Amy Adams' constant slipping in-and-out of her faux British accent kind of grinded on me after a while, Christian Bale with his beer gut and combover is phenomenal, and Jeremy Renner shines in each scene he is in as a New Jersey Mayor. As a fan of filmmaking and good acting, I enjoyed American Hustle, but this is not a film that I will find myself revisiting due to the lack of emotional connection with anyone in this film. Plus, if you're going to make a film about con artists, as the filmmakers you have to be able to con the audience and deceive us with every twist and turn, and unfortunately this film did not, with most major surprises seen on the horizon at least two or three scenes before revealed. If you really want to see a con artist film that literally cons the audience, watch The Sting.I give American Hustle an 8 out of 10!",8,1,9,21 December 2013
Rush," A Fantastic Movie that so Happens to be About Racing
","You know, I have never really cared that much for car racing in real life, and yet that does not keep me from finding Rush one of the most complete and satisfying films of 2013.The thing about Rush is that it's not really a racing movie. While the film does follow the world of Formula-One racing, it is not what the movie is about. Where Rush really accelerates and manages to resonate, is in portraying the complicated love-hate rivalry between racecar drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the early 1970s.This is a true story that is so fantastic that it almost seems as if it was fabricated, but the film never feels fake or Hollywoodified. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan go to great lengths to not make it the good guy vs. bad guy scenario. They present both the flaws and the things that made Hunt and Lauda great men of the sport. Hunt's a charming, easy to like playboy who is self-destructive, and Lauda is so calculating and abrasive he rarely shows emotion or vulnerability, and yet you've gotta love a man who is not afraid to say what he thinks. Featuring some of the most exciting cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle since he won the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, and some genuinely whip smart editing, you really get the feeling of being in this world, on the track with these titans of racing. What manages to evoke this feeling is Howard's documentary like approach to the material.Ron Howard really is a chameleon of a director. He never makes the same movie twice, and there really is no other film in his filmography quite like this one. He sheds many of the genre conventions that you find in his other works for a stripped down, realistic approach. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall watching the ultimate racing doc that's all rock-and-roll. Then there's the rocking Seventies setting that's equal parts nostalgic and cool, by and large thanks to the surprisingly nuanced and of-the-times musical score from Hans Zimmer. However, there is also a heart to this movie that is both a testament to Howard's ability to shape smart characters and the performances of his actors. These two things combine to make these character's oddly likable, even when they aren't always the nicest of people.Overall, Rush is simply put, a phenomenal experience at the theater. It's a movie that can be fun, emotional, and thoughtful all in one. It paints the picture as to why we need rivalries in life. There has to be something pushing us to greatness, and very often a healthy rivalry is the only way to get there. Even if a Formula-One movie isn't your cup of tea, I implore you to at least give the film a chance as a character piece. Stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl compliment one another in their performances very much the same way that Hunt and Lauda did on the racetrack, and sometimes you don't need flowery words to express how much a performance, or in this case, two performances work. Rush is definitely a movie I will be revisiting in the future and is one that I will more than likely include, very proudly I might add, on my year end best list.I give Rush a 10 out of 10!",10,3,4,29 September 2013
Oblivion," Seen It Before, but Beautifully Shot and Well Acted
","Tron: Legacy director, Joseph Kosinski's latest, is a sci-fi flick based on his own graphic novel, starring Tom Cruise, called Oblivion.After Earth was attacked by aliens, humanity had no choice but to use nukes, in so doing they won the war but made Earth uninhabitable. Cut forward to 60 years later, where we meet Tom Cruise's Jack Harper, a drone repairman living on Earth in a glass tower high up in the sky. His job is to repair the drones that protect the machines harvesting Earth's remaining water for the humans that moved to Saturn's moon, Titan. However, when a mysterious spacecraft crashlands on Earth, Jack finds human survivors in the wreckage, spurring everything to change.Harking back to 1970's science fiction films like Logan's Run or THX 1138, nothing in Oblivion is ever what it seems. There are so many twist and turns to this movie, it would be very easy to get lost, if you didn't see every one of them coming. Almost every twist has been done before in other sci-fi films, with far more realistic thinking as to what the repercussions of such discoveries truly would have on a person. Of course a big part to this is that the script just doesn't give enough information. They often gloss over things in one line that needed to be explained to be understood fully, and that might have made a few more of the character's actions make sense. Even with all of this said, there is a lot of good about Oblivion.The cinematography by Claudio Miranda is just hauntingly beautiful. Miranda and Kosinski's use of the Icelandic landscapes standing in for ruined America, were expertly used to create a scope that has been sorely lacking from almost every other sci-fi film over the past few decades. Not to mention the design work of this film, which is architecturally stunning, just like Kosinski's Tron: Legacy was. As well, even though the plot twists often murk up the story, the characters are always so likable and intriguing, you keep going along with them, and a large part of that is due to the good performances of its cast. Tom Cruise is easy to root for in this movie, but the write home performance is Andrea Riseborough, who plays Jack's partner up in the sky tower, Victoria. Riseborough makes simple three word lines of dialogue have far more weight than the script gave them because one can tell that she is always applying subtext through the tone of her voice and her facial mannerisms. Riseborough truly deserves more international notice of her talents.Ultimately, while you've seen everything in Oblivion before, and done with more satisfying results, Oblivion is still a good, enjoyable sci-fi film worth seeing on the big screen thanks to great performances from its cast that make the most of their characters and the gigantic canvas that the film is set against.I give Oblivion a 7 out of 10!",7,3,5,20 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Probably the funniest comedy of '08!
","Burn After Reading is the Coen Brothers returning to what they do best, comedy. After the superb No Country for Old Men, the two brothers decided that for their next project they'd do a wacky and fun screwball comedy, and it paid off very well. The film is very funny and entertaining; like previous Coen Brother's comedies it is filled with dark humor and quirky, yet likable characters. If you asked what the film was about, I'd have to say nothing really; it's really just a movie about a bunch of idiots who are somehow connected in a plot that turns out to mean absolutely nothing, but that's what makes it all the more hilarious.The Coen Brothers did a superb job directing, and their screenplay was as tight as always. Of course it is the acting from this stellar A-List cast that makes the film such a joy to watch, in particular the performances by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand steal the show in practically each scene that they're in. Overall if you're a fan of previous Coen Brother's comedies you'll love this film, and even if you have never seen a Coen Brother's comedy, but like dark humor, you'll love this film. It is easily the best comedy of the year.A perfect 10 out of 10!",10,18,37,12 September 2008
Watchmen," Watchmen finally makes it to the big screen, but was it what the fans were hoping for?
","By now pretty much everyone knows the story of Watchmen and also the story behind the making of this film, so I feel no need to retread old ground, what is most important here is whether or not the film was a good film. Sad to say that while Watchmen started out with a ton of promise, towards the middle half of the film it begins to fizzle out and become a film full of some simply put obscure artistic choices.Watchmen, which was directed by Zack Snyder, is first and foremost a well made film, there is no denying that, but where the film finds its problems is in the odd artistic choices made. The film began with an uber serious tone in which I was digging, but towards the middle of the film it began to become almost an obscure comedy that just made no sense with the tone in which they had established so early on in the film. For this reason alone, Watchmen never seemed to recover for me. Even still with this nitpick I found a lot to enjoy with the film. It was as I said well done as a whole, where at certain spots the cinematography and production design stole the show. As well the heavy thematic material of the graphic novel is still as relevant in its film counterpart as it was on the page. So what's the final verdict?Watchmen overall is an entertaining film that is worth seeing, but was short of true superhero film greatness due to some just obscure artistic choices.I give Watchmen a slightly disappointing 7 out of 10!",7,1,3,7 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Beginning of one of the Finest Film Trilogies of All-Time!
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is easily one of the most ambitious films ever made. The sheer scope of the film is enough to warrant a viewing from any moviegoer. Never before has the combination of CGI and live action footage been as superfluous as it was in this movie (this goes for all of the other films in the trilogy as well). Though what makes this film distinguished from the other two Lord of the Rings films is that this is the setup for all that is to come, so there is a certain level of mystery and intrigue to each action set piece. I think it is that intrigue that sets this one apart from the rest of the trilogy. When you view Two Towers and Return of the King, they are very similar in tone and style, but this one had a more different approach than those two, and this is also by and large because this one focuses more so on nine characters than entire nations as a whole. Another key difference between this one and the other two is that the action taking place in this film is more like a Golden Age adventure film in style, where as the action in the other two is modeled to be like epic war sagas.This film was masterfully directed by Peter Jackson, and the film is superbly acted by its wonderful cast, in particular Ian McKellen as Gandalf. After seeing this film it is easy to see why so many people are in love with these books. The world is so richly detailed that one simply gets lost in the overall scope and scale of its story.I give The Fellowship of the Ring a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,14 March 2009
Man of Steel," Not the Superman movie I was hoping for...
","Warner Bros. attempts to reboot the Superman franchise with director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, a reimagining of the Superman origin story we all know and love stripped of everything that makes Superman, well, Superman. We all know the story of of the film, there is no need to rehash that here. The bottom line of Man of Steel is simple, it's just not a good Superman movie.The thing with Man of Steel is that it's a movie that has a lot of intriguing ideas and an exceptional cast, but it's missing a fantastic script. Where screenwriter David Goyer struck it rich with Batman Begins, he fails to find with Superman. The plot is murky, often not expanding or fully exploring the ideas presented, and the characters are never given much to do. The story is simply like a Greatest Hits album of Superman's early years, jumping from action scene to action scene, with few scenes that step back and attempt to create character. The end result is a story that left me emotionally cold and often confused, because I did not fully understand what was going on and I just did not love any of the characters because I was never given a reason to love them. Then, there's the fact that Superman actually kills the bad guy at the end of the movie! You can defend that any way you want, but the Superman I've always known and loved would use his intellect to find another way to save the day.Ultimately, as a die-hard Superman fan, I was greatly disappointed. The casting was pitch perfect, in particular Henry Cavill as Superman, as well, the design work was stellar, but the filmmakers just seemed to have ignored all that has always made Superman who he is. Now, to clarify, I am biased here. To an average moviegoer, this may be a fantastic movie, but for me this movie just did not scratch that itch, so take that into account if you plan on seeing this movie.I give Man of Steel a 5 out of 10!",5,1,4,15 June 2013
Bridge of Spies," A Fantastic History Lesson
","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have teamed up for the fourth time in their illustrious careers to make their latest film, Bridge of Spies. Few filmmakers could literally direct in their sleep, and Spielberg probably could do that, the same with Tom Hanks in regards to acting, thankfully both of them give it their all here and make Bridge of Spies a very polished film that, while is neither of their best work, is still well worth your time.Bridge of Spies tells the story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), a Brooklyn-based insurance lawyer in the late-1950s who took on the case of accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (a likable Mark Rylance). Donovan was seen as a pariah for doing his best to defend Abel to the letter of the law, but he was then recognized as a hero when U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), was shot down over Soviet Russia, and Donovan was tasked by the CIA to travel to East Berlin to negotiate a swap - Abel for Powers.Spielberg works from a script that was written by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, and the Coen influence is very evident throughout the script. There are scenes of high tension one second (all exquisitely milked by Spielberg), and then moments that disarm the tension with humor the very next (a place where Tom Hanks excels at), which is very reminiscent of Coen films like Blood Simple or No Country for Old Men. This five-way collaboration between Spielberg, Hanks, Charman, and the Coens, finds each of these exceptional filmmakers all pooling their collective talents together to make a film that plays to all of their strengths, and that is the main reason that Bridge of Spies is a cut above most films in current release. The fact that the movie may have too high expectations upon it, purely because of the prior resumes of all involved, does not detract from the fact that this is still a remarkable film that captures a moment in history where too few films have gone.The history of film is full of movies about World War II, but when it comes to the Cold War, it's been an area that has been vastly unexplored by Hollywood. This film accurately recreates the period when Cold War paranoia was at its height in the States, making this a fantastic history lesson as well as fantastic entertainment. The production is designed with exquisite detail, with Berlin in particular looking as if it leapt off the pages of history books, and it really reinforces how bad things really were during that period. In just the background characters alone, Spielberg could have probably made three or four other movies, all of which would be equally as fascinating, that is how insane this moment in history was, and it's why it should never be forgotten. On the technical side of things, Bridge of Spies is another Spielberg, Janusz Kaminski collaboration with stunning cinematography. The film uses muted colors, with lots of grays, blacks, and navy blues on display in the sets and costumes, while the cinematographer, Kaminski, utilizes a lot of wide angle lenses to mimic the looks of many Hollywood films from the Fifties. This film simply looks as slick and stylish as anything that Spielberg has ever made, and yet it very affectionately feels like a throwback to the movies of the era in which is this film is set. The feel of movies like Judgment at Nuremberg is very evident in many moments. Of course, while the movie is a technical marvel and a well recreated history lesson, what makes Bridge of Spies stick with you after seeing it is the character of Donovan himself.James B. Donovan was a very fascinating man. He defended Abel because he believed that if we just sentenced him to death for being a spy without any due process, how does that make us any different from our enemy? If we see ourselves as Americans as being the better men, then should we not show the world that we are? This kind of straight arrow character is a rarity in film nowadays, with Hanks really mirroring the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Gregory Peck in his performance, it's just that kind of role and he does it perfectly. Then there is Rylance as Abel, who plays him in a very quiet, controlled manner that really paints Abel in a poetic light. He was simply a patriot, who believed in his country and on top of that, was just an unassuming, nice man who actually befriends Donovan in an interesting way. It really goes to show that the bogeyman is not always the monster we make him out to be, and I think that was one of the main ideas Spielberg was wanting show with this film, and I believe he does so brilliantly.I give Bridge of Spies a 9 out of 10!",9,3,7,19 October 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," This one is for the fans!
","In some ways it is always tough as a filmmaker to watch the Harry Potter movies when they first come out. As a writer/director and avid fan of the books, I already have preconceived notions in regards as to how I would film certain scenes, as to how I would write certain scenes, and as to what I would cut or accentuate to make the story a cinematic reality. I didn't get to direct this movie (which that would have been a dream come true), but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a cinematically satisfying experience on its own terms.The filmmakers completely dispensed with the pleasantries here. Much how they tackled the Half-Blood Prince, they do nothing to clue the viewer into this world or reintroduce you to these characters or even the storyline that was set up at the end of the previous movie. Deathly Hallows-Part 1 picks up right where Half-Blood Prince ended, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, going off on their own, in search of the seven Horcruxes, which hold pieces of Voldemort's soul; if these Horcruxes are destroyed, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can finally be killed, but what are the mysterious Deathly Hallows that our trio stumble across on their journey?If you aren't a fan of Harry Potter by now, this movie is not the kind of stand alone adventure that will make you one. As mentioned, none of the characters, nor even the magical objects such as the Marauder's Map or the Locket are reintroduced to the viewer, even certain things such as as the broken mirror shard that Harry carries around with him (which was only in the book and not in the previous movies) is never explained to the audience. The filmmakers knew that the best way to free themselves to tell this story was to assume that the audience seeing these movies have already seen all six previous films and have read all seven of the books. While this may be a detriment to those who have't read the books or to your casual moviegoer, as a fan it was increasingly liberating. A.) You do not feel like you were being retaught things that you already know, and B.) It allowed the story to consistently be moving forward and not have to retread facts of the past to make this an easier movie for those unfamiliar with this story to understand.Screenwriter Steve Kloves and director David Yates proved to be an effective duo again, being able to fill so many tiny details into this movie for the Harry Potter faithful, ultimately allowing the richness of the books to transcend into the realms of the movies. In particular, Yates has surprised me once more. He has grown so much as a filmmaker since Order of the Phoenix, and Deathly Hallows-Part 1 looks as if it was directed by a consummate professional at the top of his craft. Yates was able to convey so much texture with so little. Very often dialogue was never used to explain certain feelings or emotions to the audience and it was up to Yates to manipulate your feelings through the shots, and this is where he was most splendid; such as when Ron becomes jealous of Harry and Hermione's friendship, or when Harry sees the story about Dumbledore in the newspaper. And the trio of the actor's give probably their most affecting performances yet, in particular Emma Watson who has way more emotional scenes to chew on than either Daniel Radcliffe or Rupert Grint. This movie is put entirely on the trio's shoulders (with the colorful cast of supporting characters only in to throw in their token lines of dialogue) and I was thoroughly impressed with their talent and ability.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a standard adventure movie taken on the road, away from Hogwarts. In some ways it reminded me of The Fellowship of the Ring and the perils that those characters met on the road throughout that movie; much like that movie this is only the set- up to the story in which we all want to see (a.k.a. Part 2). Ultimately, this is one of the most beautifully photographed Harry Potter movies, thanks to Eduardo Serra's DP work, and David Yates directs some of the action sequences with so much pizazz, in particular the scenes in the Ministry and when Harry and Hagrid fly through the air on a motorcycle chased by Death Eaters. So what if non-fans of Harry Potter wont understand this movie? If you haven't read these books or seen the other movies by now, then to be completely candid, why are you seeing this movie anyways?I give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 a 10 out of 10!",10,0,4,19 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," There is no way a Goose is that Panda's Dad!
","Who am I? Kung Fu Panda 2 is about a panda with an identity crisis. Po, our hero (voiced by Jack Black), has mastered the art of kung fu, but when his father (a goose) reveals he isn't really Po's father (I know, shocker, right?), Po begins to wonder who he truly is. All the while Po has dreams of what he believes to be his real parents, and a peacock who haunts the darkness in the midst of flames.Kung Fu Panda 2 is a character piece, that has some astonishing action set pieces, both highly creative and well choreographed with the camera, a rarity in this day and age of confusing whiz-bang action. The villainous peacock, Shen (voiced malevolently by Gary Oldman), has deep ties to Po's past, making him a villain that seems more menacing than your average, 'I wanna take over the world,' bad guy, even though he wants to do that too. No other character is ever given anytime to develop or grow further than what their archetype allows, which kind of echoes the overall sentiment. There is an attempt at depth to the story, but it is rushed at almost each attempt to reach the next cool action set piece. While the story and humor always works, the emotion is not always there. Perhaps if more time had been taken and certain things fleshed out, this would be more than an enjoyable kid's movie and be something more, regardless, the action and humor of Kung Fu Panda 2 charms the child inside.I give Kung Fu Panda 2 a 7 out of 10!",7,1,1,11 June 2011
Hugo," What Happened?
","The art of adaptation is tricky. Often filmmakers manage to find nuances from the book and expand upon those nuances to make a movie that is as deep and affecting as the book, unfortunately Hugo is not one such movie.This adaptation of Brian Selznick's enchanting novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret lacks the taut structure and emotional heft of its source material, resulting in a cinematic experience far from enchanting. Director Martin Scorsese did put together a nice ensemble of craftsmen to create some breathtaking sets, costumes, and cinematography, but the thrill of the expertly crafted crafts only lasts for maybe ten minutes, then one would think the story should draw the viewer in, but it never does.Hugo is an orphan living in the walls of a 1930's Parisian train station, winding the clocks whilst rebuilding an automaton that his father found before he died. Here is the thing, the actors do the best with what they were given, but the script lacks any real life and feels like a workman's paycheck. Time is never given in the editing or the pacing of scenes to let the audience reflect on the emotions of the moment, so we never see the actor's reacting or showing any emotion to the events transpiring.For example, after Hugo's notebook is taken by the owner of a toy shop booth that he has been stealing from to get parts for the automaton, he should be devastated, right? But instead we see Hugo, immediately after, winding the clocks and watching people in the train station, laughing at their humorous situations. Not to mention, these attempts at comedy always fall flat, in particular with Sacha Baron Cohen's Station Inspector, whose antics just take too long to develop and fills up far too much screen time. The script by John Logan is just poorly paced, with scenes going from high tension and a hankering for a huge pay-off, to the brakes being hit to deliver a laugh.While Scorsese obviously shows his penchant for film history near the end with a nicely put together ten minute mini-doc in the movie that details the life of pioneer filmmaker Georges Meilies, ten minutes of enchantment do not make up for a haphazard hour and fifty minutes before all of that. As much of a fan I was of Selznick's novel, Hugo is an adaptation that perhaps should have never happened.I give Hugo a 4 out of 10!",4,10,20,25 November 2011
Wanted," An Action Packed Thrill Ride From Start to Finish!
","Wanted is simply one of the finest action movies I have seen in a long time. It is the perfect summer action flick, and might just be one of the finer summer films thus far.Wanted is the story of a nobody office worker named Wesley Gibson. Wesley is a young man who is awkward and does not know how to stand up for himself, and because of these things his life is a complete wreck. He has an awful job with a horrendous boss, and then on top of that his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best mate. Wesley's life just seems to be a complete waste, until one night a mysterious woman named Fox rescues Wesley from an assassin. Fox takes Wesley back to meet her leader, and here Wesley learns that she is a member of a secret Fraternity of Assassins. At the Fraternity's headquarters, Wesley is told that he possesses all of the powers to be in the Fraternity, and is coerced by the Fraternity's leader to become an assassin. Once Wesley begins his assassin training, he learns that his father was an assassin as well, and that he was killed by the rogue assassin Cross. Upon learning this Wesley begins to train harder in order to avenge his father.Wanted delivers everything I could ask for out of a great action movie, tons of explosions, cool fight scenes, and a few new tricks that I have never seen before in an American action movie. Each action sequence is masterfully crafted, and includes spectacular feats that are completely unrealistic, but who cares, it's a comic book movie. The film was really well directed by Russian action director Timur Bekmambetov, who utilized everything from slow-mo to awesome zoom-ins to deliver the pulse pounding action scenes. Of course, not only does it have plenty of action to satisfy the viewer, but it also has a good story. Now the story is by no means thought provoking, but is original, unique, and unlike any action film I have ever seen before. The script is both funny and suspenseful, managing to pull off both in a fashion that would make the kings of the action genre proud. Though what really surprised me about Wanted was the acting from James McAvoy, who is most well known for his roles in films such as Atonement and The Chronicles of Narnia. McAvoy successfully makes the transition to action star in this film and definitely sells you this often outlandish story, and makes you believe that this Fraternity of super powered Assassins could truly exist in our modern day world.Overall I felt that Wanted was one of the best summer films I have seen so far, and that is no easy task, seeing as how we have already had a terrific summer for movies up to this point. The only disclaimer to put on this film is to heed the R-rating. It is full of blood, gore, bad language, and some sexual material. If you are offended by any of these things you should not see Wanted, but if you don't mind them, such as myself, you will have a terrific time with this film. I can't wait for this one on DVD.Wanted gets a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,7,16,28 June 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," David O. Russell's Best Film to Date
","Silver Linings Playbook is a joy from start to finish. It's the kind of film that you feel as if you have actually experienced something, while at the same time you're wildly entertained.Blurring the lines between drama and comedy, the film tells the story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a former History teacher who walked in on his wife with another man. Pat snapped and beat the man to a pulp, being sent to a mental hospital for 8 months, diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Once out, Pat moves back in with his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), while he tries to get his life back on track and prove to his wife that he's changed. To say that this film is a comedy, may seem hard for someone to fathom, but believe me, writer/director, David O. Russell makes it work.Silver Linings Playbook shows these serious situations, but makes them funny by amping up the neuroses of all involved. In a way, it's as if Russell is saying, everyone is a little bit crazy, as is evidenced by Pat's psychiatrist's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles, or his dad's obsessive, superstitious beliefs that if Pat doesn't watch the Eagles' games with him, then the Eagles will lose.The performances by all involved are superb. Bradley Cooper delivers a career best turn as Pat, being both likable and vulnerable at the same time, and what more can be said for Jennifer Lawrence, who portrays a mentally unstable widower, named Tiffany, who befriends Pat. Lawrence is having one great year. From her career best work as Katniss in The Hunger Games, to her work in Silver Linings Playbook, she proves that she is full of spunk, but is not afraid to show emotion or fall apart, and that is why she very well may win the Best Actress Oscar come January.There is just something special about Silver Linings Playbook. It's funny and oddly heartwarming. After a career high with The Fighter, two years back, David O. Russell bests himself again with this film. This is quite possibly the best directing he has ever done, with his kinetic shot design utilizing a lot of camera movements to show the characters and emotions that he wants us to focus on at that time, by dollying the camera in or whipping it around other actors to get to the core of each scene.Silver Linings Playbook is an offbeat film, and some might not find its straightforward nature all that funny, because with both Pat and Tiffany, what you see is what you get, and they both say whatever is on their mind. While they often say socially unacceptable things at the wrong times, that is where the comedy often comes from, and it's why you realize that these two are meant to be together, learning, that no matter how crazy you think you are, there's always someone out there for you who is just as crazy and will love you for who you are.I give Silver Linings Playbook a 10 out of 10!",10,2,6,27 December 2012
Ender's Game," A Surprise Worth Noting
","Sometimes a film comes out and it's just right down my alley, and it takes more out of me to not like the film than it does to like it. In the case of Ender's Game, not only does it appeal to all of my sci-fi-leaned sensibilities, but it also happens to be more than just a film that didn't have to do much to win me over. Ender's Game winds up being a thoughtful, emotional film experience that deserves to be seen by any fan of science fiction.Based on Orson Scott Card's revered novel, Ender's Game takes place in the near future. In this future, Earth enlists kids to lead drones into battles against an evil alien race, the rationale being that kids are more in tune with technology and their minds can process more information than their adult counterparts. Asa Butterfield portrays Ender Wiggin, a teen genius, recruited to attend Battle School, an orbiting space station where these kids are trained in zero gravity. Could Ender be the Commander that the International Fleet has been looking for? Is he the one that will once and for all be able to lead the troops and destroy the alien homeworld? Well, you'll have to see the movie to find out, but what I can tell you is that Ender's Game is one of the more successful science fiction films I've seen in recent memory, and it is entirely grounded in reality.Everything in Ender's Game feels current. While the film deals with aliens and is set in the future, the thematic ideas of bullying, violence in video games, and drone warfare, are all so of the times, the film manages to feel real and lived in. This is not a slight on the film, it's a praise of it. These are all hot button issues, a few of which I don't even know on which side I come down on, but Ender's Game has got me thinking about them, and I think that, coupled with the emotional experience that this film offers, just solidifies why I go to movies.Ender's Game has moments of awe and wonder, there are laughs to be had, there are moments where you'll probably want to cheer, and yet, in the end, you realize that this film was never meant to be frivolous popcorn entertainment, but an involving conversation with the audience. Director Gavin Hood manages to hit all of the beats, and lends Ender's Game a voice through his smart realizations of things that must have seemed impossible to realize when reading it on the page of Card's novel, such as the Battle Room, where the kids float around in zero-G, fighting mock battles. Of course, a large part of what makes Hood's work so phenomenal and beautifully realized, is the stellar work done behind the scenes.The film's special effects are seamless in their integration, which is a rarity nowadays. The production design is never showy, but feels authentic. Then there is Steve Jablonsky's music, which is the genuine surprise of the film for me. Jablonsky never implements a memorable theme that you will be humming for days on end, but his smart use of strings and how he orchestrated it, makes this a film score that I find hard to stop thinking about, because it's just so technically well done and is effective when it needs to be in the context of the film. However, you cannot have a film without those in front of the camera, and the actors all manage to deliver phenomenal performances.Butterfield plays Ender like an open book. When Ender is conflicted between his leanings towards violence and empathy, we can tell what he is thinking or feeling through his facial expressions, and it works. While this type of acting is very raw and unrefined, its immediacy gives more potency to situations. Personally, I prefer performances such as this, rather than things being so internalized that we never get any facial reaction whatsoever. As for the rest of the cast, while Ender is obviously the meatiest role, there are a few key supporting roles where the actors really stand out.Harrison Ford is in tip top shape as Colonel Graff, the head of the Battle School. I would argue he hasn't been this charming and dedicated in a role in years. Then there is Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis, both delivering their usual strong performances, even if they're nothing to write home about. After that, the rest of the cast are mostly children, or at least actors under the age of 18. Abigail Breslin makes the most out of her small, yet crucial role as Ender's older sister, Valentine, who acts as Ender's conscience. Rounding out the kids of note are Hailee Steinfeld and Moises Arias as fellow Battle School students. While Steinfeld does not have as much to do as a young actress of her caliber deserves, she manages to deliver everything with the same likability she had in True Grit. Then, there is Arias, who is having quite a year, showing his range in films like this and The Kings of Summer, with two drastically different, and equally solid performances, he is truly an actor to look out for.Truly, if there is a drawback to Ender's Game, it is that the film is so heavy on the sci-fi jargon, without spoon feeding any of it to the audience, that I'm doubtful as to whether or not the film will have much reach beyond science fiction fans. Then, there is the fact that the film winds up favoring thought and emotion over action, and I truly wonder as to what type of box office it can have, but as a rabid science fiction fan myself, I find Ender's Game a surprise worth noting. This is one of those films that fellow sci-fi fans need to see.I give Ender's Game a 10 out of 10!",10,4,11,3 November 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not Worth Eight Dollars
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is not a kiddie movie, but a fell-fledged aberration from what is acceptable in modern culture. Tons of nudity, sex, and violence, infiltrate the senses within the two-and-a-half hour runtime of David Fincher's adaptation of the bestselling novel, of a hacker enlisted to solve a fifty-year-old cold case. The senses are barraged with so much of what is typically not seen as socially acceptable, that it is often hard to find a grasp as to the story and the purpose of why our senses were barraged to begin with. Not only that, screenwriter Steven Zaillian gets a bit carried away with the adaptation, with so much of the story focused on Lisbeth Salander, the titular girl with the dragon tattoo (who is played well by Rooney Mara), rather than focusing on Daniel Craig trying to solve the murder. The thing is, Salander plays no real importance to the plot till halfway into the film, and that first half could have easily been shortened had so many scenes of Lisbeth not been included that did little to add to the story or to her character, but simply add to the barrage on our senses. Well acted, with moments of genuine suspense, but is filled with too much excess to find any real traction to keep one engaged in the story or its characters.I give The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo a 5 out of 10!",5,9,15,7 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The Best Mission to Date
","It is very rare for a film series to actually get better with each subsequent installment, but that is exactly how the Mission: Impossible series rolls. Rogue Nation is the fifth installment in the film series that started all the way back in 1996 (that film in itself based off of the Sixties TV series), but Rogue Nation is really the first Mission: Impossible film to bring together every element that worked in the previous films to make the most complete Mission: Impossible to date.Tom Cruise once again is the face of the IMF as agent Ethan Hunt, tracking down a clandestine shadow organization known as the Syndicate, who is always just one step ahead of Hunt. Making Hunt's mission even more impossible is the fact that the US government has shuttered the IMF after their cowboy actions in Ghost Protocol that nearly saw San Francisco obliterated by a nuke because Hunt willingly gave a terrorist nuclear launch codes in order to try and catch him. Of course, Hunt has gone rogue in every single Mission: Impossible movie that has ever been made, so it's no surprise that he continues to evade the CIA (led by Alec Baldwin) while trying to bring down the Syndicate. However, like Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation has a greater attention to the team element than most of the previous Mission films with Simon Pegg back as funny gadget guy Benji, Jeremy Renner back as analyst Brandt, and Ving Rhames back as hacker Luther. Then there is the new addition of Rebecca Ferguson as the mysterious, butt- kicking Ilsa Faust, who is either a double agent helping Ethan bring down the Syndicate from within, or is actually in the Syndicate and is playing Ethan and his team.While it may seem like there is a lot going on in this film, it all feels organic and the story clips along at a very brisk pace, always making sense (which was a problem I had with Ghost Protocol). Then there is the stronger villain presence in this film than in Ghost Protocol, with Sean Harris portraying the cold-blooded head of the Syndicate who is always outsmarting Ethan at every turn (though Philip Seymour Hoffman in M:I:III is still the series best bad guy). While I have to concede that Ghost Protocol had better gags, Rogue Nation utilizes Simon Pegg better than he has been utilized in any of his previous two Mission films and that in itself leads to some good comedic beats featuring Benji. Another thing that Rogue Nation really does better than most of its predecessors is action aiding the story. All of the action scenes are exquisitely orchestrated and are some of the franchise's best. Of course, the thing that makes Rogue Nation the best Mission film is it really plays off of the relationships established between these characters in a way that no other Mission film has done.Having gotten to know Simon Pegg's Benji for three films now, we actually get to see more of a friendship between Benji and Hunt than ever before, and that idea of friendship is echoed in the characters of Brandt and Luther. Most of the Mission: Impossible films never really brought back the previous teammates, but with the past two films they have made a concentrated effort at creating this team and it finally pays off here with some nice emotional moments between all of them. There is arguing between them, but there is also a level of trust and a willingness to do anything to save one another's lives that was never there in any of the previous films, which makes you care more. Then there is the new friendship forged between Ethan and Ilsa that is very engaging because it is so different from any of Ethan's previous relationships with women in these movies. It also doesn't hurt that Rebecca Ferguson is insanely awesome in this movie.When all is said and done, you really feel like you have gone on a ride in Rogue Nation. The plot is full of twists and turns, something one should expect with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie having written The Usual Suspects, and the action is thrilling and intense, with McQuarrie really flexing his directorial muscles with only his third film as a director. You will have fun with Rogue Nation like you have with every previous Mission: Impossible, but you will also be treated to a smart story that you have think about with some emotional consequences at the core that McQuarrie really milks in one beautiful sequence near the end where all sound drops out of the film and we go into slo-mo. It's a smart choice in a film full of smart choices.I give Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation a series best 10 out of 10!",10,4,9,31 July 2015
Spider-Man," My Childhood Dreams Brought to Life!
","I was 12 years old when the first Spider-man film graced the silver screen. Up until that point I had never before experienced the level of hype in which this film received. This was the first film I ever obsessively tracked on the internet up until the very moment of the film's release. When I finally saw the film on opening day, I was blown away and ended up seeing the film again three more times in theaters. The main question now is, is the film just as good now as it was back in 2002? The answer is yes.Spider-man was always one of my favorite superheros growing up, and in that sense I am a little biased towards this film, but it actually is a terrific film. This is one of those few blockbuster films that I think was able to transcend its stereotypes and actually become simply put a good film. This film had all of the action and thrills in which you expect from big budget blockbusters, but it also had this genuine emotion and heart that made it resonate with me more so than many other similar films. As well, not only is this a very heartfelt film, but it is actually quite funny and the action is extremely exciting to watch, as well it gets quite dramatic near the end.Overall Spider-man is a good film with a terrific story, awesome acting, and genuine heart.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Best Potter Yet!!!
","I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I loved the first two films.When I heard that they got a new director(Alfonso Cuaron) for the third installment I was worried,but I must say I worried over absolutely nothing.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban begins when Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) accidentally blows up his Uncle Vernon's sister like a balloon after she makes an off-color remark about his parents.Wrapped in anger Harry runs away.Through various trials Harry makes it back to the wizarding world,and is reunited with his friends,to learn that a dark wizard named Sirius Black(Gary Oldman),who followed Voldermort,has broken out of Azkaban(a wizard prison) and is out to kill Harry.When Harry returns to school he meets an old friend of his fathers,while he learns more about Sirius Black learning he is his godfather and that he betrayed his parents,angering Harry.Throughout the film Harry battles these dark,hooded creatures known as Dementors,he prepares for a confrontation with Sirius Black,and battles his own inner demons.Overall this film is much darker,and more serious in tone than the first two,which in my opinion has only made it better.Once more the cinematography,special effects,and production design is superb and definitely creates this believable fantasy world,although the look of the film is different it fits the darker story,and I even prefer this film's look at times to the first two.That isn't all that is different,John Williams is back this time,but tries something that is much more darker and a little less playful,and it works helping to create this amazing fantasy.Once again the acting is great,although their is a new Dumbledore(in Michael Gambon).What really is the show stealer is the directing,Chris Columbus has stepped down as director and Alfonso Cuaron takes his place at the helm of this franchise and he does an amazing job.Cuaron takes the dark tone of the story and sells it to the audience while still retaining much of the look of the first two,just adding on.Cuaron also transforms the three leads into teenagers in this film and expands their characters even further.Cuaron and screenwriter Steve Kloves definitely need a huge pat on the back for the time turner sequence.This third outing in Harry's world is darker,and at times scarier than the first two.I find it hard to believe this got by with a PG rating.The kids have now grown up into rebellious teenagers and are now handling more mature themes and adult problems thus adding to its darker tone.Its darker tone in fact actually makes it better and more enjoyable.With more character development than previous entries,just as many laughs,more emotion,and more heart than the first two,this film is the best entry in this franchise so far.A superbly perfect: 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,8 July 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," I feel the ol' Parker luck!
","We all know the story, teenager is bit by a scientifically altered spider, gets spider powers and becomes Spider-Man, what we didn't know was his past before he became the Spider-Man. To compare The Amazing Spider-Man to the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man, is like comparing apples to oranges. One is more character centric, where as the other is more light-hearted and melodramatic in the comic book style. The Amazing Spider-Man is a wonderful movie because it does not feel like a retread of the Sam Raimi original. Director Marc Webb and the rest of his crew have manufactured a Spider-Man movie that does not try to compete with what has been done before, but rather focuses on lesser known aspects of the character Peter Parker and makes the film a character piece rather than a large scale mosaic.It's evident when we are not treated to a shot of the New York City skyline till nearly ten minutes into the movie, that this Spider-Man isn't looking to impress with scope or scale. Rather the first thing we see is the tale of how Peter Parker's parents left him as a child with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, to never return for him. This is the greatest and most unique aspect of the film. The Amazing Spider-Man is up there with some of the great comic book story arcs, because it delves deeper into Peter's past than perhaps even some of the comics have done. Actor Andrew Garfield portrays Peter as a kid with a chip on his shoulder, having been abandoned by his own father he looks for fatherly connections with everyone from Uncle Ben to Dr. Curtis Connors, all the way to his girlfriend's dad, Captain Stacy. Garfield is the heart- and-soul of this movie, and he portrays Peter as an outcast rather than as a geek with no friends, and it works. He understands the character, perhaps even more so than Tobey Maguire did.While the story does retread some of the origin aspects from the Sam Raimi movie, the movie is constantly replaying them so differently, it never really crosses the mind that they are portraying some of the same events. The strength to this lies in the great screenplay from James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sergeant, and Harry Potter-alum Steve Kloves. The screenplay ties up Spidey's origin with Peter trying to uncover the mystery of his dad's old briefcase, which leads him to discover the source of his webbing, and his powers, but it also gives the movie a different through line than any other Spider-Man movie. We see Peter get bit by the spider, we see him discover his powers, we even see the unfortunate tragedy that leads him to donning tights, but what we see is a more realistic approach to how these things play out. The Raimi film is more operatic, focusing on the emotion of the moments, rather this film focuses more on how these moments work as transitioning points in the maturation of Peter Parker and coming to accept his parents' disappearance. Everything flows and transpires with an action-reaction style. Peter does something, which causes this to happen, or this happens affecting Peter, and this keeps the story always focused on him.As cheesy as it sound, The Amazing Spider-Man is amazing. The fight scenes between Spidey and his bad guy the Lizard are top notch, with some exceptional CG-camera work that creates the sense of being a fly on the wall zooming and flipping over the fight as Spidey zips around. Emma Stone is likable as love interest Gwen Stacy, and Martin Sheen is a terrific Uncle Ben, with that exceptionally lovable twinkle in his eye. Not to mention the film is well directed, joining the ranks of other Indie-Blockbusters over the past decade (Blockbusters with an Independent film aesthetic because they were made by an Indie director, this case Marc Webb). There are many directorial signatures in Webb's work that can be seen in both his first film, (500) Days of Summer, and this one. In particular the music video-like montage when Peter is messing around with his powers and skateboarding, it harks back to Webb's video roots and the multiple montage, music video-like sequences in (500) Days of Summer. To cap it off, the musical score from James Horner is heroic and beautiful at all of the right moments, being a worthy successor to the brilliant Danny Elfman music from the original movies.I loved this movie, it was fun, heroic, deep, and emotional. There are so many great scenes, one of my personal favorites being when Spider-Man saves a child from a burning car hanging off a bridge, or the finale when an injured Spidey gets aid from New Yorkers themselves. These scenes just symbolize what is so special about the character of Spider- Man. He has wit, but he's also got a huge heart and will almost always try to do the right thing, even if it nearly kills him in the process. The old Parker luck is with this one.I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 10 out of 10!",10,9,19,3 July 2012
The Lego Movie," I Wish I Could Go Where Everything is Awesome
","Everything is awesome in the new film, The Lego Movie. The film is exactly as it sounds, it's a film about Legos, set in a world made entirely of Legos. It's quite simple in all honesty, but it's in the satire and the surprising depth that this film has that makes it awesome.The Lego Movie follows Lego construction worker, Emmett, who is as normal as anyone can be. Emmett always follows the instructions, until one night he comes across this thing known as the relic, and the relic is the only thing that can stop the evil Lord Business from using Krazy Glue and gluing all of the Lego pieces of the world together.The film is a very witty satire in the way that it pokes fun at just about every movie convention you've seen in major Hollywood blockbusters over the past 10-20 years. There are pointless prophecies, chosen ones, evil world-ending machines, even a character who is Good Cop and Bad Cop. When Good Cop-Bad Cop spins his head, the back of his head has a different face, and depending on which side he is showing, he is either good or he is bad. There is a lot of ingenious humor in the film, even if every joke doesn't always land because there are just so many packed in there. However, what really impressed me with this film was the thematic depth it has.Anyone going to see The Lego Movie is expecting a comedy, and the film is that, even in its more serious moments, but there is a very clever twist in the final third of the film that really makes this a unique, one-of-a-kind animated film. It is this twist that really gives the film weight. While the traditional idea of being an individual and not always following the traditional flow seems to be the big idea that the filmmakers are wanting you to believe in at first, once this twist occurs, you realize that the film is saying something even deeper than that. I'll say no more, other than the fact that Will Ferrell, who voices Lord Business, really shines in the final act of the film, shedding his man-child persona to adopt one of seriousness.Overall, The Lego Movie is about as good of a time as you can have with any movie out there. It's like a weird blend of Pixar meets Monty Python and Mel Brooks. The CG animation replicates the look of those stop motion Lego cartoons you can find on YouTube, but better. I am not gonna lie and say my jaw didn't drop a few times at the technical perfection on display here, but it's the humor and the heart that really makes The Lego Movie an awesome experience. Even when the film has a slight case of ADD, you are still charmed.I give The Lego Movie a 9 out of 10!",9,0,3,9 February 2014
Now You See Me," Like a Vegas Show, Entertaining but Lacking of Much Else
","Imagine Now You See Me as Ocean's Eleven meets The Prestige and you sort of get what director Louis Leterrier was going for with this film. Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.The story follows four Vegas magicians, known as the Four Horsemen, who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a cat-and-mouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians, always one step behind, trying to figure out how they did it.Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used real-life magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well, if you want a film with twists and turns, this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed, there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold, thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However, the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas, that of character.Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters, and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me, to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hood-like magicians, and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down, but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons, and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately, I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters, like the magicians or the FBI, the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point, but as it is the film's core is often muddled.While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam, it's still entertaining, thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the heist genre, you'll like this movie. For me though, it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!",8,296,491,31 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This One is for the Fans!
","In X-Men: Days of Future Past, the stakes have never been higher for our heroes and villains. They are literally facing annihilation, unless they can change and overcome their past. The film starts in a post-apocalyptic future where the cast of the original three X-Men movies (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, etc.) are all that are left after mutant hunting robots, called Sentinels, have killed most mutants on the planet. Utilizing the super powers of Kitty Pride, Professor X decides to send Logan back in time to 1973, to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from assassinating a key figure, which ultimately led to the creation of the future the X-Men are facing. It's a mindbending storyline for sure, but it all works beautifully, flowing gracefully between the past and the future with a logical ease that is missing in many time travel movies.From the very moment this film was announced, fanboys have been rabid in their anticipation, and this film doesn't disappoint. The filmmakers figured out how to give the original X-Men cast a proper send off, while making a sequel to the 2011 prequel, X-Men: First Class, at the same time. Plus, the time travel nature of the story has enabled them to wipe out some of the continuity mistakes of the previous X-Men films to rectify many of the stupid decisions made in films like X-Men Origins: Wolverine or X-Men: The Last Stand. This film was clearly made by fans, for the fans, and the fact that it's also just an exceptionally well made blockbuster is the icing on the cake.There is a lot of action in this film, with more mutants and more super powers featured than in any previous X-Men movie. Every action scene was thrilling and satisfying, and there are many fan service moments here. However, the greatest aspect of this film is that it isn't your typical superhero flick.Usually, the first question people have about superhero movies is: Who is the bad guy? In Days of Future Past, while there are the Sentinels and their creator, Bolivar Trask, the real villains of the story are our heroes themselves. The problems they are facing are all based on the choices and mistakes they made in the past, and it's about their past selves having to face up to what they will become in the future to overcome their own pasts in order to write a better future for mutants and humanity. It's in this focus on overcoming your past, that gives Days of Future Past an emotional weight that blockbusters often lack in the modern era, and if you're a long time fan of the series, there are moments in this film that will not only make you laugh and want to cheer, but will also move you deeply.I can't do anything other than highly recommend X-Men: Days of Future Past to anyone who considers themselves an X-Men fan. While people who aren't quite as well versed in the franchise might find themselves lost given the vast amount of characters, I still think the film is entertaining enough on its own accord that just about any moviegoer can have a good time here.I give X-Men: Days of Future Past a 9 out of 10!",9,1,3,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," A Spoiler-Free Review
","Captain America: Civil War would not have been possible if it weren't for the shared Marvel Cinematic Universe. If this was attempted without all the other Avengers movies and Iron Man movies, this movie would not be as good, and it is proof that the Marvel model of making movies works when done with enough forethought. In Civil War, Iron Man and Captain America find themselves at odds over a new bit of legislation that would have the Avengers answering to the United Nations. Cap thinks the Avengers should remain free to make their own choices, while Iron Man believes they need oversight, thus the battle commences. While there are a great many twists and turns that happen, I don't want to spoil that for anyone, because all anyone wants to really know is if this movie is worth their money, and that is a resounding yes.Look, by this point if you haven't jumped on the Marvel Studios train, this movie wont be the thing that gets you onboard, but if you have been a fan of every Marvel movie thus far, then this is going to be an emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish. This is top notch blockbuster movie-making and it needs to be experienced on the big screen. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo really get these characters, which is why it's great that they're also directing the next two Avengers movies. Of course the greatest aspect of Civil War is that while it features a lot of Avengers and can at times feel like another Avengers movie, it still never forgets that Captain America is the main character of this movie. While I still personally would have loved to have seen another Cap solo movie instead, like The Winter Soldier, Civil War is a great substitute.I give Captain America: Civil War a 9 out of 10!",9,2,12,27 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Fun Return to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World!
","Return to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first of a new five part prequel series to Harry Potter. In Fantastic Beasts, we are transported back to 1926 New York, during the height of the Jazz Age, where Rowling lifts the veil on the American Wizarding World for the first time. It is here we meet British magizoologist, Newt Scamander, who is traveling the world cataloging magical creatures and keeping a literal zoo within his magically enchanted suitcase. When Newt's suitcase is opened and some of his magical creatures escape, Newt must return them before getting arrested by MACUSA (the American equivalent to the Ministry of Magic), with the aid of an ex-auror named Tina, her sister Queenie, and a No-Maj (aka American Muggle) named Jacob.Fantastic Beasts sees the return of many of the behind the scenes talent from the Harry Potter movies. David Yates, the director of the last four Potter movies, has directed this one as well, while David Heyman, the producer of all eight Potter movies, is onboard here too, alongside Rowling and Steve Kloves, who wrote the screenplays for seven of the Potter movies but is merely a producer this time. Of course the biggest draw of this movie is that it is the first screenplay ever written by J.K. Rowling herself. While there was a fictional Hogwarts textbook that Rowling wrote about fifteen years ago that bears the same name, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, this movie is not so much an adaptation as it is the story that tells of how the author of that textbook, Newt Scamander, wrote it.In all honesty, how much you enjoy Fantastic Beasts really all stems back to how much you love Rowling's Wizarding World. If you are not already a fan of Rowling's work, this movie will not change your mind. On top of that, this movie would not make a great entry point for someone who has never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. If you don't know your Muggles from your Nifflers, you might be a little lost, with that all said, as a die-hard fan of the books and movies from the Wizarding World, Fantastic Beasts is a more than satisfactory return to Rowling's imagination.Like with all of Rowling's writings, there are deeper themes running underneath the whole story that help to give the story weight. No theme is more prominent than that of tolerance and understanding, however the real draw of Rowling's writing is the colorful characters she creates. Fantastic Beasts is no different, with these characters being brought to life by the great actors playing them. Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander with an awkward sensibility that often finds him more attune to creatures than other people, but throughout the course of the movie you really get a sense for Newt's heart and come to love him for who he is. Then there are sisters Tina and Queenie Goldstein, played by Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol. Tina is very straight to business while Queenie is a little more open and flirty, especially with Jacob, the No-Maj that tags along for the ride. Actor Dan Fogler steals practically every scene he is in as Jacob, acting as the main source of comic relief for almost all of the movie, and Jacob's potential romance with Queenie is easily one of my favorite aspects of the whole story. Then there are the titular fantastic beasts themselves, who all are characters in their own ways, in particular the platypus-like Niffler who garners many laughs.Once the credits roll, you realize you've gone on a great adventure. To compare the modest adventure in this movie to the grand ones in the Harry Potter stories is almost a little foolish. Like the Star Wars prequels, we ultimately know where this story ends, but it is how we get there that is what makes Fantastic Beasts worthwhile. Fantastic Beasts is definitely a different experience from the Harry Potter books and movies, but it also has all of the heart, humor, and thrills of those other stories to be a fantastic addition all on its own (pun definitely intended).I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them a 9 out of 10!",9,22,44,18 November 2016
Spirited Away," One of the Finest Fantasy Adventures Ever Made!
","This film might possibly be Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece. While it may not be as epic in scope as Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away seems to be the most personal film in which Miyazaki has made thus far. That is why I think Spirited Away might just be his greatest work.Spirited Away is the story of a young girl named Chihiro. Chihiro and her family are moving to a new town when they get lost and venture into what they think is an abandoned theme park, which later turns out to be a literal ghost town. As night falls Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs, spirits appear, and Chihiro is whisked away to a big bathhouse for the spirits. Here she goes to work for the sorceress who runs the place in hopes of freeing her parents and returning them to normal.Spirited Away is a very touching film. Deep, thought provoking, but also highly emotional. It has all of Miyazaki's trademark touches. The film has humor, heart, and not to mention some breathtaking fantasy. The reason why this is possibly his best work is simply because it achieves a poignancy that none of his other films have done for me.Spirited Away is a film about growing up, discovering the courage within yourself, and becoming someone who can truly make a difference in this world. It is a highly optimistic film that in the end has a very happy, albeit bittersweet ending. We feel for Chihiro. We laugh when she laughs, we cry when she cries, and we are happy when she shows happiness. It is thanks to this connection with the main character that makes this film a genuine knockout and makes it linger in your memory forever.Here Miyazaki tackles themes that many live action filmmakers would never dare touch. But Miyazaki never beats the viewer over the head with a baseball bat, he subtly introduces these themes and weaves them into the story. This I think is Miyazaki's special touch, as this is something that he has done in nearly all of his films, but this one in particular just feels more personal. Perhaps Miyazaki finally realized all these themes to his heart's content with this film? We'll never know for we aren't Miyazaki himself, but the themes of this film speak for themselves.Though Spirited Away is not just a deep, thought provoking art film, it happens to be a highly entertaining fantasy adventure. The scene with the Stink Spirit, or when Chihiro is chased by No Face are authentic set pieces that are exquisitely realized and are a thrill to watch. As well the film looks gorgeous. This is the most beautiful animated film I have ever seen. It's colors are vibrant, the animation fluid, and the world jam-packed with detail. Huge props go to all the artists involved in making this movie.Overall Spirited Away is a very touching film, one that will stay with you long after it's over. It's a film that some may never come to appreciate, but for those who do they'll be implanted within their own imaginations and whisked away by this film.I give Spirited Away a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,28 July 2009
Tropic Thunder," Crossed the line a few too many times.
","Tropic Thunder is a movie that is at times very funny, but at other times was blatantly offensive. For nearly the first half hour of this film I was hysterically laughing my head off, thinking that it was well on its way to being the comedy of the year, but then began the offensive jokes about people with mental handicaps. I completely felt that these jokes were totally out of line, and just showed poor taste on the filmmakers behalf. You can say that it was all in good fun, but they took it way too far and never tried to redeem what they said. Yes, they made fun of many things in this film, most notably other Vietnam war movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now, and I loved how they made fun of the Hollywood studio system; and if the film had stuck to those type of jokes, I wouldn't have had a problem with it, and would've thought it was the funniest movie of the year, but instead it traipsed into territory that while may be funny to some, is blatantly offensive for others. Now everyone has their own opinion on this particular issue, so if this issue doesn't bother you you'll love this movie, but if you are offended by this sort of thing you should skip it.Overall Tropic Thunder is a movie with plenty of laughs to be had, but the offensive jokes took me out of the viewing experience and I just never really came back to it after that point. This simple fact lost Tropic Thunder a good number of points in my book.I give Tropic Thunder a 6 out of 10!",6,2,6,17 August 2008
Inside Out," One of Pixar's Best!
","It's funny how people still seem surprised when Pixar does something the likes of which have never been seen before. They do a couple of sequels/prequels, take a year off, and everyone talks as if they are running out of ideas, but their new film, Inside Out, is the perfect example of why that was just foolish talk.Inside Out is perhaps the most inventive movie I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot. The whole concept of the movie is what happens inside your head, personifying your five core emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger, as cartoon characters. Where ordinarily the human character would be the star of the movie, here, 12-year-old Riley, is the setting of the film. While we do experience Riley's difficult move to San Francisco with her parents, almost everything is seen through the lens of the emotions operating the control center in Riley's head. Pixar could have stopped there and this film would be different than any other, but they then start to delve into areas such as the subconscious or abstract thought (all to funny but psychologically factual results I might add), and turn the film into the smallest, most intimate epic that has ever existed in movie history.It would be very easy for me to give away the whole movie here, because there are so many good moments in Inside Out, but I will refrain from doing so because this is as emotionally rich a movie as Pixar has ever made, and a movie about emotion deserves to have its emotional experience preserved. What I will say is that only the filmmakers at Pixar could take an idea like this and make it so easy to relate to, and yet also so complex if you're willing to read between the lines. The fact that they make each emotion an individual three-dimensional character and not just a caricature of what their core emotion is, is one of the most impressive things this movie does, and it really ties into the theme of the movie. No person is all one emotion all the time, you often need a balance of your emotions to properly navigate life, and that is what Joy in particular has to learn before the end of her journey in Inside Out. In truth, this movie kind of has everything I want out of a movie, and while every Pixar movie is always good, this one has one of Pixar's greatest secret weapons at the helm, director Pete Docter.Pete Docter is one of the few directors in the world of movies that I can honestly say has never made anything less than a perfect film. He directed Monsters, Inc., Up, and now has directed Inside Out. Any one man that can direct those three movies deserves Oscar recognition of the directing variety. It really is quite funny when you watch all of the Pixar movies, if you pay attention, you can kind of see the directorial hands at work. I know they always talk about their team based approach, but there is always a leader of that team. If you watch a John Lasseter movie it's usually more child-like than other Pixar films. You watch an Andrew Stanton movie it's usually full of big, cerebral ideas on top of its emotional narrative. You watch a Brad Bird movie and it's usually the funniest of the bunch. When you watch a Pete Docter movie, you usually are punched in the gut by the raw emotion on display. That is what sets Docter and his movies apart from other Pixar movies, that ability to really get at the core emotional ideas of the narrative. I guess you can say it's because to Docter, movies are personal. I know he said that this movie was inspired by his own daughter and the changes her personality started going through as she was leaving childhood behind, causing him to wonder what was going on inside of her head. In short, it's for reasons like that, that we need more directors like Docter in both animation and live action.So what more can I say about Inside Out to make you go see it? It's beautifully animated, the voice talent all do excellent work, composer Michael Giacchino has written an almost Mario-infused score that is beautiful and ethereal, and the movie is just funny and emotional (pardon the pun) all in one brief 90-minute timeframe. Inside Out is worthy of being considered one of Pixar's best, and that is saying something.",10,4,27,19 June 2015
Quantum of Solace," The Latest in the Bond Franchise!
","Quantum of Solace is the newest addition to the endearing James Bond franchise, and while it may not pack quite the punch of its predecessor Casino Royale it is still better than many of the other Bond films.The film starts only mere moments after the ending of Casino Royale as James Bond is being pursued by enemies in Italy. The entirety of the film's story focuses on James trying to find who is responsible for Vesper Lynd's death at the end of Royale, which leads him to an evil worldwide organization known as Quantum.As previously mentioned, while Quantum of Solace may not be quite as stellar as Casino Royale it still has enough to enjoy for a fan of 007. Daniel Craig once more proves that he is quite possibly the best James Bond save for Sean Connery, as well the direction from Marc Forster is truly terrific. My only real problems with this film was that it simply did not feel as if it was a James Bond film. Firstly the writers seemed to not have a real grasp on the character of Bond himself, not allowing the character to be the secret agent we all know and love; not once did 007 deliver a classic tongue and cheek one liner like in previous films, which was very sad for a long time Bond fan. For the mentioned reason it almost felt as if I was watching a Bourne film as opposed to a Bond film, which is a tad alarming in regards to the franchises future. Still, even with these minor quibbles, Quantum of Solace is a film that definitely has its moments.I give Quantum of Solace a slightly disappointing 6 out of 10!",6,0,5,3 January 2009
District 9," A Surprise!
","Aliens have been the source of many films since the fifties. Over the years, alien films have gotten far more sophisticated and less corny. District 9 is a perfect example of an alien film steeped in realism.District 9 is the story of an alien race, referred to as Prawns, who twenty years agohad their ship break down over Johannesberg, South Africa. The Prawns were feared by humans and forced into slums called District 9. The story follows Wikas, an agent for MNU, the corporation who controls the Prawns. Wikas accidentally gets infected with Prawn technology, and after many odd outbursts, slowly begins to transform into an alien himself.It is safe to say that District 9 is a fairly bizarre film, but in the best sense. It is odd at times, but that is mainly because there has never been anything quite like this before. Originality is bursting from the seams. The story is a superb allegory towards racism, the way in which the humans treat the Prawns is heartwrenching to watch, at times even disturbing as military soldiers hold guns to alien's heads. Very often when a film includes such themes and moralistic messages, many skip out upon viewing it, but District 9 manages to lace these themes within the package of a sci-fi action/thriller and it works beautifully to reach a wider audience.The film was directed by first time director, Neil Blomkamp. Blomkamp has done a superb job here, evoking sympathy from his audience for these not too attractive alien creatures, in particular the father and son Prawns, who are probably the most prominent aliens in the film. Blomkamp has done the film in a pseudo-documentary style. It switches back-and-forth between a propulsive narrative, like your normal film, and between the faux documentary aspect, making the film and its world feel very rich and alive, while still getting a certain layer of depth to the characters. Of course the standout aspect of the film is its visual effects. I sat there wondering how this film was made for $30 million. The CGI is spectacular, being some of the finest I've seen this year and definitely worthy of Oscar contention in the visual effects category.Overall, there isn't much bad to say about District 9. It's a deep, philosophical film that also has tons of action to boot, though due to the disturbing nature of certain scenes and the fact that this film is so different than anything you've probably ever seen, many filmgoers will probably not appreciate this film. Even still, District 9 is a terrific film, well worth a look for any die-hard fan of science fiction.I give District 9 a 9 out of 10!",9,1,4,25 August 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Step Down for the Franchise
","Sometimes you really want to love a movie, and when you wind up only liking it, it's more painful than if you just flat out hated it. That's how I am with this second installment of The Hobbit trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug. I wanted to love this film so much, because I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first part of The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey, but The Desolation of Smaug is further proving that perhaps Peter Jackson should have just made The Hobbit one long three-and-a-half hour movie, rather than three separate three hour films.In this installment, we catch back up with Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs, still pursued by a pack of orcs as they try to reach the Lonely Mountain and take back the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the vile dragon, Smaug. Of course, as is par for the course, nothing goes according to plan and our heroes must face many trials and tribulations before they actually get there.The biggest difference between The Desolation of Smaug and An Unexpected Journey is that this film just isn't as much fun as its predecessor. An Unexpected Journey was a lighthearted adventure film that perhaps played to a far younger crowd than most die-hard Tolkien addicts would have wanted, but it is what made that film both different from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also an enjoyable adventure film in its own right. This time around, most of the humor is gone and there is a serious lack of emotional beats, which was one thing An Unexpected Journey had in ample supply. A large part of this is because the events that are adapted here are purely action beats that have been dragged out in every possible way, adding in characters that never existed before, while also expanding upon characters who perhaps didn't need as much screen-time as they've gotten. Personally, I loved seeing Legolas again, as portrayed by Orlando Bloom, and I rather took a liking to his elf love interest, Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lily, but these characters were not necessary for this film, the same goes for the extremely broadened role for Bard the bowman. All of these new characters take the focus off of Bilbo far too often. Unlike The Lord of the Rings trilogy where these films were really ensemble films, featuring multiple character arcs, The Hobbit has always been purely about Bilbo Baggins and his going from a mild-mannered hobbit, to a great hero. We kind of already saw that arc play out in its entirety in the first film of this trilogy, so now there is very little room for Bilbo to continue growing, and therefore I guess that's the reason that there is so much more focus on everyone else, but this is still supposed to be Bilbo's story, right? Then why do we spend so much time fleshing out all these other characters and not showing how these events that Bilbo is experiencing are affecting him? Without any moments for Bilbo that really test him emotionally in this film, I never felt tested emotionally by what I was seeing, and it saddens me, because the emotions of all the previous Middle Earth films have always been so potent, to see a film set in that world that isn't as emotionally potent is just heartwrenching. Even still, this makes me sound like I hated The Desolation of Smaug, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.What I've been speaking mostly with is disappointment, but there are elements of The Desolation of Smaug that delivered, in particular the action sequences. The spiders of Mirkwood are creepy and realized beautifully, the same goes for the titular dragon Smaug, but perhaps the most awesome sequence of the film is when the dwarfs escape the woodland elves by jumping inside wine barrels floating down a river, all while fighting off orcs. Then there are the new and expanded characters that manage to at least create a nice diversion, even if they are not essential and might have been better served being relegated to an Extended Editon Blu Ray. I for one enjoyed Tauriel and her story arc, and I really enjoyed seeing this odd romance that she develops with the dwarf Kili. As well, I found Bard the bowman a welcome addition that, while does not replace the gaping hole that is Aragorn, it at least gives you a human hero to root for.Ultimately, if you have loved every film set within Middle Earth up to this point, you will find enough in The Desolation of Smaug to enjoy, and hey, you might even love it, but this outing just left me disappointed. I think the truth of the matter is, is that Peter Jackson and company just spread this small children's book out too thin and have already resolved majority of the primary story and character arcs, therefore there is nowhere to go other than to introduce new characters that draw away focus from our main heroes, while barreling forward with action. Plus, am I the only one that was underwhelmed by the special effects and Howard Shore's music this go around? The effects often looked very rushed and unpolished, which is very unlike Peter Jackson and WETA, and Howard Shore's score completely ignored the awesomely memorable main theme he wrote for the last film centered around, 'The Song of the Lonely Mountain,' which is also very unlike him. Here is hoping they step up their game in order to make next year's final installment in the trilogy, There and Back Again, the film that rights the ship.I give The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug an 8 out of 10!",8,3,7,16 December 2013
Batman Begins," An excellent movie!!!!!
","Batman Begins is by far the greatest comic book movie ever made, everything just seemed to work, ranging from the well crafted story to the superb acting and directing. The story was exciting and very well told,I loved how it focused more on story and character development; on top of that the directing was excellent,Christopher Nolan deserved at least an Oscar nomination for this; and the acting was excellent as well,Christian Bale is the definitive Batman.The art direction and the cinematography were both equally stunning, creating a style that looked as if you were in the comic book. Of course another major highlight is the score, although not as memorable as Danny Elfmans, it was still great, and is truly classic. One final note, the ending is one of the most pulse pounding endings I have ever seen, except maybe for the Death Star trench run from Star Wars.All in all it is an excellent movie and is definitely one of my favorite films of all-time!A perfect: 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,6 July 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Go Now and See, 'Wreck-It Ralph'
","Disney's latest animated film, Wreck-It Ralph, is a charming film that is laugh-out loud hilarious, and yet tender-hearted at the same time. Ralph is a video game bad guy for a video game called Fix It Felix, Jr., a game similar to the original Donkey Kong with Mario and DK. All Ralph wants to do is be seen as a good guy and be liked, so he sets off on a journey traveling through other arcade games to win a gold medal, proving he's a hero. Ralph finds an unlikely sidekick in a glitchy little girl named Vanellope in a Mario Kart-like kart racer who just wants to be a race car driver, and the two team together to try and achieve their individual goals.It's been said about this film already, but it feels like a Pixar movie rather than a movie from Disney's in-house studios. Not only is the film just wildly original and different than most other animated films in the market, but folks at Disney also created all of these arcade games that seem as if they should be real. Adding to the Pixar comparisons, the filmmakers also crafted some extremely lovable characters, from Ralph to Vanellope to the big bad guy, named King Candy, while infusing the film with deeper themes than most prior Disney animated films deal with. Wreck-It Ralph is all about learning to be comfortable with who you are and not letting a label define you, which is an important lesson for kids, and it's told in such a hilarious way with so many inside jokes about video games that anyone who even has a passing knowledge of video games will find funny, with cameo appearances from the likes of Pac Man and Sonic the Hedgehog.In all honesty, so much of this film's success must be attributed to Pixar co-founder, John Lasseter, as the new head of Disney Animation, but give credit also to Futurama creator, Rich Moore, who directed Wreck-It Ralph. With Moore's vast imagination, and folks like Lasseter willing to try something different and let talents like Rich Moore simply do what they love, it produces films like these, which is the best film to come from Disney's in-house animation studio in over a decade. The animation is beautiful, the story is both funny and touching, and the voice-over work is superb, with immense kudos to Sarah Silverman for playing the spunkiest little girl on Earth as Vanellope, I mean, who knew she could sound like an 8-year-old kid? On a final note, the animated short that plays before the film, Paperman, is so good it is almost worth the price of admission itself for its sweet love story and for the amazing combination of hand-drawn animation and computer technology that brought it to life. I truly feel that this short shows the true future of animation, combing old school techniques with modern innovations to make a better, higher quality product that still has that personal touch that only hand-drawn animation can give, while creating a depth of the image that you can really only get through using computers.I give Wreck-It Ralph a 10 out of 10!",10,3,4,10 January 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Thank Goodness, It's No Phantom Menace
","J.R.R. Tolkien's classic, The Hobbit, is finally getting the big screen treatment with the first part of a planned trilogy to bring the tome to life, An Unexpected Journey, now in theaters. Thirteen dwarfs come knocking on hobbit, Bilbo Baggins' door, recruiting him as their 'burglar' to sneak into their mountain fortress that is now under rule of a vile dragon, named Smaug. Pretty much the same crew from The Lord of the Rings trilogy returns behind the camera for The Hobbit trilogy, with the first installment not only proving to be as technically impressive as the groundbreaking effects work in The Lord of the Rings, but also surpassing it in many ways. The visual effects from WETA are better than ever, with their pioneering motion capture technology having taken many significant steps since The Return of the King in 2003, with characters like the despicable, yet lovable, schizophrenic creature, Gollum, now having a wider range of emotion than he was ever able to relay in the previous installments. Of course, what makes The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey such a joy, is that it feels like coming home after a long time abroad.From the first moments of the film, we see old places and old faces. From the first sights of the Shire, to Ian Holm as old Bilbo once more, narrating this story. There's Elijah Wood as Frodo in a brief cameo, and then we get reintroduced to Ian McKellen's Gandalf, while welcoming Martin Freeman into the role of a Bilbo, 60 years younger, who still manages to make us feel as if we've known his Bilbo as long as we have Ian Holm's. Even the music, by composer Howard Shore, harks back to The Lord of the Rings, with the Shire theme played as beautifully as ever before. This film just knows how to stir your memories, and already has you drawn into the story before you even really meet any new characters. With that said, while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does feel like The Lord of the Rings, it becomes it's own thing very quickly.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey feels of the same world, but like how a film about the Gulf War will be different from a film about World War II, one is set at a more innocent time, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes that concept and runs with it. It's funnier than The Lord of the Rings, with more emphasis on humor and a wider range of traditional fantasy. Trolls did not talk in the other films, nor did Goblins, but they did in the book, and so they do in this film, often to hilarious results. Jackson and his cast and crew play up all of the British humor that Tolkien included in the book, and do not shy away from it, just to make it feel like The Lord of the Rings (which coincidentally was written twenty years after The Hobbit). Not to mention, the relentless sense of adventure from Tolkien's book is here as well. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an adventure film, it's not a majestic epic like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's like a storybook bedtime story. Many of the visuals have this golden sheen to them, of sunlight streaming through trees and climbing over mountain tops, creating an inviting aura around the scenes that was not of the prior trilogy. As well, the fellowship of dwarfs, led by the heroic, yet stubborn Thorin Oakenshield, are a camaraderie as lovable as the Fellowship of the Ring, and composer Howard Shore does not sit on his laurels, having composed a score that takes many of the cues from The Lord of the Rings and incorporating them with a new theme based on the dwarf song, 'Song of the Lonely Mountain.' It's sweeping and majestic, and brilliantly sung by musician Neil Flynn in the credits. This film truly is a feat that is equal to what has already come before it.If you're already a fan of Middle Earth, you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. You kind of get the feeling that Peter Jackson is no longer trying to pick up new fans with these films, but rather he's just trying to serve the already fans. The truth is, the way Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he wrote it like a children's adventure storybook, and the film does have that feel in terms of the tone and the visuals that Jackson creates, but Jackson also takes the rare opportunity to expand Middle Earth. Using details from the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, Jackson and fellow screenwriters, Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh, and Guillermo del Toro, flesh out areas in The Hobbit that add further depth of character to these often slight characters from the original book, allowing for a far richer, and far more emotional experience. It's actually kind of like Peter Jackson -- who released an extended version of all three Lord of the Rings' films after they came out -- decided to release the extended version in theaters this time about. Will it seem too long to someone who is just a passing cinemagoer? Probably, but to fans, it's a treasure trove of joy. I give The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey a 10 out of 10!",10,1,9,14 December 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A Spoiler-Free Review
","How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the kind of sequel that most sequels try to be. It's a film that recaptures the magic of the first film, while telling an entirely different story. Like the main character of Hiccup, this film is a little bit more mature than the first outing, with five years having passed for the viking dragon riders of Berk, and yet there is still a levity to the proceedings in all of the darker moments that maintain the innocent, child-like charm of the story.The simple truth here is if you liked the first film, then you will enjoy this one. While I feel that the first film is a more complete narrative experience, there is sheer joy in seeing your favorite characters, human and dragon alike, back together again for a new adventure that is full of emotionally charged moments that get to you. If only the villain, Drago, had been a little more than just an external conflict for our heroes to face, this film might have bested its predecessor. The truth is, the film often bogs down a bit when Drago is on screen because in a film that is as emotional as this one, a character there merely for plot contrivance doesn't always work. Of course, aside from an uninteresting villain, this is about as perfect a sequel as you can make.All of the cast and crew of the first film are back and it really feels like you're watching a reunion of sorts unfold. I can only imagine that this must be how people felt when they saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time. While How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not The Empire Strikes Back, the comparison is one that I feel sums up all of my favorite aspects of this film. From the musical score by returning composer John Powell, revisiting the catchy musical themes of the first film while adding new ones, to the spot on vocal performance by Jay Baruchel as Hiccup, this movie works because of its lovable characters and the same emotional heart beating underneath it as the first film. From the first time you see Hiccup and his dragon pal, Toothless, flying together as one to a new song by Sigur Ros frontman, Jonsi, you are transported back into this world and you only wish you could stay a little bit longer.I give How to Train Your Dragon 2 a 9 out of 10!",9,2,5,14 June 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Easygoing Fun, Little Else
","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a whiz-bang, breezy fourth installment to a storied franchise that has never been quite as good as James Bond, but has always managed to deliver entertainment, and this fourth installment does just that, but little else.Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, whose IMF team is now having to do the true impossible, when they are believed to be behind a bombing at the Kremlin in Russia. The biggest difference from the other three films in the franchise is that director Brad Bird treated Hunt and his team, just as that, a team, working together to prove their innocence. From Simon Pegg to Paula Patton to Jeremy Renner, Bird made sure that Cruise would not be stealing the spotlight from the rest of his team (even if he is still given the best action bits).There are plenty of laughs throughout the story, and the plot unfurls at a nice click, constantly keeping the viewer on their toes. However, there is not much emotional depth to the movie, with a subplot involving Ethan and his wife only hinted at in a handful of scenes until the end, and when we are supposed to have an emotional payoff, I was left cold. But seriously, this is Mission Impossible, not Shakespeare, you watch it for the impossible action and adventure, right? So what if the villain is an underdeveloped psychopath who only gets like two lines of dialogue (and I am not joking, we see his face and are told he's evil, but we never see or hear him do anything evil). When you get right down to it, the action is well directed, Pegg is on top form here, Michael Giacchino reworks Lalo Schifrin's theme into a score that is clearly his own whilst paying homage, and Cruise still proves that he isn't too old to hang off the tallest building in the world. If these things do not allow one to switch off their brain for two hours of simple fun, then you shouldn't accept this mission.I give Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol an 8 out of 10!",8,2,5,23 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Ever wanted to see an ape uprising?
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes can almost be seen as an ad protesting experimentation on animals, apes in particular. Scientists use apes to test experimental drugs, one drug in particular to try and cure Alzheimer's. We watch as certain apes develop higher brain functioning, rivaling that of humans, this is how we meet our story's hero, Caesar. We go from the sadness of seeing Caesar's mother dying trying to protect him from the scientists, to Caesar growing up as actor James Franco's surrogate son, but when Caesar tries to protect his family by attacking another human, Caesar is taken away to an ape sanctuary. Throughout all of this, we feel Caesar's joy as he first climbs a Redwood tree, and we feel his anger and sadness when he is left in a cage by his surrogate father, lending emotional plausibility to Caesar becoming embittered and rising to lead the apes in a revolt against the humans, rioting across San Francisco. What is more impressive is that not a single real ape was in this movie. All of the apes were portrayed by actors in motion capture suits, with their ape exteriors being added on in post production via CGI. The effects work is expertly woven into the story by WETA digital, and there are moments within the movie that even a seasoned eye can barely tell the difference between CGI trickery and a real ape on Animal Planet. This is just a pure spectacle that only a blockbuster can deliver. Tight storytelling, high emotion, and marvelous action, wrapped up into a wonderfully written, solidly directed, immaculate technical showcase.I give Rise of the Planet of the Apes a 9 out of 10!",9,8,16,6 August 2011
Django Unchained," An Unbiased Opinion from a Non-Tarantino Fan
","I have never been a Quentin Tarantino fan, so to say that I enjoyed Django Unchained is a huge testament to the film itself. While Django is not without its flaws, it's an enjoyable film that actually has a little more emotional weight than your typical Tarantino flick.In the film, Jamie Foxx portrays Django, a Southern slave in 1858, who is freed by a German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, played with charismatic relish by Christoph Waltz. The two become an unlikely dynamic duo, as they kill bad men for rewards. Meanwhile, Schultz helps Django find his wife who was sold to a vile plantation owner, Calvin J. Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, with more boyish enthusiasm than I've seen from him in years.The performances are top notch and the script does a good job of making these characters likable, for the most part. The two best characters are Candie and Schultz, primarily because they are the most charismatic, but Schultz also turns out to be the most sympathetic and human, in terms of emotional response, than most other characters. The big thing with the script is it never makes Django likable. While I'm rooting for his character because of all the injustices that have separated him and his wife, I don't like Django as a person, especially by the end of the film where he seems to be more interested in exacting revenge, than in love, even after he's already saved his wife. Another misstep in writer/director Tarantino's script, is that he kills off the two most charismatic characters thirty minutes before the end, making the final act feel like a chore to get through. Not to mention, is there really this much need for blood and guts spewing everywhere? The amount of gore was over-the-top, even for the genre that Tarantino is mimicking here.Even through all this, Django Unchained does have its moments, in particular the hilarious scene with an early version of the KKK. As well, from a technical standpoint, this is one of the more masterful films of the year. The cinematography is immaculate, with all of the Spaghetti Western zooms Tarantino employs executed to perfection, never losing focus. As well, this is quite possibly the best edited film of 2012. Is all of this enough to warrant a second viewing? No, but I don't regret seeing the film. I love Christoph Waltz and his character Dr. King Schultz, and I rather enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio getting to have a little bit of fun as Candie.I give Django Unchained a 7 out of 10!",7,1,6,27 December 2012
Drive," Cascading Violence to Synth Pop!
","The guy just likes to drive. Is that too much to ask for? Why can't gangsters let him be and get with the girl? Well, so is the life of the Driver in Drive, the tale of a Hollywood stunt-car driver by day and a getaway driver by night.Drive is relatively simple filmmaking that is complex and complicated due to the depth of the performance from Ryan Gosling and the psychological directing of Nicholas Winding Refn. The Driver falls in love for his next door neighbor, Irene, portrayed by a refined Carey Mulligan, but yo ho, complications arise when her husband is released from prison and the Driver must aid this family that he has grown to care for when Irene's husband must pull off a heist to pay off a debt. Refn and Gosling work in tandem to do so much with so little. Gosling does not show much emotion, but rather his eyes show that he is thinking about the events transpiring, and Refn just keeps the camera on him, letting us as the audience meditate whilst slowly dollying in at all of the right moments to bring us into the Driver's mind. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Siegel is definitely a highlight that helps all of the proceedings, and Refn and Siegel are in for potential Oscar noms.However, Drive is a tale of two halves. The first half deals with the Driver living his odd life simply wanting to drive no matter what he is doing, whilst getting to know Irene and her son, which was a lot stronger in terms of character; where as the latter half forsakes all of the strong character work in the first half for gratuitous violence. While Refn and Gosling manage to keep it together in the few quiet moments near the end, the action often overwhelms the characters and they get lost in the shuffle. So what? Even if Drive shifts from a spectacular contemplative drama to fairly standard thriller midway through, Refn delivers the thrills in pulse pounding, Hitchcock fashion to make Drive a thrill throughout.I give Drive a 9 out of 10!",9,4,8,3 October 2011
Frozen," Not Quite a Classic, But Good
","Disney's animation department has really been struggling over the past decade trying to figure out their place in the midst of in-house rival Pixar, and other studios like Dreamworks Animation. They've been trying to make all of their films a little bit more hip and cool, and less old-fashioned. Now, with Frozen, even thought it's a return to the fairy tale musicals of the past, it's still a little too modern in its sensibilities for it to ever feel like a classic Disney animation.The film is a loose adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, The Snow Queen. In the film there are two princesses, Elsa and her little sister, Anna. Elsa has always had the ability to create ice and snow, with no way to really control it. When Elsa is crowned queen, she accidentally reveals her powers at the coronation ceremony and freezes the entire kingdom. With Elsa fleeing into the wilderness, Anna must go after her sister to try and thaw the kingdom and help her sister control her abilities. Of course, along the way Anna meets up with a colorful cast of characters, most notably a talking snowman named Olaf who dreams of Summer, and who also gets the biggest laughs of the entire film.Truthfully, there are many things to love about Frozen, I mean the characters are all immediately likable, and I appreciate Disney's attempts at upending all of the traditional tropes that they've harbored in the past to be more feministic, but at a certain point I want that old Disney comfort food. Personally, I miss the simplicity of many of Disney's old animated classics. There was nothing ironic about them, they were not trying to be politically correct, they just were faithfully told fairy tales that made you believe in magic and in the good that the world can offer if we just look for it. Then there is the CG animation, which is very well done, but it lacks the warmth and personality that comes from hand-drawn animation of yore, which I feel would have given the film more life. As well, Frozen often suffers from its attempts to go against the grain. There is not a very strong central conflict to this film, because there is no real villain till about the final twenty minutes, and so the film often feels like its languishing with no urgency, especially in the middle portions. Of course, that's not to say that Frozen is not a good time.The songs of Frozen are the best songs written for a Disney film since the Nineties, with many of the tunes, like 'For the First Time in Forever' and 'Let It Go,' assured to be Disney classics, but the film itself falls just shy of that mark. This film does no harm, and it is quite entertaining, but it's one of those movies that a year from now I will be hard pressed to remember. It's definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of Disney animation, but just enough of the classic elements are missing to keep this from being another Disney classic.I give Frozen an 8 out of 10!",8,7,11,16 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Not a Home Run, But Enjoyable
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty tells the tale of Walter, a lonely, unadventurous negative asset manager at LIFE magazine who daydreams constantly, but when a photo negative goes missing, Walter embarks on a real-life adventure to track it down. The film is directed by and stars Ben Stiller, who for the most part manages to forego his traditional comedy trappings making a film that is offbeat, visually sumptuous, and different than just about anything else out there on the market, however that doesn't hold true for the entire film. Walter Mitty often dips into over-the-top comedy in the daydreams, and it's here that Ben Stiller kind of falls back into his old schtick. The thing is, this comedy is often humorous, but the daydreams don't always tie into the story or what is thematically going on at that point in the film. Overall, there are many great ideas involving characters, theme, and story beats, but they often aren't fleshed out enough. Too many things seem to happen merely by coincidence because the script said so and not because they felt organic to the story or the characters. In summation, I think that this film was a few rewrites away from being a truly great film. As it is, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is just an okay film, albeit one that will occasionally entertain and make you smile.I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a 7 out of 10!",7,1,3,30 December 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Best of the Trilogy!
","There is something special about the Two Towers that makes it more enjoyable than the other two parts of the trilogy. That is not to say that the other two films are inferior in any way, I just am simply more entertained by this one than the others and this is a large part to due with the Battle of Helms Deep. The Battle of Helms Deep is simply one of the finest battle sequences ever in movie history. Though not only is the battle exquisitely crafted, but thanks to Peter Jackson's wonderful direction, he makes us feel for the heroes and makes you want to continuously jump up and cheer each time Aragorn mows down a row of orcs, or Legolas rides a shield down a flight of stairs, pummeling enemies with his arrows on the way down. Still the battle is not the only thing that makes this film more enjoyable. I felt for these characters more so in this film than any of the others. Part of that is because this film puts more focus on the characters and who they are than either of the other two films. In the first one it was all about exposition, the third one it was all about drawing it all to a close, but this one was all about getting to know the characters better so that by the time we reach the third film we are so emotionally attached that we could not bear to see any of them pass.Overall Two Towers is a terrific film and is easily one of my more favorite movies of all-time.I give the Two Towers a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,1,3,14 March 2009
The Bourne Legacy," A Marvelous Action/Thriller
","Before seeing The Bourne Legacy, I had never before seen any of the previous Bourne films, but upon seeing this spin-off, I am definitely willing to give them a shot.In the film, actor Jeremy Renner portrays Aaron Cross, a government agent who has enhanced brain functioning and physical attributes thanks to an experimental drug program, funded by the government. When a fellow agent named Jason Bourne (who is never actually in the film), threatens to expose a similar government operation, the government shuts down Aaron's division and kill all agents, save for Aaron, who goes on the run, purely looking to survive.The Bourne Legacy is a taut cat-and-mouse thriller, with some of the finest stunts work you'll see in a film this year, with majority of the action sequences created in camera. Jeremy Renner once more proves he is a more than capable action movie star after his brilliant turns in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and The Avengers, this time proving he can carry a film all on his own, and he really should be doing more things like this, because he could be the next great action movie box office draw. Not to mention, the film just has more brains than almost any other action flick out there. You have to constantly be thinking to keep up with Tony Gilroy's script, that never spells anything out for you. You have to piece everything together on your own, but by doing so, you feel as if you're participating in the game of cat-and-mouse, constantly keeping you on your toes and anticipating what's next. The only flaw is the film is slow to start. It takes nearly thirty minutes for the film to really kick into high gear and draw you in, but once you are hooked, you can't take your eyes off the screen.I give The Bourne Legacy a 9 out of 10!",9,9,16,17 December 2012
Kick-Ass," A Fun, Sure-Fire Hit!
","Few movies can actually have so much blood, carnage, and absolute political incorrectness, and actually get away with it, and Kick-Ass is one of those films. I'll get to the bottom line, while Kick-Ass is not the greatest superhero film of all-time, and is not as much of a satire of the whole genre as I would have wished, it's just such a good time at the movies, I completely forgot about anything other than just being entertained.The film is a what if scenario. What if superheroes were real? In a way though, the superheroes in this film are not your average superheroes, more like vigilantes, like the Punisher and such. They kill, they don't just bring the crooks to justice, which is one thing that irks me a touch about the film, but not so much that I didn't enjoy it.It's all about a gawky teen, named Dave, who decides one day to take his love for superheroes, and put it into practicality by becoming one himself. One thing that the film does, is it doesn't allow Dave (a.k.a. Kick-Ass) to become Batman or the Punisher, he remains as Peter Parker would have had he never been bitten by that spider and still tried to be a superhero. Like the great hero Spider-man, the film is identifiable to just about anyone who grew up as a comic book nerd, like myself, which is partly why the film is a joy to watch.Like Spider-man, Kick-Ass has his Mary Jane in Katie, and unlike the comic, they actually allow Dave and Katie to hook up in the end, which I like a lot more to be honest. In both the comic and the film, Dave and Katie become best friends cause Katie thinks Dave is gay, the difference is, in the film when he reveals he isn't gay, Katie wants to be his girlfriend, and in the comic she calls him a perverted freak, essentially. For me, this actually gave the film an added layer of emotional connection, maybe because I am a hopeless romantic, but it made what could have been a mindless, raunchy, gore-fest, something that actually had a beating heart at its core.The film is raunchy at times, actually a lot of the times, but it never seems to be as raunchy as something like Superbad or Knocked Up. It's just the right amount of humor at the right times to make you laugh, and most of these laughs are generated by the pint-sized, 11-year-old assassin Hit-Girl (played marvelously by Chloe Moretz) and her dad, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage, who does his best to be Adam West). Hit-Girl has all of the great one-liners in the film, and her and Big Daddy are really the only two superheroes in the film anyways that actually seem to know what their doing, but their story also lends an emotional core to the final act of the film that I wont spoil by divulging, but it makes the action at the end of the film actually feel as if it was worth something.I'll just say it, I enjoyed the movie more than I enjoyed the comic. The movie actually allowed itself to have more fun, and that's what I liked about it. The film reminded me so much as to why I got into comics as a kid in the first place. I didn't get into comics to have thought provoked, or nothing of that ilk. I got into comics to be entertained, emotionally charged, and taken to a different world for a short period of time, which is what Kick-Ass does exceptionally well. It is over-the-top and kind of cheesy, but it's enjoyable for the kid inside of me to watch. I mean, Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass flying over New York City in a jetpack is so cheesy, but it was my favorite sequence of the film. Or what about the badguy getting blown to bits by a bazooka!?! Ultimately, if any faults come with the film, it is that the story kind of lags in the middle sections a bit, and it also missed out on a great many opportunities to be smarter than your average comic book film and actually be a genuine satire and not just another clichÃ©' comic book film or spoof. But I can't really hold any of this against it, I had fun watching it, and while I don't think at the end of the year I'll really remember it all that much, for a night on the town, it was well worth my $8.25 ticket.I give Kick-Ass an 8 out of 10!",8,1,15,16 April 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," A Spoiler-Free Review
","The X-Men are back in the sixth movie in the X-Men franchise and the fourth to be directed by Bryan Singer. While this is the end of the second X-Men trilogy, it also feels like a new beginning. The main thing to understand with X-Men: Apocalypse is that you shouldn't listen to most of the critics lambasting it for its vast number of characters and story lines. Even though there is a lot that goes on in X-Men: Apocalypse, it's all emotionally engaging and most importantly, fun.X-Men: Apocalypse takes place ten years after the events of Days of Future Past in 1983. The world's very first mutant from Ancient Egypt, a being named Apocalypse who thinks himself a god, awakens from suspended animation and sees how the world has become without his leadership. Apocalypse sets out to destroy almost the entire Earth to start humanity over anew, with only those pesky X-Men standing in his way. In a nutshell, that's the entire movie, but what gives X- Men: Apocalypse its emotional resonance is the fact that it is the sixth X-Men movie.This is a direct sequel in the way that The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars. The movie makers don't waste time reminding us who these characters are or what they're doing, they simply assume we've watched every other X-Men movie. While there might be a few passive fans of the franchise who do not like this approach, as a fan who has seen all of the X-Men movies multiple times, I was on cloud nine practically the entire runtime. On top of that, this one and Days of Future Past feel like the movie makers are finally embracing the more comic bookish nature of the X-Men. There are a lot more fantastical images in this one that look and feel as if they were taken straight from the pages of the comic books, and as a comic book fan, that's just icing on an already delicious cake.Overall, I absolutely loved X-Men: Apocalypse and it's my personal favorite superhero movie of 2016 so far. I know those are fighting words, but all of my favorite X-Men are represented in this movie and shine brighter than these movies have ever let them shine. From the teenage reintroductions to Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler, it's like Bryan Singer was reading my mind Professor X style to deliver the X-Men movie I've wanted for years.I give X-Men: Apocalypse a 9 out of 10!",9,10,21,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Just an Okay Spider-Man Movie
","In the follow up to 2012's reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, we find Spider-Man on a journey to further figure out the mystery surrounding his parents' death, all the while going toe-to- toe with the new big bad guy in town, known as Electro. I'm gonna get straight to the point, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not as good as the other Spider-Man films, but it is a piece of popcorn entertainment that will entertain for most of it's two plus hour run time. However, as a fan, I cannot lie and say that I am not disappointed by this film, and as an amateur film critic, I have to be honest and point out how cluttered the film often feels. In all honesty, they just tried to pack too much into this one movie to try and set up future films and spin-offs, like Venom and The Sinister Six. There is not a clear focus to this film, unlike any of the other Spider-Man films. It's unclear as to what the filmmakers were actually trying to do here. Is it the story of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy? Is it the story of how Spidey met Electro? Or is it the story of the Green Goblin? It's all of those things and a whole lot more, but there is never enough time devoted to any one of those story threads for them to feel fully fleshed out and satisfying on their own. I really think the culprit for all of this is in the Spidey producers trying to be like Marvel Studios and The Avengers. No longer can a superhero movie be simply a good standalone movie, and if that one is successful, they make another one with a similar, single-minded focus. Now, in the wake of the massive amount of cash The Avengers brought in, every superhero film franchise has to create this larger than life canvas of multiple films intersecting to create a larger story. While I love The Avengers, here's one of the things that Marvel Studios has done for almost all of their films, which The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did not do. They made every one of their superhero films good standalone films on their own right, and not just films that had to be seen in the larger context to be liked or understood. I mean, look at both of the Captain America movies. Take those away from the context of The Avengers, and they're phenomenal films irregardless, but add in the ingredient that is The Avengers, and you get super awesomeness. The thing is, the key is making one good film, and not placing so much focus on the future that you forget about the present. Of course, what really makes me feel conflicted here is that there are just a good many things that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does right.Andrew Garfield is once again phenomenal as Spider-Man, and Emma Stone is even more lovable as Gwen Stacy (as if that was possible). The film truly shines in the romantic scenes between Stone and Garfield, particularly because those are the scenes, alongside the music montages, where it feels like director Marc Webb is most comfortable. There are moments where I see that spark from his music video work and (500) Days of Summer, and in the midst of all the spectacle and bombastic action, it is those moments that stuck with me more than anything else. Somewhere in the midst of all of the excess that this film has, there is a very innocent and true romance, and I think that is the real focus of this film, but it's often pushed aside for too long to develop something that may not pay off for another film or two. As a matter of fact, if the film was purely about Peter and Gwen's romantic woes and Electro, I'd have been a happier Spider-Man fan, because I really like what actor Jamie Foxx and the filmmakers did with Electro, alas he gets the shaft after about the first hour mark. Maybe I'm becoming a bit of a movie curmudgeon, but the more and more I analyze films, the more I realize, the simpler you often make the story, the better the film. While that may not always be the case, I think here, it is. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is just too bloated, feeling like three different films crammed into the run time of just one. While it is a film that you will have fun at, laugh at, and actually feel something at, it is not a great film, it's simply okay. I actually remember reading another review the other day where they said, had this film been made in the Nineties, it would be one of the best superhero movies ever made, but made now, when we have so many other top notch superhero films, many of which being other Spider-Man movies, it just pales in comparison. Even still, if you can accept that this is not the greatest Spider-Man film, you will enjoy yourself with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which I did for at least three-fourths of this film, I just wish it had all tied together a little better.I give The Amazing Spider-Man 2 a 7 out of 10!",7,3,9,1 May 2014
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A Spellbinding Experience from Beginning to End!
","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a very intriguing film, very different than many of the other works from famed filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. Nausicaa undoubtedly has a genuine heart, but it is a film that is far more epic in scope than any other film from Miyazaki, even more so than Princess Mononoke. It also treads the line between fantasy and science fiction so finely that you truly have no idea what you're watching, but you can't help but be captivated by the story in which Miyazaki tells with so much conviction.Nausicaa tells the story of an unnamed world in which the world was ravaged by wars 1,000 years prior. Since then the world has been engulfed by this poisonous jungle that continues to spread and kill all human life. One of the few unpolluted areas left within the world is the Valley of the Wind where the title character, Princess Nausicaa lives. Nausicaa is a beautiful young woman filled with determination to keep her people alive, sending her on an epic journey to fight gigantic insects and discover the secret to the pollution and how to regenerate the world.Nausicaa is a film that is mythical in its style. While it still has many moments that make you know you're watching a Miyazaki film, it is as a whole very different than the rest of his works. It is far more serious in tone with very few moments of levity. I think the best way to sum this film up is to say that it is probably Miyazaki's most adult film he has ever made. The way everything is depicted within this film feels very realistic, even though the story clearly takes place in another world, Miyazaki does not overplay these characters and evokes very humanlike emotion from their cores.Nausicaa is another showcase of Miyazaki's trademark themes. His pacifist views come through in the story as well does his all encompassing environmental message. As well just like all other Miyazaki films the animation is gorgeous and highly imaginative. The last ten minutes of the film are so awe-inspiring that it cannot be described in words, it is quite possibly the most beautifully animated ten minutes of any film I've ever seen. Of course the film also features a beautiful musical score, thanks to Miyazaki's longtime collaborator Joe Hisaishi. Hisaishi's music along with Miyazaki's animation just wraps the viewer inside this world and refuses to let go. On a final note the voicework for the English dub was very well done, in particular the work by Patrick Stewart and Alison Lohman as the title character of Nausicaa.Nausicaa is a highly imaginative experience, filled to the brim with awe-inspiring spectacle and heart. Miyazaki's epic tale about courage and determination is what I believe to be a timeless classic.I give Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,10 August 2009
Transformers," Explosions galore!!!
","Wow!Going into this movie I was afraid I would receive yet another disappointing summer blockbuster,and boy was I wrong.We open with the voice of Optimus Prime describing what the Transformers are saying they are from the distant planet Cybertron,and all was peaceful until one robot known as Megatron wanted the all powerful Allspark(a very powerful and mysterious cube) and his followers(the Decepticons) and his enemies(the Autobots) engaged in a war that eventually destroyed their planet and the Allspark flew into space and landed on Earth.Transformers begins when a mysterious helicopter lands at an American military base in Qatar,and the chopper transforms into a gigantic hulking robot that destroys the base and tries taking top secret military files from the bases main hard drive,but is stopped in the act.Where meanwhile we meet teenager Sam Witwicky(Shia Labeouf) taken to get his first car by his dad,and gets what appears to be an old beat up Camaro(which later turns out to be the robot Bumblebee).Then one night Sam's car is stolen and follows it to find out that it stole itself and see it transform into a gigantic robot as it calls the Autobots(good robots) to Earth.Thus Sam gets caught up in the war between the machines and he later learns that he might even hold the key that can save all of humanity from the evil Decepticons(bad robots).I have to say I was thoroughly impressed.The movie was good primarily all around,fairly good acting by all(in particular Labeouf),amazing CGI,and pretty good directing(Michael Bay at his best).The best part of the whole movie is the fact that it knew it had an outlandish premise and so it never took itself too seriously,I mean this is by no means a comedy,but it has plenty of laughs to keep the movie light-hearted and fun.The action was superb,Bay definitely took advantage of this film's budget,and it shows,giving us some of the best action sequences in years.My only complaint with the entire movie was Bay was so close to the action I found it hard to distinguish which robot was fighting which,I wished the camera was pulled a little further back.Still putting this minor gripe aside,the action was top notch and this little gripe didn't detract from my enjoyment in this movie.This film is the greatest movie I've seen all summer.With more action than any other movie so far this summer.I must say on a final note the CGI in this film deserves at the least an Oscar nod,it was superb.Great top notch entertainment from start to finish.A well deserved: 10/10!!!!!!",10,3,7,3 July 2007
Lincoln," A Marvel of Acting, Writing, and Directing
","Upon seeing director Steven Spielberg's latest, Lincoln, I would not at all be surprised to see both Spielberg and Abraham Lincoln-portayer Daniel Day-Lewis win their third Oscars, and deservedly so. Lincoln is a master class in acting, writing, and directing, as the cast and crew tell the story of the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's life and his battle to get slavery abolished by passing the 13th amendment.All of the actors, from Sally Field as the tortured Mary Todd Lincoln to Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist Thadeus Stevens, relish in three-dimensional roles scripted with historical authenticity by screenwriter Tony Kushner, but it's Day-Lewis that steals the show. He disappears in the role, due in a large part to the brilliant make-up work which requires a genuine second glance to distinguish him from the real Abraham Lincoln in certain shots, in particular profiles. Where Day-Lewis excels though, is how he controls the performance. He rarely chews scenery, his high, reedy voice just seems perfectly natural to the Lincoln that he is presenting, with the real depth not always coming in his words, but in his soulful eyes. As a matter of fact, I would say that control is the best way to describe everyone's work in this film.No performance outshines the other in a scene, there is never too much attention drawn to the cinematography, as everything all gels together nicely to feel organic to the story. What's most surprising, Spielberg and composer John Williams show genuine restraint in the sparseness of the music, such as letting it be entirely ambient noise when the 13th amendment is passed. However, this isn't the entire film, with Spielberg and company knowing when to give a little visual or aural flourish to make their point. While Spielberg often sits back in dialogue scenes to let the actors do their work, he always knows the right moment to push the camera in or pull it out to immerse you in their words, and the scene where the House is voting on the amendment, is as finely crafted a visual sequence he has ever done in his career.Lincoln is a cinematic marvel, it shows the humanity of a man that we often put up on a pedestal, and even when we see him in all of his flaws, we are still drawn to him because he was just such a great man. It's such a loving portrait, that when you see Lincoln surrounded by his cabinet and his family, pronounced dead, you are overwhelmed by emotion to see a man that you have grown to love, never to open his soulful eyes again. However, as Spielberg illustrates in the final scene, with the slow dissolve from a burning candle to Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln will continue to burn on to inspire countless generations to come. If you want to try and make comparisons to the modern day political climate with this film, you're entirely in your right, but to me, this film is an inspiration, a firm reminder about the good of humanity and the leadership of a great man that should never be forgotten.I give Lincoln a 10 out of 10!",10,5,11,19 November 2012
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A truly imaginative experience!
","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful film. The original story was sprung from the imagination of Tim Burton, but has a slightly lighter tone than his other works. The Nightmare Before Christmas takes places in the town of Halloween where every inhabitant is a monster, or creature of sorts. The story follows Jack Skellington, a skeleton who is also the Pumpkin King and is a highly gifted scarer, he is viewed as the town hero. Jack is getting tired of Halloween and one day he stumbles into Christmas Town. After this Jack obsesses over Christmas and decides to try and recreate Christmas in Halloween Town.The film is wonderfully directed, and the script is very intelligent and funny. The voice acting is all really top notch. This movie is one of the most imaginative films I've ever seen. Each frame is full of magnificent wonder. The real showstopper is the music by Danny Elfman, in case you don't know this movie is a musical. All of the songs are well sung and are very catchy, you'll be singing them for hours (my personal favorites are: Jack's Lament, Poor Jack, and What's This). Danny Elfman's voice suits Jack perfectly, he is a very good singer.Overall this is a great imaginative film and is very, very fun. If you haven't seen it yet you need to try and get your hands on a copy, you wont regret it.Score: A 10 out of 10!",10,1,1,24 October 2007
Brave," Far From Pixar's Best
","To clarify, Disney/Pixar's Brave is not the worst time at a movie theater you will ever have, it just falls drastically short of the usual Pixar pedigree. When a feisty princess in a fantasy realm -- oddly reminiscent of Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon -- asks a witch for a spell, she accidentally turns her overbearing mother into a giant bear (no pun intended) and must help turn her back into a human. Brave is charming and innocent in the way that most Pixar movies are, with none of the little winks and nudges included for the adult crowd that most other animation studios offer, but it's the fact that the story just feels so uninspired that really gets me. Pixar has a knack for being original and telling stories that have never been told before, and this story just feels like a run of the mill Disney fairy tale, without any of the charm that comes when based on a pre-existing story that you already know and love. The characters are fairly standard for such a film, and the plot is sluggish to reach its finale. Overall, the animation is beautiful and it should entertain, but don't expect another Pixar masterpiece.I give Brave a 6 out of 10!",6,1,3,17 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Fun Movie from Start to Finish
","With Marvel Studios latest movie, they have gone to the bench to highlight some of the lesser known corners of their comic book universe. In many ways, you could almost say that Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel Studios throwing down the gauntlet, proving that when it comes to their movies at least, their distinguished competition is completely in the dust. Guardians of the Galaxy is not so much a superhero movie, but is more a space opera/sci-fi western in the vein of Star Wars, or more accurately, Firefly. The story follows Earth born Peter Quill, who was abducted by aliens as a child, and has spent his life since, traversing alien worlds as the outlaw Star-Lord. Following an opening sequence a little reminiscent of a sci-fi Raiders of the Lost Ark, Quill discovers a mysterious orb that just about everyone in the galaxy seems to be after, but why? The answer to that question leads Quill to team up with a ragtag group of quirky misfit outlaws, including a gun-toting raccoon, named Rocket, and a talking tree man, who all work together to save the galaxy from the villainous warlord, Ronan the Accuser.If the above description does not tickle your interests, then don't go to see this movie, but if it does, then you'll enjoy just about everything that this movie has to offer. Without traipsing into too much spoiler-filled territory, this is a fun movie from start to finish. You will be laughing almost non-stop. This is quite possibly the funniest Marvel movie to date, and perhaps the funniest movie of the year, period. Rocket Raccoon is almost certain to become one of the new favorite Marvel heroes, because let's face it, when you have a talking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, who also happens to have short man syndrome, magic happens.There is just a lot that is charming about Guardians of the Galaxy. There is a nice dose of action, a ton of laughs, and a little dash of emotion there to tie everything together. Of course, the main thing people always want to know is if this is the best Marvel movie ever? I don't know if I would go that far, partly because this movie doesn't have the added benefit that The Avengers had, having had five movies prior to set up all of the characters, rather than having to set them up and then bring them together in the course of two hours, but when Guardians works, it soars. Plus, I have a feeling that when we finally reach The Avengers 3, this particular chapter in the Marvel saga will be one of the most crucial in understanding what's at stake in that particular adventure for Earth's Mightiest Heroes.I give Guardians of the Galaxy a 9 out of 10!",9,1,4,1 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Movie Review: 'The Imitation Game'
","The Imitation Game is the kind of movie that could win Oscars, now whether or not the competition will be too stiff for it to do so is another matter. The most fascinating thing about The Imitation Game is that it is a stylish history lesson that manages to remain entertaining thanks to some intriguing visual ideas and stellar performances from its cast.The movie tells the true story of Alan Turing (played in this film by Benedict Cumberbatch in an Oscar worthy performance), who was a British mathematician who is considered one of the most influential men in computer sciences. Turing's biggest claim to fame was when he created a computer for England in World War II to break the seemingly unbreakable Nazi enigma code. It is the drama that occurred around the creation of the said computer that is the primary focus of the story, with majority of the movie playing like a war film without really ever seeing much war. In a way, you could say that this is a war film honoring the smart men and women who solved problems from the homefront, while often not being able to solve their own personal problems.What The Imitation Game tries and succeeds at illuminating is that the greatest tragedy of Turing's life truly isn't the fact that he was persecuted for his being different, but that he was a man who did so much for humanity but could never quite crack the code to his own humanity or that of others. The whole film sort of plays like a puzzle with the story being told in three concurrent timelines: when Turing was at boarding school as a child, when he was decoding Enigma, and when he was arrested in 1951 for homosexuality, with his time decoding Enigma making up about ninety percent of the story. However, by interspersing these other time periods into the story, you see the future for Turing and we have to often venture into the past to piece together all of the details of the man to understand why he was the way he was and how he eventually got to the point he was in. It is in constructing this movie like a puzzle that gives it an extra bit of pizazz that keeps this movie from being like a made-for-TV movie.Director Morten Tyldum works with his cinematographer, Oscar Faura, and editor, William Goldenberg, to create a visual language, at times similar to that of Christopher Nolan from The Prestige. There is some truly spectacular crosscutting between scenes in the past, present, and future, that really astounded me as a fellow filmmaker. One matchcut in particular, going from a Nazi u-boat firing a torpedo, to a sideways shot showing a cigarette being snuffed out in an ashtray, is perhaps the most powerful cut I have seen in a movie in a long time. The way that Tyldum and company work in conjunction with Graham Moore's taut script, makes every scene of the film another piece of the puzzle to the eventual outcome. Often you watch a movie and feel there are extraneous scenes, but each scene in The Imitation Game builds toward the tragedy of Turing in his final years. Then there is the music from Alexandre Desplat that is both simple in its themes and motifs, but exceptionally complex in how it uses a lot of moving parts to aurally illustrate Turing's always mobile mind. From a technical standpoint, this is about as well made a film you can find, but what gives the film its heart and soul is the actual way Turing is represented.The greatest feat that The Imitation Game accomplishes is in the way that it makes Turing a character you root for and pity. Turing was a very anti-social, slightly arrogant man, who did not know how to deal with people all that well and who struggled with his closeted homosexuality for his entire life (which was against the law at that time in Britain). The credit really goes to Cumberbatch (and those soulful eyes) for showing the heartbreaking humanity inside of Turing. There are few actors currently working who can play the calculating man with the heart that Cumberbatch brings to these roles. You genuinely feel that Cumberbatch's Turing is not a man who is ever intentionally being mean or offensive, he just does not know how to properly behave. He has been bullied and disliked for his entire life and had only a small handful of people who genuinely cared for him, one such person being Joan Clark, the only woman who worked on Turing's team of codebreakers. Keira Knightley does some of her best work ever here as Clark, managing to decode Turing even when he often didn't seem to be able to figure himself out.In short, The Imitation Game is for anyone who enjoys well made prestige fare with the Oscar sheen behind it. The movie isn't explicit and would play well to a high school history class. Alan Turing was a tragic, broken man who was isolated from an early age, with the only ones who ever took a vested interest in him always leaving in the end. Any man or woman who can never manage to solve the riddle of emotion and connect with other people is one that I pity. I think we all often struggle with how best to connect with people, and that to me is what The Imitation Game is all about.",9,2,8,7 January 2015
Jurassic World," Speed Review
","Jurassic World is yet another attempt at recapturing the magic of the original Jurassic Park, and while the plot has a great many holes in it, you still have fun with this movie thanks to the likability of its cast. The park has now officially opened to the public and guess what, it all goes wrong when the Jurassic World scientists create a genetic hybrid dinosaur to try and up ticket sales. Simply put, Jurassic World is a nice afternoon at the movies, but it is lacking in the scares, memorable moments, and most importantly, heart, that made the first movie such a worldwide phenomenon (although Chris Pratt is his own phenomenon at this point).",7,1,6,18 July 2015
Prisoners," Not as Good as I Hoped, but Still Worth It
","Prisoners is a simple enough film to follow. When two little girls go missing and are believed to have been kidnapped, one of their father's -- portrayed by a gruff Hugh Jackman -- takes the law into his own hands, torturing the prime suspect when the police can't charge him with anything. This is a film that asks many moral questions, most notably -- What would you do if this happened to you? While I'd like to think most fathers wouldn't go to the extremes Jackman's character does, I don't know if I'd blame someone either for doing what he does in this film. I think that's why so many in the cast seem to relate to this material, and it shows in their performances, which are all strong, in particular a near mute Paul Dano as the prime suspect with a shattered psyche. Ultimately, though, while Prisoners offers some rich, complex characters, the lack of any levity, as well as the more, 'been there, done that,' procedural elements of the story, really make this a long watch. We can see much of what Prisoners has to offer, in particular the detective aspects of hunting down the kidnapper, by staying at home and watching an episode of Law & Order in one-third of the time. Perhaps the film would have been stronger had it focused entirely on Jackman torturing Dano's character? Sure, there would have never been any levity in that scenario either, but at least it would have made for a more tight and concise story that would have been different and justified why this had to be a film and not just an episode of a TV show.I give Prisoners an 8 out of 10!",8,0,0,15 November 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Movie Review: 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'
","Lightning rarely strikes twice and that is the first thing you've got to understand about Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Avengers was one of those one of a kind movie-going experiences, and while I don't think Age of Ultron ever tops its predecessor, it is a really awesome movie in its own right. Filled with wall-to-wall action and more probing character exploration, Age of Ultron is what Serenity was to Firefly (pardon the Joss Whedon comparisons, but the guy did write and direct all of the aforementioned films and TV series). Age of Ultron is darker and more serious-minded than The Avengers, and yet there are enough one-liners and awesome comic book panel-worthy moments of mayhem that keep the film entertaining and a fitting kick-off to the Summer of 2015.In Age of Ultron, Tony Stark creates an artificial intelligence known as Ultron in hopes of being able to establish a peacekeeper for Earth that would make the Avengers obsolete. Of course, as with just about everything Tony Stark seems to touch, things go awry and Ultron takes possession of a series of robotic bodies and believes that the only way to true peace is through evolution, which means the demise of all human life on Earth, especially those pesky Avengers. What follows is this ragtag team that we saw come together in the first film falls apart and then has to rebuild themselves all while duking it out with Ultron and a pair of superpowered twins from Eastern Europe, Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have allied themselves with Ultron.The greatest thing about Age of Ultron is it further cements the idea that these Marvel movies have really become like one really big TV series that you just have to wait every six months or so for each new episode. These things have very much become a machine with each entry being as impressively put together as the last, and when you couple that with the comfort of seeing characters you know and love reunited and bickering with one another, there is no way on Earth that you cannot enjoy the film.Seriously, if you are reading this, you're not really wanting a full lowdown because you are already going to see the movie regardless, so what do you really need to know? All you need to know is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is worthy of the Marvel brand. It is entertainment of the highest order with a story that manages to further challenge our heroes and force them to really decide where their priorities lie. While majority of the Marvel heroes did not want to become heroes, they did rise to the challenge when called because of a sense of responsibility, and the way Age of Ultron ends effectively answers the internal question that each of our heroes face. So what are you waiting for, get to the theater and see this movie as many times as you know you're going to see it.",9,30,62,30 April 2015
The Dark Knight," The Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time!
","The Dark Knight is the follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Now I thought Batman Begins was amazing, I mean it is one of my favorite films of all-time. To sum it up, I was very pumped about the sequel, but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that The Dark Knight might not be as good as Batman Begins, but finally after three years of waiting I can say that The Dark Knight is not just as good as Begins, but it in fact blows it out of the water. The story of The Dark Knight follows Batman on his continuing crusade to rid Gotham City of crime. In this film Batman begins to see hope for both him and Gotham in the hopes of the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Batman feels that Gotham needs a hero with a face, and he believes that Dent is that hero, not Batman. Of course, Batman's hopes are soon shattered by the arrival of a new criminal mastermind calling himself the Joker.As I have already said, The Dark Knight is amazing, you could call it a masterpiece, but that just doesn't seem to fully sum up how blown away I was by this film. To start, the directing by Christopher Nolan is superb, reinforcing once more that he is quite possibly the film industries greatest current filmmaker. On top of that the cinematography by Wally Pfister is amazing, and I really think it is about time he finally wins an Oscar for his work. Then the score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is perfect, fitting each scene perfectly. Finally the script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is perfect, flowing perfectly from scene to scene, making this 2 and a 1/2 hour film feel as if it lasted only 90 minutes, but in a good way. Of course the true highlight of the film is the acting from the all-star cast, all actors turn in perfect performances, including: Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllennhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes; though the one performance that truly stands out ahead of the others is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, he was amazing, this role just fit him like a glove, and he truly deserves a post-humous Oscar win.In final thought, the Dark Knight is epic, emotional, and exciting, all at the same time. I loved this film, it was tense and disturbing while being at times a little comical through the Joker's odd, dark sense of humor. I could go on all day long talking about how perfect this film was, but I'll try to wrap things up here. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of 2008, and should definitely be considered for some big-time Oscars, in particular Heath Ledger's stunning performance as the Joker; but not only is The Dark Knight the year's best film, it is the best film of the decade thus far. The Dark Knight is the Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time, and definitely stands in my books as one of the Greatest Films of All-Time. It is a true masterpiece.The Dark Knight earns a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,8,17,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Amazing!!!!The Best Movie of the Year by Far!!!!!
","I'm a huge Harry Potter fan,having read every book and seen every movie countless times.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has always been,in my opinion,the weakest of the books so I was very worried about the movie before seeing it,but I was very wrong.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins when Harry and his cousin Dudley fall prey to a Dementor attack in an underpass on their way home one evening.Harry fends off the Dementors saving both his and Dudley's life,only to later receive a letter from the Ministry of Magic saying he has been expelled from school for using magic in front of a muggle.Later that night the Order of the Phoenix arrives(the group who opposes Voldermort led by Dumbledore) and rescues Harry taking him back to their HQ and telling him that Dumbledore has arranged a trial to decide his fate.Once at their HQ Harry reunites with the Weasleys,Hermione,but most importantly his godfather Sirius Black.Once back in the wizarding world Harry learns that the Ministry is denying all reports of Voldermort's return and is branding both Harry and Dumbledore liars,essentially accusing them of herecy.At Harry's trial Dumbledore arrives to get Harry off of the hook,and his punishment is lifted and he is off back to Hogwarts.Once back at Hogwarts Harry feels more alienated than ever,while also having to deal with Professor Umbridge(played superbly by Imelda Staunton) Fudge's assistant who is the Ministry's representative at Hogwarts.The Ministry fears that Dumbledore is planning to build up an army and overthrow the Ministry,so they refuse to teach any real magic at Hogwarts.Due to this Harry,Ron,and Hermione create their own secret class full of many other students taught by Harry to teach them Defense Against the Dark Arts.All of these events eventually build up to a big showdown against Voldermort and the Death Eaters in the Ministry of Magic.The first thing I immediately noticed about this film is how much darker in tone than the previous films it is(even darker than Prisoner of Azkaban).As usual the production values are all top notch,cinematography,production design,and special effects are still top notch and at certain times steal the show.This time around the franchise has changed tremendously with almost a completely new creative staff behind it.First is the wonderful music by the new composer Nicholas Hooper,bringing back a great whimsical feel to the music that Goblet of Fire seemed to lack(still this isn't as great as William's scores,but is a welcome substitute).Another new member to the crew is a new screenwriter in Michael Goldenberg(Steve Kloves having left to take a break from Potter).Goldenberg has perfectly adapted the longest Potter book into a 2 hour and 15 minute film that seems to flow better than almost any other Potter film.The greatest thing about the script was how close it stuck to the book,majority of the film followed the book by verbatim,hitting every single major plot point in the book with precise accuracy.The greatest new addition though is director David Yates,who has only ever done one other theatrical feature before.Yates perfectly captures the spirit of the book generating quite possibly the greatest performances by these young actors so far,which brings me to the acting.The acting as usual is one of the major highlights of the Potter film.All of the veteran British actors deliver picture perfect performances as always(in particular Gary Oldman).The only thing is the adults in the cast are getting less and less screen time each film.What is really impressive though is how much the younger actors have evolved since the previous installment,especially Daniel Radcliffe,who is proving to me that he could become one of the greatest actors of our generation.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film rich with character development,emotion,and heart.Although there aren't quite as many laughs in this film as there were in previous installments there still are enough to tide you over.Another huge plus to the film is the climax in the Ministry of Magic giving some of the best action in any Potter film,it was amazing and was great eye candy.All in all it is another great entry into the Potter franchise with way more character development than any other installment thus far,plus is way darker in tone(the darkest Potter so far),and way more emotion and heart as well.Although it has less action than Goblet,it is a way better film in my opinion.A superb film that is nearly perfect in every way and possibly gives Prisoner of Azkaban a run for its money as my favorite Potter film.Another Potter film with a Perfect: 10/10!!!!!!!!",10,2,6,11 July 2007
Singin' in the Rain," The Greatest Movie Musical of All-Time!
","Singin' in the Rain is a true classic that is by far the finest movie musical to ever be released.The story of Singin' in the Rain takes place back in the late 1920s, just a few years before the Great Depression. The story is set in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and follows Don Lockwood, a highly famous silent film actor. At this time in Hollywood movies have begun making the change to talking pictures, and just like everyone else Don is having to make the change to making pictures with sound; of course his career is put into jeopardy when everyone finally takes notice that Don's romantic co-star for years, Lina Lamont, has a voice that is like nails on a chalk board. Don is in real trouble, and in a move to try and save his career he comes up with the idea to turn his and Lina's next film into a musical, and Don's friend Cosmo Brown convinces Don to dub over Lina's voice with that of Don's girlfriend, Kathy Selden.Singin' in the Rain is just genuinely one of the most positive films in movie history, there is no way you can come away from this film without a smile on your face. The musical numbers are perfectly staged, ranging from the awe inspiring Broadway Melody to the title song Singin' in the Rain. Of course what keeps driving the film and allows it to transcend generations is the romance between Don and Kathy, which is one of the most heartwarming relationships I have ever seen in the history of film, but what truly allows the romance to come off so well is the terrific acting by Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, which brings to mind another strong point of the film, the acting. The acting is superb, ranging from the great Gene Kelly as Don, or the hilarious Donald O'Conner as Cosmo Brown, the cast is very well rounded and helps keep the film moving at a terrific pace and allows you to truly grow an attachment to these characters.This is just truly a terrific film, which is not just the best movie musical ever made, but just might possibly be one of the greatest romantic comedies as well.I give Singin' in the Rain a terrific 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,19 June 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Jim Carrey's Finest Performance of his Career!
","When one comes out of first viewing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it is almost hard to know what to truly think of it. The film takes you on such a bizarre, mind-bending adventure that the first impression is not the one in which really matters. Like many other films from this director, Michel Gondry, it is a film that tends to get better with age.The film's premise is one of the most original I think ever used within a film. The thought that someone could erase specific memories from your mind is at times something any human wishes they could have done. Who wouldn't want to forget a traumatic experience or bad relationship? Still what this film does is make you think about life, love, and memories in a way in which no other film in history has ever made you think.The film was superbly directed by Michel Gondry, who also co-wrote this Oscar winning screenplay with ace screenwriter Charlie Kauffman. I truly believe that this is both filmmakers best works, but the film truly shines thanks to its cast, in particular Jim Carrey, who seems to be playing the only straight man in a comedic story. It is bar none his best dramatic performance to date, and any fan of his work should check this film out.Overall Eternal Sunshine is a totally unique experience that even after a few viewings I still don't know what to truly think of it, but time will tell where this film truly stands.I give Eternal Sunshine a 10 out of 10!",10,1,2,11 March 2009
Elysium," Far From Fun
","Writer/director Neil Blomkamp's Elysium is much like his prior feature, District 9, a message movie that takes itself too darn seriously and never has much fun.The title of the film refers to a space station orbiting Earth, called Elysium. In the future, the rich have left Earth to live on Elysium, while the rest live in poverty and squalor on Earth, that's where we find Matt Damon's Max. Max is given only five days to live, but they can miraculously cure him if he can get to Elysium, but of course the 'border patrol' of Elysium don't want any illegal immigrants on their space station and will fight him at all costs. Sound heavy handed? That's because it is. The thing is, nothing is wrong with a message movie, but when the film is zero fun, that's when I have a problem with it.The thing with Elysium is that none of the characters are really that likable. There is no real sense of hope, warmth, or just the goodness of humanity. The film's just all doom and gloom while trying to hammer home Blomkamp's personal beliefs. The thing is, this could have been a five times better film had Blomkamp made the characters we're supposed to care about enjoyable to spend time with. Would it have killed for Matt Damon to of cracked a joke once in a while, or behaved in any way truly heroic? Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, this is a $100 million Summer popcorn extravaganza, and I don't wanna feel depressed when I leave a movie where I kind of just wanted entertainment with a little bit of substance, rather than substance with no entertainment.While Elysium manages to skate by with enough action and dazzling imagery to not be a complete waste of nearly two hours, if you've seen the trailers you have seen the best of what this movie has to offer.I give Elysium a 6 out of 10!",6,8,17,9 August 2013
Taken," A Surprisingly Good Time!
","Liam Neeson stars in this new actioner about an ex-CIA agent, played by Neeson. While on a trip to Paris, Neeson's daughter has been kidnapped. Neeson of course takes matters into his own hands and decides to hunt down the kidnappers himself.The film was an enjoyable experience. It was well written and directed for the most part, as well the acting was good overall. Still, the one man that made this movie was Liam Neeson. His presence elevates this film from a passable action romp, to a fun, must-see entertainment picture.Overall Taken was an enjoyable experience. It was fun and entertaining, with terrific action, and made you want to stand up and cheer for the hero. Even if this film is simply pure escapism, it is worth seeing.I give Taken an entertaining 7 out of 10!",7,0,2,31 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Blockbuster-ified Fairy Tale
","I adore fairy tales. Fantastical stories that take you to other worlds and have no rhyme or reason, they simply are and exist, without any complex explanation. Of course, now there are blockbuster-ified fairy tales. If that's what you want, then director Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is for you.This is not your ordinary Alice in Wonderland, it's actually a vague sequel to the original story, but rather than being an adaptation of the legitimate sequel penned by Lewis Carroll (Through the Looking Glass), it is an odd jumble of a story that seems as if it was dreamed up in a board room. Alice has been to Wonderland before, but cannot remember it. When she is 19 and faced with the horrible decision as to whether or not to marry her horrible suitor, Alice falls down the rabbit hole once more, rediscovers Wonderland, and learns that she is the only one who can usurp the Red Queen by slaying her all powerful dragon in a Lord of the Rings-esquire climax.It isn't fair to say Alice in Wonderland is a bad film, just cliché where it could have been so much more. One would think the marriage of bizarre director Tim Burton with the Lewis Carroll classic would be a perfect pairing, but the film was bogged down into the realm of cliché action/adventure. The film kind of plays out like a Lord of the Rings light. We must get this ancient sword, take it to the White Queen, and then Alice must challenge the Red Queen's dragon and slay it to save Wonderland. Am I the only one who finds something wrong with this? Alice in Wonderland is a fantasy, and not an action/adventure epic, but more of a fantasy that is more about the characters and not the epic backdrop. Speaking of fantasy, time was never taken to drink in the fantastical, to truly experience Wonderland, we would just hop on over to the next piece of the Hollywood puzzle. Still, there is a good amount to enjoy in the film.Unlike most Tim Burton films, this isn't a macabre film that is simply macabre for no other reason than to be macabre. It is actually a kid-friendly film, and for Burton, is not weird at all, it is just true to the spirit of Lewis Carroll's story. The film is strikingly the most commercial friendly Burton film since the original Batman in 1989, and even though I was disappointed that the film was more of a big blockbuster than a straight up fantasy (like the books), the action/adventure elements were played well. While it was all a touch cliché, the dueling the dragon and the big epic battle at the end, was at least entertaining, even if it didn't feel like Alice in Wonderland. Not to mention, the characters are exceedingly charming. Johnny Depp is fascinating as the Mad Hatter, as well, Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice, shines and is definitely a star in the making.I think my greatest disappointment came with this film in seeing that the cast was all pitch perfect and the design of Wonderland was fantastic, not to mention a great many moments within the film showed promise of being one of those unforgettable movie moments, but none of that ever came to fruition and was just bogged down by the mechanics of the studio system. Really, the film is entertaining enough to watch, but repeat viewings really aren't desired, and by this film's favoring of cliché Hollywood blockbuster story over originality and straight up fantasy, it keeps the film from being something more memorable down the road.I give Alice in Wonderland a 6 out of 10!",6,1,6,5 March 2010
Avatar," An Epic Piece of Cinema
","There are films, and then there are movies. I am not going to be technical here in my definitions, I'm just going to speak from how I feel the difference is between the two words. A film is a piece of work that might be artistically engaging, but is just meh, whereas a movie is all that and a bag of chips. A movie is something that sweeps you away into its world and keeps you riveted to your seat till the credits roll. James Cameron's Avatar is a movie in the best sense of the word.Avatar has been in production for nearly fourteen years, and it shows in the world in which James Cameron has created. The world is Pandora, an alien moon covered in lush rainforests inhabited by wild alien creatures of astounding design, and an indigenous race of 10 ft. tall cat people called the Nav'i, who have had their own language created specifically for this movie. Humans have come to Pandora to mine a precious resource that is unique to the planet, but in order to do so they must relocate the Nav'i, which is almost impossible, so the humans have instituted the avatar program. The avatar program is where human scientists mix the DNA of a human with that of a Nav'i in a test tube, resulting in an organically grown humanoid that a human can link their mind into Matrix-style. All of this is unfurled upon the audience within the first thirty minutes or so, and while it all seems a touch too explanatory, it is necessary information needed for the rest of the movie to work.The hero of this story is Jake Sully (likably played by Aussie, Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine who comes to Pandora after his identical twin brother's death to fill his brother's slot in the avatar program. While in his avatar, Jake can run and walk unlike he can as a human. Eventually Jake meets Neytiri, a Nav'i princess (portrayed by Zoe Saldana, who completely disappears into the role). Jake and Neytiri fall in love and Jake begins to embark upon an ordeal to get inducted into Nav'i civilization. All the while, the war-mongering human corporation behind the whole shindig is chomping at the bit to eradicate the Nav'i from the face of the planet in order to mine. This conflict results in Jake having to choose sides between the humans he hails from, and his newfound home with the Nav'i.The story has traces of so many different movies found within. It's ecological message can make you want to compare it to the work of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, where as it's sci-fi/fantasy story of a man crossing over to fight for an alien race can make one think of The Planet of the Apes, not to mention the influences found from our own country's Native American history. Of course, to me Avatar is a wholly original experience. James Cameron should be applauded for attempting something that isn't based upon a book, comic book, or video game. In a way, Avatar is far more thought out and better executed than many movies that are already part of pre-existing properties. What Cameron did here was tell a story that blurs the lines between science fiction and fantasy, much in the way that he blurs the realities between Jake's two worlds.Avatar is many different things, it has romance, action, adventure, and drama. The film has moments of sheer wonderment, and moments that make your heart ache or wanna punch the bad-guy Col. Quaritch, played to perfection by Stephen Lang. That is why Avatar is such a good time at the cinema, because of these moments. Cameron actually took the time within the film to detail the world, to give you a sense of its scope and its scale, and it all adds up to make Avatar a rollicking success.When all is said and done, Avatar is a special time at the cinema. It's one of those movies that has to be experienced again in order to fully drink it all in, but even after one viewing, the film is very much appreciated. Thanks, James Cameron.I give Avatar a 10 out of 10!",10,4,9,18 December 2009
Invictus," An Uplifiting Piece of Cinema
","I'll be honest, I didn't really know who Nelson Mandella was before this film came out, but when I saw Invictus, I saw the story of a man that is unlike any other in modern history.The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, refuses to be your typical biopic, and that is where it is most charming. Rather than giving you the typical play-by-play analysis of Mandella's life, like pretty much every single biopic ever made, Eastwood simply took a small slice of Mandella's long and illustrious career, and put it to the big screen.The film picks up right when Mandella is elected President of South Africa. The film essentially follows his first year or two in office as he rallies together with the Captain of the South African Rugby team to try and unite the country, which is split between black and white, by winning the Rugby World Cup. But how can the Rugby team win, when they're utterly horrendous? That is all one needs to know to see Invictus, and if you have any knowledge of modern history (which unfortunately mine is very limited), then you probably know what is going to happen, but it's the journey there that makes Invictus worth watching.Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham should be applauded for giving the audience a full summation of who Mandella is and what he's like, all without doing this long and boring backstory, they just jump straight into the meat of the story and capture the audience from the very beginning. Though, this film isn't just a biopic, it's a sports film as well.Eastwood and Peckham have managed to craft a sports film unlike any other I think I've ever seen, tossing aside all of the typical sports movie conventions. They do not overplay any of the rugby matches, they simply show them as if you were a player running on the field along with the two opposing teams, which in the end is more naturalistic, but I can't help but feel it keeps the film from reaching the emotional heights of some other sports films. Plus, it's the first film I've ever seen to feature rugby, and I just wonder, does anyone in America truly understand this sport?With all that said, the film features terrific performances from all the stars. Matt Damon shines as the Captain of the South African Rugby team. Damon disappears into this role, and while I don't know if it has enough meat to garner him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod, he should not be forgotten. Speaking of Oscars, Morgan Freeman is the heart-and-soul of this film as Nelson Mandella. Freeman is, in my opinion, a shoe- in for Best Actor, he simply disappears into this role and he comes across as confident, wise, and charming all at the same time.At the end of Invictus, you leave feeling satisfied and uplifted, but the only thing this movie lacked was that big emotional moment of catharsis. Perhaps I'm too sentimental to enjoy a movie that denies the audience that big, weeper moment? Even without it, Invictus shines as a beautiful piece of filmmaking, being an entertaining film that defies convention and manages to uplift the soul while at it.I give Invictus an 8 out of 10!",8,1,3,12 December 2009
Super 8," A Super 7 out of 10!
","Small town America, the most unassuming place in the entire world for anything amazing or spectacular to happen, and yet it does in 1979 Lilian, Ohio. Super 8 is a fond throwback to the time that the filmmaker, J.J. Abrams, grew up in. A time running around with your friends making home movies, just when you started liking girls, and still at a time when you believed in the mysteries around us all.Joe is our hero, a 12-year-old boy whose mother recently died. His father, a police deputy, has no idea how to relate to his son. Joe wants to help his best friend Charles finish his zombie movie, and it doesn't hurt that his crush, Alice, is the lead actress. Upon sneaking out one night to film a pivotal scene in Charles's movie, this lovable gang of pre-teens witness a train crash carrying a peculiar cargo, leading to the U.S. military's arrival in Lilian, along with a monster that starts wreaking havoc across the town.Super 8 is a movie that wears its heart on its sleeve, and it is the better for it. So many monster movies fall in the B-movie tropes of forsaking any sort of character for the monster, and Super 8 is the other way around. In a way, this movie could have been made, and possibly have been better had it not been so focused on constantly trying to give us the monster thrills to make this a Summer blockbuster. The relationship between Joe and Alice develops nicely, and is just plain cute and authentic, with newcomer Joel Courtney and the other Fanning, Elle Fanning obviously having some sort of chemistry. The movie often stumbles when it tries to cut away from our young heroes, and focus on the adult perspective which is where majority of the exposition to the monster portion of the movie takes place, following Joe's dad as he tries to understand what is truly going on in Lilian.J.J. Abrams' screenplay is exceedingly well written, with his dialogue mirroring almost any pre-teen boy or girl, and the characters seem to represent at least someone you knew at that age of innocence. Whether you were the quiet Joe, or the artistic and bossy Charles, or the pyromaniac Cary (who needs a whole bunch of Ritalin), these characters take the viewer back to their own Middle School days.As pure entertainment, Super 8 excels, as a monster movie, it can stand proudly alongside many of the 1950s classics, but it lacked that special something that could have made it something more than a monster movie. That something was in there, but the monster overshadowed it. While the monster is incredibly cool, each time I saw it I just wanted to get back to Joe and see what was happening with him, Charles, and their friends making their movie, which is where the true heart of the story lies, and ultimately only three-fifths of the story takes place. Though it's easy to overlook when you have David Gallagher from 7th Heaven stealing the show as the pot dealer working at the local film developer.I give Super 8 a 7 out of 10!",7,1,5,11 June 2011
Up," Get Ready for Adventure!
","Up is another piece of true artistry from Pixar. It's the story of an old man named Carl, who has become a grumpy old man after the death of his wife. When he is threatened with the possibility of being put into a retirement home, Carl attaches hundreds of balloons to his house and the house takes flight into the sky. Carl begins to steer the house towards his and his wife's childhood dream, Paradise Falls in South America, where he plans to live out the rest of his life.Up truly is an excellent piece of film-making; it resonates more so than just about any other film in the Pixar catalogue. Here director Pete Docter has tailored a film that will both make the audience laugh, and cry. Though the film finds its strength in its themes. With this film Pixar has dared to deal with some very heavy themes, such as growing old and one's childhood heroes not always being what we want them to be. The themes are expertly handled by Docter, never feeling heavy-handed, but it is Docter's amazing ability to let the emotion of a scene to play out is what makes this film a true stand out above many other recent animated films. Now this should not fool one into thinking that Up is not a great film for the children as well, because it is.Up is first and foremost an amazing adventure film. It's action packed, filled to the brim with pulse pounding action sequence after another. Another one of Up's strong suits is its comedy. It is quite possibly the funniest film Pixar has ever made, a large part to due with the wonderful cast of characters within this film. You grow to love Carl Frederickson and the rag-tag crew that follows him. Of course what makes Up a film for the ages is its sheer imagination. No other film in recent memory has sweeped me away into its world quite as well as Up has. The film's world is unique, endlessly filled with original idea after original idea. Who would have ever thought of a house flying through the air, or making a 78 year old man the hero of an adventure story? The guys at Pixar did and it paid off big-time.Once it is all said and done Up is one of the finer films of the year, and definitely stands amongst Pixar's best (but is there really a worst). While it is sold as a children's film, many adults may find themselves enjoying this film more than their kids, thanks to its often serious subject matter. Though children will love the films flat-out hilarity and its high octane adventure. Up is a true masterpiece.I give Up a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,2,5,31 May 2009
Departures," Beautiful and Emotional
","Death might just be the most sensitive subject to handle in the world of cinema. It's always riddled with emotion. If mishandled it can be disastrous, but if handled with a daft hand, the end result can be beautiful.The Japanese film, Departures, is a film about death, atonement, and an appreciation of certain things that others find dishonorable. The film follows Daigo, a cellist for the Tokyo Philharmonic. When the orchestra is disbanded, Daigo and his wife move back to his hometown, where Daigo gets a job working as an encoffiner (people who prepare dead bodies for funerals). In Japan being an encoffiner is seen as a dishonorable profession, and Diago must come to grips with his change in fortune while also learning about the beauty of death.Departures is an intriguing film, beautiful and highly emotional. To say that this is a moving film would not be doing it enough justice. The film is a fascinating piece of art. Director, Yojiro Takita directs the film much like Daigo plays the cello, with passion and intensity, often utilizing swelling crescendos and moments of silence to create genuine emotion. It is never manipulative, but simply beautiful.The film is full of brilliant performances, in particular Masahiro Motoki as Daigo. Motoki delivers a performance that draws the viewer into the film. He takes you directly into the emotional state of the character, and he is a large part of the film's success. Of course it doesn't hurt when a film looks this beautiful and wondrous to behold. The cinematography is stunning. The film captures the beauty of the Japanese mountain ranges with so much clarity. To cap it all off, the musical score from legendary composer Joe Hisaishi is magnificent. Hisaishi's music always amazes me, but with Departures he has taken another step forward in his career.The real treat of this film is that it laces all of the drama and tragedy with humor and heart. It's a recipe that just leaves you as the audience feeling uplifted rather than depressed. It's a film where if any tears flow, they will not be tears of sadness, but rather tears of hope.After seeing this film I can definitely see how it deserved all of the accolades bestowed upon it (including the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar at the Academy Awards this past year). The film is brilliant. It is tough to find, but if you manage to find it online or playing somewhere near you, I strongly recommend seeing it and being moved by the power of this film.I give this film a beautiful 10 out of 10!",10,5,7,30 September 2009
Jack Reacher," Pulpy and Fun
","Jack Reacher is a pulp action movie in the vein of 1970's Steve McQueen. There are car chases, mysteries, and a slightly more gritty view of everyday life. In Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise portrays the titular character, and while I have never read the books, so I cannot say I agree or disagree with some critical statements that Cruise is far from 6' 5' and blonde, as a moviegoer I felt that this was Cruise's best action performance in years. I actually buy Cruise as Reacher, an uber-smart drifter who can give Sherlock Holmes a run for his money, with the physicality of a bar brawler. Reacher lives a life of freedom, no home, debt, or ties to society, he just travels from place-to-place, often using a fake identity wherever he goes to right the wrongs of justice. A former military police officer, Reacher may be the true supercop, he's almost superhuman, but there and again, that is what makes Jack Reacher pulp. If you have never enjoyed characters like James Bond or Sherlock Holmes, then you will not enjoy Jack Reacher, but if you do love the aforementioned characters, or at least similar characters, then you'll love this movie.Based on the ninth novel in Lee Childs' Jack Reacher series, One Shot, Jack Reacher comes to Pittsburgh to clear the name of a former military sniper who was set up for killing five people in cold blood, but Reacher, being the supercop that he is, manages to uncover a conspiracy behind the killings. The mystery behind the sniper and the conspiracy that unravels from that, are the best parts of Jack Reacher. The movie is suspenseful, almost Hitchcockian at times, in particular the sniping sequence, where we see the crosshairs, we know what will happen, and we're on the edge of our seat just waiting for him to fire.Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie proves he has great cinematic chops. In particular, I was in awe of the first ten minutes, where there is no dialogue of any importance, but all visuals moving the story forward. We learn everything we need to know about the case of the sniper in these shots, gathering all of the evidence and discovering who Reacher is all via the shot design and the exquisite editing. Though, even for the brilliant piece of pulp entertainment that Jack Reacher is, with the exception of the Jack Reacher character, the majority of the other character's in Jack Reacher are stock lawyers, DAs, gangsters, and corrupt detectives, in particular the villain portrayed creepily by filmmaker, Werner Herzog. The connection between Herzog's character and the shootings is never fully defined, leaving me confused when Jack Reacher and Herzog's men showdown in the final thirty minutes as to why I should care. And as for Rosamund Pike's character, Helen, why does she start the film dressed conservatively and suddenly at the midpoint of the movie, she's wearing such low cut clothing it's distracting? There was no discernible psychological change in her character as to why she'd change the way she dresses everyday? Perhaps this was a mistake in the costuming department, or maybe McQuarrie just succumbed to the urges of his inner twelve- year-old? I guess we'll never know.Still, even though Jack Reacher falls into some of the common trappings that these kind of pulp stories can, I really love the character of Jack Reacher, and enjoyed Tom Cruise in the part. Featuring one of the most pulse-pounding car chases in recent movie history, and some occasional humor that comes from Reacher's analytical mind often pointing out human flaws, Jack Reacher is a fun movie that any fan of these kinds of stories will enjoy, and I for one would love to see a sequel.I give Jack Reacher an 8 out of 10!",8,5,14,22 December 2012
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Style Over Substance
","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a film that is often at times fairly entertaining, and funny, but it seems to stop just there as a film that favors style over substance. This film is fairly basic fare as far as the plot goes for crime movies: four guys lose a bunch of money and have one week to get it back, and they decide to turn to thievery to obtain it.First off I will mention what I really liked about this film. First and foremost the cinematography steals the show, proving just how beautiful a film shot on 16 mm can look; as well the directing by Guy Ritchie is really well done, and he definitely gives the film a visual flare that is very reminiscent of a young Martin Scorsese; then the music is really great throughout, the whole soundtrack consisting of great British rock; on top of all that the acting is really well done through out. All of the stuff mentioned above really helps lend this film to a style that is both pleasing to the senses and often entertaining, and you might wonder where I found a problem with the film, and it is the story. The story seemed like a good, entertaining concept, but it never fully met its potential. The story just got bogged down by way too many characters and plot twists, there were just way too many. Now the screenplay had some truly terrific dialogue and some funny scenes written in, but majority of the comedy had nothing to do with the overall story. Then to cap all of that off, the film ran on for at least a good 15-20 minutes longer than it probably should have.Overall it is a film that is only worth watching for its well done style, but for no other real reason. Now if you love cinematography it is at least a definite rental, but if you don't, you should definitely skip it because you will most likely find the story too overstuffed to enjoy. It just seemed like it was trying too hard to be Pulp Fiction, but it failed.I give Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a 4 out of 10!",4,5,9,17 June 2008
Les Misérables," A So-So Adaptation
","It has taken a long time, but Broadway sensation, Les Miserables, finally makes it to the silver screen with this cinematic adaptation, courtesy of director Tom Hooper. This musical set during the French Revolution, follows Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), from prison to finding religion while trying to evade French officer, Javert, who is after Valjean for skipping his parole board.The strength of the film is in the performances of Hugh Jackman as Valjean and Anne Hathaway as prostitute, Fantine, who is shown kindness by Valjean on her deathbed, as she names him her daughter's guardian. There is an emotional authenticity to their performances, largely because the actors are freed and are able to act in the moment thanks to director Tom Hooper choosing to film all of the music live when they shot, rather than per-recording the tracks in the studio.While Les Mis does hit all of the emotional beats, sending shivers down your spine during the beautiful songs, the plot feels fairly disjointed and is resoundingly flat when they're not singing one of the showstoppers. For instance, only when the characters Marius and Cosette are singing a duet do I feel emotion, but between memorable songs, the plot takes over and is full of gaping plot holes. Am I supposed to believe these two who have only met once when they are singing about how they can no longer go on without the other? Not to mention, the film's editing is often chaotic, causing confusion as to the spatial relationship in scenes with multiple characters, and the shot design never fully takes advantage of the grandeur of the tale, save for that beautiful opening shot.To put it mildly, Les Miserables is an emotionally potent disappointment, that only has moments that never connect into a cohesive whole worthy of the beauty of the songs. I give Les Miserables a 6 out of 10!",6,18,33,31 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pure movie magic!!! (No pun intended!)
","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books,I have been reading it since the first book was first released,and ever since I read it I loved Harry Potter.When I first heard about the film adaptation of the first book I was a little scared,but I must say it surpassed my expectations.The story of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone begins when the title character,Harry(Daniel Radcliffe),is left on the steps of his aunt and uncle's house as a baby after his parents were brutally murdered by the dark wizard Voldermort.We rejoin with Harry 10 years later to find him mistreated by his aunt and uncle who love their own son and despise Harry.Suddenly these weird events keep on happening and they all seem to be related to Harry.When on the day of his 11th birthday a half-giant named Hagrid takes Harry away from his aunt and uncle and Harry's told he is a wizard and that he is enrolled to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Once at school Harry makes friends,plays a sport on a broomstick,goes on an adventure that could save all wizard kind,and discovers home.I must say this was one of the best film's I've seen in a while.With some of the most amazing cinematography,special effects,and production design I've seen in years and it definitely creates this magical atmosphere.The directing by Chris Columbus helps sell you this magical world,and in my opinion will go down in movie history as his greatest work.As usual John Williams has delivered an amazing score that just helps sell the magical feel of the film even more.Though what makes this film a true classic is the amazing acting everywhere from the young children in the cast to the experienced veterans like Richard Harris,Maggie Smith,and Alan Rickman,the cast is top notch and is picture perfect,each respective character looks as if they stepped out of the book.All in all this is an amazing film that does the book equal justice.This is pure movie magic at its finest.I strongly suggest you give this film a chance.This film has a lot of heart and emotion and also delivers an amazing message.A picture perfect: 10/10!!!!",10,0,1,8 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter Returns,Again!!!
","Going into Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I was very excited,seeing as how it was my favorite book,and plus all of the trailers leading up to the film looked to be very promising.Upon seeing the film I must say I enjoyed it, it was a tad different from the book in a few areas, but it was a solid entry in this already classic franchise.The film begins with Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends going to the Quidditch World Cup,where after the match the Death Eaters(Voldermort's followers) arrive and attack all that were at the match.During the mass panic and confusion Harry finds himself knocked out to only awaken later to find the campsite empty and destroyed,but he sees a man fire the Dark Mark(Voldermort's sign) into the sky.Shortly thereafter Harry regroups with his friends and they return to school to learn that this year Hogwarts will play host to the Triwizard Tournament,a competition between two other wizarding schools where all students wishing to compete will enter their names into the Goblet of Fire,and those chosen must face three very deadly tasks,the only catch is you must be 17 years of age or older.Naturally the three champions are selected,but one more name pops out after those three and it is 14 year old Harry(who didn't put his name in the goblet).Now Harry must compete in this deadly tournament where he must face a deadly fire-breathing dragon,dive into the depths of the Black Lake,and journey through an endless maze.In the midst of these tasks Harry must rekindle his friendship with Ron(Rupert Grint),discover who put his name in the goblet,and he has to tackle his most challenging task to date:girls,all of this leads up to the return of Lord Voldermort.As usual the film excelled in practically all areas. The cinematography and production design were just as great and stunning as in previous films in the series,as well the score is quite good, not as memorable as the John Williams scores from the first three films, but still good and performs the job that a film score is supposed to perform.They also changed directors once more,the new guy Mike Newell does a very good job with his source material being able to maintain much of the look and tone of the first three,and when working in a franchise that is a pretty big deal.The two show stealer's though this time around is the acting,great performances all around,and the special effects, which are just downright superb.As I mentioned earlier our teens are now discovering members of the opposite sex,and these scenes in particular are just downright hilarious and gives any teen comedy a run for its money.Plus the better special effects go hand-in-hand with the great action this film has to offer,being quite possibly the most action packed Potter film to date.As well the emotional climax at the end of the film is very sad and can even possibly make you shed a tear leading to the first sad ending to a Harry Potter film.All in all it is another great entry in the Harry Potter series. There are tons of laughs to be had,more action,and just as much emotion as the first three to make this one a very satisfying addition to the Potter franchise.An entertaining: 10/10!!!!",10,0,1,8 July 2007
Thor," Not a Total Knock Out of the Park
","The God of Thunder storms into theaters, starting off the 2011 Summer with some action, but not very much substance. In Thor, up and coming star, Chris Hemsworth portrays the title character as an arrogant young man, who still has much to learn before he can become king of Asgard (the realm of the Gods, where his father Odin, resides over the throne). When Thor decides to fight the evil Frost Giants, against his father's wishes, Thor is banished to Earth, and he must embark upon a quest to reclaim his mystical hammer in order to return to Asgard and stop his evil brother, Loki, who manipulated all of the events so that he could take Thor's place and become the next king of Asgard.Hemsworth is charming in the role, and really shines in the Earthbound sequences when he plays everything straight while still acting as if he is a God amongst Men, even though he is just flesh-and-blood. However, Thor lacks any real substance. The characters are never given time to fully develop, and it is partly because the movie is constantly switching back and forth between Earth, and what is happening on Asgard.We spend the first thirty minutes in Asgard, then Thor spends about thirty minutes on Earth with Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman), and then about thirty minutes dealing with S.H.I.E.L.D., then he returns to Asgard for the finale to fight with Loki. The movie just had too many irons in the fire for any single character to be developed, so when director Kenneth Branagh tries to cash in and show a romance between Foster and Thor, it just does not ring true, seeing as how Thor acted like a psycho for most of the time they were together, which was ultimately just one Earth day! Not enough time to develop a star-crossed romance.Regardless, the actors do their best and give it their all. Anthony Hopkins adds a sheen of sophistication as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston knocks Loki out of the park (even if his character is never given the time to develop fully, as it should). As well, the movie is full of Marvel Easter Eggs, such as the Cosmic Cube, and an early appearance of Hawkeye in an action sequence near the middle of the movie. Speaking of which, the action is extremely well done, and definitely scratches that itch that only a Summer movie can, but what previous Summers have proved, is that a Summer movie nowadays cannot rely on action alone and must also have a fantastic story to go along with it, and Thor often slips in that area.It feels like a sculpture that has rough edges and still needs to be smoothed out. The story does not flow as freely as it should, with myself wondering if the story would have been better served if the entirety of the film had taken place on Earth and save Asgard for a sequel, or perhaps simply save Asgard for the finale, rather than jumping back and forth as they do. The film lacks character development and relationship development, but it manages to still tell a story that makes sense, though it doesn't necessarily feel like a smooth ride.I give Thor a 6 out of 10!",6,0,2,7 May 2011
The Fountain," Darren Aronofsky's best film to date!
","I remember seeing the previews for this movie in theaters, and saying I want to see that, but when the film came out I completely forgot about it. Then the other day I saw it laying on a store shelf at my local DVD store, and I decided to pick it up. Now Darren Aronofsky is in my opinion one of the finest filmmakers out there right now. His works sport unique concepts filled with endless imagination, that you never really find in American films nowadays. Aronofsky got his start doing low budget Indy films; and finally with the Fountain, Aronofsky has the money to just let his imagination run free, and he delivers his best film to date.The story of the Fountain is about one man's search for immortality over the course of a thousand years, resulting in a story that is both about the meaning of life and death.As mentioned the film, which was both written and directed by Aronofsky, is simply amazing. The direction is crisp, the cinematography is a wonder to behold, the score is magnificent sound to go along with the visual splendor, and the acting from this stellar cast is terrific, in particular the performance from Hugh Jackman.The Fountain is simply one of the best films I have seen in a long time, it is heartbreaking and emotional, while also being terrific eye candy; and just like any other film from Darren Aronofsky, you must be willing to go into unexplored territory. If you are wanting a safe movie that follows all of the typical guidelines for drama films, then this isn't for you; but if you want a movie that takes you places dramatically that no other movie has ever dared to go, then you will love the Fountain.Aronofsky has outdone himself here with a true classic for the ages.I give the Fountain a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,2,4,17 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry is back!!!!
","I loved the first Harry Potter film,and was extremely excited for its sequel hoping it could quite possibly be better than the original. I must say that I was not at all disappointed upon first viewing the Chamber of Secrets, and might even venture to say that it is better than the first. In terms of truthfulness to the book Chamber of Secrets excels, and when transferred to film it has lost none of the magic that made its book counterpart a triumph.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins when Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) meets a house-elf named Dobby who claims Harry must not return to Hogwarts this upcoming school year because bad things are supposed to happen.Of course Harry refuses to listen,and Dobby continuously tries to foil Harry from getting to school.Eventually Harry arrives to school in style.Once at school Harry meets the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,Gilderoy Lockhart(played superbly by Kenneth Brannagh),discovers he is a parselmouth(can speak snake language),and learns of a secret Chamber in the school that holds a monster that is petrifying many of the muggle borns in the school and naturally Harry and his friends try to unravel the mystery that is the Chameber of Secrets before the school is closed.I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this film.All of the cinematography,special effects,and production design is once again top-notch and perfectly creates this fantasy world.Cris Columbus steps back into the director's chair once more and once more did a very respectable job.Yet again John Williams score steals the show,its magical sound sells every single scene.The acting was once more the definite highlight of the film,bringing back old favorites and adding new ones.This film is superb entertainment and is yet another modern day classic.With more action,more laughs,and just as much heart as the original this one is a definite must see.Even if you aren't a Potter fan you might find something to enjoy in this film.It is one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better than its predecessor.Another perfect: 10/10!!!!!!",10,0,2,8 July 2007
The Holiday," A hit-and-miss romantic comedy!
","The Holiday is the story of two women: Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who lives in L.A.; and Iris (Kate Winslet), who lives in Surrey, England. The two are both having guy troubles and decide that for their Christmas holidays they'll take a vacation far away. The two get on a web site that allows you to exchange homes with another for however long you like, Amanda and Iris meet on the web site's chat room and decide to switch lives with one another. Once in their new locations the two women find love and finally learn how to start living life.I must say that the film overall is really quite good, but only small portions are great and some are just flat-out boring. I think this problem arose in the fact that the story essentially follows two completely different story lines, and one story line is really fun and entertaining, and the other is a lot weaker and is very unforgettable. Throughout majority of the film I found myself enjoying Kate Winslet's side of the film more than Cameron Diaz's side, and it all really came down to their separate story lines. Kate Winslet's story of befriending an old screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood and finding a love interest in Jack Black was more entertaining. Now don't get me wrong, the other story line has some good things about it, in particular Jude Law being Cameron Diaz's love interest, and Jude Law's children in the film are fairly cute and funny, but this story line ended up being very cheesy to me and a little too melodramatic as well. Overall the story was very hit-and-miss for me, but overall the film is very enjoyable.The film is well written and well directed by Nancy Meyers, and the acting is really good, in particular Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black, and Eli Wallach (who plays the old screenwriter). All of the other production values are good as well, it was definitely a well made film, if only it could have fixed its few problems within the story and maybe found a way to of beefed up the weaker side of the story the film would have been even more enjoyable, but because of that it is really only a decent film that is fun to watch every now and then.A good 8 out of 10!",8,1,2,29 February 2008
Zero Dark Thirty," Amazingly Lived Up to the Critical Hype
","Zero Dark Thirty is the story of how the CIA found Osama Bin Laden, and yes it is one of the better films made in 2012. The film follows a young CIA analyst named Maya, portrayed with fierce determination by Jessica Chastain. Maya is the only analyst who chases a lead that most of her superiors feel will go nowhere, and it's her unwillingness to give up on that lead and not succumbing to her human emotions that allows her to uncover Bin Laden's hideout. How much of this film is true, we'll probably never know unless the government declassifies it someday, but as a film it works as a powerful, taut thriller and a modern history lesson. The film opens by smartly never showing any footage of 9/11, but just leaves the screen black for nearly two minutes, just playing overlapping phone calls and news reports from that horrific day. In this day and age of whiz-bang movie-making, that took guts on behalf of director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal. Then, there is the Seal Team 6 night raid on Bin Laden's compound. Bigelow makes it tense and eerie through the night vision point-of-view shots, but most importantly, it feels real, as the events play out in real-time and nothing is ever over-dramatized for Hollywood. However, even though Seal Team 6 performed the job, it was Maya and her intelligence that led to that moment. We are never given much backstory on Maya, all we know is that Maya is young, has only been in the CIA for 12 years, having been recruited straight out of high school, and that she is darn good at what she does. She does not have time for friends or relationships and for the past 10 years, Bin Laden was her life. She is dedicated. Even though she is affected by seeing a man tortured, she maintains a fiery exterior to get to the information she needs. Possibly the best moment for Chastain as Maya comes when she is sitting in the plane after Bin Laden has been killed, she's asked where she wants to go and she does not answer, just succumbing to tears. Her emotions finally take her over. At this moment, there is this look that Chastain has, of a person who does not truly know who they are and where to call home. It's the most powerful moment of the film, and easily a scene that will linger in many Oscar voter's memories.I give Zero Dark Thirty a 10 out of 10!",10,15,34,12 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Speed Review
","Steve Jobs is one of the most unique biopics ever produced. The film paints a picture of the enigmatic Apple computers co-founder by going backstage at three product launches in his illustrious career, where Jobs interacts with countless figures within his life to show us who this man was and how he evolved over time. The most fascinating thing about this film is that it makes you look at all of your Apple devices differently. You are able to see all of the brilliance of Steve Jobs on display, as well as all of his faults. Actor Michael Fassbender is amazing as Jobs, even though the two look nothing alike. While some may quibble about this little detail being historically inaccurate or whatever, no biopic is 100% perfect, but Steve Jobs is about as close as any can get. It is a film that requires you to think while also entertaining you with the energy on display in the script from Aaron Sorkin and the direction from Danny Boyle.I give Steve Jobs a 9 out of 10!",9,0,1,8 November 2015
Crazy Heart," Those With A Crazy Heart Do Well
","I'm not a big fan of country music. In my own family I'm known as the black sheep when it comes to the worlds of music, but with the film Crazy Heart, it doesn't matter whether you're a fan of country music or not, Crazy Heart is an extremely good film.Crazy Heart is the story of a washed up country singer named Bad Blake, whose best days are behind him. He used to be a top-selling country music artist, but now he has spiraled down due to his alcoholism and has been relegated to playing in small town bars and bowling alleys. But Bad Blake's time for redemption comes when he falls for a small town reporter half his age, who has a four-year-old son.The film was subtly directed by first time director Scott Cooper. While it isn't the most visually intriguing film I've ever seen, it is competently directed and filled with marvelous performance. Seriously, this film is really an actor's showcase.The film stars Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, and he gives a fascinating performance filled with charisma and charm. Even though Bad Blake is a sloppy mess, Bridges is just so likable at the end of the day, you can't dislike Bad Blake. Whilst you can't necessarily say it's his career's best (because he's done so many greats) he delivers a solid award's worthy performance and will win him his first Oscar.Bridge's gets support from Maggie Gyllenhaal, who portrays Bridge's love interest, the small town reporter. I will boldly say that this is her greatest performance of her entire career, it is so heartfelt, I wish it could win her an Oscar, but I don't think that will happen. Finally, rounding out the cast are two fun performances from Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall, both do a lot with their small roles. I just have one question, who knew Farrell and Bridges could sing this well?Now there is a ton of music in this film and the music really mirrors the narrative perfectly, T Bone Burnett and Ryan Bingham did fantastic work, in particular 'The Weary Kind' is a marvelous song. 'The Weary Kind' is the song that tells what the film is all about. The film is about one old man's downward journey into his own obscurity. He's not the man he used to be, and this film is about his finding his way back through some really tough tumbles down life's expressway.In the end the film has a pseudo-uplifitng ending, depending upon whether or not you want him to end up with the girl, but I personally found it a satisfying ending that actually made me happy. Bad Blake's tale is a common one for these types of older artists who have been eclipsed by the young guns, and it's all about Bad Blake finding his way back and learning how he can return to the world in which he cares for.I give Crazy Heart a 9 out of 10!",9,2,3,6 February 2010
Edge of Tomorrow," Spoiler Alert -- Tom Cruise Dies!
","Tom Cruise dies over and over again in the new sci-fi/action film, Edge of Tomorrow, having to relive the same day each time he dies. In the film, Earth has been invaded by aliens who can relive days, with Tom Cruise's character accidentally tapping into this power and trying to use it to end the war. It's a little complicated to wrap your head around at first, but the movie quickly catches you up to speed and before long you're playing by the filmmakers' rules. I'll go ahead and get to the point, this movie is fun. If you're looking for explosions, laughs, and some generally likable characters, you can't find another new movie out in theaters this weekend that will sate your appetite the same way this film does. With all of that said, the film doesn't give you more than a little taste of what could have been. I haven't read the manga this film is based off of, but from the very first frame of the film, there felt like there was something missing here. Sure, the story is coherent and engaging enough to warrant seeing, but I kept feeling like there was something special in this premise that still remains buried underneath the surface. I feel that the film often barrels forward with the narrative at the cost of the characters. Majority of the film is told from Tom Cruise's perspective, but every now and then we are told he's lived a scenario multiple times without actually seeing him living and learning from that particular scenario. It's not necessarily a plot hole, it just feels rushed and not as fulfilling as it would be if we saw these moments happen. It's this rapid fire narrative that makes it hard to invest fully in the relationship between Tom Cruise and his kick butt love interest, played by Emily Blunt. The moments where Cruise falls for her aren't often represented on screen and are just inferred as having happened, so we don't quite feel it.Ultimately, Edge of Tomorrow comes close at times to being something special, but always falls just short. In many ways, I think had the film taken more time developing the relationships while also basking a little bit more in the wonder of the futuristic technology, and taken more time to build up the suspense before action scenes, the film would have been stronger. I really don't say this all that often, but I honestly believe that had the movie been maybe thirty minutes longer, and done a few of the aforementioned things, it could have been a science fiction classic, but as it is, Edge of Tomorrow is merely a fun Summer movie. Even so, Edge of Tomorrow has enough explosions and enjoyable moments to keep you entertained. Bottom line, if you're wanting to just sit back and go on a roller coaster ride for two hours, this is the right film for you this weekend.I give Edge of Tomorrow a 7 out of 10!",7,1,3,8 June 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," A Disappointing Movie
","I am not really sure where to begin here. Hail, Caesar! was a movie I wanted to love, but just couldn't. The thought of not liking a Coen brothers comedy still horrifies me, but that's exactly the case here.Hail, Caesar! stars Josh Brolin as a Hollywood fixer for a fictional movie studio in the Fifties, and it is his job to privately resolve issues between stars, directors, and the media. This idea seems to be perfect fodder for the Coens to mine, but the movie just never really seems to click into place. George Clooney portrays a buffoonish movie star who is kidnapped by Communist screenwriters. Why? The movie never really makes that clear. Then there are all of the well produced, but overly long stretches showing the various movies in production at the studio, from a biblical epic to a Gene Kelly-type song-and-dance movie. I wanted to enjoy everything this movie was doing, but I never got why we were spending so much time with characters who literally only show up for one scene and then are done. The only real saving grace for this movie is the very funny performance from Alden Ehrenreich as a simple singing cowboy movie star who helps Brolin rescue Clooney. I personally would have watched a whole movie about Ehrenreich's character and had been more satisfied.At the end of the day, I still think there was a great movie idea in here somewhere, but Hail, Caesar! never quite finds it, nurtures it, and brings it to the forefront.I give Hail, Caesar! a 5 out of 10!",5,0,1,25 June 2016
Jaws," Quite Possibly the Best Monster Movie of All-time!
","Jaws is, and probably will always be, the film in which truly defines a blockbuster. Of course unlike many modern day blockbusters, Jaws had something more than just action and suspense; it was chock full of likable, three-dimensional characters, and it had this magical touch that could simply be explained if one only looks to the film's director, Steven Spielberg.The premise of Jaws is one that if you were simply told about as opposed to seeing it, you would probably laugh your head off. I mean how could you make a film about a gigantic great white shark preying on the inhabitants of a beachside town a serious and engaging movie? Well Mr. Spielberg knew how. First he made the smart decision to make all of the characters in the film three-dimensional, then he cast terrific actors to pull off the magnificent roles. Robert Shaw truly shines as Quint, but Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are no slouches either. Of course where Spielberg's true mastery comes through was in his decision to not show the shark until the movie was almost over. Yeah you'd see a fin here and a tail there, but the full shark was never exposed until the end. This made the film feel more tense and threatening, because lets face it, the mechanical shark looks pretty fake. Still, applying the classic Hitchcockian principal of the viewer is more afraid of what they don't see, Spielberg was able to craft a film that still stands tall as one of the best films of all-time.When one gets off the amusement park ride which is the film Jaws, you feel as if you just went on one of the most thrilling rides of your life. For this reason alone Jaws is one of my favorite films.I give Jaws a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,7,13,12 March 2009
The Wrestler," This is Mickey Rourke's Film!
","The Wrestler is a film about an aging professional wrestler who is having to come to grips with his own mortality. I saw it just the other night, and while I was blown away by certain aspects of it, others just left me a tad dissatisfied.The Wrestler is the latest film from visionary director Darren Arronofsky, but this time around Arronofsky has taken a far more simpler approach to directing and has shifted away from the visuals and rather towards the acting. While I was slightly disappointed in Arronofsky's direction, simply because he seems to be refusing who he truly is as a filmmaker in this film, he does manage to generate terrific performances from his actors; in particular Mickey Rourke's Oscar worthy performance as Randy 'the Ram' Robinson. While Arronofsky's direction left me with a little more to be desired, the script by Robert Siegel was superb, as well the 16 mm cinematography was beautifully utilized throughout.Overall the Wrestler was a good character study, but without Mickey Rourke this film would have been a forgettable experience. This film truly is Rourkes and no one else's. While I am a tad more critical of the direction mainly because I am such a big fan of Arronofsky's previous works, there is still no denying that the direction fit the story and its style, even if it was not as visually stimulating as an Arronofsky fan could have hoped. In the end the Wrestler was a film that I enjoyed, but the story's depressing nature and overall brutality keeps it from being a film that you will want to watch more than once.I give the Wrestler a good 7 out of 10!",7,0,0,15 February 2009
Dark Shadows," Please Mr. Burton, Do Something Good Again
","Number one rule if you're doing a remake, have a reason for doing it. Second rule of doing a remake, if you're going to change the style and tone of the series that you're remaking, then have a reason for doing it as well. Unfortunately for Tim Burton's remake of the 1960's cult classic vampire soap opera, Dark Shadows, he breaks both of these roles.In another collaboration with Burton, Johnny Depp portrays Barnabas Collins, a 1700's man who wronged an evil witch, and is now cursed to live eternity as a vampire. Where the movie falls apart is when Barnabas is unearthed in 1960's America, where he reunites with his modern day ancestors at their ancestral home in Maine. Seeing as how this happens about ten minutes into the movie, you can see my problem.Here's why Dark Shadows does not succeed. Unlike the 1960's TV show it's remaking, it's intentionally trying to be funny. The original show was campy, but it was because they did not have the money to pull off what they were trying to do, so it often came across as unintentionally funny. What this movie does, is it turns Barnabas' quest of trying to rebuild the family's shipping empire while having a showdown with the witch that cursed him, into a grand farce. It's a movie that's cracking jokes around every turn, not interested in delivering a fun supernatural adventure, but in trying to be something that the original never was. Now, would I be so negative if the movie actually was funny? Probably not, but the thing is, the movie isn't funny.Featuring countless jokes about 1960's counter culture, such as hippies, the jokes just aren't funny. Rather than being clever, the movie reverts to innuendos and humor we've seen countless times before. I seriously would have enjoyed this story so much more if it was just played straight, and let humor be evoked through the absurdity of seeing supernatural beings battle one another, rather than intentionally trying to create that wink-wink, nudge-nudge form of comedy. Honestly, the only ray of shining light is the hauntingly beautiful, and colorful lensing of the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel.I give Dark Shadows a 4 out of 10!",4,1,2,6 December 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Movie Review: 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'
","Did The Hobbit need to be turned into three movies? No. Does The Battle of the Five Armies feel like it's stretched thin? Yes. Does that mean it's a bad movie? No. What you get with The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is exactly what you expect, a big battle between five different armies, while wrapping up the final few chapters of The Hobbit book in a two plus hour movie. As far as the action goes, this is top notch action movie-making. By this point, you like all of the characters, and Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is so good, that you wish there weren't so many subplots going on that he gets a bit of the shaft (it is called The Hobbit afterall). Of course, the greatest thing that this movie does is that it never lets off the gas. It's always going somewhere and doesn't feel as if it's spinning its wheels. While that somewhere is probably another action scene that might have been better served for the eventual extended edition, if you're a fan of Middle Earth you wont care, and that's really all that matters at the end of the day. If you're a fan of these books and movies, you'll see this movie and you'll enjoy it. Is it the crown jewel of the franchise? No, as a matter of fact, from a filmmaking standpoint, it's probably the weakest film of the six Middle Earth movies, but the weakest film in this franchise is still better than the strongest film in most other franchises. There is a great thematic undercurrent about the destructive power of greed that runs throughout this movie, as all of these different forces are vying for the treasure in the Lonely Mountain, and it's when this theme is in play that many of the strongest scenes occur on an emotional level. It was really nice to see Peter Jackson work in a little something on the human side of things to keep this from feeling like a two hour brawl, but that's really what he does best. He finds the humanity in the largeness of his vision, and that's why he's such a great filmmaker. The only thing I feel like Jackson fumbles is the ending, by trying to tie everything back into The Lord of the Rings, rather than ending happily as the book does. The Battle of the Five Armies ends kind of mysteriously with suspicion about Bilbo's ring, and that kind of dampens the impact the ending could have had. While I know that this is a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the movie might have been better served as a movie had it not tried to foreshadow what's to come and just embraced the sentimental emotion of the farewells between Bilbo, the dwarfs, and Gandalf. That's just my personal feeling, and it's kind of a sour cherry on top of what was a pretty good hot fudge sundae at the movies.",8,3,7,20 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A great movie!
","Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the 3rd film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the final installment of the amazing Star Wars Saga! To start off this one was a major improvement over its predecessor, Attack of the Clones, but still there were a few problems in many of the same places that its predecessor had. First the acting, although very notably better than Episode II, still falls short of the pedigree in the others; and much of the dialogue is still pretty bad. Still minus the bad things it is a well made film and is very good. The story is a bit slow getting started, but once it gets moving it doesn't stop until the credits roll, non-stop action. One thing that should be noted is that this is probably the most action packed Star Wars film, and I must say that nearly all of the action is very engaging and exciting to watch(especially the films many lightsaber duels). The special effects as usual are top notch, and so is the production design(from the new planets, to costumes, and much more). Overall it's a great film, and the ending is a definite highlight for any Star Wars fan, it brings everything full circle.Rating: An 8 out of 10!",8,3,7,13 October 2007
Inception," Nolan pulls it off, but almost too mindbending for its own good!
","There is a scene in Inception, when Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Cobb, introduces Ellen Page's character, Ariadne, to the possibilities of dreams and the ability to change the architecture within that said dream. Ariadne literally bends the streets of Paris upside down, walking up walls, changing streets, and raising bridges. That scene is a marvelous introduction, and was so imaginative, feeling as if it laid seeds for the possibilities of the rest of the movie. I was just imaging the possibilities of dream creation and manipulation within action sequences, but this was a concept never explored beyond this one scene, and this sort of became a trend for the rest of the movie. Lots of promise and potential, but the elevator never quite reached the tenth and final floor.Like a labyrinth of the mind, Inception, manages to befuddle and clutter your brain to the point of confusion at times, as if you're getting lost in an insane maze, but thankfully no Minotaurs.Writer/Director Christopher Nolan's latest weaves a heist film about a team of subconscious extractors who venture into the dream states of their subjects, mostly corporate CEOs, to steal the secrets of their multi-billion dollar corporations. But the movie puts this concept on its head as the team of extracting characters try to attempt the opposite, called inception, or planting a thought into the heir to a large energy conglomerate, Charles Fischer's mind. They must venture deep into the human subconscious to do so, dodging the subject's attempts at booting out the foreign visitors, not to mention, the constant terror of being found by the ghost of Cobb's ex-wife who wants to sabotage the mission.Inception is a tough nut to crack. It is very easy to get lost within its labyrinth of complex twists-and-turns, and in many ways I felt as if the movie was a touch too convoluted, and that it nearly got lost in the architectural maze of its own creation. While Nolan manages to hold everything together with no gaping plot holes to mention, the movie still flies at a breakneck pace that does not allow the viewer to really drink in the environments or the wondrous cinematography, because it is such a dense story. The editing cuts before you can really get a look at a shot, and this makes the fantastical action sequences often not as amazing as they are. It's less grandeur and sort of claustrophobic in feel.While there are some quips with Inception, it is still a good movie. The action sequences are solid, while the only tour de force is the sequence with Joseph Gordon-Levitt fighting off baddies in a revolving hallway, this action bit alone is stellar enough to warrant the price of admission. Plus, Levitt did his own stunts! As well, the acting is very even, Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy being the true standouts. Their two characters, Ariadne (Leo's apprentice of sorts) and Fischer (the guy they're trying to implant the idea in), having the most complete arcs of the entire story. Filling it out, Leonardo DiCaprio manages to turn in a solid performance that by no means will advance his career any further, but does nothing to hurt it, and Marion Cottilard is extremely creepy as the ghost of Cobb's wife.As you can gather, Inception is jam-packed, a movie that I guess only the most complex minds can master, and I guess I'm not complex enough to love it, but I do like it a great deal. This is an original movie, and that gets this one a lot of points in my book, there not being many of those these days. Plus, the ambition is impeccable, I could never have dreamed up a ride such as this. While I feel more could have been done with it in letting us see more grandeur and overall imagination in the dream world sequences, it is an enjoyable ride, and I think this one's for Nolan, now time for the guy to give us some more of the Caped Crusader.I give Inception an 8 out of 10!",8,2,6,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," A Pure, Exhilarating Joy!
","Reinterpreting a classic character is always going to be met with mixed response. The only way to pull this off is to boldly pursue a new vision while retaining the recognizable core of the character, which is what Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes does so well.Robert Downey, Jr. is Sherlock Holmes, and he knocks it out of the park. The film deals with the supernatural Lord Blackwood, who is at the beginning of the film arrested by Sherlock whilst performing a human sacrifice. Blackwood is sentenced to death and hung, however the following day, Lord Blackwood rises from the grave and puts into motion a plan that will completely warp the fabric of life as we know it. Of course it is up to Sherlock Holmes to stop him, alongside his legendary sidekick, Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law.This Sherlock Holmes film is less of a mystery and more about the ride, which might disappoint a few fans of the famed detective, but it's what I enjoyed so much more about this adaptation than previous adaptations of this classic character. The film does have a mystery, but rather than giving the audience the hints and clues throughout the film to try and let us solve the mystery alongside Holmes, we literally see and hear Holmes's thoughts as they're happening and we go along with him as he solves the mystery. This really comes through in the scene where Holmes pummels a Big Guy whilst in an underground street fight.For me, Sherlock Holmes was very different than the trailers. The trailers paint it as a stupid amusement park ride made up of cheap thrills and explosions. While the movie does have some fun action sequences, this is not a correct portrait. In actuality, this film has had some thought behind the creation of the story. The script is filled with highly clever dialogue, and the witty banter between Holmes and Watson is hilarious, not to mention the chemistry between Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. Then the villain, Lord Blackwood, is the first badguy I've seen in a longtime that legitimately creeped me out. Blackwood is mysterious and evil, being given that all-evil moment that I am always looking for out of a villain when he makes a man spontaneously combust! The only weak link to this film is Rachel McAdams. She just doesn't really work in her role as Holmes's love interest, Irene Adler, although her character does set-up a potential sequel. Also, the action in the film is fairly generic, never having that memorable action sequence that would allow one to put this film alongside movies like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Overall, Sherlock Holmes is an extremely fun time at the movies. Robert Downey, Jr. is charming and lovable as the eccentric detective, and turning Sherlock into an action hero actually works extremely well. Sequels are definitely desired.I give Sherlock Holmes a 9 out of 10!",9,7,14,25 December 2009
Rango," Chameleons Need Friends Too!
","Rango is a movie clearly inspired by the works of others to create something that is a unique mash-up, and it actually works. The movie has fun with these various different styles of the Western, managing to never fall into spoof territory, but simply remain fun and entertaining. It does this through a blend of humor and sophistication that is rarely found in children's films. The movie seems to at times draw influence from films of the French New Wave or the Italian Neorealists, where it seems Rango is breaking the Fourth Wall and is communing with the audience, 'Who am I?' After all, a chameleon with an identity crisis (and no name to boot) is something that is a tad sad, and existential.Rango is a lonely critter, having no friends and no identity, spending all of his time in his cage creating stage plays with inanimate objects. But when this actor finds himself lost in the desert as a fascinating stranger in a small desert town called Dirt, he can fashion himself as a rough-and-tough, gunslinger named Rango, and be whatever the people want so he wont be alone. There is obviously a moral to this story, don't try to be what you aren't, just be you, and Johnny Depp's charismatic voice over work as Rango really makes this message ring true with the audience. There is something so lovable about how Depp plays Rango; he is funny, skittish, over-the-top in his mannerisms, and is essentially what makes this movie worth watching. No other character in the movie seems as alive as Rango, but there and again that is not a detriment to the other voice over performances, just high praise for Johnny Depp stealing the show.Even if Depp steals the show, director Gore Verbinski keeps the movie rolling with some slick action set pieces, including a marvelous sequence near the middle of the movie where Rango and his 'possum' (aka posse) are fighting off a swarm of badguys while being trying to escape with a covered wagon. While these things seem so cliché to the Western film, the way everything is mashed together makes it feel fresh. The town of Dirt is imaginative, with the fronts of buildings being things like juice boxes or whatever, and the filmmakers never stop playing with these various desert animals and the stereotypes and odd eccentricities that they all have to make them funny. For example, when Rango sheds skin when he first walks out into the desert sunlight, these little touches with the scale of the world and the attributes of these characters keep the perspective where it needs to be in order for the audience to suspend our disbelief.Of course, as much as Rango keeps things humorous with their existential studies and Western homages, the movie often dips into the bag of just plain old annoying bathroom humor at times, like fart or burp gags, just to try and get a cheap laugh from the child audience whenever things seem to be going a little slow. So what if the movie takes its time to develop its thoughts and emotions? That makes for a great movie, so don't ruin it with a fart joke! Even if that is tough to get over, did I mention the gorgeous, photo-realistic animation done by Industrial Light & Magic on their first ever animated flick? This is some of the most stunning animation I have ever seen, it is fluid, and the facial movements are spot on in relaying the emotion. Bravo to ILM!I give Rango an 8 out of 10!",8,0,2,10 March 2011
Prometheus," Please, Just Watch Alien Instead
","Certain ideas are interesting in theory, such as having Ridley Scott (director of the original Alien) return to direct an Alien-prequel, called Prometheus. Alas, certain ideas, such as this one, are already setting themselves up for disappointment.The fact of the matter isn't that Scott and company do not have a story filled with original ideas, it's that the story falls into cliché, horror/action territory, trying to pigeon-hole itself as a prequel to Alien, rather than being its own film. For example, the idea of aliens coming to Earth and creating humans, is an intriguing kind of sci-fi concept that hasn't been committed to celluloid before, however, once the explorers reach the mysterious planet that may harbor all the clues as to where we came from, the film sees fit to play all the same cards as the original Alien. An android with ulterior motives, a questionable mega corporation mogul, tons of crazed monsters running around killing, and a female scientist having to become a hero. The problem is, all of these things have been done, over and over again before, to much better results.There is a lifelessness to this film about discovering where life originated. It feels as if it's going through all of the motions, trying to put all of the pieces into place for the next installment, rather than innovating and being something truly original. If this film were not beholden to the Alien franchise, I believe Prometheus would not only be a different film, but possibly even a better film, but unfortunately it is what it is, and I just cannot recommend it.I give Prometheus a 3 out of 10!",3,5,7,7 December 2012
The Woman in Black," Smart and Genuinely Terrifying
","Nothing freaks me out more than a ghost story. There's something about the idea of something that you cannot see, that you cannot fight, that's more terrifying to me than any other type of horror story, and The Woman in Black is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. The film is brilliantly directed by James Watkins, with so much of the film's characters being revealed through cleverly designed shots, rather than verbal exposition. It tells the tale of a recently widowed London lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who travels to a small country village to settle the documentation of an old abandoned house in a foggy marsh that is unreachable during high tide, and is also haunted by a vengeful ghost who is causing the strange deaths of all children in the village. Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe, portrays Arthur Kipps in his first major, post-Potter role, and he is marvelous. At first he seems too young to be portraying a father, but it's how Radcliffe shows a breadth of emotions that one generally associates with someone beyond his years, that makes him believable in the role. In many ways, it's a one man show, and Radcliffe carries this film, with much of the film following him being terrorized in a house, and he is such a mesmerizing presence on screen, you're willing to go along on the journey. Where the film really stands out though, is that it just avoids all clichés of films like this. Not only is it well acted and well directed, it just genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat because it does not traipse into genre formula, and literally shocks and surprises you in the very end.I give The Woman in Black a 9 out of 10!",9,0,1,3 December 2012
X-Men: First Class," Forget the G-Men, these are the X-Men!
","Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr (a.k.a Professor X and Magneto, for those not in the know), meet and become friends, then tragedy corrupts their unique relationship when mankind refuses to accept them for what they are. As it is, there are always two sides to the same coin. Erik carries a Nazi coin the entire movie, a memento that helps him remember his mother's killer; a nice touch by way of screen storytelling, giving us viewers a visual cue to remember the character's emotional anguish of watching his mother gunned down before his eyes. However, the coin that Erik and Charles reside upon flips up into the air at the end of this film, but this is not about which side the coin lands, but how we get there.X-Men: First Class details the days before the X-Men, the days before Charles and Erik were known as Professor X and Magneto. These were the days that Charles was a silver spoon playboy, who is compassionate, but may be too cocky for his own good. Compare that to Erik, who grew up in a Nazi concentration camp to watch a mutant named Sebastian Shaw murder his mother before his eyes. Now, as a young man, Erik scours the globe to avenge his mother's death and kill Shaw. Yes, this is the 1960s! The Cuban Missile Crisis! A time of great divide, and at a point in American history, right before everything just kinda goes South. Sebastian Shaw is manipulating the Russians and the U.S. to start World War III, and Charles is recruited by the CIA to help create a mutant division and stop this war. With Erik's help, Charles trains many young mutants to make up this team, from Mystique, to a personal favorite of mine, Beast.There is a sophistication to X-Men: First Class. Director Matthew Vaughn evokes the visual style of 1960s pop art in his direction, using kinetic visuals and fanciful camera movements to create a sense of being lead through this world, but never feeling as if we're being pushed. Vaughn in particular should be commended for being able to balance the dual origins of Charles and Erik, as it takes nearly the first half hour to finally see these two meet. The first thirty minutes jet all the way from Oxford, England, to Vegas, to Switzerland, to Argentina, Germany, and Rochester, New York. There are tons of stamps on the suitcase within the first act alone, but Vaughn makes the transitions smooth and natural, a feat that is hard to explain in words, but makes the difference upon viewing the film.With an arc of revenge, Michael Fassbender gets the meatiest role to play as Erik, but to say that James McAvoy does not succeed as Charles would be incorrect as well. To be honest, Erik is the scene stealer of the entire movie. This is Magneto as he has never been seen before. For once the viewer does not see Magneto as a manipulator of the plans, but actually use his powers in action, as a soldier, an action hero who must find a place between peace and anger in order to truly master his powers. Seeing Charles trying to teach Erik how to master his powers, shows how these two characters develop such a memorable friendship, keeping up the mantra of the entire movie. There is very little told, it is always shown to us, making X-Men: First Class a visual masterwork, and a joy for escapist popcorn entertainment with the action exhilarating, and all of the cast looking as if they had fun (especially Kevin Bacon, knocking villain, Sebastian Shaw, out of the park).With that all said, X-Men: First Class all boils down to being comfortable in one's skin and how should someone different approach being different in normal society. Should they hide being a mutant, or should they have mutant pride? This question has been the foundation of nearly all of the X-Men films, so this may not be new territory, but the examination of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto, is what this movie is truly about. The journey these two men go on is exciting, beautiful, and heartbreaking, making X-Men: First Class must see entertainment.I give X-Men: First Class a 10 out of 10!",10,8,16,3 June 2011
The Wolverine," Hugh Jackman's Mutton Chops Still Fit
","Hugh Jackman returns for the sixth time as everyone's favorite bad boy mutant, Wolverine, in what is the best Wolverine-centric movie since 2003's X-2: X-Men United.In The Wolverine, our titular hero journeys to Japan to say goodbye to Yashida, a man he saved from the H bomb in Nagasaki, who is now a dying business tycoon. Yashida offers the immortal Wolverine a tempting proposition -- he will thank Wolverine for saving him by taking away Wolverine's powers, enabling Wolverine to go off and be mortal. Of course, nothing goes as planned and everyone around Wolverine, including Yashida himself, seem to have ulterior motives.What is so fun about this movie is that it's a serious, character centric superhero movie. This movie literally has only two other mutants in it other than Wolverine himself. It's quite simply a stripped down action movie where the hero just happens to have special powers and centuries of baggage that he must overcome in order to once more find his place in the world. Of course, by the movie starring Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, even though it's a dramatic look at what makes Wolverine who he is, Jackman still infuses the character with enough gruff charisma to where his one-liners are all actually funny and you're having fun while also being completely captivated by the serious tone of the story.This is honestly unlike any other superhero film ever done before. There aren't many pure black-and-white characters in this story, almost every character languishes in the moral grey area, including Wolverine himself at times. It's a movie that actually shows one of the toughest superheroes in all his glory. While it's a shame that the climax of the film lacks any real definitive punch that tops all of the action and adventure that comes before it, The Wolverine is still a close to perfect cinematic adaptation that will please almost any fanboy.I give The Wolverine a 9 out of 10!",9,3,8,9 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Time to Rise
","Batman has been gone for eight years, Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, but when Gotham comes under attack, he returns to fulfill his promise to his city. That is the best, non-spoiler way I have to sum up Christopher Nolan's Batman finale, The Dark Knight Rises.The series of films that started back with Batman Begins comes to a close with this tense and entertaining piece of pop entertainment. While it never quite reaches the emotional highs of its predecessors, your eyes remain glued to the screen till the credits roll, and a large part of that is due to the newest additions to the cast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway. Levitt portrays rookie cop, John Blake, with righteous indignation at the way that the police force has become complacent in the eight years of peace time in Gotham City. As for Hathaway, she steals the show as Selina Kyle (also known as Catwoman). Hathaway takes the famous cat burglar, and adds emotional drive -- such as fear, anger, and love -- behind her actions, humanizing a character that could easily be seen as a stock criminal looking for what's her's.As a fan of the comics, it's enjoyable to see how the story draws heavily upon some of the more awesome Batman story arcs, such as 'No Man's Land' and 'Knightfall,' to create a plot full of forward momentum. The Dark Knight Rises is constantly moving forward, trying to cram in as much as possible in two hours and forty-five minutes, often not leaving as much room, like the first two did, to soak in the emotion of the proceedings before carrying on to the next scene. Even still, the plot is rock solid, and works to convey a full-bodied story about rising to meet challenges when they come.Seriously, if you love Batman you're gonna see this movie no matter what anyone says, and you should. It's an awesome movie that is extremely well done. It's well directed, exceptionally acted -- in particular a series' best turn from Michael Caine as Alfred the butler -- and it concludes the story Christopher Nolan started seven years ago in a satisfying, and believable manner. To ask a movie such as this to live up to its predecessors -- both of which happen to be in my top 20 favorite films of all-time -- is almost impossible. While it is the weakest of the trilogy, I've already seen it twice and look forward to seeing it many more times. Why? Because the weakest of this trilogy is still better than ninety percent of the other blockbusters out there.I give The Dark Knight Rises a 9 out of 10!",9,3,9,20 July 2012
Iron Man," A highly entertaining and fun superhero movie!
","Wow! That one word sums up how I felt after leaving the theater upon seeing Iron Man. I was completely shocked, this movie was actually really good. I am not going to lie, before seeing this film I really thought it was going to be bad, I wasn't even planning on seeing it, but then reviews started coming out, and all of them were generally positive; as well, a trusted friend of mine, whose opinion on movies I hold in high regard, saw it and enjoyed it, so I thought I might give Iron Man a shot. I did, and I must say it was entirely worth it.Iron Man follows the story of billionaire playboy Tony Stark. Stark is the CEO of his company Stark Industries, which manufactures weapons for the U.S. Government. The story begins in Afghanistan, where Stark is showing a test of his new missile to U.S. troops. Soon after the test, the troops Stark is with are attacked by a terrorist group. The terrorists kidnap Stark and take him captive in a cave, here he sees that these terrorists have access to the weapons his company makes. The terrorists want to use Stark to build a missile for them, but instead he builds a gigantic iron battle suit, which he uses to escape the terrorists. Once Stark is back in the states he dismantles the weapons division of his corporation, at the same time he learns that people within his company has sold terrorists his weapons without his permission. Stark begins to perfect his iron battle suit and decides to use it to destroy all of the terrorists who use his weapons. Soon Stark learns who gave these terrorists access to his weapons, which culminates in a gigantic robotic battle in L.A. at the end of the film.Overall this was a really great movie, it was highly entertaining, and no scene ever felt rushed or too long, the pacing was perfect. The true highlight of the film though was Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, his turn as the cynical Stark was funny and picture perfect for the role. The rest of the cast was great as well, especially Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots, Tony's assistant and love interest; and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah, the villain of the story. Another highlight of the film was the superb screenplay, the dialogue was extremely tight, witty, and flowed very well; as well it perfectly balanced the comedy alongside the drama and action, which is something that many films nowadays don't seem to do well. Other good things included the usual terrific special effects job from ILM, and the pretty good directing from Jon Favreau (Elf), this film being his first go at doing an action movie. That brings to point the amazing action sequences in the film, there maybe weren't as many as I thought there'd be initially going into it, but there was just enough to quench your thirst, which I felt was perfect.It was really hard for me to find any fault with this film. The only minor complaint I could come up with was the characters. The problem came in the fact that the character of Tony Stark was the only three-dimensional character in this film, which wasn't bad, except when there was an occasional scene without Stark in it, the scene didn't feel as tight, because he was the only character in the film that they really spent time to examine his character and who he is. As I said this is just a minor complaint, and overall didn't affect this film really since Stark was in about 95% of the scenes in the movie.All in all Iron Man is a highly fun and entertaining superhero movie, and kicks off this summer on a high note. I was genuinely entertained throughout the film and had a lot of fun, and I think it stands tall amongst some of the best superhero movies of all-time, it is definitely one of Marvels better movies since probably Spider-man 2. Another great thing, that is worth a mention, is the great scene at the end of credits, which is almost worth the price of admission itself; just stay after the credits are over, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend Iron Man to any movie fan, even if you are skeptical about it just give it a chance, I did and I came out loving it.I give Iron Man an amazing 10 out of 10!",10,1,5,2 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Spoiler-Free Review
","I'm gonna get straight to the point here, because all you really wanna know is if Batman v Superman is a movie worthy of its titular characters, and in my opinion, it totally is. While some might be thrown off by the notion of Batman and Superman fighting one another the first time they're actually in a movie together, director Zack Snyder and writers David Goyer and Chris Terrio, make it believable.The whole notion of this series of DC Comics movies is that these are what-ifs. What if these superheroes actually existed in our real world? In this movie, Superman has to deal with the political ramifications of his actions in a way that is not too dissimilar than the political debates we find in our day-to-day. Superman can't win for losing and Batman's distrust of him only exacerbates the problem. Of course what makes this movie such a joy is not the depth of the material, but it's seeing these classic characters -- Batman, Superman, and yes, Wonder Woman -- fighting alongside one another for the very first time in live action.If you were like me and did not like Man of Steel as much as you wanted to, this movie might rectify a lot of the issues you had with that movie. With that said, this movie certainly wont please everyone. I can already tell you Batman v Superman is going to go down as one of those love it or hate it movies with very little in-betweeners. The movie often has a slower pace than most will be expecting, and it also doesn't like to always spell everything out for the audience. Every now and then a scene transpires and it's not till after its completion do you even know what the scene was. There are a fair few dream sequences in this movie, almost all of them belonging to Bruce Wayne's nightmares and are setting up future sequels. Sure, the movie could have done with a little less teasing of the upcoming Justice League movie and been a tighter affair because of it, but the movie that exists is a good one that I found myself invested in, both emotionally and cerebrally.The action sequences are top notch and exciting, and the drama, in particular the finale, is executed very powerfully. While I know there will be other fan boys complaining about Batman or Superman doing this or that that they never did in the comic books, both of these characters go on a journey in this movie, and if you hang with it, you'll see the two of them evolve into their traditional comic book counterparts by the time the credits roll. And rest assured, Ben Affleck is really, really good as Batman, while Henry Cavill continues to prove his chops as Superman. As for Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, she certainly holds her own alongside the other two and left me wanting more. All in all, I just wish the Justice League was already out so I can see what happens next! Yeah, I liked this one that much.I give Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice an 8 out of 10!",8,4,9,24 March 2016
Monsters University," Pixar Still Has It!
","There has been lots of talk the past few years about Pixar losing their mojo, and if anything, Monsters University proves those naysayers wrong. Monsters University is vintage Pixar, through and through. It is a heartfelt film that is highly inventive, laugh-out loud hilarious, and worthy to stand alongside each and every Pixar classic.The film, a prequel to Monsters, Inc., follows the Billy Crystal-voiced Mike Wazowski from childhood to his early days working for Monsters, Inc. Of course, the road to that point is not that easy for our favorite one-eyed cretin, as Mike wants nothing more than to be a scarer, and the thing is, he just isn't scary. As Mike goes to college at Monsters University, the point becomes even more clear as he develops an antagonistic relationship with slacker, yet natural scarer, James P. Sullivan, otherwise known as Sully (voiced by John Goodman). Now, as we all know, Sully and Mike wind up being best friends by the start of Monsters, Inc., but they weren't always that way, and that's what this film shows. It shows us how they met and how they became friends, and that's the true value of Monsters University.Here's what I absolutely love about Pixar and what they do with their films. Even when they make a sequel, or in this case, a prequel, they don't simply redo what they did the first time out. They only do a sequel when there is an intriguing story that shows a different facet of the world they created. Honestly, I've always been a fan of Monsters, Inc., and nearly a decade and a half later, it still stands as one of Pixar's most imaginative worlds they've ever created. When a world is that imaginative, there are so many different avenues the story can go, and there are only so many that can actually make it into the film. What Monsters University does so well is how it further expands the world of Monsters, Inc. There are so many new kinds of monsters we see in this film that we never saw in the first one, all of whom are so original, yet so simple in design, it feels as if they were the monsters we saw under our beds as children. Once again, Pixar has managed to tap into the childhood experience to craft a masterwork, but what Pixar has always done phenomenally is not just make films that speak to the experience of children, but to life experience in general. This film does that as well.What makes Monsters University so funny and different from other Pixar movies, is that while kids will undoubtedly love it, due to the humor involved, so much of the humor's focus on college hijinks makes the film just as funny, if not funnier for adults who went to college and have already had that experience. While Monsters University does seem to have a greater focus on comedy than its predecessor, don't be fooled into thinking that there isn't a heart to this film, or lessons to be had. Like all Pixar films, the lessons aren't always simple to grasp and speak to the larger life experience I previously mentioned. One must applaud Pixar for not making another narrative telling kids you can be whatever you set your mind to. Mike has set his mind to being a scarer, it does not mean he is good at it, and if you've seen Monsters, Inc., you know he doesn't become one. As depressing as this may sound, you do not always achieve your dreams, but what it teaches, which is something adults can learn as well, is that if you're open to alternatives, you may wind up in a place better than you ever imagined.At the end of the day though, Monsters University is simply a great film about friendship that has you laughing throughout its entirety whilst having your heart warmed.I give Monsters University a 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,16 November 2013
Toy Story 3," Thematically Dense, yet Hilarious at the Same Time
","For those of us who grew up with the Toy Story films, we, like Andy, have left behind our toys to venture out into adulthood, but we all still hold that fondness for the things from when we were children. Toy Story 3 is the full summation of fifteen years of growing up, from childhood to adulthood. I was five when the first Toy Story hit theaters, now I am twenty and Toy Story 3 is here.In between that time, Andy has grown to be seventeen and leaving for college, and he is faced with the dilemma as to what to do with his old toys, Woody, Buzz, and the whole gang. All these once cheerful toys want is to be played with, but now their in the doldrums from not having any playtime in years. One thing leads to another and the toys accidentally wind up at a Daycare Center. At first it seems like a magical resort for toys, but it in fact winds up being a prison. The Center is enforced by a big teddy bear named Lotso who utilizes his crazy cymbal, clanking monkey for security to keep toys in line. The film really takes off though with the the toys' determination to return to Andy's house before Andy leaves for college. This is where the movie has it's real fun as the toys try to escape the almost impenetrable Daycare Center.In a way, Toy Story 3's ending has all the more emotional resonance because I have grown up with these characters and it is hard to leave them behind. I think that is why Toy Story 3 is such a fascinating film. The film is about life, and one's contemplations, albeit it's about a bunch of hunks of plastic. You feel for these characters, you even feel for Andy and his conflictions as to what to do with these toys that he still loves so much. But what the film is all about, is about not trying to hold onto one's past, but learning how to move on. This is, thematically, Pixar's heaviest film that they've ever done, and I don't think that there is any dispute about that. You walk out of the theater at the end, both wanting to cry and smile.Director Lee Unkrich's directorial debut is well done, channeling John Lasseter's fascinating work on the first two installments, while layering the film with a very appetizing visual flare, but Unkrich's direction soars thanks to Academy Award-winner Michael Arndt's funny, yet increasingly moving screenplay that has surprises around every turn. All of the voice cast returns and delivers pitch perfect performances, I mean, you can't really beat Tom Hanks as Woody, but Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear comes close. Michael Keaton's Ken is the most fun new addition to the cast, but Kristen Schaal (Mel from Flight of the Conchords) makes the most of her limited time as Trixie the Triceratops.Like every third installment, the film feels as if it has thirty climaxes, but each one is played to maximum perfection. Like the first two films, Toy Story 3 is filled with pint-sized adventure and much hilarity, but it's the heart that ultimately wins you over, and it's the heart that makes one remember.I give Toy Story 3 a 10 out of 10!",10,2,4,20 June 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," Perhaps a Perfect Film
","I think the wrong way to view the new film, Saving Mr. Banks, is as the making of Disney's classic, Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks is really about storytelling as both truth and escape, as well as a film about fathers. The film tells the true story of how Mary Poppins author, P.L. Travers, came to Disney Studios for two weeks in 1961, as Walt Disney and his ace crew of creatives tried to convince the ill- tempered Travers to allow them the rights to make Mary Poppins. I think it's safe to say that we all know how the film ultimately ends, but how we get there is such an emotional journey that it is worth embarking upon. Emma Thompson portrays P.L. Travers with enough emotion buried within the subtext of her words that we care about this woman who is not all that immediately likable on the page, and in lesser hands the role would have been just that. Meanwhile, Tom Hanks plays the part of Walt Disney himself, with a twinkle in his eye, and yet he also manages to bring his trademark everyman quality to old Walt himself and make Walt not seem as if he's some myth, but rather a real man. However, the big mistake that many seem to be making with this film is that it's a movie about Walt Disney, and while Disney is a very important character in the film, this is P.L. Travers' story.Through flashbacks we witness Travers' childhood in Australia and her relationship with her alcoholic banker father, Travers Goff, who was the inspiration for Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins, and is portrayed in this film by Colin Farrell with a charming, yet tragic likability. We witness how much of Travers' childhood went on to inspire Mary Poppins, and it's through these flashbacks that Saving Mr. Banks finds its heart. Without us seeing what P.L. Travers went through, it's hard for us to understand why she is so against Disney transforming, what is essentially, her own past into a film. This allows us to relate to this hard to relate to woman, which is the brilliant stroke of director John Lee Hancock and screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. As a matter of fact, if there is one word to describe Saving Mr. Banks for me, it is brilliant.It is rare to see a film made by a major studio with this kind of thematic density, and that is why this is such a brilliant motion picture. There is an honesty to the way the film deals with the idea of fathers and that while they may not be infallible, they can still be saved. Then there are the thematic ideas of storytelling that ring so true to me as a storyteller myself. Whether we realize it or not, the stories we tell are reflections of ourselves and our own lives. Walt says it best late in the film when he points out that the true power of imagination and story is to lend hope, and I think that is why anyone deep down tells a story, and I think that idea sums up Disney's entire career.There just aren't that many kind of films like Saving Mr. Banks in these cynical days, but if you allow yourself to feel, you will be swept away. This is a Disney movie, through and through. There are laughs and moments of soaring emotion throughout, and I wouldn't want anything different from a film made by Disney. Every time you hear, 'Let's Go Fly a Kite,' your spirit soars and as you watch the film, the song begins to take on a whole new meaning that makes it an even more life affirming song than you perhaps ever thought of it as before. It's not merely a great toe-tapper that closes a film, it's a song of hope.I just can't say enough about Saving Mr. Banks, I loved it and I think everyone should see this film. The funny thing about all this is, is that without the film Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks would not exist, and yet Saving Mr. Banks is a film that manages to improve upon what is already a near perfect classic and perhaps even best it. From now on, every single time you watch Mary Poppins, the many events and ideas of that film will take on a whole new meaning. In fact, I can't wait till the next time I see Mary Poppins again to see how it may affect me more strongly on an emotional level now knowing more of the story. Saving Mr. Banks is just a miraculous kind of movie that we need more of. It's classic Hollywood drama, so if you want my advice, bring a hankie and just enjoy yourself.I give Saving Mr. Banks a 10 out of 10!",10,80,108,19 December 2013
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Fantastic as a Fox!
","Fantastic is the operative word in director Wes Anderson's adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic, Fantastic Mr. Fox. The film tells the story of Mr. Fox, who gave up his life of stealing chickens to settle down with his wife, Mrs. Fox, and start a family, but when Mr. Fox relapses into his criminal ways 12 fox-years later, everything just busts loose. What the cuss! The film is a marvelous piece of stop-motion animation. Where as we all have seen stuff like Wallace and Grommet, and many have seen Nightmare Before Christmas, the stop-motion in this film is so much more clever, charming, and lovable as a form of artistic expression than any other example of the form. One moment in particular, Mr. and Mrs. Fox's conversation in front of the underground waterfall is simply breathtaking, but not only that, the design of the furry animals in the film are just so cute and adorable.The animation is brought to life, thanks to the terrific voice-acting from the likes of George Clooney and Meryl Streep as Mr. and Mrs. Fox, but it is Jason Schwartzman that steals the show as their misunderstood son, Ash, who simply wants to be an athlete and win his dads approval. In many ways, the film is like all Wes Anderson films, in that it is all about family dynamics, except this time relaying those dynamics to the entire family community. You can't help but love to see Bill Murray's Badger get in an argument with George Clooney's Mr. Fox, and the great cousin rivaly between Ash and Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), is absolutely hilarious.While Wes Anderson has made many films, this one is his finest. It includes all of the stuff that I have always enjoyed about his works, such as the dynamic of the dysfunctional family, but it sheds itself of all that has held me back in his previous works; not to mention, his typical absurdities tend to work far better in the realm of fantastical animation than it does in live-action.This really is a wonderful family film. It is easily accessible, and in many ways, it's like the old school Warner's cartoons that I used to watch when I was little, very slapstick, but also witty with fantastic dialogue. The film is fantastical in all respects, it never takes itself seriously, and that is why it works, cause even when it gets serious, Anderson pulls back and delivers some humor. When the credits roll on Fantastic Mr. Fox, you will have had such a good time at the movies, that you wont even realize how much time has passed and you will be dancing along with the characters.I give Fantastic Mr. Fox a 10 out of 10!",10,1,4,6 January 2010
X2: X-Men United," Genius!
","X2: X-Men United is simply put Bryan Singer's greatest film to date. While the first X-Men film was a fun and entertaining thrill ride, this sequel manages to not only up the thrills of its predecessors, but bring much more to the table that the first film did not.The film is a terrific allegory about racism, prejudice, and acceptance. Its emphasis on the rights of mutants seems to mirror the real life plights of homosexuals, various discriminated races, and other such people who are often met with much prejudice. Now all of this should not confuse you into thinking that this X2 is not a fun action film, because as I mentioned earlier it still manages to pack in the thrills.The action sequences in this film are unparalleled, they're not only expertly crafted, but they're also intensely exciting to watch unfold. One sequence in particular, when the school is attacked by soldiers and Wolverine single handedly fended off the invasion, is quite thrilling and is amongst one of the finer action sequences ever put on film.Director Bryan Singer truly outdid himself here. With the top notch action, mixed in with some true thought and genuine emotion, X2: X-Men United is a definite must see.I give X2 a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,11 May 2009
Thor: The Dark World," More of the Same, Which is not a Bad Thing
","By this point, you're either a fan of what Marvel Studios are doing with their movies, or you aren't. It is that pure and simple, and if you enjoyed the first Thor film and his role in The Avengers, then you will absolutely love Thor: The Dark World, as I did.Few films these days are as much fun as the films that Marvel Studios are putting out right now. Not only are these films showing deep respect and faithfulness to their source material whenever they can, but they also never try to downplay the fantasticalness of what makes these comic book heroes so awe-inspiring. They embrace the comic booky-nature of all of these heroes and portray it not as satire, because while there are jokes at almost every juncture of these films, the characters are always taking the situations they are in seriously, therefore we're laughing while feeling like there are genuine stakes at hand. Thor: The Dark World does Marvel's typical bang-up job of this, and everything works.This particular film is very much born out of the repercussions of Thor and The Avengers, picking up right where those films left off, and you must have seen both of those films in order to get full enjoyment out of this one. At the start of Thor: The Dark World, Thor is still traveling across the nine realms, trying to restore peace and order to the galaxy after he had to destroy the bifrost at the end of Thor, therefore cutting off the other realms from Asgard's protection. Meanwhile, Loki has been imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard for his attack on New York at the end of The Avengers. When the convergence of the nine realms approaches, that only happens every one thousand years, an ancient power awakens, threatening to destroy all nine realms, including Midgard, or Earth, as it is better known. This sends Thor having to journey back to Earth to save his beloved mortal, Jane Foster, while also having to make a shaky alliance with Loki in order to fight the evil that is brewing.As a whole, there isn't anything more I can say to entice you to see this film. If you love these films, you're going to see it. All I can really say is that Thor: The Dark World is everything you expect it to be. There is tons of action, lots of laughs (contributed mostly from Kat Dennings' Darcy and some smartly utilized cameos), and the film is also emotional and genuinely heroic. Few films can put you through so much emotional turmoil in the course of the story, and yet still keep things lighthearted and full of hope. That is what Marvel does better than anyone else. What we're seeing here is a new Golden Age for Marvel superheroes, and if you just sit back and allow yourself to enjoy the ride, rather than searching for ways to not like these films just because you have your own ideas of how you feel these heroes should be best represented on film, then you will be a part of something that is truly special.P.S. Stay till the very end of the credits. There are two scenes after the end of the movie. One in the middle of the credits, and one after they're all done.I give Thor: The Dark World a 9 out of 10!",9,5,10,8 November 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Perhaps Anderson's Most Lively Film to Date
","If you're a fan of director Wes Anderson and his typical absurdist humor, then you'll be at home with Moonrise Kingdom. An orphaned boy scout runs away with the girl of his dreams on a small island just off the New England coast in the 1960s, as they're pursued by boy scouts, parents, and the local sheriff. It's a funny movie from Anderson, that is surprisingly tender hearted. It deals with young love with such fervor, you believe the reasons as to why these two young pre-teens are drawn to one another, and you laugh at all of the awkward moments that come from that young love. The kids, played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, are already masters at delivering each deadpan line of dialogue, that is Anderson's trademark. As for all of the typical troop that follows Wes Anderson from film to film, they're all spot on here, but it's new Anderson additions, Edward Norton and Bruce Willis, that steal the show. As with all of Anderson's characters, Norton's scout leader is the most offbeat scout leader you'll ever meet, and Willis's sheriff is a lonely man that is not as sure of himself as most Bruce Willis characters are, marking this as one of his better performances in years. This just is a true Wes Anderson film, through and through. It deals with, what I believe to be, his career long theme of familial disconnect and a search for familial connection, which is represented here between Gilman and Willis's characters' relationship, but most importantly, it's just a funny film. Boy scouts engaging in epic forest battles, dances in your underwear on the beach, what's not to love about this film? In many ways, Moonrise Kingdom seems to be the most lovingly crafted film of Anderson's career. It's debatable as to whether or not it's his best, because it does spin its wheels about in the middle, but there is a sentimental sense of nostalgia for a time in life that we grow out of very quickly, that is different than the feelings that one typically gets from an Anderson film.I give Moonrise Kingdom a 9 out of 10!",9,1,2,7 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars is in Safe Hands
","The Force has awakened once more and this time it feels as if it will never go away again. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the seventh installment in the Star Wars franchise and is the first of the Disney-era after they purchased Lucasfilm back in 2012. Directed and co-written by fanboy lightning rod, J.J. Abrams, The Force Awakens is a Star Wars film that was made by fans, for fans. While this could have easily been just a whole bunch of fan service to grab for some quick and easy cash, The Force Awakens is more than that -- it's a true tour de force of a movie (no pun intended).There is simply a confidence to The Force Awakens that is evident from the very first frame, resulting in a movie that is more of a new beginning than a retread of past films. Taking place nearly thirty years after Return of the Jedi, the film boldly places its new heroes front and center instead of the old stalwarts like Han Solo (who doesn't even show up till nearly forty-five minutes in). That is not to say that characters like Han, Luke, and Leia do not play crucial roles, but their roles are always in service to the new cast who are the main reason this film works. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac make up the hero side as Rey, Finn, and Poe, while Adam Driver plays the mysterious new villain, Kylo Ren. All of these characters feel very Star Wars, but are different than any other Star Wars characters we've ever seen before. Rey is a hopeful desert scavenger who had to raise herself when left by her family on the planet Jakku as a child, whereas Finn was a stormtrooper for the First Order (a less politically powerful, but restructured Empire) who defected when refusing to kill in cold blood, and Poe is a Resistance fighter pilot (the New Republic's secret military force led by Leia) who is literally the greatest pilot the saga has ever seen. And what can really be said about Dark Side acolyte Kylo Ren without giving anything away? Other than that Adam Driver delivers arguably the most nuanced portrayal of a Star Wars villain ever. As for Ridley, Boyega, and Isaac, the chemistry between them is impeccable with all of them having phenomenal comedic timing as well as an amazing ability to wear their hearts on their sleeves, with 23-year-old Ridley in particular shining the brightest in her cinematic debut as an actress. Thanks to the new cast, The Force Awakens is both one of the funniest movies in the Star Wars saga and perhaps the most emotional. It's quite amazing that Abrams, alongside co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, managed to keep such a great balance going between light and dark without going too far either way. As previously mentioned, the new cast is one of the key reasons that the script managed to work, but the thing that really makes this one so emotional is the old, returning cast. Carrie Fisher delivers her best work in years as Leia, but it is Harrison Ford as Han Solo that really gets you in this one. The pure joy of seeing Harrison back as Han is most certainly one of the primary reasons so many people are going to go see this movie, and I will say this much because I don't want to spoil anyone, his return does not disappoint and Han goes to some new places that we've never seen him go before. As for Mark Hamill as Luke, well I'll just tease that there is a reason he hasn't been in any of the promotional materials so far, and it's a good one.One of the things that people often say in the film business is that lightning rarely strikes twice, but in the case of the Star Wars saga, lightning seems to have struck seven times now. Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivered in all of the expected ways as well as in a great many unexpected territories. As is par for the course with a Star Wars movie, the movie looks and sounds great, with more imagination on display here than in just about any other movie being made nowadays, and what can you really say about the music from the great John Williams? It's phenomenal, with himself being bold in not relying too heavily on old themes, utilizing mostly new creations for this go around. That is the best way to sum up The Force Awakens. It took a great many risks and they all paid off brilliantly, culminating in one of the best movies made in perhaps the last decade. It's emotional, fun, and just super cool. Go see it and enjoy it, because Star Wars is in safe hands.I give Star Wars: The Force Awakens a 10 out of 10!",10,6,33,18 December 2015
RED," A Rad Shade of 'Red'
","Retired and Extremely Dangerous (R.E.D.), that is the acronym for Red, the story of retired CIA agents being hunted down by the agency because of the secrets that they know. As is usual with these espionage flicks, there are twists, there are turns, but this movie takes the usual tropes of a Jack Ryan-Tom Clancy movie and makes it all funny.In this cartoonish action flick, Bruce Willis plays retired CIA agent, Frank Moses, who has fallen in love with the woman over the telephone line in charge of his government pension, Sarah (played by Mary-Louise Parker). But when CIA agents come knocking on Frank's door, Frank has no choice but to run and kidnap his love, who he has never seen. With Sarah at his side, Frank reassembles his old unit, consisting of vet actors like Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren.The jokes fly between these veteran actors with so much ease, you would think that these consummate professionals have been working together all their lives, and that is the mark of a truly magnificent actor. John Malkovich gives probably the most memorable turn as a retiree who is constantly paranoid that the government is watching him, but Helen Mirren isn't far behind with her trigger happy, Grandmommy James Bond seductress, persona. I thought actor Karl Urban, playing the agent hunting R.E.D. down, was a nice foil to Bruce Willis's character, but Morgan Freeman actually had the most forgettable role in the whole movie, dying halfway through. While the movie has some missed opportunities in terms of exploring the proposed concepts of not having a life or love when part of the CIA, these few moments of proposal are never really explored which could have made this movie a more memorable romp.Director Robert Schwentke directs the action sequences with a visual flare that many directors seem to lack when working in this genre, but the story is often vague. Why R.E.D. is being hunted by the CIA is never explained in full; we know all of this stuff they're fighting for means something to these characters, but we, as the audience, are clueless as to why. While the overall ride gives you just enough information to warrant you wanting to sit through to the next action sequence, this movie could have been so much more had this story been made clearer. Regardless, the movie is an enjoyable action flick with some slick visuals and a fair few laughs to warrant the time.I give Red a 7 out of 10!",7,6,9,21 October 2010
Flight," A New Kind of Film from Zemeckis
","Flight is a change of pace for director, Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Cast Away). After a decade of doing mo-cap animated films, Zemeckis returns to live action with a film that is decidedly darker than any other film he's ever made. Flight tells the story of Whip Whitaker, portrayed by Denzel Washington. Whip is a drug addict, an alcoholic, and a commercial airline pilot. On the morning that his airplane experiences technical difficulties and starts falling out of the sky, Whip was drunk and high. While he made an emergency landing in a Georgia field, his condition leads to a criminal investigation as to why the aircraft really fell. The crash sequence is as harrowing as any I've ever seen, and is a marvel of Zemeckis's directing and ability to get immaculate effects work out of the effects crew, however the rest of the film is about Whip and his addictions. Whip cannot stop drinking, lying, or being a man so unfitting of the word hero. He refuses to go to AA meetings, he cannot resist a drink when it's sitting there right in front of him, and the film goes to many places that are surprising and uncomfortable for the viewer. We witness Whip, fall down drunk, high as a kite, and lying with a silver tongue, ignoring his son and ex-wife for most of the film, and losing the few good relationships he still has left. Washington delivers a performance of intense depth, he plays the role with charm, but the kind of charm one has when they're trying to get everything to go their way. Though where his performance really stands out, is in the way that Washington's Whip refuses to admit that he has a problem, and he gives a good case for award's attention at the end when he finally lays down his alcohol addiction for the whole world to see. Smartly, Flight never tries to answer the spiritual questions it raises, some might find a spiritual movie underneath all of this, about why things happen, and that's one of the best things that Zemeckis and writer John Gatins did, they don't try to push anything on the viewer, but let them make up their own mind. To me, the movie is about discovering one's faith, while it's also a movie about a man on a downward spiral, crashing both figuratively and literally in this film. The whole piece works thematically, and the acting performances are strong, in particular Don Cheadle, as the most believable lawyer I've seen on film in a while. While Flight loses some of its credibility when Whip's lawyer pays for him to get high on cocaine when he's spending his whole time the rest of the film trying to get Whip's toxicology report to go away, as a whole, Flight is a hard-hitting drama that is unlike anything else that Zemeckis has ever done. For a filmmaker who one thinks they've already seen all the tricks he has left in his bag, this is a refreshing experience to see him growing and delivering adult fare unlike anything else he's ever done before, but be warned, this is neither a feel good movie, nor a film for the faint hearted, as there is nudity, drugs, alcohol, and many different ways to use the f-word.I give Flight a 9 out of 10!",9,1,3,17 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It All Ends!
","When the final frame of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2 flickered across the screen, it finally hit me, there are no more adventures with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, this finale is it, and what a finale it is. This is a movie! In the best sense of the word. There just seems to be no time anymore to complain about what was cut, what was changed, and what wasn't included from the book. This adaptation succeeds in streamlining the story and turning it into a story that meditates life-and-death, awash with operatic tones and emotional heart tugging.What more does anyone need to know, this is the final battle between Harry Potter and the evil Lord Voldemort, as the armies of Good and Evil collide! Their battlefield...? Hogwarts, of all places. Every actor and character gets their due, but with the movie being called Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe has the most emotional scenes to pull off, as it has been in nearly all of these movies. Radcliffe carries this movie's emotional nexus on his back and does so brilliantly. Though let's not forget Alan Rickman, as the good guy pretending to be a bad guy, Severus Snape. People have always loved Snape's drawling voice and utter lack of emotion, and seeing the flashbacks of Snape actually showing emotion and how he came to be who he is, was eye opening, and allowed Alan Rickman to deliver one of his finest performances to date. But this is not a movie about the actors, but about the story.We literally see the grand castle of Hogwarts ripped to shreds, as spells, giants, and animated statues, tear through the rubble. With so much propulsive action, the movie is moving forward from the first frame, never looking back, moving with the assumption that if you didn't see the last few, then why are you here. We are always in the present, never having to be told what is going to happen or be explained what has happened, we just get to see what is happening in the present of these characters and allow the natural surprises that come with the territory, making the heavy emotional beats in the latter half of the movie really hit the viewer hard, and be presented with so much drama and importance. Though action is not what makes this movie important, it is the deeper ponderings of life-and-death.Death comes for us all, and that being the true master of death is understanding how to greet it when it comes. Harry has to deal with death, as he literally marches to his own funeral with the spectral forms of his parents beside him, or when he reunites with Dumbledore in the after life. These moments are touching, thought provoking, and filled with so much raw emotion through the actor's performances that you will go through an entire box of Kleenex before you're through. The lessons of death change how we live if only we can accept it when it comes, like Harry does.Simply put, when a movie is this beautiful and heavy with emotion, no amount of evil can keep our hero down. Looking back over it all, it's rare for me to feel so emotional over an ending, but these were my friends too. And they were the friends for countless millions of people around the world. Thanks Harry, Ron, and Hermione.I give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part II a 10 out of 10!",10,3,7,14 July 2011
Unbroken," Movie Review: 'Unbroken'
","I am always worried for actors when they try their hand at directing. For every Mel Gibson, Emilio Estevez, or Kevin Costner, there are countless others that try and just never seem to get a good handle on it. The biggest misconception that I think a lot of actors make is that since you're an actor you can direct actors better, and while that may be true, they're ignoring a lot of the other elements that make great directors. A director needs to not only be able to work well with actors, but they also need to have an ability to lead, to be able to see the bigger picture, and most importantly, to create the visual language of the movie. It's this last one that I feel a lot of actors trying their hand at directing struggle with the most. Fortunately for Angelina Jolie, she manages to prove that she is a very adept director with a strong visual style to go with her ability to work with actors. Her second film as a director, Unbroken, is as good of a film as any other director could make.Unbroken tells the amazing true story of Louie Zamperini, an Olympic track athlete who was a bombardier in World War II. When his plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean, his arduous journey begins. From being adrift at sea, to being a POW in a Japanese prison camp, Louie's journey is one of discovering extreme inner strength, perseverance, and ultimately the ability to forgive through faith in God. Simply put, this is the type of film that is rarely getting made anymore, and it is the sort of movie that even 15 years ago would have swept the Oscars, but cynicism and political correctness rule today.What strikes me most about Unbroken is just how powerful it is through showing us very little about Zamperini other than his service in World War II. While there are a few flashbacks highlighting his childhood and his accomplishments in the Olympics, probably 95% of the movie is all about his experiences lost at sea or as a prisoner of war. It is through this crucible that we learn more about who Zamperini was, tying into the best line of the whole film, 'If I can take it, I can make it.' In so many ways, that's one of those sayings that perhaps everyone should live their life by. Louie did, while he had his moments of doubt and fear, he ultimately remembered those words when times were at their worst, and he managed to come out the other side.The cast of up-and-coming actors all deliver exceptional performances and really dedicate themselves to these roles to make this film believable. Japanese pop star, Miyavi, is malicious and so perfect as, 'The Bird,' the officer in charge at Louie's POW camp, and it's a shame that a year after Barkhad Abdi managed to find critical love for a similar type of role, Miyavi doesn't seem to be having as much luck with awards. Of course, a film like this needs actors you can root for if you are to buy their struggles, and more importantly, actors that go that extra mile to sell the reality of a true story such as this. Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson, respectively playing Louie and his friend Phil, both lost tons of weight to make the impact greater when they are forced to strip down in front of Japanese soldiers and you see their sunken stomachs and sallow cheeks. That type of actorly commitment only comes when you have a director you can trust and when you know you are working on a great story, and that is exactly what Unbroken is, it's a story that anyone who is a human being can relate to and be moved by.I often think of watching movies as therapy. A good movie is always therapeutic for me, whether it's a story that makes me think differently about a particular subject like friendship or war, or whether or not it's simply a movie that makes me laugh or feel good. Movies are great for when I need inspiration to go do something, or reminders of the important things in life. Unbroken is one such movie that is a therapeutic experience. It is expertly crafted and superbly shot. Cinematographer Roger Deakins utilizes natural light in some truly stunning ways, and the shot design that Angelina Jolie employs in a lot of the action scenes had me thinking that she should make an action movie, her direction was that clear and concise. It's PG-13, so it's a little bit more tame than a lot of similar movies. Now that doesn't mean it is not rough, but a lot of the worst stuff is more implied, making this a great film for families of high school kids and above. Simply put, Unbroken is one of those movies that I just think everyone has to see, because if you walk away from it and haven't been moved, then there might be something seriously wrong with you.",10,26,55,10 December 2014
Rear Window," One of the most suspenseful films of all-time!
","Rear Window is easily one of, if not the finest crafted mystery suspense/thriller of all-time. The story is about a man who is confined to a wheelchair within his apartment for eight weeks. During those eight weeks the man takes up the hobby of watching his neighbors through his window, and eventually he witnesses what he believes to be a murder.The film was directed by the amazing Alfred Hitchcock, who is easily the greatest filmmaker of all-time. Hitchcock gave this film the proper amount of comedy, romance, and suspense to keep the audience enthralled; a large component in his achieving this though came through the magnificent script. The script features tight, witty dialogue that never falls flat, and flows at a pace that only a classic such as this can achieve. Of course the film would be nothing without its cast, Jimmy Stewart alongside the beautiful Grace Kelly, both are stellar actors and deliver pitch perfect performances, as well as the rest of this small, yet flawless cast.It is rare for their to be a film that is so timeless, this film is just as entertaining today as when it was released in the fifties. No matter how much people try to re-emulate the film for modern age, they always fall flat. Rear Window is a true classic through and through, and is easily worth seeing.I give Rear Window a flawless 10 out of 10!",10,1,4,5 July 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One of the Greatest Cinematic Achievements in Cinema's History!
","The Return of the King is a film full of ambition. That is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. The scope and scale of this film was enormous, I do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one, and I'm not sure there will ever be another. Though not only is Return of the King a true epic through and through, it also has a ton of drama. This film has so much emotional resonance, and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. When Sam picks Frodo up and carries him up the slope of Mount Doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. This film is not only a terrific actioner, but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. When it is over there is no denying that the Return of the King is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film.I give the Return of the King a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,14 March 2009
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Superb Sequel
","It still baffles me as to why The Hunger Games is so successful. I love it, but why do so many others? These aren't escapist stories, these aren't entertainment, and yet there is something about these stories that appeals to me in a deep way that I can't quite explain. Perhaps it's because I love the characters and identify with them? Or perhaps it's because I find the thematic ideas of oppression and rebellion so striking? Irregardless to what it is that draws me to the material, I love The Hunger Games, and I absolutely enjoyed the first film in the franchise. The sequel, Catching Fire, does what every good cinematic sequel should do, and goes above and beyond.First and foremost, I must applaud new director, Francis Lawrence, for applying an if it isn't broke, don't fix it mentality to the material. Rather than recreate everything that the first film's director, Gary Ross, did, Lawrence merely expands on all of Ross's ideas and makes them clearer and more concise. There is an obvious continuity that this film has, and it's because of this filmmaking approach. Too many sequels often change the worlds of the films too much, especially when there is a change in directors, and it can be off-putting and alienating if you were a fan of everything the predecessor did right. Lawrence avoids this pratfall and only makes things even more cinematic than before. A large part of the reason the continuity also works is because James Newton Howard was brought back to do the music a second time around, and he utilizes all of his prior thematical material to bring you back into the world. With Howard's score, and Lawrence's direction, it makes the film feel familiar both aurally, and visually, which is simply what makes this film a phenomenal sequel that bests its predecessor.Everything that worked the first go around works once more, due to the careful attention in maintaining continuity, so if you were a fan of the first film, then buckle up and just enjoy the ride. Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss Everdeen. Her performance as Katniss in The Hunger Games was the best performance she ever gave, and I think was more deserving of the Oscar than her role in Silver Linings Playbook, and once more she proves why this is the role of a lifetime for her. She plays Katniss with such a raw, brutal honesty. There is nothing that feels faked about her portrayal, it simply feels like Jennifer, just baring her soul for all to see, and that is the most adventurous and awesome kind of acting there is.Other returning favorites to the cast all grow further in their roles and excel, but I was most pleased to see Donald Sutherland with even more screen time as President Snow. He relishes in this role, and it's clear that he is enjoying himself being the bad guy, but by having an actor of his caliber in his role, it lends a third dimension that would not come had he just been played by a mustache twirling character actor. Then there are the new cast additions. Sam Claflin as Finnick Odair, and most importantly, Jena Malone as Johanna Mason, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee. Malone in particular sets into this role that is so eccentric, so over-the-top, and manages to make Johanna somewhat relatable and real. Simply put, I could not find a weak performance in this film, and that's how I like it.All in all, I loved Catching Fire. The love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale, is given even more prominence this go around, and is peppered which much more complexity that the first film. You understand each and every person's feelings better, and their reasonings for why they feel that way. By the time Katniss finally kisses Peeta and you know it wasn't for show, you can't help but be moved by the moment. The sad thing is, while there is a romantic component to these stories, that is all anyone usually talks about.I think in some ways, these movies have created the kind of false pageantry that the Capitol forces on the people of the Districts. Sure, filmmaking is a business, even still, I truly believe that the writers, directors, and producers, for these films, have all understood what Suzanne Collins' novels were about. With that said, I have serious doubts that many, in particular of the teenage crowd, as well as the studio, see these works as anything other than another night on the town, and I think that's sad. It's sad that something so thematically important, and so emotionally rich, has essentially been turned into another cash-cow. It's not because of the books, because the books are phenomenal works of literature, and it's not because of the films, because as I've already said, Catching Fire wisely doesn't ever lose sight of the book's themes and never traipses into blockbuster territory. So why have we turned this into a blockbuster franchise akin to Star Wars or Harry Potter? These aren't simple good versus evil stories, and yet I think that's all most are seeing these as. It's why we're carting the cast off to premieres and mall appearances to turn them into teen heartthrobs. It's why the studio is constantly tracking the box office performance like it's a baseball game. It's why people are not looking at these books and films the right way. These are stories about real emotions, real relationships, and eerily familiar situations. I just wish the target audience would understand this, but it's not a fault against the films, because no matter how other people perceive Catching Fire, I know how I perceive it, and I am blown away once more by The Hunger Games.I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a 10 out of 10!",10,2,26,22 November 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla is King
","If you have been hankering for a good giant monster movie, then Godzilla definitely fits the bill. The King of the Monsters returns in true heroic fashion in this American-made reboot, that makes the last American-made attempt in 1998 look like a joke.In this Godzilla, when a new monster, named MUTO, starts to wreak havoc across the Pacific, he eventually draws the attention of Godzilla, leaving the humans to try and find a way to save humanity before we're all destroyed. There is a lot more to the story than that, but that is the basic gist of this movie. There are giant, radioactive monsters upsetting the balance of nature, and Godzilla must perform his sacred duties to restore that balance. As a matter of fact, that's one of my favorite things about this new Godzilla, is that they make him the hero of the story, by painting this idea that the reason for Godzilla's existence is to maintain the delicate balance of nature.Cutting straight to the point, the monsters are the stars of this movie. Like all Godzilla movies, the human characters are merely there for exposition and to create an emotional avatar for the audience to experience all the insanity through. Even still, there are some top notch talent creating that anchor, from small, yet crucial performances by Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche, to a nice Everyman turn by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins as scientists who are the source of all exposition. While I feel the filmmakers could have pushed the human characters a little bit further, all in all, the human characters always work to create empathy when they're on screen, and isn't that their purpose when the world is being destroyed around them?Truthfully, the real takeaway from this film, for me, is director Gareth Edwards. With just two feature films to his credit now, he has quickly become one of the directors to watch. Edwards' work here is nothing short of phenomenal. All of the action is represented from the perspective of the human characters, with cutaways to the monsters bashing one another rarely not seen, but rather experienced via destruction and how it is affecting the human characters on the ground. As well, Edwards has quite possibly the most important skill a director needs, which is a great sense of place. The way he shoots these action scenes, and any scene for that matter, gives you a great feel for the space in which each scene takes place in. You are rarely lost or confused when watching the chaos unfold in this film, and that's a credit to a meticulous craftsman.Ultimately, Godzilla is everything you could want from a Godzilla movie. While I feel the characters could have been pushed a little further towards a third dimension, they are relatable and perform their duty at setting up the epic battle at the end between Godzilla and not one, but two MUTOs. I especially loved the conspiracy theory angle that permeates the first half of the film, creating an air of eerie suspense that I really dug, as well, the musical score by Alexandre Desplat is very different than any of his other work, often harking back to the great John Williams' scores of past. Simply put, Godzilla is a great Summer blockbuster, and is the first one of Summer 2014 that is actually worth seeing.I give Godzilla a 9 out of 10!",9,7,16,16 May 2014
Looper," Food for Thought
","What happens in the future when the Mob wants to get rid of people? Well, they send them back in time of course. To a point in time where no one is looking for them. Standing in wait are these assassins named Loopers, who kill these time travelers on the spot and then incinerate the bodies. Of course, what happens when a future version of yourself is sent back and you must kill him, failing in the process? Well, now you're being hunted down while trying to set things right and kill yourself, I mean, your future self. Still with me? Because if you are, and you think that sounds cool, then you'll like the movie Looper.In the film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays a young Bruce Willis with eerie accuracy, in a large part thanks to some excellent prosthetic makeup. What's so enjoyable about this film though, is that it's just original. At every turn, writer/director Rian Johnson is turning your usual expectations for a sci-fi film on its head. The future is not full of flying cars and robots, but it's a more gritty, realistic idea, where only the rich have hover bikes, and the poor still drive wheeled vehicles. As well, things like telekinesis and time travel are treated as everyday things. There is some social commentary here, but that's not the real meat of Johnson's story. The real questions he proposes, is the age old question -- Can you change the future?While Looper bogs down in it's latter half, as Gordon-Levitt finds himself holed up at a farm with a single mother and her child (who could give Damien from The Omen a run for his money in terms of creepiness), Johnson manages to hold the film together and deliver an emotional ending. So it isn't perfect, but Looper is one of the more daringly original sci-fi films in a long while. Featuring stellar action, good performances, and plenty of food for thought, Looper is a worthy sci-fi successor in the Kubrickian-fashion.I give Looper an 8 out of 10!",8,0,3,4 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film). STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!

50_50," To Tell the Truth
","Adam is an ordinary 20-something: he has a job that he is passionate about, he has a girlfriend that his best friend despises, and he just happens to get diagnosed with a rare cancer that leaves his life chances at 50/50.50/50 is a rarity of the cinematic landscape. It deals with cancer in not a sentimental, Bucket List kind of way, but rather in a way that feels authentic. Adam does not embark on a vast journey to live his life to his fullest, he actually deteriorates before our eyes, having moments where he is happy due to the rapport and humor he has with his best friend Kyle, and at other times he is exceedingly grumpy.To be honest, the real star is writer Will Reiser, who wrote the story from his own personal battle with being a guy in his mid-20s diagnosed with cancer. This is what makes the story authentic. The dark humor that is sprinkled throughout, only a person who experienced this would be able to write from such a real perspective, rather than making everything dramatic. The thing is, in real life, no matter how bad the situation, there is still levity, there is still smiles and laughter, and Reiser captures that while also stirring the emotions through his screenplay. But don't go thinking 50/50 is a writer's showcase. The film sports a truly fine acting ensemble that brings Reiser's words to life.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives not his most controlled performance, but uses his everyman charm to make Adam a character worth rooting for. The biggest thing, is it is rare for me to see something with Seth Rogen in it and like it. He is perfect as Adam's friend, Kyle, who thinks the cure to cancer is using it to pick up chicks, but you really see how true a friend he is as he stands by Adam every step of the way. Anna Kendrick shines as Adam's young, 24-year-old therapist, who knows everything a book can teach but has no life experience, while Angelica Houston manages to steal the few scenes she is in as Adam's doting mother who is trying to deal with her son's cancer diagnosis whilst taking care of Adam's father with Altzheimer's (who Serge Houde makes the most out of simple reactions). And I know he's not an actor, I just wanna mention Michael Giacchino's magnificently refined score. Giacchino, known for big, verbose scores that sweep the viewer up in masterful uses of strings, keeps it simple here with soft electric guitar and piano, resulting in a soothing musical score that fits the piece perfectly.Now, being fair, 50/50 was not without its faults. This is director Jonathan Levine's sophomore effort, and one can tell he is still young. There are times where his use of soft focus overpowered the performances of his actors, and he drew attention to his directing trying to create the emotion through the shot rather than through the actor's performances and the shot just being an aid. This is seen throughout the movie as he rarely sits on a close-up long enough to give the audience some time to read the actor's facial expressions and feel their performances. This is a weakness to the story, but one that does not keep Reiser's screenplay and the fabulous ensemble from pulling the viewer through, thanks to the sheer emotional landscape going from laugh-out-loud humor to tear duct-filled drama.I give 50/50 a 9 out of 10!",9,1,2,5 October 2011
Deadpool," A Spoiler-Free Review
","If you like your movies violent and vulgar, then Deadpool is right for you. Based on the Marvel Comics character, Deadpool is about Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, a masked merc with a mouth who is on a mission to find the jerks who physically scarred him, and that's about the whole movie right there. Deadpool is essentially one long chase movie with flashbacks thrown in to give the chase context. Ultimately, how much you enjoy the movie simply boils down to how funny you find Ryan Reynold's filthy-mouthed portrayal of Deadpool. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a fun superhero movie for the whole family, this movie has a hard R-rating, and deservedly so. While I personally found a lot of the violence, nudity, and language unnecessary, we live in a day-and-age where so many are desensitized to these things, I know I'm in the minority. Bottom line, if you enjoy movies that are as rude, crude, and socially unacceptable as possible, Deadpool is right for you.I give Deadpool a 5 out of 10!",5,1,5,4 June 2016
Cloud Atlas," An Almost Masterpiece
","There are many things one could call Cloud Atlas -- ambitious, emotional, thought-provoking -- and all of those things would be rightly justified. Quite simply, it's the hardest movie to sum up in words.The film, directed by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer, is a collection of six stories set in different time periods, ranging from the 1800s to modern day, all the way to two stories set in the future. With Cloud Atlas, it has a seemingly simple aim, to try and show how the smallest acts a person can make can impact and shape mankind's future. This is done brilliantly as an 1800's man details his story in memoirs, which are read by an aspiring composer in the 1930s, who writes a piece (that becomes the film's unforgettable theme) that is heard by an investigative reporter in the 1970s, and so on and so forth. This could have easily been a boring slog fest, as the Wachowskis and Tykwer tried to piece everything together, but what makes the story work is how they jump back and forth between each time period.Each time period represents a different genre of film: one story is a comedy, one is a drama about artistic passion, another is a period drama, and one is like a political thriller akin to All The President's Men. Add on to those, two futuristic sci-fi stories, and it creates an intrigue in the viewer to try and piece together how these stories are connected, not making it completely obvious at first how these six stories are similar. Where everything starts coming together is how the Wachowskis and Tykwer use parallel action to unfurl the story. What is happening in one time period will mirror what is happening in another time period, where they are crosscutting between multiple time periods to form one scene that has a larger impact than any one time period could offer on its own. It's this use of thematic similarities that ultimately ties everything together.Each story is about a person doing something against the established order to try and create something greater than what has ever come before. It's this thematic idea that each story represents that makes the film so emotionally powerful when all of the revelations start to be revealed. As it is, this is one of the more unique films I've ever seen because of the storytelling. The way the story does not conform to traditional storytelling methods by intercutting between the different genres, constantly keeps you on your toes and keeps you engaged. I mean, here in one scene you'll be in a broad comedy, then the next you'll be in a thriller, and the next you'll be in an action flick. However, the storytelling is not the only thing makes this film truly one of the most ambitious films ever made, it's the approach to the acting.The story uses the same group of actors in every time period, from Tom Hanks to Halle Berry to Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. They do this by using makeup and prosthetics to change the actor's looks. At times, some of the actors are completely unrecognizable -- I mean, who ever thought they'd see Hugh Grant as a post-apocalyptic cannibal? Take Halle Berry, for example: she plays an old Asian man, a white Jewish woman, and an African American woman, all in the same movie. Every one of these actors relish in the opportunity to play such vastly different characters, many of which are unlike any they've ever been able to play before. In this one film, you see charming Tom Hanks, mobster Tom Hanks, villain Tom Hanks, and even a Tom Hanks who is plagued by a dark force battling inside of him. I'll just say it, I have never seen this done before, and I am not sure I ever will again, and that is what makes Cloud Atlas such an important film.With all this said, Cloud Atlas is not for everyone. Not everyone will like the way the story is told, and not everyone will connect with it as I have, but for individuals who like something that tries different ways to tell stories and to express emotions and ideas, this is a film for you. It's impressive, exceptionally well acted and exquisitely well made on every level, featuring one of the most beautiful endings in any movie I've seen in recent memory. Cloud Atlas is close to a flawless movie, if only it didn't drag for about the first half hour, as you're left wanting for forward momentum and not exposition. So what? It's an A+ for originality, but unfortunately I must grade the entire film.I give Cloud Atlas a 9 out of 10!",9,10,22,28 October 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A Spoiler-Free Review
","At once a slick spy movie in the Sixties' James Bond mold, while also being a satire of those films, Kingsman: The Secret Service reminds me of films like Hot Fuzz in how it sends up the tropes of a genre by making a good movie in that genre at the same time. The Kingsmen are an independent spy organization modeled after the ideals of being a gentleman and protecting others. Director Matthew Vaughn delivers more of what he is known for here, slick visuals, kinetic action sequences, and a fair amount of blood spatter, and yet I found myself not only entertained but emotionally involved as well. A large part of the film's success in those regards is the relationship between Colin Firth's Kingsman named Galahad and his twenty-something protégé, Taron Egerton's Eggsy who goes from a street kid to Kingsman all in the course of a two hour movie. The bottom line is, you wind up liking all of the characters because Vaughn cast the right actors in each of the roles, I mean, Samuel L. Jackson is so charismatic as the Bondish bad guy Valentine that you almost want him to succeed. While had this film dialed down the blood and usage of the f-word it could have easily achieved a PG-13 rating, compared to a lot of other action movies in the modern era, this one is almost tame (key word, almost). Truth be told, none of the gratuity of this film bothered me as much as other movies made in a similar vein, and a large part of that is that the film never really lingers on anything gratuitous, it just kind of moves on with the story, focusing more so on the characters and what's happening with them. So at the end of the day, if you enjoy a good spy movie, or simply an action movie with likable characters and some clever laughs interspersed throughout, Kingsman: The Secret Service will more than satisfy.I give Kingsman: The Secret Service a 9 out of 10!",9,2,9,13 February 2015
Fantastic Four," The Fantastic Four Rocks!
","Going into this movie I thought it would be awful,but I was wrong.It was a great,fun movie.This story starts with five scientists going into space to examine a cosmic storm.They get to their space station and begin to prepare for the storm,but the storm comes early and their shields are down and the storm hits transforming the five into:Mr. Fantastic,The Invisible Girl,The Thing,The Human Torch,and the evil Doctor Doom.To start it off the story was fairly good,the only real problem I had with it was they changed a few minor details from the comic,but none of them were big enough to destroy the movie.One thing I really loved is how well they took the comedic aspect of the comics and transferred them to the movie.I also loved how quickly the story moved which made it feel like only an hour long,but one of its strongpoints is also one of its weakpoints.The movie sometimes moved so fast you missed some stuff.My only other problem with it was that I wished the final fight was longer because it was so cool.But every thing else was spectacular.The directing was great,and so was the acting(especially Gruffud,Evans,and Chiklis).The sets,props,and costumes all looked spectacular,and so did the special effects.If this movie didn't have such good special effects it would have fallen flat on its face,but it didn't.The score was also really good,although it had no real memorable theme it was real good and it fit the tone and mood of the movie really well.All in all it was a great,fun movie that everyone will enjoy.If you just see one movie this weekend go see the Fantastic Four,this movie rocks!A great: 8/10!!!!",8,4,8,9 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My Favorite Film of All-Time!!!!!
","The Empire Strikes Back, formally known as Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, is the sequel to the superb Star Wars. Empire is one of those few occasions in movie history where I think the sequel has surpassed its predecessor, it just wasn't a remake of the original it took the story of the original in amazing new directions. The script, the directing, editing, special effects, everything is just head and shoulders better. This movie is also one of the first times in Hollywood history where the bad guys actually won. The movie superbly expands upon the original story-wise as well, the romance between Han and Leia is great, and the big revelation at the end of the film is probably the most shocking moment in film history. Although George Lucas didn't direct this installment, Irvin Kershner did superb. This is just a picture perfect film that did everything right and is my favorite film of all-time.Rating: A picture perfect 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,1,2,13 October 2007
Inside Llewyn Davis," Not the Coens' Finest, But Still Worth Your Time
","The new Coen Brothers film, Inside Llewyn Davis, is very much a Coen Brothers film in its dark sense of humor, with its pessimistic story of failure, yet it kind of feels like a been there done that exercise.The film follows the titular Llewyn Davis, a struggling folk singer in Greenwich Village in the 1960s. Llewyn is the kind of complete and total mess that the Coens seem to be drawn to. Llewyn is not the nicest guy on Earth, he bums off friends, sleeping on couches with nowhere to call home, and yet we still like him. Why? Perhaps it's because the Coen Brothers know what they're doing when they write characters like this. If anyone knows how to make a tragic, seemingly unlikable character likable, it's the Coen Brothers through their witty dialogue. Of course, while this is an enjoyable film in the Coen-style, it fails to really differentiate itself from many other films in their filmography.Here's the thing, Inside Llewyn Davis features superb performances from the actors, in particular Oscar Isaac as Llewyn, and the songs produced by T Bone Burnett are all sensational, but aside from those elements, it feels like we're watching A Serious Man or Barton Fink all over again. Perhaps if you've never seen any other Coen Brothers films, Inside Llewyn Davis might feel a little more fresh, however don't go thinking that I disliked this film, I just think it pales in comparison to their previous works as writers and directors for a few key reasons. The film drags a little bit in the middle portions, especially when Llewyn is on a strange road trip with John Goodman, and the ending was a tad confusing, drawing into question what the Coens were really trying to say with this whole story. For these reasons, Inside Llewyn Davis just failed to live up to the heights of what the Coen Brothers have previously achieved.I give Inside Llewyn Davis an 8 out of 10!",8,1,2,21 January 2014
Gangs of New York," A Bona Fide Gangster Movie
","Gangs of New York is a film that has many of Martin Scorsese's typical trademark flourishes and is a worthy film to add to his legendary filmography.The film follows a young Irish immigrant named Amsterdam as he travels through the cutthroat gangs of New York City in 1862, searching for his father's killer, the untouchable, Bill the Butcher.The themes of revenge and vengeance run rampant throughout the film. Amsterdam wishes to avenge his father's murder. Amsterdam's friend Johnny betrays Amsterdam to the Butcher out of revenge for stealing the girl of his dreams. Even Bill the Butcher's striking down of Priest Valon was an act of revenge after the Priest removed his eye.The film was superbly directed by the great Martin Scorsese. The production design was stunning, but what impressed me the most was the acting, in particular Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher. Day-Lewis disappeared within this role like he does with nearly every part he's ever played, and he was definitely on top of his game here as the chilling Butcher.While the film kind of chugs a bit in the middle parts, the beginning and the end form terrific bookends to a highly entertaining, and extremely well-made film.I give Gangs of New York a 9 out of 10!",9,0,1,9 October 2009
Spectre," Spectre is Nothing Short of Spectacular!!!
","If Skyfall was the deconstruction of James Bond, Spectre is the reconstruction. Daniel Craig has returned once more as 007, with Spectre marking his fourth (and potentially final) outing as the character. In Spectre, Bond follows a cryptic message from his past, which leads him to the evil criminal organization known as SPECTRE. After three films, this is the first of the Daniel Craig Bond films that feels more like the Sean Connery/Roger Moore-era Bond adventures, and that is a good thing.Longtime Bond fans should know all about SPECTRE, who were the very same criminal organization that terrorized Bond for almost all of the Sean Connery films (save for Goldfinger). Due to some issues involving legal rights, the filmmakers have not been able to use SPECTRE since the early-to-mid Seventies. Ultimately, the rights were returned just a couple of years ago and now we have SPECTRE's triumphant return in a film that hits all of the beats one expects of a classic Bond adventure: exotic locales, an imposing henchman, some sultry Bond girls with troubled pasts, cool gadgets, and a maniacal villain in the form of Christoph Waltz's Franz Oberhauser. On top of all that, Spectre is chock full of great Bond moments. From an opening action sequence that features one of the finest Bond fight scenes ever, to a Swiss Alps duel between Bond in a plane and the bad guys in SUVs, Spectre finally turns Daniel Craig's Bond into the superhero the character once was, and the 12-year- old inside of me loves it. Of course, the single greatest element of Spectre is not necessarily it's throwback feel or the fact that it's the first Daniel Craig Bond that fully embraces the Bond mythos, but it's how this film effectively ties together all of Craig's Bond movies.Featuring nods to the events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall, Spectre kind of feels like the end to the whole enchilada. In some ways, that's good. It has been rumored that this might be Daniel Craig's last Bond film, and if it is, then it is an amazing end to his tenure. No other actor who has ever played Bond has had a run of films as strong as Craig's, and a large part of that is that all of these films have been direct sequels to the others. None of the other Bond films ever really acknowledged any character growth or story progressions from one film to the next, but the Daniel Craig movies all have. The Bond in Casino Royale was brash and impulsive. The Bond in Quantum of Solace was moody and violent in response to Vesper Lynd's death. As for Skyfall, Bond was tired and worn down, a relic searching for a purpose. And Spectre finds Bond struggling with the repercussions of his past while finding his heart and soul once again. By the time the credits roll on Spectre, you really feel as if a myth has been born and Bond is back in tip top shape, better than ever.I give Spectre a 9 out of 10!",9,84,160,8 November 2015
Her," You'll Never Look at Siri the Same Way Again
","Writer/director Spike Jonze is a genuine original, and his newest film, Her, is unlike any other film you'll ever see. While many have jokingly called the film, 'Siri: The Movie,' that statement isn't that far off from what the film is. Her tells the story of Theodore, a lonely man who's recently divorced, who finds a special connection with the AI operating system named Samantha on his phone and computer. What follows is one of the most unique romance films the cinema has ever seen. Long distance relationships are hard, but how do you even have a relationship when one person doesn't even have a body? It's these questions that are at the forefront of this film, and Spike Jonze manages to micro-analyze the ideas of love and what true love means through the lens of this story.Joaquin Phoenix has the unenviable task of portraying Theodore, who spends more than half of the film acting with thin air. For this performance to be as emotionally honest and sincere as it is, it took tons of imagination on Phoenix's behalf and he knocks the role out of the park. In many ways, it's a shame he's not nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. As for the voice of Samantha, actress Scarlett Johansson delivers a soulful performance that manages to bring this artificial voice to life, so that we actually care about her, the same as Theodore does.Spike Jonze manages to keep the film engaging for most of its two hour runtime, by and large thanks to Phoenix and Johansson, but Her does kind of get stuck in a bit of a loop around the hour mark. It kind of feels like the film could have said everything it needed to say in an hour and a half, rather than in two hours, with many scenes often feeling like retreads of scenes that occurred thirty minutes before. While this film is thematically rich and needs time to explore these themes, the impact of the thematic ideas can often not be as strong if drawn out, and that's what happens here. Even with that all said, Spike Jonze's words and retro-Hipster vision of the near future are so sensational you're willing to forgive a little indulgence. Personally, I love the way video games are in a few years, but the high-waisted pants? No thanks.I give Her a 9 out of 10!",9,7,13,21 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Danny Boyle's Best Film to Date!
","Slumdog Millionaire is one of those rare films that comes along every once in a while that is simply breathtaking, and it achieves this status not through big flashy special effects or massive Hollywood set pieces, but rather through its unique direction, superb writing, amazing acting, and genuine heart.Slumdog Millionaire is the story of a young man named Jamal who grew up in the slums of India. Jamal has found his way onto India's version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'. The story starts, Jamal is only one question away from winning the jackpot, 20 million rupees, but the show ends shortly before he can get to the final question, so he must wait until the next episode to finish his run. After leaving the show, Jamal is kidnapped by the Indian police and is accused of cheating. Through his interrogation, Jamal describes in flashbacks just how he knew all of the various answers to the questions from different points in his life, as well we end up learning why he even went on the show in the first place.This film is quite easily Danny Boyle's best film of his career thus far. It has all of his usual trademarks that you expect from his directing, but it has something more that many of his previous films did not have, a true heart. That's right, Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in years, and Danny Boyle's kinetic direction keeps the film rolling at a terrific pace, while never forsaking the true heart of the story.The film as well features terrific acting from all of its cast, especially Dev Patel who plays the oldest incarnation of Jamal. Also the film's script, written by Full Monty scribe Simon Beaufoy, is simply marvelous and is one of the best written scripts I have seen in a long time.To sum it all up, Slumdog Millionaire is easily one of the best films I have seen in a while. It is Oscar worthy in every single sense. If you see just one more film this year, make sure that it is Slumdog Millionaire, you will not regret it.I give Slumdog Millionaire a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,5,10,26 December 2008
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Far Better Than Its Predecessor!
","After the complete let down that was Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay is back with Transformers: Dark of the Moon, sans-Megan Fox, and while not as good as the original Transformers, Dark of the Moon manages to pack enough thrills and emotion into its two and a half hour frame to be more than Summer movie drivel.In 1961, an Autobot spacecraft crashlanded on the far side of the moon, sparking the space race between the Soviets and the United States. While Dark of the Moon rewrites some history, the whole shebang gains some credibility when the real Buzz Aldrin makes a cameo to talk to the Autobots about the real reason him and Neil Armstrong went to the moon in 1969. As it is, this spaceship held ancient Cybertronian technology that, if in the hands of the villainous Decepticons, could mean the end of all humanity.Meanwhile, we catch back up with Shia LaBeouf's lovable everyman Sam Witwicky. In the first Transformers, Sam went from being a boy to a man through his getting a car that just happened to be a transformer. Film two did nothing to advance the character further, but this film finds Sam fresh out of college, no job, no government clearance, even though he has saved the world two times in the past and has a medal from the President to prove it. Sam wants to do something that matters, like he did when he was working alongside the Autobots saving the planet. At least he has his new girlfriend, Carly, played by Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is ogled by Michael Bay's camera every chance it gets, however she surprisingly has some real acting chops and delivers a far more likable performance than Megan Fox ever did. The romance between Sam and Carly is actually portrayed believably through Huntington-Whiteley's hot attitude and LaBeouf's great sense of goofy comedic timing, making it logical that a girl like that would fall for a guy like Sam Witwicky. Together she helps him realize that through their relationship, that this is what matters, and not being a hero.As it is, the action is all top notch, even through the final hour of nonstop explosions and metal crunching leaving little time to know what happens to these characters post-apocalypse rescue. Bringing us around to the length of this movie. Two and a half hours is a long time to watch transformers duke it out. I love that the humans got more to do this time around, but the movie really wears itself long, and could have been more impactful had some of the usual Michael Bay gags been toned down a bit more. Much more time was spent on gags, when that time could have been used to help flesh out the underdeveloped relationship between Optimus Prime and new badguy, Sentinel Prime. Even still, majority of the gags are funny, however Ken Jeong's whole character was flat out annoying, luckily he was only in the movie for three minutes, enough time to dispense a plot point and get killed by a Decepticon. As for other new cast members, John Malkovich as Sam's new boss ultimately goes nowhere other than a few unnecessary gags, however Frances McDormand is highly enjoyable as the government agent in charge of the Autobots, and Patrick Dempsey plays an intriguing human chameleon working for the Decepticons.With everything said and done, Transformers: Dark of the Moon could have done with a little trimming of some of the gags that don't necessarily add to the primary theme of Sam's journey through this story, however the action is superb, and many of the gags are quite funny. As well, the movie emotionally involves you in the story between Carly and Sam, and the connection between Sam and his transforming car, Bumblebee, is just as poignant as it was when Sam tried to save Bumblebee from the government in film one; when the transformers fly off in their rocket ship and Sam and Bumblebee must part ways, it's gut wrenching! Even at two and a half hours long, viewers will enthrall to this adventure that blends metal with heart and makes for an enjoyable trip to the movies.I give Transformers: Dark of the Moon an 8 out 10!",8,1,6,2 July 2011
The Social Network," All He Wants to be is Somebody
","What's the point of being rich if you have no friends? The opening credits of The Social Network play over a scene of future Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) solitarily running across the Harvard campus, passing socializing college kids without a second glance from Zuckerberg. Mark has just been broken up with by this beautiful girl because Mark could not understand the concept of human relationships. All Mark wants to be is somebody, and he gets that wish, if nothing else, in the end.The Social Network tells the story of the founding of the now famous social networking website, Facebook, and all of the lawsuits and broken relationships it took to create the source of friendships for the 21st century. In a way, writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher have crafted a modern day Shakespearean tragedy. No, there is no murder, but there is a ton of backstabbing. Nowadays, we don't need to kill to usurp power, we just need money, and more of it. Whether Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from some collegiate athletes wanting to make a Harvard dating website or not, this is all irrelevant, the bottom line is, Zuckerberg, like all great tragic heroes, made the wrong alliances (Sean Parker, founder of Napster) and alienated his only real friend (Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook and former CFO).Actor Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin with such an emotional range, that I would say Garfield's performance is the heart of the movie. You feel for Eduardo being phased out of the company by his one and only friend and Zuckerberg's new 'so-called friend' Sean Parker, played surprisingly well by Justin Timberlake in fantastic acting form. The true reason Eduardo is phased out is never really explained, maybe Mark was always jealous that Eduardo was more popular than he, or that Sean felt threatened by Eduardo's business prowess. The worst part is, and this is what really makes The Social Network a tragedy, is that Mark spent so many hours working on his computer with headphones on, tuning out the rest of the world, that he never listened to reason and lost his only legitimate friend. This turn towards pathos in the final scenes of the movie are played exceptionally well by Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. With just one look, Eisenberg manages to convey a range of unsaid emotions, that while he is still talking like the world's biggest socially awkward jerk, he knows what he's lost.I give The Social Network a 10 out of 10!",10,5,9,13 October 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Search for the Holy Grail!
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third outing for everyone's favorite Nazi fighting archaeologist, Indiana Jones, except this time around his father joins in on the adventure, Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (played by Sean Connery).The story begins with a small scene where we meet a young Indiana Jones, within this scene we learn pretty much how he becomes the archaeologist we now know, we also learn why he is afraid of snakes. We then flash forward to an adult Indiana Jones (played once more by Harrison Ford), Indy learns that his father has gone missing while searching for the Holy Grail, the cup used by Jesus in the Last Supper. Indy, and his colleague Marcus Brody(Denholm Elliott), travel to Venice, the last place his father was seen. At Venice Indy hopes to learn what has happened to his father. After a few daring battles and such, Indy finally discovers what happened to his father, he is being held captive by the Nazis. Indy rushes to rescue his father from the Nazis, but in turn gets captured himself, and his love interest turns on him here and reveals she is a Nazi. It is here that Indiana learns that the Nazis are searching for the Holy Grail and want to use his father's knowledge on the subject to obtain it. Together, Indy and his father escape the Nazis and begin a race against Nazi troops to discover the Holy Grail before they do. On their journey they are joined by two of Indy's most colorful and exciting sidekicks, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Brody. Together all four of them try to thwart the Nazi army.Last Crusade is yet another fun Indiana Jones adventure, and while I may not enjoy this one as much as the other two in the series, it is still a very worthy successor. Last Crusade is once more directed by Steven Spielberg, who does just another marvelous job. The script by Jeffrey Boam is really good, it may be a little bit more jokey than the first two Indy adventures, but it is by no means a poorly written script. The acting in this one steals the show, in particular Sean Connery as Indy's father is really quite fun and exciting. Then John William's score is just the icing on the top. Everything else: cinematography, art direction, special effects, etc., are perfect.My only minor complaint comes in the fact that they played up the comedy aspect of Indiana Jones a bit more in this adventure than the others, for this reason I found it harder to connect to the characters a little more so than in the first two. After Temple of Doom they tried to lighten up the franchise, and they did very well at that, but I slightly preferred the darker atmosphere of Temple of Doom compared to this one. Still even though I may not have been a huge fan of them adding all of this extra comedy, I must say that all of the jokes and gags are funny, as well the action is really stunning. Each action set piece is as well constructed as any of the others in the other films.Overall it is still a fun Indiana Jones adventure, and many will prefer this one with the added comedic aspect to it. Now don't take this as me hating this film, because I love it, I just prefer the first two Indy films more.A superb 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,18 February 2008
The Great Gatsby," A Spoiler-Free Review
","You know, I've never been the biggest fan of both F. Scott Fitzgerald and director Baz Luhrman, so when Luhrman announced he was adapting Fitzgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby for the big-screen, I had very low expectations, and in those regards I was surprised by the film, but it still does not make me a fan of Luhrman or Fitzgerald. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular Gatsby, and he's charming and does his usual Leonardo DiCaprio thing here, but it's a fairly safe performance by an actor who is capable of far more reaching material, however, part of the reasoning for that is that this film never really takes flight. This is an emotionally cold story, and it's hard to relate to rich people lavishing in their own extravagance when very few people are actually that wealthy. Not to mention the fact that all of the melodrama comes across as trite and soap opera-like in our more modern time where we've seen just about every genre clichÃ© this films features hundreds of times before. Even still, this is a visually sumptuous film that is vibrant and energetic in its style, with some solid performances from the cast. It's just one of those films that if you aren't already a fan of the book or the director's previous works, you will find very little to latch onto here and enjoy.I give The Great Gatsby a 6 out of 10!",6,0,2,16 December 2013
Warm Bodies," Not Perfect, but Really Funny
","Warm Bodies is an interesting zombie movie that tries to answer the central question: Can zombies find love? It's a funny premise, one that is entertaining to watch unfold, but in order for the filmmakers to make it work and give it a Hollywood ending, they kind of go against the grain of what we always have known about zombies. Nicholas Hoult plays R, a zombie who falls in love with a human girl, portrayed by Tersea Palmer. R takes Palmer's character back to his home inside a derelict airplane and tries to woo her. These are the film's best moments, where we as the audience hear R's human thoughts, but all he can do is act and talk like a zombie. Where the movie starts to lose its momentum is when all of the zombies start turning back into humans because R's love with this human has sparked their hearts to come alive once again. I know the whole idea of zombies is far-fetched, but this is really making serious logic jumps even in the zombie world. If these zombies were created through disease or nuclear radiation, love can't just cure them of these things. They'd need a medical cure as well. Honestly, this is just me being nitpicky, because the real take away from Warm Bodies is that it's a fresh and original comedy, that features a spectacularly heartfelt performance from star Nicholas Hoult, even if he is playing a zombie.I give Warm Bodies an 8 out of 10!",8,0,1,20 June 2013
Sully," Another Success for Eastwood
","Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, Sully, is a movie worthy of the accolades it has received. Detailing the true story of the Miracle on the Hudson and the NTSB investigation that followed for pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (played with extreme likability by Tom Hanks), Sully is another strong movie in a string of recent hits for Mr. Eastwood. While it would be very easy to wonder how a 90-minute drama could be created detailing an event that occurred in about two minutes of real time, screenwriter Todd Komarnicki tells the story non-linearly to keep a sense of momentum. One way that Komarnicki and Eastwood help keep the story fresh is they revisit the crash at multiple intervals and detail it from a different perspective -- similar to Akira Kursoawa's classic, Rashomon -- by doing this in parallel with the NTSB investigation, Sully maintains a sense of white knuckle suspense for the entirety of the movie. That is the true brilliance of this movie. While we already know how the story ends, Clint Eastwood manages to keep our stomach tied up knots because of his smart directorial choices, using minimal music and not overplaying the actual crash but showing it as it harrowingly happened in real life.I give Sully a 9 out of 10!",9,0,3,8 November 2016
Princess Mononoke," An Epic Masterpiece!
","Princess Mononoke is a rare film, one that manages to transcend its animated exterior and become simply an amazing film.Princess Mononoke is an epic fantasy, following the battle between the ancient forest spirits in feudal Japan and the persistent humans that are pillaging their forests. It is a beautiful tale about love, humanity, and the environment.Director Hayao Miyazaki is simply a master at his craft. Not only is the film highly imaginative, well drawn, and has a very tight story; it is also a highly emotional film that will not only make you feel, but also make you think. Miyazaki weaves his environmental message into the story, taking center stage amongst all the epic conflict, making you grow to appreciate the great outdoors even more after viewing this film. Not only that, Miyazaki shows us how awful war truly is, he makes us realize all the sacrifice and loss involved. He does not glorify the battles within this film, he shows them in a very real, almost upsetting fashion (or as real as war can be represented in a fantasy). Though Princess Mononoke is also a story of real love. The romance between the warrior Ashitaka and the wolf princess San is beautiful, and very real in how it unfolds. In the midst of all this conflict, these two opposites come together and form a force that is stronger than all.Even still Princess Mononoke is also a terrific action film. The action set pieces in this film are many, all being extremely inventive and exciting to watch. The opening battle with the possessed boar and San's attack on Iron Town are among two of the finer action sequences in the film. Of course the one that is truly the stand out battle scene is the battle between the humans and the boars. This battle is played out in a very affecting, very artistic way, and is definitely one of the more memorable sequences of the film.This film is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest. It is far more mature than any of his other films, and that might be why it's so special to me. It's a film that is different, but relishes in it, delivering a film that is not just a good animated film, but simply a terrific film in general.I give Princess Mononoke a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,1,2,28 July 2009
Jurassic Park," Who doesn't love dinosaurs?
","Jurassic Park is one of the landmark films of my childhood. One of the earliest memories I have of ever going to see a movie at a movie theater was of seeing this movie. For simple nostalgic reasons this has always been one of my favorite movies, but I think in a way I never fully appreciated the film until I have become an adult.Jurassic Park is truly up there with Jaws as one of the most thrilling monster movies of all-time. Each time Tim and Lex get chased by the velociraptors, my heart pounds. When the T-Rex attacks the jeep on that rainy night, I always get filled with raw excitement. It is hard not to be thrilled by Jurassic Park's many death defying set pieces, but the film truly shines thanks to its characters and its director.What makes Jurassic Park more than your average amusement park ride, is that the director, Steven Spielberg, knew that the film would need great characters in order for the audience to feel any sort of attachment to the film's story. This was a ploy in which he utilized so well in the past in Jaws, and he does here once again with Jurassic Park. The story of Alan Grant leading Tim and Lex through the dinosaur filled Jurassic Park would have not been as thrilling, or even as heartwarming, if Alan Grant was a fan of children. Still the characters on the page were not enough, they needed great actors to bring them to life, which Jurassic Park had; ranging from Sam Neil to Richard Attenborough. I mean could you imagine watching Jurassic Park without Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. It's almost impossible isn't it.Overall I think Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated films in movie history. The classic Spielberg magic is there, and in my opinion even more so than Jaws. What Spielberg did with Jurassic Park was give it an awe inspiring scale, but also he gave this film true heart. As a kid I thought this was one of the greatest films of all-time, and I still think the same today.I give Jurassic Park a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,3,5,12 March 2009
Valkyrie," Terrific Entertainment!
","Valkyrie is the latest film from director Bryan Singer, after many delays the film has finally been released, and I must say that it was definitely worth the wait.The film is about the assassination plot against Hitler, formulated by military officials. The leader of this plot was Col. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise). These officials knowingly committed treason in hopes of successfully killing Hitler.The film was superbly directed by Bryan Singer, who re-enforces himself once more as one of the film industries greatest living filmmakers. As well the script by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander was terrific. Of course the true highlight of the film was the amazing acting. The cast, ranging from Kenneth Brannagh to Tom Cruise himself, was stellar. It almost seemed as if every single character actor in the film industry was cast in this movie.While some have given this film flack for the simple fact that you pretty much know the ending before the film even starts, the film still manages to be a tense and highly entertaining thriller that not only will keep the audience on the edge of their seat, but also the ending will evoke a deep emotional response from the very same audience.Valkyrie is Bryan Singer back in true form. It is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and I am greatly looking forward to seeing this film over and over again.I give Valkyrie a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,5,8,3 January 2009
The Martian," Speed Review
","The Martian is simply put, a phenomenal film. The story follows Matt Damon as astronaut Mark Watney, who while during a violent dust storm on a mission to Mars, gets separated from his crew on the way to their ship. They believe him to be dead and leave him on Mars as they return home to Earth. Now stranded, Watney has to find a way to survive till he can contact NASA and coordinate a return home. You might think I just spoiled the whole movie for you, but this is literally the first 5-10 minutes! Now, I wouldn't blame anyone thinking that a movie like this might be a downer, but it is not. The Martian is a movie that balances all of the intensity of the situation with humor and heart. Matt Damon's performance is comforting even when things get rough and the character personalities are all so great from every actor involved, that you care what happens. In short, The Martian is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit (I know, a cliché), and the ability of the human spirit to problem solve in order to survive.I give The Martian a 10 out of 10!",10,3,7,8 November 2015
The Fighter," The Pride of Lowell, Massachusetts!
","Two brothers. First there is Dickie, a crack addict, who just also happens to be a washed up fighter, now trainer for his younger brother, who is boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward. Then, there is Micky, a boxer who must battle his own family before he can become a legend in the ring. The Fighter is a familial drama with some sports in it, but like all of the greatest boxing movies, it is when the characters are outside of the ring that the movie wins one over.Micky's family is what one would call a convoluted battle of the wills. They do not take too kindly to outsiders, or doing things outside of the family, so it is no wonder that neither Dickie, Micky, nor their sisters are married, and you'll fully understand this when you meet their domineering mother, Alice, played to crisp perfection by Melissa Leo. Adding to the strain is Charlene, Micky's new girlfriend, played exceptionally well by Amy Adams, who sees the potential in Micky to be something great, but he must first overcome his family and become his own man if he is to be champion. Actor Mark Whalberg is the heart-and-soul of the movie as Micky Ward, and what more can anyone say about Christian Bale's no holds barred performance as Dickie. This movie is an actor's showcase, featuring some of the best acting you will see in a longtime, and I think a lot of the credit should go to director, David O. Russell.Russell shoots everything very naturally, there is a flow to it, like the human observer watching these things unfold rather than him intentionally leading us by the hand and manipulating us like so many sports movies have done. I've gotta say, the fight scenes filmed like HBO fights on television was a brilliant choice, not to mention the opening credits when Micky and Dickie walk like kings through the streets of their hometown of Lowell, Mass., these and so many other scenes are just some of the more finely crafted scenes to be projected on the big screen in a long time. In the end, the movie still manages to be uplifting and makes you wanna cheer Micky on, but you don't feel as if you were watching characters, but real people persevere and simply live, that is The Fighter's strong suit, and it is better for it.I give The Fighter a 10 out of 10!",10,3,4,27 January 2011
Up in the Air," Challenging, But Rewarding
","Up in the Air is an ethereal movie-going experience. I don't think there is any other way to put it. The movie is relevant, realistic, and at the same time, oddly beautiful. While the movie starts off snarky and very savvy, it later on slips into the true realities of life and meaning.The film stars George Clooney as downsizing expert, Ryan Bingham. Ryan works for a corporation who loans out guys like Ryan to big companies all over the country to lay off their work force, so essentially he fires people for a salary. Ryan has no real connections in his life and considers airport terminals his home. Seeing as how he nearly has 10 million frequent flyer miles and is traveling about 320 days out of the year, I'd say that is an astute observation. Ryan's way of life is threatened when a young college grad starts working alongside him and has developed a way to fire people via webchat rather than traveling all over the country at an expense. Ryan is opposed, but has a chance to possibly settle down with Alex (played to crisp perfection by Vera Farmiga), a soul mate if there ever has been. She is a frequently flyer too, and as stated in the film, is essentially the female version of Ryan.It's kind of odd watching this film and wondering whether the filmmakers had any idea what kind of state our nation's economy would be in at this time. I guess it was foresight or whatnot, but the film plays out so much more powerfully in this current economic crisis than I think it would in any other time. Much like The Grapes of Wrath, Up in the Air captures the realities of this economy. What it captures though isn't Midwest farmers, but rather the turmoil of the corporate world, where nearly every company is downsizing and having to lay people off. This is played out wonderfully in many sequences, in particular when actor J.K. Simmons steps in for a small one scene cameo, but he makes the most of it, as Ryan convinces Simmons to pursue his dreams of become a chef.At the end of the day, this film is all about people. The recurring theme rampant throughout Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner's witty screenplay, is the concept of connection, and in some cases the lack thereof. Anna Kendrick is a delight as Ryan's young, fresh-out-of-college protégé, who Ryan has been forced to show her the ropes. She challenges Clooney's character, and acts as if she has it all figured out, but Clooney just shoots her down like a one-winged duck. Then, there is Vera Farmiga as Clooney's love interest, Alex. Farmiga is very flirtatious in the role and plays off Clooney and his charm extremely well, so well in fact that you wont even see the truck coming when it hits. Though the real star here is George Clooney himself.Clooney is essentially playing himself, but I think that is what makes this performance all the more affecting. In order to have achieved the emotions required by this film, Clooney had to have taken a deep look at himself, and if like Ryan, he didn't like what he saw, we will never know, but it is that soul searching that comes across in this film and is a different breed of acting that we tend to forget. Clooney manages for you to feel empathy for Ryan, even though he isn't the most desirable man on Earth. I mean seriously, he fires people for a living! Even still, we feel deeply for Clooney when he is burned by his own philosophy of having no connections in life, and we feel a rush of melancholy when he finally achieves his goal of 10 million frequent flyer miles. It's kind of a moment of, 'What was it all for?'The film was directed expertly by Jason Reitman, and I applaud Reitman's decision to film the corporate world with a slick expertise, and when the characters are out mingling in the real world, he films everything hand-held, almost as if it is a documentary. Not only that, I think Reitman benefits here from having written the script, because he handles the balance between the comedy and drama extremely well. It doesn't feel like a flip-flop bouncing up-and-down upon the sole of your foot, it's just a smooth ride to the other side, very much like a Billy Wilder film in that way.Overall, this is a special movie that is actuality extremely funny, but at the same time it is very down-to-Earth and deeply moving.I give Up in the Air a 9 out of 10!",9,1,7,31 December 2009
The Godfather," A True Masterpiece!
","Every now and then a film comes along that is something truly special. Within these films everything seems to come together so perfectly, ranging from the acting, to the writing, to the directing. The Godfather is one of those such films.The Godfather is one of the most endlessly entertaining films of all-time. Each and every time you watch the infamous hospital scene you can't help but get tense. When Michael goes to get the gun out of the toilet, your heart quickens. This all a testament to the film's magnificent director, Francis Ford Coppola. This is Coppola's finest work of his career. Though not only is the Godfather an entertaining film, but it is also the thought provoking character study of Michael Corleone, which is just one more reason as to why Coppola deserves recognition. Though Coppola's true merit as a director can be seen in the many magnificent performances within this film. The stellar cast ranging from Al Pacino to James Caan is awesome, though its Marlon Brando's iconic performance as the Godfather himself that steals the show.Overall the Godfather is easily one of the best films of all-time, and while it may not necessarily be my number one, it is awfully close.I give the Godfather a perfect 10 out of 10!",10,2,5,13 March 2009
