Mission: Impossible III," Adequate thriller
","MI-3: a fast-paced action thriller, right? Right. I did like the action sequences: my favorite was the one on the bridge. The plot is straightforward enough; Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has to do the impossible to keep his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) alive. To the movie's credit, the relationship between Ethan and his wife is developed well enough for the audience to care whether she lives or not. The supporting cast is accomplished enough but I can't say that they add terribly much to the movie, except for Philip Seymour Hoffman who is convincingly maniacal as Owen Davian. Ving Rhames does adequately as a member of Ethan's team. An enjoyable watch. 3 stars.",7,2,4,6 May 2006
V for Vendetta," Spectacular! *This* is the real sequel to The Matrix.
","V for Vendetta is a must-watch. It has all the elements that made 'The Matrix' more than just another action sci-fi, a more convincing and thought-provoking plot and less of the loose sentimentalism that spoiled the Matrix sequels. Drama, not action, is still the main focus of Vendetta, in typical Wachowski brothers fashion, but this time it is restrained and powerful, making for a tight and action-packed thriller.*may contain spoilers* Much of the credit for the plot must, I suppose, go to the original graphic novel by Alan Moore (which I haven't read). Without giving too much away, the movie is about the revolutionary (or terrorist) acts of one masked crusader, V (Hugo Weaving, unrecognizable except for the voice), against a fascist regime in future Britain. We see the plot unfold through the eyes of Evey (Natalie Portman), whose realization of the horrors of the dystopic society she lives in and her subsequent turn to activism mark the dramatic high point of the film.Is Vendetta politically and socially relevant today? Unquestionably. The Wachowski brothers do well to tie the plot to the current scenario in the US (e.g. the fall of the WTC, the dominance of right-wing politics) without trying to make an overt political commentary a la Fahrenheit 911. The film remains firmly in the realm of science fiction and that is where it belongs.Needless to say the action sequences are superb. Even the insipid sequels to the Matrix managed some decent action sequences (e.g. the Hollywood freeway chase from Matrix Reloaded) and Vendetta is no exception. The music supports the choreographed action sequences wonderfully well. The characteristic slow-motion knife fights are there and as good as one could hope for.Natalie Portman is, simply put, a revelation. In spite of Hugo Weaving's stylish turn as V, she is the heart and soul of the film. Stephen Rea is particularly good as the police chief, a conscientious servant of an immoral regime. The rest of the supporting cast does well too.All said and done, Vendetta is a must-watch. 9/10.",9,1,3,18 March 2006
