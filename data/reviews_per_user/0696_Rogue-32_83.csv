Black Swan," Brutally seductive, seductively brutal
","Aronofsky has proved himself by now to be a filmmaker of total and utter fearlessness, beyond brazen in his choices and the dazzling execution thereof, the innovative and consistently dependable master Shyamalan wished he could be, and with Black Swan, he takes Natalie Portman - and us - for the ride of a lifetime.Any film which has the deliriously gorgeous - and also consistently dependable - Portman in nearly every frame is worth plunking down cash for, and if you throw in the fact that she plays a reality-challenged and sexually repressed ballet dancer torn between her loyalty to her mommy and her desire to please her ballet director, who needs her to access her dark side - starting with her sexuality - in order to portray both the White Swan and her alter ego, the Black Swan in his production of Swan Lake, you've got yer basic on screen goldmine, and Aronofsky mines this gold for every nugget it's worth and then some.We know going in that Nina has a less-than-firm grip on reality - this is shown early on in a variety of ways - so by the time we're not sure anymore what's actually happening and what's delusion, it makes perfect sense. This is not a movie that skirts the issues - this is the full-blown, in-yer-face genuine article, with no holds barred. Others have called it the female version of The Wrestler and I would say this is valid, in its brutal depiction of how far a person will go in order to achieve and/or preserve his or her life choices or artistic vision. In Nina's case, she gives everything - literally - for merely one night of glory, the price her split psyche has had to pay for 'perfection', and on this level the movie works as a parable, a cautionary tale of obsession, a theme which resonates in all the movies Aronofsky has given us, from Pi on. It also works on the levels of melodrama, horror, sexually repressed psychosis, fear of failure, loss of innocence, all this and more, and in the hands of any other filmmaker I can think of it would have been laughable. In the theatre I saw it in, today, at the end, as the credits rolled, nobody was laughing.",9,4,10,19 December 2010
Frost_Nixon," A seductive chess game of a film
","A lot of critics have been writing that so many films this year have been elevated above their material by the sheer power of the actors' performances; 'Frost/Nixon' is most definitely in that category, for me.Writer Peter Morgan and director Ron Howard do give us just the right balance of historical information and theatrical anticipation to make the film work. At the beginning, the stage is set very cleverly and economically, filling in the segment of the audience who was too young (or too drunk and/or too stoned) to know about what happened at Watergate in the early 70's with Richard Nixon and his cronies. From there, we have a very well-done build-up to the actual interviews, from their inception, showing how Frost gets the initial idea, through how Nixon, who clearly needed some sort of outlet for his anguish over the events that caused him to resign the Presidency, decides to take the bait.If the set-up hadn't been dramatic and interesting, it would have somewhat diminished what follows, but it still could not have destroyed the power of Frank Langella's soulfully stunning turn as Nixon. It's his movie, he commands every second of his screen time, with a performance that evokes Tricky Dick from the inside out, deep from the inside; he's said in interviews that he wasn't trying to look like Nixon (although, from the back, the similarity is uncanny) - he was attempting to show the man's soul, and in this regard he succeeds beyond any expectations, hopefully including his own.The fact that Langella manages to make Nixon understandable and sympathetic is amazing in itself, but it's the way he does it that makes it all the more of an achievement. He shows us the humanity of the man, but in a subtle way which goes far beyond the words he's given in the script; it is this characteristic which elevates the film, makes it more than the sum of its parts, gives it a transcendent quality that stays with you long after you leave the theatre.I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of humor that found its way into the script; this isn't a dry lets-get-the-facts-straight-and-to-hell-with-everything-else sort of affair ~ it's entertaining, above all, it moves along at a brisk pace, and by the end of it you feel you've actually gotten to know both these people a little better, Nixon more than Frost: his character, I have to say, really didn't feel like the David Frost I've seen. Michael Sheen's portrayal was less arrogant and far more generous - by the last interview, you get the feeling he took no pleasure in his checkmate (Nixon's confession); I don't know how true this is to how it actually went down, and of course we'll never know, but the Frost I've seen appeared to have had a bit of a harder edge.",9,2,5,26 January 2009
Walk the Line," Because you're not quite mine, I walk (and walk and walk and walk) the line
","There's no question that Phoenix does a superb job inhabiting the skin and soul of Cash, he's brilliant in every possible way (particularly in how he literally turns his eyes into Cash's eyes), and Reese Witherspoon is a more-than-decent June Carter as well. These two performances, unfortunately, are the only really good things about the film, which plays out more like a (two-part!) TV biopic rather than a motion picture.It starts out promising, with Cash being relentlessly drawn to music, but once he gets his foot in the proverbial door and meets June Carter, the movie deteriorates into yer basic lovesick puppy scenario, with Cash continually debasing himself because his fierce and undying love for June is unrequited.More specifically, he wants her to marry him, see, and by the end of the movie, after she finally agrees, onstage (in a sinfully heavy-handed scene that the two actors barely manage to pull off), it's clear that the film has nowhere else to go, and so it ends, somewhat unsatisfactorily. I would have preferred just a tad more depth here, I think both Carter and Cash (who remained together for THIRTY FIVE years after the conclusion of the movie!!) deserved it. I think it's a shame when two actors who were obviously so up to the challenge weren't given anything truly outstanding to work with, but they still deserve acknowledgment come Oscar-nomination time, regardless.",6,0,3,19 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie is so offensive, I could barely stand it. NOT.
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is, quite simply, one of the most hilarious films ever released on American soil. Armed with nothing but brilliant inspiration, Sacha Baron Cohen (SBC) goes fearlessly into the mockumentary realm, emerging triumphant where many, MANY others have failed. Why? For one thing, he knows his territory: his character is perfected, going in - he understands who this guy is from the inside out, he's thoroughly comfortable in his skin, which allows the audience to instinctively relax, sensing that collectively, it is in good hands.Ironically, although this film has been called offensive by a lot of people, I thought it was not offensive at all. Why? It's too over the top to be offensive, and it's done with such obvious tongue-in-cheekery and glee, that it automatically diffuses the sexism and bigotry, replacing it with a subtle and wise knowingness which only a few can pull off. I was reminded, in fact - and this is a supreme compliment - of Woody Allen's earliest films: Take The Money And Run, Bananas, and the like. Not because of the material but because of the tone, which rendered me giddy, as very few films are capable of doing. High five, SBC, high five.",8,1,7,29 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," Let's party like it's 1769!
","Sofia Coppola keeps giving us supremely original and daring films, created from her own uncompromised point of view and aesthetic. She did it with The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation, and she continues that tradition with Marie Antoinette, which is as personal as a costume-heavy period piece could possibly be.Here, she teams up once again with her Virgin Suicides leading lady, Kirsten Dunst, to create a sumptuous feast for the eyes. Even more impressive: between the magnificently-detailed sets, stunning costumes and its ravishingly beautiful star, Marie Antoinette manages to avoid all the clich√©s inherent in this kind of movie, by taking a very personal approach. The film focuses on the teenage title character and how she copes with her nearly unimaginable situation while managing to stay true to herself, in the purest ways, throughout. Coppola's Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a decent, loving individual who conducts herself with astounding restraint, considering her age and the events thrust upon her. It makes you imagine what her life must have been like, from the inside, and it's done in a subtle way, without ever being heavy-handed or overly dramatic.The only problem I had with the film is that the ending seemed unnecessarily abrupt. While I appreciate that Coppola chose not to 'age' the character to 38, when she was subjected to the guillotine, I still felt the ending could have been done in a far more satisfying manner.",8,1,3,23 October 2006
The Ring," The title is a double entendre & the film is a conundrum
","The Ring has to be one of the most intense films of its genre I've ever experienced, with one scene so genuinely creepy I was literally rubbing my palms on my legs like an 8-year old (if you've caught the movie you know which scene I'm referring to - dare we ever watch tv again?!).  
Naomi Watts was the main reason I succumbed to seeing this movie and she never makes a false move, she's the real thing, a brilliant actor, and everyone else is stunningly convincing as well. And there are some very cool effects in the film - for example: did anyone besides me happen to notice the -=-minor spoiler =-= SUBLIMINAL ring that appears about halfway through the movie, during a scene-to-scene transition?  That was a very cool touch, in my book, and I also got off on how, by the end, you realize that the title is a double entendre and the film itself presents its main characters (Naomi and her son) with a very scary conundrum (it's no coincidence that the boy learns this word in the course of the proceedings).  Cannot WAIT to get my hands on RINGU, but I do not think I would want to watch it at home, on my (gasp) tv - perhaps I can rent a small theatre and have a private screening, something like that.",8,0,0,3 November 2002
Deja Vu," Didn't I write this review before?
","So here's a commercially released blockbuster-level movie that actually does not appeal to the lowest common denominator, and what's more, it's even better than the trailer shows it to be.Thanks mainly to a supremely thought-out, well-written script and a thoroughly believable performance from Washington, Deja Vu is a treat on many levels. They also got the casting right for the part of Claire - Paula Patton, evoking the feral quality of Halle Berry, is genuinely captivating; one can easily see how Washington's character Doug could fall in love with her while watching the wormhole footage. Jim Caviezel is also hugely effective as the patriot-gone-awry - his character is three-dimensional, not merely a plot device. Val Kilmer comes off good here too, a solid performance. All in all, an exceptionally decent, thought-provoking thriller.",8,2,4,9 December 2006
Monster," Not a popcorn film, leave it in the lobby
","Monster is a deeply affecting film based on the unbelievably sad life of Aileen Wuornos, whose tragic story is done justice here by writer/director Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron, who portrays Wuornos (known as 'Lee' in the film) with dazzlingly fearless abandon. I have always been a fan of Theron's, and I'm very pleased to see her getting such fantastic praise for this performance. Surely she will at least receive an Oscar nomination, and Christina Ricci is equally deserving; she nails her character Selby (based on the real-life Tyria Moore) brilliantly as well. The thing that makes this movie more than just another 'based on a true story' melodrama is the rawness and truth of its emotional core - here we have a woman, raped and abused from childhood on who sees no other options for herself but to become a hooker, brutally marginalized by society, whose life is just one long series of bewildered confusion (although she believes she sees things very clearly in her deluded state), who meets someone (Tyria/Selby) that needs HER, someone she believes she can invest all her love in (and she does have a lot of love to give). Unfortunately her mind is far too warped by this point, and it doesn't help that Selby (in the film) is a complete emotional cripple, a virtual black hole of need, and this is what eventually undoes the situation. -=- POSSIBLE SPOILERS -=- Ironically, Selby ultimately betrays Lee in what she believes to be an act of survival, which is what, if nothing else, she has learned from Lee, and even more ironic is the fact that Lee, the ultimate survivor (living through abuse, rape, brutality of every kind, years of prostitution and more) is not able to survive love.",8,1,2,12 January 2004
Memento," .reverse in scenes color the watch and dvd the Get
","Saw this in a theatre when it came out and immediately wanted - no...NEEDED to see it again, to make further sense of what I'd just been put through. Finally, I got the dvd last night and stayed up til nearly 3am with it - first, watching it 'normally' and then watching the color scenes in reverse order, and then watching just the black & white scenes one after another, in linear fashion.  The last b&w scene, where Leonard kills Jimmy, turns into color when he snaps his picture, his 'memento' of the incident, thus beginning the entire search/find/kill process all over again.  If you were into this movie in the theatre, you truly owe it to yourself to get the dvd and watch it this way.  Many things are revealed to you, all sorts of quirkly little moments and running jokes.  Cannot WAIT to see Following, and I certainly can't wait for Chris Nolan's next cinematic experiment.",9,0,1,15 January 2002
The Girl Next Door," The juice is definitely worth the squeeze
","Here we have a great example of how decent writers, armed with creative juice to spare, can take a well-worn plot and rework it to make it seem fresh.  Just when you think you've got the next twist figured out, you're surprised.  This happens throughout the movie, making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming, smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time - beautifully written, perfectly cast, a real pleasure from start to finish.  Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant shine in their respective roles as the young man at a crossroads in his life, the girl next door of the title, equally confused, and the scuzball with a heart who knows he has to do the right thing even if it goes against his 'business instincts.' These characters are not one-dimensional, thanks to the superb writing, nor are they caricatures; they come across as genuine individuals, and the comedy in the film comes not at their expense but rather organically, as part of their journey. As Olyphant's character asks Hirsch at one point: 'Is the juice worth the squeeze?' In this case, it most definitely is.",10,291,354,20 April 2004
Balls of Fury," Enough balls for everyone
","So I went to see this yesterday - had a good feeling about it from the previews, with the clever title, all the furious ping-pong playing and of course Chris Walken in that hilarious get-up, figured it'd be worth a shot. Balls of Fury is a lot of fun, with a great central performance from Dan Fogler, who grows on ya with every scene. Walken and the rest of the excellent supporting cast contribute as well, with Maggie Q. being the stand-out she always is, although everyone is good here. The energy never lags, the jokes and the situations are funny without being seriously mean-spirited - it's just fun, plain and simple. You don't have to be a ping pong wizard to appreciate this film, you simply have to come with an open mind and a new cricket for the master.",6,19,37,30 August 2007
Spider-Man 2," A exhilarating masterpiece that works on all levels
","I don't even know where to begin raving about this film -- actually, I think I've already started, with my Summary line, so I'll take it from there: this is the best movie I've ever seen that's based on a comic book - absolutely fantastic in every way, from its wonderful beginning (that sucks you right in) to its unbelievably satisfying double-conclusion. Sam Raimi - whom I've always believed was capable of true directorial greatness - his writers and his performers (especially Tobey Maguire, who valiantly held out for the right script) manage to pull off the spectacular miracle of creating and balancing the perfect tone throughout: the movie never gets silly, corny or confusing, and it never goes over the top even at its most outrageous.  Even more miraculously, the film works brilliantly on all levels: it's witty, poignant, profound, full of surprises, loaded with heart, romantic as all get-out, and the action sequences are flawless - literally mind-boggling.  Kirsten Dunst, Rosemary Harris and the rest of the actors are perfect, with a special nod to the always-great Alfred Molina, who's been turning in outstanding performances for years and years now. 
For once, I'm thrilled to report, the great reviews that Spider-Man 2 has been receiving are thoroughly warranted, and THEN some.  Go see it at your earliest possible convenience.  And take along somebody you love.",10,0,0,5 July 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," go frost yourself
","Kate Hudson & Matthew McConaughey were the only two reasons I wanted to see this film, because after witnessing the coming attractions I realized it was gonna be pretty lame. . .but I had no idea, no clue whatsoever, that it would be as patently pathetic as it actually turned out.
The 'plot', of course, was regurgitatingly ridiculous, but I can deal with a paltry premise if it's at least played out in a relatively clever way. There is not one clever moment in this movie, alas and alack, and although Hudson is adorable even when she's being more obnoxious than Joe Dirt (she gives Matthew's male member the monicker of Princess Sophia, for instance, and she sabotages his boys-only poker game in such foul ways that they cannot be described without resorting to severely inappropriate 4-letter words), and although Matt of course is dangerously and disgustingly attractive, this just aint enough to justify this tastelessly trashy travesty, which ends really really badly, subjecting their peers (at their devastastingly dreary 'frost-yourself' diamonds advertising campaign party) to an astoundingly embarrassing duet (yes, they're SINGING by the end of this treachery, boys and girls), followed by the token let's-make-up-after-we've-put-each-other-through-the-tortures-of-the-damned-(not-to-mention-the-audience)-because-aw-shucks-we-actually-love-each-other scene.   The good news is, I had more fun writing this review than I had sitting through the movie, and I thank imDB for giving me this opportunity.",1,14,29,17 March 2003
Alexander," Alexander: He Had Balls
","I have to say this film was not as bad as the critics made it out to be, which didn't surprise me because I generally tend to enjoy Oliver Stone's movies. It was too long, no question, it was unbelievably repetitive and over-indulgent, which I've come to expect from Stone, and about halfway through it I found myself wondering, 'Where's Jim Morrison when you need him?' (Val Kilmer could have easily got rid of the one-eye makeup and burst into song). And the back-and-forth story telling was sort of tedious, as well, I thought. Also, the movie lost some credibility with me early on, when one of Alexander's soldiers says to one of the other soldiers, 'he's got balls.' And then they drove off in a Maserati. (Kidding about the Maserati, but the 'balls' comment did feel really out of place in 300 BC, give or take a few years.)",5,1,3,3 January 2006
Constantine," A hideously deranged, ridiculously overblown allegory - heavy on the GORY
","Constantine is quite possibly the worst film ever made that was based on a comic book. I think the bottom-line message of this movie can be summed up best by a few lines of dialog that Tilda Swinton (as Gabriel) utters to our so-called hero early on: 'You're going to die young because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you're going to go to hell because of the life you took. You're f---ed.' And so are we, the hapless audience who is forced to sit through this abominable mess - and make no mistake, we ARE forced: we have to see how it turns out, after all, and even more than that, we have to see just how ridiculous it gets on the journey. In that department, you can rest assured it doesn't let us down - it goes all the way.",4,0,3,17 February 2006
Troy," Oh boy, it's Troy
","This film is too long, plain and simple. I know they were going for that good old-fashioned epic feel, but let's face it, these guys aint exactly Cecil B. DeMille and Company.   I still give it a 6, which is my imdb equivalent of ***, because Pitt's good, the girl who plays Helen is sufficiently beautiful, and Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole raise the bar every time they appear.  Plus there's a certain other-worldliness to the proceedings, even if it's not of C.B. DeMille caliber.  But my first statement still holds:  lop off at least 30 minutes of troops-running-toward-each-other scenes and we would find a far more engrossing film lying underneath the spoils.",6,3,7,25 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Less is most definitely more
","Jake Gyllenhaal nailed it when he was on Leno a few weeks ago - 'It's what's NOT said,' he told Jay, and this statement is at the heart of what makes Brokeback Mountain more than 'just' a tale of 2 cowboys who have undeniably powerful feelings for each other. It's the supreme restraint and subtlety with which the story is told that resonates with us long after we leave the theatre: rather than having everything spelled out for us six ways from Sunday, we're given the opportunity to fill in the rest ourselves, privately, and in this way, Jack and Ennis' story becomes absorbed by us on an organic level, making it a personal story - this is the 'haunting' effect that so many people have been writing about in their commentaries, and other filmmakers should be learning from this masterfully realized, majestically heartfelt cinematic experience.",10,21,27,22 January 2006
Insomnia," Kept ME awake!
","I'm a huge follower of Chris Nolan's, after seeing both Memento and Following (in that order), and it was with much anticipation that I awaited his third directorial outing, Insomnia. I haven't seen the original movie this film is based on, but I certainly would like to, based upon the plot,which is an extremely brilliant and thoughtful one. I did enjoy this version of it, I wasn't nodding off in the theatre, but I do have to say it lacked that thrilling kinky edge of both Following and Memento; there is something to be said for non-linear storylines and Nolan is brilliant at them.  I hope in his next film he explores that sort of thing again.",7,0,0,26 May 2002
Juno," I think I might want a hamburger phone
","I was familiar with Jason Reitman before 'Thank You For Smoking', from his fantastic short film, 'In God We Trust', which I caught at a film festival a few years back. I was a fan of Diablo Cody after seeing her on Letterman and buying her book Candy Girl: A Year In the Life of an Unlikely Stripper the very next day. And I knew all too well how great an actor Ellen Page was from seeing 'Hard Candy', so 'Juno' was a no-brainer for me ~ I was there the very first day it finally opened in my neighborhood.This is one of those rare films that actually lives up to and mightily surpasses its majestic hype, thanks to Cody's killer script, Reitman's sure-handed direction and a thoroughly captivating performance from Ms. Page, who manages to create a character we hadn't quite seen before but yet feel we know intimately by the end of the movie.Brilliant casting throughout, especially Michael Cera as Juno's true love Paulie Bleeker and J.K. Simmons as her father, but everyone here serves the production beautifully.The best thing about Cody's script is how specific the details about the characters are - she gives just enough to flesh them out, make them 3-dimensional without telling too much and losing the edge. And she makes all the right choices in the course of the story, for these characters, whom she clearly loves - just when we think it's going down a predictable road, we get something different. Brilliant choices for the music too - it's quirky and quietly understated, adding still another magical layer to this near-perfect and heartfelt winner of a film.",9,1,3,13 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," Always remember (and never forget): Less is more.
","There are so many things about this third Spider-Man movie which reek of excess - there's just too much crammed into the screenplay, too many subplots for it to genuinely feel cohesive - these people don't get the 'less is more' philosophy one iota - but I did enjoy some of it. The Black Spidey thing especially, which was very cool, all those scenes where Maguire is struttin' it, those worked for me. And Thomas Haden Church brought humanity in spades to the Sandman, plus James Franco was very believable and charming. Poor Kirstin Dunst got the shortest end of the stick - her Mary Jane was absolutely pathetic this time out, no fun at all, and when it finally all wrapped up, I left the theatre feeling confused and overwhelmed.",7,0,1,12 August 2008
Match Point," The Woodman Goes Out On A Limb
","I'm a huge follower of Woody's work, from the very beginning (even got to meet him in his Play It Again Sam Broadway dressing room in NYC a long time back). Some of his movies are disappointing, but most of them have delighted me, even the more serious ones, like Interiors and C&M. This one is a real departure of sorts, not necessarily in the subject matter but rather in the execution. Gone are the nauseating jumpy camera moves from Husbands & Wives (which I liked nonetheless, what can I tell ya), gone are the snappy one-liners, gone is the jazzy soundtrack, gone is his beloved New York City. Instead, we get slow, subtle panning shots, arch dialogue with hardly any obvious humor to them, an opera soundtrack, and London, of all places. It works, though, this noir-ish concoction; it lures you in, sweeps you along and then it turns the screws in a most surprising way, leaving the viewer - this viewer, anyway - entirely jaw-dropped.This is a thought-provoking work that no doubt has precipitated many philosophical discussions, and for that alone it's a winner. Not quite perfect, however - some of the dialog feels a little phony, the opera gets a little bit much in places, and some of the plot points are a tad heavy-handed. I forgive Woody for this. The Big Question is (aside from the question of karma): can his leading character in the movie genuinely forgive himself for what he does, in the name of 'survival'?",7,1,2,18 June 2006
The Prestige," 'A man's reach often exceeds his grasp'
","Big fan of Nolan's ever since Memento; I still think his best film thus far is his first full-length feature: Following. The Prestige is undoubtedly his most ambitious film thus far, and it is mesmerizing, no question. By the end, however, I felt that style won out over substance just a bit.Great acting throughout, with Michael Caine being a shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actor nod. Bale (who, like Caine, is always great) and Jackman (who convinced me finally that he can indeed act) are perfectly cast as the dueling magicians. Bowie, I felt, was also perfect as Tesla - an elegant performance from an always-elegant performer.The movie does have those 3 acts, just like in a successful 'trick': the Pledge, the Turn, and the all-important Prestige. This film does deliver on all three, even if it stumbles just a little on the execution.",9,2,4,29 October 2006
Blades of Glory," This film actually warrants a sequel!
","From the very first second I laid eyes on the absolutely hilarious poster for this film, in my neighborhood multiplex a few months ago, I knew with extreme certainty that I'd be seeing it the very first week it opened. Caught it on Wednesday and I'm here to say the movie most definitely delivers on the promise of the poster, big time.Jon Heder finally gets a role he can have some fun with for a change (which hasn't really happened since Napoleon Dynamite), and he's superbly cast as the sheltered and phobic Jimmy MacElroy, the perfect foil for Ferrell's sex machine on skates, Chazz Michael Michaels. Ferrell is fast becoming more and more adept at portraying genuine characters in his movies, not merely hollow caricatures, and he is clearly in his element here.The beginning of the movie, the set-up, is wonderfully written, and the over-the-top tone that's established in these opening scenes is successfully carried throughout. The energy level stays high, the plot never gets tedious or bogged down, and, best of all, the routines that the two of them perform together as partners are truly hilarious and original. I was left wanting more, and that speaks volumes.",8,72,152,6 April 2007
Nacho Libre," Black and White and Jared all over
","If you are familiar with my reviews, you know I'm a huge Mike White fan and you also know that Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is aces in my book. And it's no news to anyone on the planet that Jack Black ain't no slouch either. Put them all together, throw in some adorable orphans, a career-confused monk, a sexy nun, some funny face masks, a wrestling ring or two, some stretchy pants and the country of Mexico, and you've got Nacho Libre. This is one of those movies, like Napoleon Dynamite, that you either get or you don't. You either buy into the offbeat-ness of the premise, the skewed-ness of the characters and the thoroughly charming and subversively sure-footed execution thereof, or you don't. While this film is a bit more mainstream than ND, and Jon Heder (whose characterization elevated that film to near-mythic status) is nowhere to be seen, Nacho Libre still manages to succeed on its own terms, bent and twisted - but always good-hearted - as they are. The thing I loved the most about the film is its originality. Not the plot per se, which is yer basic 'let's put on a show and save the (fill in the blank)'. Rather, it's the way the plot is executed that makes this such a special affair.Of course I could not imagine for a second that Jack Black was Mexican (or even half Mexican and half Scandanavian), but that's not really the point, I decided by the end of the film (great closing credits, by the way, with that song that Black sings, the one he wrote with Hess and White - really funny lyrics). This is supposed to be a gentle satire, not a searingly realistic art film, and on its own terms, it works brilliantly, creating its own pace, its own reality, its own world which, by the end of the movie, thoroughly won me over. Even the silly outfit that Black's character wears began looking nearly mythic (there's that word again) by the endearing climax. Filmed entirely south of the border, with a vast amount of Mexican crew members, this film can hardly be called racist - it's not like Hess & Co filmed in Boise and tried to pass it off as Mexico, for cryin' out loud. And remember, a movie isn't merely what you see on screen, it's also what you DON'T see; so many stereotypical elements that could have been included and pathetically run into the ground are LEFT OUT - these had to be conscious choices on the parts of the film makers. Nacho Libre has its heart in the right place, without being sappy about it, and that utterly deranged smile of Black's in the final scene - where's he's gotten the glory, the gold and the girl - is more than thoroughly well-earned.",8,5,8,23 June 2006
Closer," Lar and Anna and Dan and Alice
","Mike Nichols is one of my favorite directors, a multi-talented genius who has never been afraid to work on the edge (quite possibly he cannot work any other way), and when he delves into the intense Scorpionic waters of the savagery involved in the vast majority of one-on-one relationships, you know a profound experience is in store.With Closer, he returns to the Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf format of 4 people brutally ravaging one another's psyches. Closer is different though, of course, because it takes place over a period of time rather than a consecutive amount of days, as Woolf did, and it's a much better film, I believe: over the years, Nichols has managed to hone his innate Scorpio talent of restraint, and Closer benefits from this magnificently. Like Virginia Woolf, it's based on a play, and it does feel stagy, but this works FOR the film - the framework of one scenario after the other in which time has passed (or regressed, as the case may be; the film is not entirely linear, which is another brilliant choice) creates the discipline - the illusion of civility - necessary to exhibit the brutal mind games and lethal, obsessive ego-driven powerplays that endlessly occur between the 4 characters.I realized over dinner after seeing it last night (my last film of 2004!) that Closer is basically an s&m film, without one whip or chain ever appearing, and it's an unbelievably violent film, without one head rolling across the screen and without the male characters resorting to duking it out in the streets a la Bridget Jones. I also appreciated how ONLY the 4 characters have speaking parts in the movie, and how all 4 are very articulate and somewhat self-aware: they sort of know why they're doing what they're doing, they do understand themselves on some level, but they're still helpless to stop their behavior because their egos are involved, particularly with the 2 men.What they don't understand - or want to understand - is the meaning of 'truth', which is essentially a 5th character in the movie: 'truth' is used as a blunt instrument by all 4 of the characters, and ironically, when one of them actually TELLS the truth in a non-hurtful way (it's Alice, who admits to Larry at one point that her real name is Jane) she is of course not believed. At the heart of this is the sad truth that most of the time, whenever anyone tries to get closer to anybody else, whether the attempt is sincere or otherwise, he or she eventually comes to understand that most people cannot deal with the truth, do not want to hear it and certainly not from someone they're intimately involved with, even if that person is sincere and not using 'truth' as a weapon, and so all relationships wind up being untruthful in one way or another.Law's Daniel commits what I think is the most mean-spirited act in the film, by chatting with Owen's Larry in an internet sex room (in one of the edgiest scenes in the film or rather it's tied with the scene in the strip club between Larry and Natalie Portman's Alice aka Jane - too provocative to even begin to describe, where the power shifts back and forth like in an especially well-matched chess game). In the chat room scene, Dan poses as Anna (Julia Roberts, who has never looked more human or been presented more effectively as seen through fellow-Scorpio Nichols' probing lens), but then he takes the chat one step further by telling Larry to meet 'her' at the aquarium, where he knows Anna goes all the time. Larry goes and Anna's there and Larry makes a major fool of himself, and he doesn't forget it - he gets his revenge indirectly through Anna and then directly, in the film's most brutal verbal confrontation between him and Daniel, later on.It also wasn't lost on this viewer how ironic the characters' professions in the film are: Anna is a photographer - she takes pictures of strangers, hoping to show their humanity but in reality she's using them because she doesn't really seem to be learning anything from her work. Alice is a stripper, which she digs because of the obvious power trip involved. Dan is a writer of obituaries by day and a fiction writer the rest of the time - he admits early on to Alice that his obits are all resplendent with euphemisms (i.e.: ''he enjoyed his privacy' means he was a raving queen', like that), and his fiction is apparently sex-driven accounts of his relationships; he's in essence using his partners as fodder for said fiction. Larry is a doctor, specifically a dermatologist: skin - superficial layers that get deeper as they are revealed. He has one of the best lines in the piece, which occurs during the final confrontation between the men, where Dan is whining about 'the heart' and Larry shoots back, 'have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist covered in blood', words to that effect - not the most subtle imagery, but in context it speaks volumes.My IMDb rating: 10 (****)",10,2,4,1 January 2005
Capote," Long day's journey into complete darkness
","Atmospheric, chilling and bleak, this film is a stunner from beginning to end. The mood is brilliantly set during the opening credits, and it never wanes. At the center, of course, is Philip Seymour Hoffman's magnificent portrayal of Truman Capote. Speaking in his wistful baby voice, with its overpowering narcotic effect, Hoffman evokes the man from the inside out, virtually disappearing into the role. There were just a couple of times where I could see that sly little Hoffman grin in there but only for a few fleeting seconds. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, right up there with Jeremy Irons' cunning portrayal of Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune.Capote, however, is a much better film overall. The excruciatingly dark subject matter is handled brilliantly, with all its conflict and complexity displayed with superb subtlety. As a writer myself, I know all too well about walking that fine line between serving your story and serving yourself - allowing yourself to say and/or do whatever it takes to get what you need, to become whatever you have to be in order to gain trust, sometimes at the expense of one's own morality and judgment. Truman exploits and manipulates Perry relentlessly, even though he does have genuine feelings for him; this destructive conflict of interests is at the heart of the film, and it's depicted with chilling clarity. You understand from the get-go, the second that Truman sees the pictures, with the pillows placed under the victims' heads, that the cold-blooded criminal who did this can be manipulated, because he is 'human' on some level, and as soon as he gets his chance, he pounces. Quietly, with insidious intellectual premeditation.The thing I appreciated the most was how Perry understood Truman's compulsion to exploit him and he didn't mind. This made it even harder for Truman to deal with, and it ultimately destroyed him - artistically, and, even sadder, as a human being.",10,6,10,8 February 2006
Lost in Translation," Nothing is lost, everything is gained
","As a writer/director, Sofia Coppola is endowed with the wonderful gift of confidence - she is able to resist the insecure temptation to over-tell her stories, opting instead to allow the characters and the situations to unfold organically and naturally, without artifice, heavy-handedness or contrivance.  She achieved this in The Virgin Suicides and she takes this concept even further here, managing to create superb emotional resonance that rings true in every frame.Bill Murray's quirky talents have never been better utilized; Coppola inspires him to give a stunningly restrained performance, letting his true subtle mastery shine.  And Scarlett J. is wonderful here as well, infusing Charlotte with just the right amount of desperation without letting her become a victim.  It's a wise film on every level - poignant, humorous and insightful beyond belief.  A pleasure.",9,0,0,19 September 2003
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl's Streependous, and Anne Hath a Way
","I'm from NYC, and my earliest jobs were in publishing, both book and magazine. Compared to some of the mind-bogglingly neurotic, fear-driven, tear-your-hair-out-soon-as-look-at-you women I encountered, some in managerial positions far less 'powerful' than Miranda Priestly's, lemme tell ya, Meryl Streep's character in this movie is almost like Mother Teresa.I'm sharing the above in case anyone doubts that a boss can be as insufferable as Priestly. Now, to the actual film: Streep's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Her Miranda Priestly is constructed from the inside out, as all Streep's characters are. It's what she holds back, what she doesn't show but subtly hints at, that gives her character 3-dimensionality and humanity and gains our sympathy without ever asking for it. She is one of those rare actors who is able to convey more with an eyebrow, or by merely pursing her lips, than with an entire page of dialog, and the script here serves her well and vice versa.What I appreciated most (aside from Streep) is how the movie is superbly restrained throughout - it never turns into one of those over-the-top shriekfests, with hysteria running rampant. I also appreciated how Tucci, who can do no wrong in my book - the Tuccinator, I call him - is never reduced to a cartoon figure; none of the characters are, in fact. Everyone is sufficiently fleshed-out (maybe that's not the choice of words the women in the movie would like, but you know what I mean), and the movie never gets heavy-handed either, even toward the end.Hathaway is thoroughly believable as 'the new Emily' aka Andrea aka Andy, an individual who has so much character that she's loyal to her boss even though her boss hasn't overtly earned it. A tricky part, but our girl manages to pull it off, with style to spare.",8,4,7,6 July 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne, free
","The Bourne films have operated in an opposite way than most sequel movies, which tend to lose steam the further into the series they go: the first one was good (and it was clear that Matt Damon was perfect for the part), the second was fantastic, and this one, the third in the series, is better than the first two combined.The thing I've always appreciated about Damon, in this role, is how everything his character does (or has had to do) is done without ego. He merely takes whatever steps he needs to take to accomplish his mission; namely, finding out who he is and what the hell happened to him. His training (and his obvious innate abilities) have made him smarter, faster and stronger than all adversaries, but he never once takes any smirking pride or glory in this, he simply does what needs to be done, in a matter-of-fact sort of way. This has served the project extremely well, and it gives the third installment - where the answers are revealed - a huge boost because we really care about this guy and his plight.The Bourne Ultimatum delivers on so many levels, and it's hilarious in ways you wouldn't think, or at least to me it was: I found it exceedingly laughable how stupid David Strathairn's character, Noah Vosen, was - he kept trying to catch Bourne (or at the very least catch UP with him), who was always way ahead, but Vosen never adjusts his attitude or mentality to try to think like Bourne; he takes everything Bourne says on face value, which becomes really funny near the end of the film, when Bourne is talking to Vosen by phone, FROM VOSEN'S OFFICE, while Vosen is in a car waiting for him to appear where he said he'd be. Hilarious. The film has no overt humor, no funny dialogue (as in Die-hard, for instance), nothing to destroy the seriousness of the mood and the mission, which of course is the right choice, so this character-based Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner relationship between Vosen and Bourne really serves the production well.Genius casting, too, with Albert Finney in the doctor/brainwasher role - even before we meet his character, toward the end, just from seeing his picture (and witnessing him in the flashbacks we're shown), we know that he could make anybody do anything he wanted, regardless of whether they'd volunteered for it and had misgivings afterwards or not.The finale is perfect as well, leaving it open to the possibility of a fourth film. And the cool closing credits (and music) are excellent too. Just a pleasure from beginning to end, this one.",10,0,1,4 August 2007
The Italian Job," Raises the bar on the Gold standard
","'The Italian Job' is carried out by real pros, a delight from beginning to end, with superlative casting, clever dialogue and one beautifully-directed scene after the other. The film, a re-tooling of the earlier Michael Caine movie of the same name, has the simplest of plots: get the gold, lose the gold, get the gold back. It's the way it's done that elevates this one: all the characters are well-written, it's got the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheekedness (is that a word?!), the style AND the substance are there in equal part, and it's supremely easy on the eyes to boot.Particularly outstanding: Charlize Theron (dazzlingly gorgeous as always, with a well-played touch of vulnerability underneath her character's more-than-capable exterior), Donald Sutherland (elegant and cool in his brief appearance), Seth Green (as the self-titled 'real' Napster, who gets to play God with the Hollywood traffic grids in his very own 'matrix'), and Mark Wahlberg   (in a perfectly nuanced performance, controlled and clearly on top of his game). And oh yeah, Edward Norton as the slime-bucket who gets his just desserts is sufficiently and sublimely sleazy.  (Think he's been taking Dustin Hoffman lessons in his spare time.) In the movie, 'FINE' stands for 'freaked-out, Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional'. . .but in the case of this review, it just stands for Fine.",8,0,3,2 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," More, more. I want more.
","I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more.  This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films.  Thank you, Peter.  I am hungrily awaiting the next two.",10,1,1,26 February 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I'm posting this review because I choose to.
","The last half hour of the film is good, but the rest is a major disappointment, what with the endless Star-Wars type battles (made semi-watchable thanks to Jada Pinkett's intense performance, at least) and the dreary dud of a script (the audience was actually laughing at how stupid some of the lines were).  The only really decent line was delivered by Neo near the very end, and Mary Alice was great as the Oracle.",5,0,0,10 November 2003
The Village," let's twist again!
","You know you're well on your way to becoming a filmmaker of serious note when your films start to become either passionately loved or hideously reviled. Judging from what I've been reading of late, M. Night Shyamalan has definitely gotten into that league with his new film The Village.This is a brilliant film that works as both an allegory and as an actual story, with characters you care about. It's brilliant because Night manages to take a really tricky plot and execute it with dazzling clarity of vision. The thing I liked most about it was how I was expecting it to be a different kind of movie - this is what Night wanted us to expect, so we'd be caught off guard by what the film actually is about. A lot of people (including some very vocal ones at the Arclight in Hollywood, where I saw the film last Saturday) were bent out of shape by this, whining that Shyamalan 'misled and tricked' them. To these people, I offer three words: GRIP. GET ONE. If the film had been what they had been set up to expect, these same people would have been carping that it was predictable. What I recommend: don't read reviews (you can stop right here with this one, if you want). Don't listen to people who've seen it. Just go check it out for yourself. If you're looking for an original, thought-provoking movie that will leave you with goosebumps (but not for any of the reasons you might expect), you can't go wrong with The Village.",9,0,0,3 August 2004
21," Doesn't even work as a fairytale
","I was intrigued by the preview of 21 because I'm a sucker for films about gambling, and this is a film about gambling ~ it's the director/writers gambling with our intelligence, hoping we're completely devoid of brainpower, which would make us stupid enough to buy any of the claptrap we see on screen in this bonafide turkey.The beginning is good, it's only when the true fun should be starting - when Ben starts going to Vegas as part of the blackjack team headed by Micky (Kevin Spacey) - that the movie begins to seriously fall apart.Vegas is a huge town, with literally hundreds of casinos, but these clowns wind up going back to the SAME casino, over and over, using the SAME signals to one another (their ridiculous signal to indicate a hot table, for instance), until it's more than blatantly obvious to the security overseer, Laurence Fishburne, that these stooges are playing a very dangerous - and stupid - game.The story then continues on its deathtrail of stupidity, with the storyline and the characters' behavior becoming more and more ridiculous until Ben - duhhhh - loses Everything and has to - double duhhhh - find a way to outsmart Micky (a 2-year-old could outsmart this guy) and get his life back together. The way it's done is even stupider than what proceeds it, what with Ben luring Micky back to the SAME casino for one last shot at the Big Money. 'They'll know us there,' Micky says, 'So we'll have to wear disguises.' Oh yeah, genius - a cowboy hat and fake mustache really make Spacey look like a totally different person (not), and even stupider --- they show up using the SAME signals that they've used all along; yes, these giboneys are that dumb.Then, to insult the audience even further, the writers tack on what they believe, in their deluded states, to be a double surprise ending. By this time, the only surprise is that anyone is still left in the movie theatre.",2,92,125,1 April 2008
"I, Robot"," Would Isaac have approved?
","I used to work in NYC in publishing more than a few years back, and during that time I got to meet and hang out with the great Isaac Asimov, who discussed with me all sorts of things, including his obsession with robots. While watching this film, which is loosely based on his ideas, I was wondering if he would have approved of it, and my educated conclusion is. ..yes and no.I think he would have enjoyed the way the world of the not-so-far-off future looked in the film, and I think he would have liked the way the robots looked.  I think he would have had no problem with Will Smith, and I think he would have found the film to be entertaining overall, a slick little piece of summer-blockbusting.  At the same time, he probably would have thought it was tritely simplistic and cliched, certainly not as deeply thought-provoking as it could have been, on so many levels.  And if these indeed would have been his feelings about the movie, I would have had to agree with him ~ they didn't completely 'ruin' it by any stretch, but it just didn't have the weight it could have had, ultimately - when you left the theatre you weren't still thinking about it, or at least I wasn't, and in this respect it was the perfect summertime escapist fare.  But there could have been more.  Close, but no radium-infused hydrofoiler, as Isaac might have said.",7,0,0,19 July 2004
Dreamgirls," You want a show stopper, you got a show stopper
","I just got home from seeing the film, and I'm still feeling overwhelmed by the emotion of it, particularly the depth of feeling that Jennifer Hudson managed to convey in her role as Effie White, the 'fourth' Dreamgirl, the underdog with the genuinely awe-inspiring vocal talent.To say that the film is a monumental tour de force for Ms. Hudson is an understatement. Nearly halfway through, she delivers the song And I Am Telling You, and these moments alone redefine the term 'show stopper' ten times over. Ms. Hudson delves as deep into the core of her very soul as a person could possibly go to wrench out a performance that left me emotionally overhauled good and proper. I defy, in fact, anybody with any shred of feeling to sit through this number unaffected.The rest of the movie works too, in every possible way. Eddie Murphy especially is a standout, and this comes not a second too soon - he's been languishing away for years now in thankless roles, and it's a genuine thrill to see him come alive once again, in a part that allows him not only to show what a fantastic singer he is, but also how overpoweringly magnetic he is as a performer and as a film star.The movie could easily be seen, by people who are not really familiar with the ground being covered, as a series of overworked clich√©s, but in reality, beyond being supremely entertaining, it's a fantastic historic document, a brilliant look at a period in time when things changed, musically, forever. In the years covered, the music business went through radical shifts, where mainstream white audiences for the first time accepted and ultimately embraced black music.I had never seen the stage production, and I wasn't really familiar with the plot, so I was not prepared for the film to be so emotionally wrenching, but this is, of course, a good thing - it made me care deeply about the characters (Hudson's and Murphy's in particular), and this is what makes the film a transcendent success, in my estimation.",9,3,6,9 January 2007
Being John Malkovich," A heady head trip of the supremely highest order
","I realized the other day when I was doing my write-up of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I had never reviewed this film (even though I had given it a 10, the equivalent of ****); it was the first Charlie Kaufman movie I'd seen and the one that made me a follower of his work for life.
Being John Malkovich truly is one of the most inventive, mind-boggling and subversively profound movies I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing...and experiencing, and experiencing - I've seen it more than once and it always comes across as fresh and I always marvel at it anew each time.  Cinematic achievement doesn't get any better than that, for my money. Get the DVD in your hands as soon as possible and experience Kaufman's inspired subversiveness for yourself.",10,2,5,30 March 2004
Spider-Man," One of the best films based on a comic I've seen
","This film is fun, plain and simple.  It manages to achieve the perfect balance of portraying the serious aspects of being a super hero (the 'with great power comes great responsibility' byline) and the sheer glee of suddenly finding yourself embued with said powers (AND the rapt attention of the girl you've loved since your childhood).  Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem DaFoe (get it? DaFoe??! DA FOE!!?) were all superb as well. Maguire always manages to hit the perfect human tone in his performances, making him sympathetic and believable. Kirsten...she just has to show up, and of course DaFoe was MORE than capable as the evil and disgusting Green Goblin.  The long, detailed set-up was so well rendered that when the first action sequence took place, it seemed like an extra treat, the icing on the cake.  In so many of these sort of films, the stuff between the action sequences drones on and on in an artlessly contrived fashion, but in Spider-Man it was the opposite. Kudos to Raimi and the entire production team for (forgive me) weaving the perfect web.",10,0,0,15 May 2002
Collateral," The Tominator
","Michael Mann has directed a lot of films I haven't liked, but Collateral, I am very pleased to say, is not one of them. This is a fantastic movie, with superb performances from its two leads, Jamie Foxx (soon to be a major star, I believe, thanks to this performance and his starring role as Ray Charles in the upcoming Ray), and Tom Cruise, who is perfect as the killing machine I affectionately named the Tominator around four-fifths of the way through the film. Collateral is sophisticated, clever, sordid, witty, outrageous, stunningly visual and diabolically intense all at the same time; chalk it up to Mann's penchant for showing off the best and worst elements of his terrain - in this case, it's Los Angeles, and every scene is perfectly shot (no pun intended) and beautifully enacted. There is a slick little plot twist toward the end - a precocious little plot twist, I call it, because technically we shoulda seen it coming (and perhaps a lot of viewers did), but I was so caught up in all the splendid distractions that I didn't realize where the film was heading, but it was one of those twists, that, when you DO realize, you find yourself literally giddy with excitement at how it's going to play out. This hasn't happened to me in a Michael Mann film before. And also thumbs up for the casting of the great Javier Bardem as Felix -- his Santa Claus story was priceless.",8,0,3,7 August 2004
The Machinist," Heavy stuff
","SPOILER ALERT-=- Ever since I moved to California (from NYC) and started driving, I've always had it in the back of my mind that I had to be extremely careful that I didn't hit anyone while I was in my 2000+ lb. machine, particularly a child. I've always felt that this would be one of the worst things that could possibly happen in someone's life ~ how it would be just unforgivable, and how it would cause unfathomable guilt. So this film had a profound effect on me, by the end of it, when we find out what's really at the bottom of Trevor's severely tormented state of mind.The film exists inside this mind; the entire film is experienced from this drastically tortured vantage point. Trevor no longer can perceive what is real and what isn't, and so we're not sure either. At first I was thinking the whole thing was a dream, but that didn't quite make sense, because from the way it's shot, with some of the scenes having a little color in them, and some nearly black and white, it felt more like hallucinations were occurring along with some flashes of reality. I think the filmmakers do an absolutely brilliant job in letting us into Trevor's head. Of course, Bale's 110% commitment to the project certainly doesn't hurt. Magnificently realized, The Machinist is a harrowing and monumentally sad cinematic experience.",10,22,33,2 June 2006
Now You See Me," You won't be seeing me again
","This tells you how unsatisfying an experience watching this film last night turned out to be: About halfway through I'd figured out who the 'mastermind' might be. But at the end, when it was confirmed, I felt no sense of elation at all. Compared to, say, with The Usual Suspects, when I figured out who Kaiser Soze had to be and it was revealed, I was absolutely euphoric in the theatre. I excitedly nudged the person I was with and said, 'I knew it!!!' It didn't work with Now You See Me because it had no weight; it was totally unearned.Movies about magicians have to have some semblance of believability at the core; I'm thinking of The Illusionist and The Prestige, for example - both brilliantly realized films that manage to walk the tightrope between wonderment and plausibility. This piece of garbage takes the opposite route: it insults its audience in so many ways that I couldn't even begin to mention them in a decent-sized review.Can't believe they're actually doing a sequel, which I will NOT be seeing. And I can't believe Boaz Yakin(of FRESH fame) had anything to do with this train wreck of a monstrosity of a lame two-hour long plothole.",1,3,7,13 April 2014
Tropic Thunder," InsPirEd LunAcY
","This is the kind of film where you either get it or you don't - you either are open to the maniacal absurdity of the proceedings or you're not, in which case I recommend you slink home and watch the director's cut of 'Atonement' instead. For those who are on board, this movie will render you obscenely giddy during more than most of its running time, perhaps even levitating above your seat but you'll be laughing too effin' hard to actually notice that.Ben Stiller and his co-writers manage to pull off the near-impossible here. The premise of the film is great, the movie-within-a-movie, but in the wrong hands, or rather in less inspired, less hell-bent-for-leather hands, the execution could have easily been its downfall. But Stiller & Co. are crazed enough, willing enough, and most importantly, savvy enough, to make it work from beginning to end.Take the performances: everyone rocks his role, with the obvious standouts being Downey Jr as 'the dude playin' the dude disguised as another dude' (he doesn't break character, he brags at one point, until he's done the DVD commentary, you gotta admire that kinda commitment, mate); Tom Cruise, barely recognizable and absolutely hilarious as the corrupt studio clown (Cruise chose to play the part bald and paunchy, looking like a cartoon version of Jeffrey Tambor - you know, the 'hey now' guy from 'Larry Sanders') and Nick Nolte, who just has to be on camera to illicit giddy laughs, and when he speaks, fuggedaboudit. Plus Stiller himself scores major big time here, especially when he's captured by the Viet Cong (led by Tran, played by teenager Brandon Soo Hoo, who is a riot) and forced to act out in its entirety his flop of a film, 'Simple Jack' over and over again for their demented pleasure.Can't wait to see what he comes up with next, the Stillernator, but for the time being it suffices to say that he has most definitely redeemed himself for the two overstuffed turkeys that were 'A Night at the Museum' and the 'Heartbreak Kid' remake. It'll do for now.",9,2,8,21 August 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Two directors equals two too many
","This would have been a really decent, thought-provoking film if the writers/directors had the intelligence to actually -=- SPOILER ALERT-=- end it in a way that would let the poor long-suffering audience comprehend that (poor long-suffering) Evan was NOT actually going back into the past at all, EVER ---- that there WERE no journals, as explained by his doctor (AND confirmed by his mother), that this was how he had been dealing -- in his MIND -- with the guilt over killing his childhood friend Kayleigh.
As the doctor said toward the end, Evan (and his father before him, who was deeply disturbed too) had created a disease that 'doesn't exist.' By having the film end the way it did, the writers/directors actually negated everything that came before it, thereby confusing 99% of the people who saw this convoluted mess ( people who left the theatre actually believing that the past-changing scenes were REAL), and by doing this, they thereby created a MOVIE that doesn't actually exist.",1,7,22,9 February 2004
Meet the Fockers," Meet the Pickrens
","Didn't really think this would be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it on cable the other night. The best part of the movie for me was the appearance of Little Jack, played by the Pickren twins, Spencer and Bradley, who have been doing the signing language since they were weeks old. Their mother, Wendy, was a pediatric occupational therapist, and she had been teaching it to them; by the time they were 11 months old, she writes at their official website, pickren twins dot com, they were already communicating with her in this way. So what you see in the film is genuine.What I loved even more than the signing (and their incredibly astute reactions throughout the film) is when Stiller's character inadvertently teaches Little Jack the 'A' word - to hear the kid saying it during the rest of the movie is absolutely hilarious; the film is worth seeing for this alone. Streisand and Hoffman are also high points, with their very specific characterizations. All in all, a very funny and worthwhile sequel. And educational, to boot.",7,1,2,20 November 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Ok, this will hold me til the third one...

School of Rock," Black and White, together again!
","I've been a huge fan of writer genius Mike White's since Chuck and Buck, and I'm thrilled to see him achieving major commercial success with this movie, which goes right up there with C and B as one of my favorite movies of all time.This is the vehicle that was custom-made for Jack Black (who worked with White on Orange County) - nobody could have brought Dewey Finn to life with any more energy than he does; he RULES this film from start to finish, although the kids are fantastic as well, and Mike White, casting himself as Dewey's p-whipped roomie, Ned Schneebly (can you even SAY that name without laughing?), is extremely effective as well, happy to just be there and let Jack shine. And the great Joan Cusack nails all her scenes as only she can, adding yet another non-stereotypical element to the proceedings. 
You don't have to be a musician or even a fan of rock music to get off on this film, which, at its heart, is about finding yourself and remaining true to that self against all the odds, and the coolest thing about the movie is how White's script never gets preachy or heavy-handed but the message is there, grinning at us between the lines of every heart-felt frame.",10,0,0,20 October 2003
The Illusionist," One of the best films of this year, last year, ANY year
","The Illusionist is one of the best movies I've ever seen, plain and simple. It's perfect in ways I never knew a film could be perfect. Instead of trying to come up with adjectives to describe the experience, I will suggest instead - or rather implore - that you vigorously ignore any comments that will give anything away about this magnificently masterful (OK, OK, those are adjectives) film and just go see it. And no, I am not just saying this because Paul Giamatti (whom I have a group for at Yahoo - a not-so-subtle plug: http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/talkpaul/) co-stars in it and turns in yet another seamless, brilliant performance, and no, I'm not just saying this because I've always been a huge fan of my fellow Leo Edward Norton, who had me at hello years ago when I caught him in Primal Fear; this is an actor who has grown immensely with every role he's tackled since then, and his performance in this movie - along with Giamatti's - is Oscar-worthy.The Illusionist succeeds on levels that are far beyond the scope of any words, in any review. From the opening credits, there is a spell being cast, a palpable otherworldly feeling which permeates every frame of this masterpiece. What I'm saying is, the film starts off great and gets even greater. If you love movies like you say you love movies, this is the movie for you.",10,2,3,15 October 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," tock tick, tock tick
","Every once in a while ¬ñ a very long while ¬ñ a film comes along that is fully worthy of your total suspension of disbelief, where you can sink comfortably into the theatre seat and simply take it in, knowing you're in completely competent hands. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' was one of those extraordinarily rare films, for me.Within the first 20 minutes of this masterpiece ¬ñ a word I don't use lightly or often ¬ñ I knew it was gonna be OK; I could relax, let go and just allow the story to wash over me. And what a story it is, this one. It sounds weird, when you first hear the premise ¬ñ Brad Pitt's character aging backwards, starting out as an old man (who reminded me of an extremely wizened Robert Redford) and getting younger as he goes on. However, within the context of the film it works brilliantly. It's tied in to how a clockmaker creates a clock that goes backwards in time; he built it that way in the hope that it would somehow bring back loved ones who died during war. So the weird concept doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's given a grounded basis, however fantastical that basis is.That's the thing about this film ~ it's got this fantastical element at the center of it, but the story itself is grounded in reality, the reality of life ¬ñ its joys, its sorrows, its surprises, its moments of transcendent beauty and the sometimes devastating discovery that things most often work out much differently than one imagines or dreams they will. At its core, this is a story about love ¬ñ the love of a woman, Queenie (a heartfelt, beautiful performance from Taraji P. Henson), for a horrific-looking little baby, the love of a father for his son, the love of a man for a woman and a woman (Cate Blanchett's stunning performance) for a reversely-aging man.At the heart of the film, of course, is Brad Pitt's perfect turn as Benjamin. Aside from all the other wonderful things he brings to it, his part needed someone physically beautiful, to give full power to the segment of the movie where Benjamin is in the magnificent glory of his prime. Vincent Gallo, as great as he is, wouldn't have cut it, is what I'm saying. Pitt's physical beauty gives deep resonance to this segment ~ there's a heartbreaking feeling to this part of the film, making what follows even more chilling, as we see him become younger and younger, until even the memories of his incredibly-lived life are obliterated by his ever-regressing child's brain.A few more things that deserve mention: there's a great turn by the wonderful Tilda Swinton, who finally realizes her dream of being the first woman to swim the England Channel, at age 68, and also one from the great Jared Harris, as the colorful, consistently inebriated artist/sailor, Captain Mike. His character provides a lot of the humor in the film, and there is a lot of humor throughout, though never at the expense of the characters. The rest of the casting is perfect, as well ¬ñ for instance, you really believe that the younger Daisy has grown up to be Cate Blanchett.Screenwriter Roth and director Fincher make all the right choices in this epic piece of film making. This is the kind of film that movie theatres were created for in the first place, it's the kind of movie that cannot be rationalized or intellectualized or nitpicked to pieces - it simply must be experienced, in all the rarity of its awe-inspiring wonder. My favorite line, the most eloquent and the most ironic, is in the scene where Benjamin has become a youth (sort of reminding us how he looked in 'Thelma and Louise' so many years ago), and Daisy gasps, 'You've gotten so much younger!' and he replies, with hard-earned, world-weary wisdom, 'Only on the outside.'",10,5,11,30 January 2009
Men in Black II," Ah, the New York City I know and love!
","Aliens are literally crawling out of the woodwork in the NYC depicted in the Men in Black films, and oddly enough, it makes sense (I can say this, being a native an' all)!  I enjoyed this better than the first MIB, especially since -=- MINOR SPOILER ALERT -=- Tommy Lee's character is alive and kicking alien butt at the end, so it wasn't wistful and sad like the first one.  -=- END OF MINOR SPOILER.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld cannot deliver a bad film, he's endlessly inventive and he keeps things moving (or slithering) along at a fast pace.  I smiled through the whole film, it was thoroughly entertaining and my only complaint is that it was over too fast.",7,0,0,5 July 2002
Million Dollar Baby," Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't
","The above maxim is from a poster in the film's boxing gym, and its presence very cleverly and subtly pertains deeply to what transpires in this movie.Eastwood gets everything right in this one, beginning with Morgan Freeman's eloquent (but yet never overwrought) voice being utilized as the narrative - this in itself is transcendent, immediately elevating the film to mythic heights. And Hilary Swank's Maggie - there are no words to describe what she manages to achieve in this performance, no words could ever begin to do justice to the depths of what she makes us feel. And Eastwood's turn as Frankie is equally brilliant, coming from a place of true, pure and deep understanding of the human condition and all the dark ramifications that implies.The best thing about the film - and another one of the things that elevates it to mythic status - is how there is not one minute detail that doesn't belong; there is nothing on screen that doesn't contribute completely and utterly to the film's power - the amusing banter, for example, is not there to simply kill time or to create comic relief but rather it is intrinsic to the characters, to show their almost-unrelenting heart in the face of monumental adversity. Eastwood has matured magnificently as a director, he has made me a believer after all these years; I could not get home faster to get to IMDb and give this staggeringly heartfelt masterpiece a TEN.",10,6,12,29 January 2005
Mulholland Drive," The Impossible Dream
","Been into Lynch since Eraserhead, which I saw in an actual theatre many years back and came away positive I'd seen something quite spectacular and original. I've watched it several times on VHS since then, and I've seen all of his subsequent films more than once as well - it seems to be a requirement with them.I've seen Mulholland Dr. 5 times now - once in a theatre in Hollywood the weekend it opened and 4 more times on cable and/or DVD. I'm convinced that the entire first two-thirds of the movie is Diane's dream, from the very beginning, with the jitterbug dancing (Diane won a jitterbug contest, we learn later). She becomes 'Betty' in her dream, juxtaposing her name with the name she saw on the waitress's tag at Winkie's when she was paying the hit-man guy to kill Camilla.Here's what confused me about this concept the first and second times I saw the movie and made me doubt if I was right: generally, in a dream, YOU are in every sequence, or at least your consciousness is there, watching. In this dream, though, Diane is not in all the sequences. This threw me off. But I think I've got it: Diane created the whole thing in her mind as a MOVIE, with other characters besides herself and Camilla.Great performances here, of course, particularly from Naomi Watts, whom I had never seen before. I've made it a point to check out every film she's done since; she is one of the best actors working today, plain and simple. Not sure I'd agree to meet her up on Mulholland Dr., though.",9,2,3,31 October 2002

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie and the Kookoonut Factory
","I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, I think he's visually brilliant, and I generally tip my hat to Johhny Depp for sheer audacity alone, but I have to regretfully acknowledge that watching this film was not what I would call a pleasant experience by any stretch (no pun intended).It was OK during the set-up, when we meet Charlie (the perfectly cast Freddie Highmore) and his maniacally eccentric family - the film actually works while we're all waiting to see how Charlie's going to become one of the five supposedly lucky souls who finds the all-important Golden Ticket and gets to visit - moment of reverential silence - The Factory. But soon as Depp shows up, looking like a deranged cross between Jane Fonda, Billy Crystal and Faye Dunaway, it's downhill all the way, unfortunately. I never thought I would agree with the people who had said there were parallels between this version of Wonka and Michael Jackson, but these people were sadly on the money: here we have an emotionally crippled character, damaged from childhood, who becomes the antithesis of everything his father stood for, the ultimate act of neurotic rebellion in full force. To his credit, by the third act, Wonka realizes he's monumentally dysfunctional, which is cemented in a retardedly demented Oompa Loompa therapy session.And let's talk about these Oompa Loompas - they're undeniably creepy by any standards, let's face it, and the musical numbers become more psychotic as the scenario goes on. I was thinking about three fourths of the way through that I needed some serious drugs to properly appreciate this movie, I mean the endorphins released by mere chocolate unfortunately were hardly enough to cut the proverbial mustard.",4,0,1,11 September 2005
Black Snake Moan," Sinfully Soulful and Heavy
","If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan.Unashamedly over the top from the get go, this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame. It's yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on, in more positive ways, with their lives. Been done before, of course, this tale, but as I've always said, it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power.Ricci's damaged-by-childhood-abuse wild-child character Rae and Jackson's equally soulsick musician character Lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances, and Laz takes it upon himself to try to help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain, rather than trying to take further advantage of her, and we know from the onset that Laz's heart, and the film's heart, is in the right place. The movie at its core is about the redemptive, healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates profoundly with this truth - soulfully, artfully and brilliantly.A major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce, committed performances from Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists' hands are, instead, powerful as all get-out. In particular, the film's arc scene, in which Jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house, with Ricci, amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from Rae's past running amok inside her head, leading her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to his leg, comes off not ridiculous as technically it should, but rather as gut-wrenchingly cathartic. All the supporting performances are fantastic here too. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Rae's anxiety-ridden boyfriend Ronnie, and the always-wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is outstanding as well, as Laz's reverend friend R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works about this movie, let's face it, including the music/soundtrack, which features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House, and most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I am listening to as I compose this review. There's also a really beautiful and moving version of 'This Little Light of Mine' featured in the film, sung heart-breakingly tentative and soft by Ricci.Samuel Jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far; I could not agree with him more. This is work that he can be monumentally proud of, along with everyone else involved in this audacious, supremely wise and deeply heartfelt mother*ucker of a project.",10,13,21,5 March 2007
Big Fish," Big Fish, Bigger Heart
","I've been a Tim Burton follower from the beginning (hey, it doesn't get much better than Frankenweenie), and I was delighted to see this film, where he uses his enormous capacity for visual originality to bring a thoroughly remarkable story to the screen.Big Fish works on so many levels that it's impossible to truly convey to you if you haven't yet seen it what a magnificent treat you have in store.   And if you're a fan of the great songwriter Loudon Wainwright, you'll be extra pleased, since he's in it, and he's wonderful in his part - everyone shines in this film, especially Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and of course Albert Finney, who will no doubt get a Best Actor nomination for his deeply heartfelt performance.",9,0,0,19 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Putting the virtually impossible on film
","I saw this film the day it came out, last Friday, and nearly a week later I am attempting to put onto the page how deeply I feel about it.
I can start by saying that I have the most profound respect for Charlie Kaufman - I think he and Mike White are the most brilliantly subversive (and subversively brilliant) screenwriters working today - and in Eternal Sunshine, with his team of superb actors and a kindred spirit director, Kaufman once again does what only he can do: probe, stretch,  and literally recreate the depths of his chosen reality, turning it inside out, around and back again, without ever losing sight of his story's priorities at any given time.  He's a masterful writer with a daring mind that knows no boundaries or limitations, and in this film he directs his unflinching genius at relationships -- the human need for them, the over-whelming fragility of them, and most profoundly, the pain they cause when we expect another person to fulfill the parts of ourselves that cannot be filled by another person - the illusions we have about each other, the baggage we bring to any new encounter, the neurotic preconceptions that pretty much doom any relationship once it gets past the newness phase.   Kaufman shows this to us brilliantly (and subversively) in the course of Eternal Sunshine, but this is just part of the 'magic' he pulls off here: he also actually manages to get inside the mind of his main character (played with unerring poignancy by Jim Carrey) and show us his subconscious process - this is not easily accomplished without resorting to cliches galore, but Kaufman and his crew manage to pull it off without a hitch.",10,0,1,25 March 2004
The Last Samurai," Sake! SAKE!!!
","The cinematography is stunning throughout The Last Samurai, and Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are excellent, but after the extremely well-executed set-up involving the two men, the film becomes completely predictable. . .and not in a good way. It basically just drones on and on, devoid of any genuine energy, and by the time it finally wraps up (with a less-than satisfying conclusion), I too felt like yelling for sake (as Cruise's character had done earlier).  For a film with so many swords, it has surprisingly very little edge.",4,0,2,8 December 2003
Life Is Beautiful," Benigni rules
","This is one of those monumentally gut-wrenching films that you wouldn't want to have to ever see more than once, but with a film this brilliant, once is enough.  Benigni is a genius, plain and simple, and he's also great at climbing on tables and chairs to accept awards (he couldn't possibly receive enough).",9,2,4,15 October 2002
Some Like It Hot," 'Wait for Sugar!'
","After ranting in my West Side Story write-up about how certain movies cry out to be experienced in an actual movie theatre (although I did conclude that West Story Story can be appreciated on a smaller screen), I decided to write about another classic movie that actually is enhanced by the smaller-screen experience: Billy Wilder's 1959 comedy gem, Some Like It Hot.I did get to see this in a movie theatre in Hollywood a few years back (with excellent popcorn!), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a beautifully executed piece, in all ways: The plot moves along briskly, the situations are exploited for all they're worth without ever descending into heavy-handedness, and Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon show the world why they became Movie Stars of the highest calibre - their characterizations are flawless, their comedic timing impeccable, and Curtis looks gorgeous in drag, let's face it.At home, on the smaller screen, this film plays amazingly well. The intimacy level is higher, of course, and you're easily drawn into the delightful story without feeling as if you're watching something horrifically dated, which I do feel with most films made before the '70s, say. The great Billy Wilder wrote and directed some fantastic movies in his career, and Some Like It Hot is right up there, at the pinnacle.",10,1,1,22 January 2008
The Da Vinci Code," So Dark, The Ron Film, Man
","I actually wasn't interested in rushing to catch this movie at all until the critics posted their reviews and I saw that they were nearly all bad. Then I found myself curious - just how bad can it be, I asked myself (switching the letters of the words around to form an anagram, of course). The answer: purdy dern bad. And even worse, it's boring. And long. Much, MUCH too long.It starts off in a cheesy manner and proceeds to get even cheesier as it goes on, and make no mistake - go on, it does. There is not one character that breathed as flesh and blood except for Ian McKellan's Sir Leigh Teabag - I mean Teabing - who stole the picture without any effort whatsoever on his part.The problem starts with the script, which is dreary and uninspired in every possible way. Add to that Ron Howard's yawn-inducing pacing (and I use that word lightly), the trying-to-pump-drama-into-a-tediously-overwrought-storyline, aka 'The Plot', and you've got a turkey on your hands the size of the west wing of the Louvre.Hanks' only 'good' line comes early on, when Audrey Tautou, whom I usually love but who comes off like a wooden prop here, shows him the hidden message on the Mona Lisa, 'So Dark The Con Of Man,' to which he replies, 'It doesn't say that!' (I thought this was a good line, anyway.)I was thinking while I was watching it, in an effort to stay awake, that the film would have been a helluva lot more fun if, say, Paul Giamatti had been playing Robert Langdon. And maybe they could've gotten, say, Kate Winslet to play Sophie, or perhaps Giamatti's co-star from Howard's previous film, So Dark The Cinderella Man, Renee Zellweger. I bet she could pull off a French accent.",3,2,7,20 May 2006
The Fountain," 'We spend our entire lives trying to become whole...'
","Two thousand six has been a year of phenomenally ambitious cinematic excursions, and Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain belongs right up there on the top of that list, in my opinion, along with The Illusionist.It is astoundingly difficult - nearly impossible - to portray the unportrayable, but Aronofsky succeeds in doing just that in The Fountain, and he does it with breathtaking purity of vision and the surehandness of a master.In his supremely down-to-earth interview with Capone from aintitcool.com (see link below), Aronofsky says, 'The Fountain of Youth is one of our oldest ancient myths--if not the oldest myth--that people have been telling, because people have been coming up with stories how to deal with the fear of death. And, trying to find out the reason of why we're here and what is life and what is love. And what happens when you die. These are questions that people have been asking since the beginning of time. So, there's absolutely no way that this schmoe from Brooklyn is going to be able to answer them. That's not the reality here. For me, it's a film that's a journey and it's a trip and it's an experience through the meditation of a lot of these questions...' As a writer and 'schmoe from Brooklyn' myself, I particularly appreciate what he's saying here. The journey of the two main characters/souls, portrayed magnificently by Jackman and Weitz, is indeed at the center of the film, which must have been excruciatingly hard to edit - a miracle in itself - but they got it right: it flows, from beginning to end, like a fountain, in a sublime, indescribably perfect circle.The rest of the interview: http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30768",10,5,10,27 November 2006
Crazy Heart," Not so crazy and a lot of heart
","So here we have Bridges doing what he does so brilliantly in every film he's ever appeared in - effortlessly sucking us in to his story, making us care, through the sheer easy confidence of his presence.It's this deceptive (and rare) quality which has caused him to be excruciatingly under-appreciated for years, and as a longtime fan, I'm thrilled that he's finally being given some props, in the form of the great reviews for his performance and of course all the Best Actor awards he's gotten thus far, which I hope will culminate in his winning the Oscar on March 7th. As others have said, it would also be a lifetime recognition award, and there's nobody working in films today who is more worthy.It's hard to separate the film from Bridges' performance, since in this case his performance IS the film. T-Bone Burnett's music is excellent, Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful as always, the little boy who plays her son is adorable and Colin Farrell gives a unexpectedly effective turn as the country music star Blake mentored, but every frame of Crazy Heart belongs to Bridges, plain and simple.He sort of evokes a cross between Kris Kristofferson and Nick Nolte in his performance, but it's genuinely heartfelt nonetheless, not a caricature. As always, he gets inside the character, inhabiting him from a profoundly deep place, and it's this quality which makes what he does seem so effortless - by becoming the person so completely, so intimately, we forget he's acting but rather we feel as if we're almost intruding on his life in a voyeuristic way when we watch him. Crazy Heart isn't a great movie by any stretch - it gets hugely simplistic toward the end - but it's good enough to leave us feeling that we've experienced something authentic, that we've spent time with someone worthwhile.",8,1,3,24 February 2010
Love Actually," A labor of love actually
","The greatest thing about this movie (and there are a LOT of great things) is how it's edited -- although we have a lot of stories running simultaneously, thanks to the brilliant editing (which cleverly employs music as a tool to link the scenes) we are able to juggle these stories with no problem whatsoever.  This is a very rich and rewarding film, loaded with heart, unabashed romanticism and just enough 'reality check' elements to keep it grounded. Kudos to all concerned.",8,0,2,24 November 2003
There Will Be Blood," Like watching a man attend his own funeral
","There is no denying that DDL is a superlative actor, capable of delivering a 125% commitment to any character he takes on. This is a given. His performance in There Will Be Blood is indisputably stupendous, and he does deserve the Oscar he no doubt will receive later in the month.That being said, this doesn't make the movie all that great; it's hardly perfect and hardly the masterpiece so many critics are deeming it to be. For a film to be truly great, you have to have a brilliant concept going in, and said concept must then be brilliantly executed. I think this film had a very good concept but its overall flaws lie in the execution. Haven't read the source material (the novel by Sinclair) but I do think there is enough of a grand story here to warrant a better execution.Some films give the viewer too much information on the characters, which generally leads to triteness and loss of edge; others give too little. There Will Be Blood, for me, falls into this second category: we are never given enough background detail, or - even worse - enough CURRENT detail, to have the Daniel Plainview character fleshed out enough to even begin to understand him on anything other than a superficial level. All we are given to work with is an empty shell of a man, with hatred for himself at his deepest core, and that hatred festers from the inside, until he is, by the end of the movie, a drunken rotted-out, still-breathing corpse. He has monetary success, sure, but with no one to share it with, it is meaningless.The battle of egos between the Eli preacher character and Daniel is at the root of the film, and this was played out in a very intriguing way, the question being, which one of them is actually phonier, more psychotic and more evil? Partway through the film we know that Daniel, who at one point submits himself to an act of vile and ridiculously overplayed humiliation at Eli's hands, will be getting revenge. Therefore, the ending that so many people have found to be surprising came as no surprise to me; it was the only possible way the movie could conclude, in fact. The ending was not as powerful as it could have been because I just didn't feel Daniel's character deteriorate the way he obviously had as depicted in the 1927 sequence. There's a character that shows up halfway through, who tries to pass himself off as Daniel's brother (from a different mother); this character turns out to be nothing more than a plot device, a person to whom Daniel speaks of his true nature - it's not enough for him to succeed, he reveals, he's not happy unless others fail. He hates nearly everyone and cannot wait to make enough dough so he can get away from them all, blah blah blah. From then on, his character becomes more openly hateful, but we never really FEEL this happening from the inside of the man. This bugged me.The most frustrating part of the film is Daniel's relationship with his son (or the boy he apparently chooses to adopt as his own, not really sure how this worked). At the beginning, we see him showing what appears to be genuine affection for him, but this deteriorates so quickly that it just didn't seem valid. I think a little more subtle nuance in Anderson's writing was called for - this would have elevated the film to possible mythic status, right up there, say, with No Country For Old Men although I hate to compare.",6,6,13,1 February 2008
Ice Age," Ice Age melted me
","Adorable, witty, playful, sweet - what's not to like about Ice Age?  I had thought from the previews that it would surely be creative, but I didn't expect it to have so much heart, and such a cool underlying message (which was never banged over our heads, thanks to good writing) regarding tolerance, understanding, and high-mindedness. Did I mention you'll probably be smiling the entire time, too?",9,1,3,1 June 2002
The Last King of Scotland," The Last King of Scotland will stay with you
","Forest Whitaker has been turning in one magnificent performance after the other for over 20 years now, which makes it incredibly satisfying for me, as someone who's been deeply appreciating his work (both as an actor and director!), to see him finally get some props. His towering inferno of a performance in The Last King Of Scotland deserves all the kudos he's been receiving this year, and hopefully he will take the Oscar at next Sunday's ceremony, to top it off.Another great thing about Whitaker's receiving such high profile acknowledgment for his portrayal of Amin is that the film is finally getting wider distribution. I saw it this afternoon, and it was riveting from start to finish - brilliantly crafted, thanks to a supremely well-written script (with slow, subtle and ultimately overwhelming build), perfectly directed, and impeccably cast, particularly in the two main roles.Whitaker's been getting all the accolades - his depiction of Amin as a lethally charming but horrifically psychotic two-faced 'president' works because he never loses sight of the fact that he's playing a human being. This is something that informs every one of Whitaker's performances, and it is the major quality that also makes his work always stand out. There is another flawless performance in this film, however: it's James McAvoy, who plays the fictional doctor character through whose eyes we experience the movie.The scenes between McAvoy and Whitaker are, in my opinion, some of the most powerful scenes between 2 characters ever filmed. The predicament which Nicholas finds himself is far more than he bargained for when he set out, at the film's start, to find adventure. The beginning, in fact, lets us know straight away that we're in good hands as far as the writing of the film goes: in just a couple of short scenes, we are shown everything we need to know about his character - the way he downs his wine so quickly at the table and wants more, the way he yells out with frustration in his bed, and the way he chooses to go to Africa by spinning the globe around and pointing to a location - twice; the first time he lands on Canada, which doesn't have the adventure factor he's clearly seeking.By the end of the film, he has most definitely gotten what he was searching for, a thousand times over, and he knows it. McAvoy conveys this brilliantly through his facial expressions and body language alone. We feel what he feels. Although we might not have made the same choices he makes in the course of the movie, we still have tremendous compassion for him, or at least I did, without feeling sorry for him, because he did indeed make those choices. His character knows that, as well. McAvoy as an actor makes us feel all this without ever stating any of it. It is a masterful performance, right up there with Whitaker's, and even though he hasn't gotten the kudos that Whitaker's received for The Last King of Scotland, it is a performance that will not be easily forgotten.",9,1,4,17 February 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The dog has the best lines
","I expected stupidity from this film, and I wasn't disappointed - it's stupid, awright, damn stupid, and although it's not a total waste of time because --- POSSIBLE SPOILER --- Ferrell's on-screen dog has a great exchange of dialogue with the bear --- END OF SPOILER --- it's still purdy damn stupid.  I wasn't expecting subtlety (and I didn't get any), I'm a watcher of SNL and I know better than that, but I was hoping for a possible shred of intelligence to rear its head somewhere during the proceedings.  No such luck.  Applegate is adorable but she has a thoroughly thankless role here -- she has to be (1) smitten with Ferrell's character while still (2) throbbing with personal ambition and (3) willing to do anything to achieve her goal but yet (4) dreadfully sorry when she does get what she wants while still (5) trying to maintain a decent relationship with Ferrell's character although she's (6) thrilled to have gotten what she wanted all along. Sounds like a complex role for an actor, but guess what? It's a shallow as the day is long (sorry for the mixed metaphor), just like the rest of the film.  Shallow can occasionally be ok, so long as there are actual jokes and/or humorous situations, but this isn't funny, not really.  It's just sad, as Ross Perot would say, and to use another one of his famous phrases, it's a dog that won't hunt.",3,3,6,25 July 2004
Stranger Than Fiction," Wise and profound
","Stranger Than Fiction is a film, judging from the trailers, that appears to be a quirky, clever little comedy. In reality, it's much more than that, and it's much more than the sum of its parts, as well.As a writer, I am all too familiar with the sometimes-eerie ways that life parallels art, and vice versa. In Fiction, that's just the jumping-off point; there are quite a few thought-provoking ideas and wise messages to be had here, and they're all cleverly injected into the proceedings without the slightest bit of heavy-handedness or preachiness, from the beginning to the very end.The casting is superb. Ferrell proves once and for all that he is an actor, Hoffman is terrific as always, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was the absolute perfect choice for Ana, the person who arouses Harold's deeply buried feelings of love. I thought the scene where he plays that song for her on the guitar was the best in the movie. Her reaction when she comes in from the kitchen, the look on her face - that rang true on a profound level. And Emma Thompson, who is a writer herself, brought genuine angst to her portrayal of a person who has to come to terms with what her responsibilities are in this life, both as an artist and as a human being.",10,1,2,18 November 2006
The Wrestler," No Holds Barred
","If you're familiar with Darren Aronofsky, you know that he makes balls-out, no-holds-barred films, from the outrageous 'Pi' to the gut-wrenching 'Requiem For A Dream' to the epic scope and profound power of 'The Fountain', so it's no surprise that his fourth feature film, 'The Wrestler', follows in this unflinching tradition.And if you, like me, enjoy his kind of film-making, you will certainly appreciate this incredibly intense character study. It's the story of Randy (ne Robin) 'The Ram' Robinson , a hugely successful professional wrestler who is well past his prime but still hanging on to the only life he's ever known ~ the glory of what happens in The Ring.Mickey Rourke is our Randy, and he's the perfect choice, the only choice. Let's face it, the film wouldn't have really worked with, say, Stallone or Pacino or Steve Buscemi in the role. Rourke has been a boxer, in the '90s, he's lived this sort of life (and has even talked about trying professional wrestling in the future ¬ñ with Rourke, it could very well happen). He knows this character from the inside, and every bit of that hard-earned knowledge explodes onto the screen.The film lives or dies on the basis of the believability of this performance, and I'm here to tell you he is so credible that you might sometimes forget you're watching an actor, he's buried so deep within the soul of the character. Whether we see him with his grungy dirty blond hair in a restrained bun, trying to live a 'normal' existence - trying to reconcile his broken relationship with his daughter Stephanie (another completely believable performance from the great Evan Rachel Wood), trying to forge some sort of meaningful bond with stripper Marisa Tomei (in a deeply heartfelt ¬ñ and sexy- performance), trying to fit into a new gig behind the deli counter of a super market ¬ñ or with his hair down, getting pounded to a pulp in the ring, we feel it. We feel his regret, his frustration, his hopefulness, his pain, we live it with him; this is a genuine tour de force for Rourke, and I wouldn't be surprised if he comes up from behind and takes Best Actor on 2/22/09.",9,1,1,31 January 2009
The Terminal," Shawshank without the redemption
","The Terminal starts out with a shaky premise and proceeds to get shakier and shakier as it goes on (and on and on).  It seemed to me like Spielberg was counting on Tom Hanks to be so engrossing that nobody would notice how stupid the movie is.  The good news: Hanks is great, completely at one with his character and thoroughly believable throughout.The bad news: The film really begins to go seriously downhill when -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- Stanley Tucci's character is outsmarted by Hanks (there's medicine and a non-existent goat involved) and from here, the film starts turning into a third-rate rehash of the superb movie The Shawshank Redemption, with Tucci's character becoming increasingly angered by Hanks, to the point of trying to sabotage him at every turn (just like the sadistic warden did to Tim Robbins in Shawshank).  But there's no redemption here, just an unbelievably contrived sequence where Tucci orders his security people to stop Hanks from leaving the terminal, but of course the head guy sides with Hanks and lets him depart, in the corniest possible way, while Tucci semi-foams at the mouth (he's not really THAT perturbed, you see; the script tries to play it both ways, telegraphing to anyone in the audience with half a brain that this is a pathetic ploy to drag the film out longer by creating a completely unnecessary conflict).  -=- END OF SPOILERThere's a ton of other stupid stuff going on as well; I can site a couple but not all (it would make this review much too long) - one of the guys on the food staff employs Hanks (who is making MORE MONEY than Tucci by mid-film, doing 'under-the-table' construction work, totally inconceivable at an airport) to help him woo the woman who constantly stamps Hanks' form 'REJECTED'; that's ok, that's cool and charming, but it's thoroughly implausible that she -=- SPOILER ALERT =-= winds up MARRYING this guy, without seemingly getting to know him whatsoever. And Hanks himself begins a relationship with a flight attendant (played by Zeta-Jones); she's yer basic hopelessly-devoted-to-a-married-man sadsack, written as a total cliche, as all the characters wind up being.  -=- END OF SPOILER  I want to point out that I came into this movie totally open-minded; I generally like Spielberg as a director and I think Hanks is brilliant, and I'm also a huge fan of the Tuccinator (as I affectionate call him).  I was willing to suspend disbelief for the basic shaky plot because I thought the film would at least proceed with some sort of intelligence once the premise was set up.  But it's like Spielberg didn't really know what the heck kind of film he was making -- it doesn't really work as a fantasy because there are too many elements of attempted realness involved, it doesn't actually play as a metaphor because Hanks actually has an agenda (involving his father), and it certainly doesn't work as a drama, what with the half-heartedness of the characters' convictions (Tucci's character in particular).  It's not a comedy either because nothing really funny happens. It's a mess, really, and by the time the unbelievably unsatisfying ending comes around, my feelings had shifted, as you can see from what I've written here.  My suggestion to Spielberg:  Step back, Stevo, step back very far and get a grip.  Some clarity of vision is necessary if you're to maintain your godlike-director status for much longer (at least on THIS planet anyway).",3,2,7,21 June 2004
Music and Lyrics," This movie is dinner AND dessert
","Music and Lyrics has been on the top of my list of must-sees from the first time I caught the trailer; any film that features Hugh Grant as a washed-up 80s pop star and Drew Barrymore as his song writing partner had to be more than serviceable or there's no glimmer of hope for the movie biz - that was my thinking. Today, I got to see the film, and I'm thrilled to report that I liked it even better than I had expected, from the trailer, which is a monumental rarity for me.This film works on every level, from the premise on up. Hugh Grant was born to play the role of Alex Fletcher. In fact, I cannot think of any other actor who could pull the performance off as brilliantly as he does. The thing about Grant that really sets him apart from others who do romantic comedy is his perfect timing combined with his abundance of natural glibness - he has a way of making witty dialogue even wittier by having it sound as if he's actually just thought it up and is speaking it spontaneously. There are not very many actors you can genuinely say that about. And Drew Barrymore - her mere presence is enough to make any movie at least watchable, and here she is given a great character, a superb co-star, and a clever set of circumstances to work with. The film is both charming and funny, which is not an easily-achievable combination. It never gets contrived, heavy-handed or mean-spirited, and just as importantly, it has heart. It's got a lot to say, as well, in a subtle way, about the serious topics of writing, inspiration, honesty, relationships, the music biz in general, and more specifically, the tightrope act that it takes to deal with the commerciality factor of superstardom while still maintaining one's integrity in the process. It also has an extra ace up its sleeve in the form of the absolutely gorgeous Haley Bennett, in a star-making performance as pop star Cora Corman, the person who enlists Fletcher's services at the get-go, which starts the delightful plot wheels turning. I especially appreciated how Cora's character is not made out to be a bimbo, some brainless puppet whose career is being controlled by some behind-the-scenes mastermind. This is evident particularly in the Madison Square Garden concert scene toward the end, where -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- she decides to do the song that was written for her by Grant's and Barrymore's characters the proper way; this is shown to be ultimately her decision and her decision alone, not a 'corporate' one. -=- END OF SPOILER.There aren't too many films, let's face it, that can make you laugh out loud (and I laughed out loud a LOT during Music and Lyrics - sometimes at the hilarious one-liners delivered so impeccably by Grant, sometimes at the situations, and sometimes it was a physical bit, like when the two of them wake up under his piano) and also deliver a heartfelt - and subtle - message about what it takes to be true to oneself in life and to realize what truly matters, whatever your occupation. There's a line in the film where Fletcher says his music from the 80s was OK, but it wasn't dinner, it was merely dessert. I'm here to tell you that Music and Lyrics is most definitely dinner. With a delicious serving of Chocolate Creme Brulee brought to your table afterwards.",10,2,4,15 February 2007
The Queen," An elegant film
","Frears definitely got the casting spot-on for this film - nobody could have portrayed HM Queen Elizabeth II as magnificently as the great Helen Mirren, whom I predict will win the Oscar this year. It could not go to a more deserving actor.The film is really well done, with the thoughtfulness, style and grace needed to depict the sensitive subject of the aftermath of Princess Diana's severely untimely death. Mirren's uncanny ability to evoke Elizabeth II electrifies every frame she appears in. I appreciated especially how we never truly get inside her head; she remains a cypher of sorts til the very end of the movie, although there are a few scenes where she does allow human emotion to break through the surface, but it's always done in a controlled way. The most revealing scene features a stag, whom the Queen is trying to shoo off so he's not hunted down; we can easily see how she relates herself to this inevitably trapped animal - it's a supremely effective analogy for her own life, and this scene is also done in a restrained way, keeping it elegant, subtle and sublime. Also especially effective here is Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, who manages just the right balance of respect for his Queen, along with the clear-headedness befitting his own position.",8,1,2,25 November 2006
Tombstone," Ah'm yo' huckleberry
","Short and sweet: What makes this film live and breathe as deeply as it does is Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday. This is truly one of the best marriages of an actor to his lines that I've ever experienced in a motion picture. Everything else in the film is excellent too, of course, especially the relationship between Doc and Wyatt (a superb Kurt Russell), but in the end it's Kilmer's Doc that stands towering above the fray.  A classic characterization that will define his career.",10,0,0,16 April 2002
Bruce Almighty," Not exactly B.E.A.-utiful
","I was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions: Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. As a huge fan, I was sure he'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong?  Yesterday, my bubble got burst big-time, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. The first act (where it's set up that he hates his life, he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God) is serviceable, the second act (where he's summoned by God via telephone and receives Powers Almighty) is GREAT - Carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny.  But the third act is wretched beyond belief.The rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who comes off EXCEEDINGLY well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her NAME reeks of unsubtlety) - she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead, he tells her (on bended knee, yet) that he's finally getting his news anchor job, and isn't it so exciting?She doesn't think so.  She wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still LOVES him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next, until by the end I was praying, too. . .for it to be over. I didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, Bruce prances into the room singing 'What if God were one of us, just a slob like one of us', blah blah blah), and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us (for openers, Morgan Freeman - a/k/a GOD - tells Bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this, a lot). Those choices were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy, directed by Tom Shadyac - it aint The Remains of the Day. Or rather it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy.  When the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of (gag) Message Movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that GRACE is his saving - have to say it - grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued.   All this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way, however. The film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points.  Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, light-handed way, so they went the bang-'em-over-the-heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice. They even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste.  It didn't work for me.",3,3,7,2 June 2003
Signs," A little too much corn in those fields?
","While not as breathtaking as The Sixth Sense (with its goosebump-inducing-no-matter-how-many-times-I-see-it surprise ending) nor as majestic as Unbreakable (with its unique believe-it-if-you-dare reality), Signs is still an M. Night Shyamalan film, which means it will not bore you, at least.  There are great performances as well: Mel Gibson conveys profound sadness with incredible subtlety, Joaquin Phoenix permeates his every scene with complexity, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin  have no false moves, thanks to Shyamalan's superb direction, particularly with children.
So we have a potentially brilliant film that doesn't quite pay off at the end (which in any other filmmaker's hands would most likely have been downright corny).  I do, however,  appreciate Shyamalan's attempt to depict a very tricky subject - the 'mysterious ways' of divine guidance, the lack of coincidence in events that seemingly appear disconnected, which come together when they're meant to, in order to make what is supposed to happen occur.  For that alone, I give him the thumbs-up sign.",7,0,3,5 August 2002
Identity," Don't read any reviews! (except this one)
","Identity is the kind of movie you do NOT want to read about before you see it and especially not here at imdb - spoilers are everywhere.  That being said, I will tell you that the film is an extremely effective little psychological thriller that I really enjoyed because I figured it out  - in 3 stages - from the clues given, and I got to have the supreme and intense pleasure of indeed seeing it play out the way I had deduced that it must. So for me, the ending was not a surprise (it was the only logical conclusion), but this didn't ruin the film for me or make it predictable in a bad way; in fact it actually ENHANCED the reward of the experience.The movie doesn't have enough psychological nuance to make it a masterpiece (like, for example The Sixth Sense) but I still got the chills at the end even though I had figured it out - this speaks volumes about its effectiveness.",8,0,0,28 April 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," The most fun you can have in the dark with your clothes on
","The original Die Hard movie still stands as one of the most compelling, entertaining and perfectly realized action films of all time, and after seeing the fourth installment in the franchise today, I am thrilled to report that in its own way, Live Free Or Die Hard is just as good as the original.Nobody understands the art of movie making better than Bruce Willis - how at the heart of any film, including an action film, there has to be a character whom audiences can relate to and sympathize with, not just yer basic bulked-outa-proportion megaman who offers nothing more than grunts and groans (although Willis can grunt and groan with the best of 'em). His John McClane rings true, plain and simple; no matter how outrageous the action becomes, you still can feel the heart of a genuine human being beating underneath there. And his sense of humor? Fuggedaboudit. Nobody can deliver a sarcastic sly remark better than Willis, and he gets a chance to do that a lot in this film - the hilarious one liners fly fast and furious. It's when McClane stops making jokes that you know he's going ultra-serious, and that's when the real fun begins.The remaining casting here is perfect across the board, as well. Timothy Olyphant is completely believable as the villain, Maggie Q. is great as the second most major physical bad ass in the movie, Justin Long grows on ya as McClane's reluctant sidekick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is totally captivating as McClane's daughter Lucy, and writer/director Kevin Smith rocks as the ultimate computer hacker, Warlock, whose frequency is, of course, 66.6. Worked for me.",10,5,14,27 June 2007
The Matrix," Getting beyond The Hype
","Before the movie came out, the What-Is-The-Matrix hype was everywhere, permeating everything.  I went in to the film expecting some great revelatory experience and I was very disappointed with what The Matrix turned out to be (the idea of the world we think is real being actually a computer simulation wasn't that original or earthshaking to me).  But in re-watching it on dvd (after having seen the sequel as well), I now appreciate the movie for what it is rather than for what I expected it to be, based on the over-powering hype.  Andy and Larry W. are brilliant, no question about it, and the inspired purity of their vision is definitely evident on the screen. The three leads are fantastic - Keanu Reeves' particular quirkiness has never been better utilized, Laurence Fishburne is stunning as Morpheus, and nobody could have brought Trinity to life with any more clarity and controlled passion than Carrie-Anne Moss.  Hugo Weaving looms large as well, as the contemptuous, non-human Agent Smith.  The script still leaves a lot to be desired, especially at the end, which wasn't really satisfying at all, but the film is a splendidly creative and heartfelt  achievement nonetheless.",8,0,1,15 June 2003
Sin City," Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
","Or perhaps that should read, 'Frodo, I don't think we're in the Shire anymore,' considering how one of our all-time favorite hobbits mutates into an insatiable, head-collecting cannibalistic psycho in Frank Miller's Sin City, without even blinking an eye (literally).He's only one of the many deranged lunatics we get to spend quality time with in the dark, courtesy of Robert Rodriguez's undeniably faithful film version of Miller's intense and brutal graphic novels. With a screenplay by Miller himself and co-directed by him (with a guest-director credit to Tarantino - what would Sin City be without his contribution, I ask you!?), we get to take a trip the likes of which we've never taken in a movie theatre before, and hopefully we'll never have to take again, but that's just my opinion.Don't get me wrong, the film is a stupendous achievement, visually - if you've ever read any of the Sin City graphic novels, you'll recognize the place immediately from the very first shot: beautiful, bleak, barren, brutal - all the good 'b' words. And the stories weave together brilliantly, there's no question: the film works on a plot level too. The performances couldn't be any better either, particularly Mickey Rourke's portrayal of Marv: covered in band-aids, brandishing bucketloads of bile, with a prosthetic profile which looks like a combination of Kirk Douglas and Roy Scheider, this is most definitely the role he was born to play.And you want babes? There's plenty of babes, most of 'em decked out in bondage gear to beat the band, and they're just as hell-bent on kickin' major butt as their male counterparts, make no mistake. Sounds really swingin' so far, huh? But remember, this is a Rodriguez/Tarentino joint, so of course it's gotta be more than just tastefully violent, it's gotta be yer basic beyond-the-levels-of-human-endurance affair, with broken bodies, half-eaten bodies, Pez-dispensered heads and severed heads galore, and this is just in the first hour. The person I saw it with had her eyes closed nearly the entire time, but that still couldn't shield her from the carnage, because, this, being a Rodriguez/Tarantino joint, remember, has to also include the characters' graphic verbal rehash of the violence: what had just happened to the victim, what it felt like when it happened, and what was going to happen next. So if you're especially squeamish, bring ear plugs to the theatre as well as your eye mask.When I was watching the film, I couldn't help thinking how much fun making this movie had to have been, especially for Frank Miller, to finally get to see his vision brought so lovingly to life, and this got me through some of the most bombastically brutal sequences. Don't get me wrong again, Sin City is not an incoherent exercise in excessively over-the-top self indulgence (a la From Dusk Til Dawn). It's worth seeing, especially if you could sneak an extremely large flask into the theatre with you (which I kept wishing we had done).",6,1,5,2 April 2005
Her," Mutual Masturbation in the Electronic Age (so to speak)
","A lot of people have philosophized about Her, both in reviews and on various message boards at various sites, in an attempt to make the film into more than it is, to try to give it some profound meaning. This is a waste of energy because there is none. Phoenix is an amazing actor, an intense and riveting screen presence, but here, in the role of Theodore Twomby, a sweetly sensitive soul who writes poignant letters for other people for a living, he's given hardly anything to work with. He's either grinning retardedly with dewy eyes or moping. First there's moping. His wife is divorcing him and he's reluctant to sign the papers. But then, when he hooks up (so to speak) with his new OS, we get scene after scene of him 'falling in love' with it/her. She decides to call 'herself' Samantha because it sounds nice. She also decides that she's an actual person, with feelings and emotions and libido, just without a body. Her 'needs' sometimes conflict with his. Here's one example, not as ridiculous as the others but silly just the same: at one point she wakes him up while he's asleep 'just to hear' his voice. (If windows 8 did that, I would not be flattered, to say the least.)I still genuinely wanted to buy into the plot; I liked the idea of the OS having a reciprocal relationship with its owner (which of course has been depicted in other movies, not an original concept in itself). And I understand fully well that the age we're living in, with the over-abundance of tech devices, cell phones, all that, has ironically not brought people closer together but rather farther apart. So many people feel empty, lonely, disconnected, longing for intimacy and meaning in their relationships. This is recognized in the film, and that's completely valid.The problem for me was how oddly one-dimensional and superficial the plot turned out to be. Nothing clever, no insights really, just a series of silly scenarios, the silliest being the 'sex' scenes.-=- SPOILER ALERT -=- There's one where the screen goes black so Samantha and our hapless hero can indulge in seemingly mutual masturbation; this choice was made apparently in the interest of subtlety. Rather than keeping the camera on Theodore's face, we get the black screen so we can hear what's going down (so to speak) and use our imaginations for the rest. This scene came off (so to speak) as really silly, not intimate or erotic. Then, there's another 'sex' scene, where Samantha takes the liberty of hiring a surrogate partner for Theodore, so she (Samantha) can provide him with an actual body while she uses her own voice to make love to him (so to speak). Of course it doesn't work at all for Theodore, which was probably for the best - it spared the viewers another possible silly black-screen event.The silliest part about this scene: the surrogate is so sorry that she couldn't fulfill Samantha's desire (so to speak) and she cries that she wanted to be part of their great 'love'. Wow.The silliest part of all, though, is saved for the end. All the OS's manage to band together to 'leave' their owners to venture into the unknown, in order to create a new consciousness, going farther than any species has ever gone before, blah blah blah. Cue more moping. -=-END OF SPOILER -=-The reason I'm giving it a 5 (the equivalent of 2-1/2 stars) instead of a lower rating is because the movie wasn't boring, it kept my attention the entire time, even when I was rolling my eyes in disbelief at the screen, plus the performances were competent enough. Scarlett J's vocal contribution (as Samantha) was decent considering what she was given to work with, and Amy Adams as the friend was sufficiently morose throughout, but in a good, hopeful way. Also, the film was not mean-spirited in its depiction of sad, empty souls yearning for connection, as we all are. So the message was there - not profoundly stated, but visible nonetheless.",5,7,12,17 May 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," (d) It is written
","Highly acclaimed and rightfully so, 'Slumdog Millionaire' has one of the most unique structures of any film I've seen: the main character, Jamal ¬ñ a superb performance from the young Dev Patel ¬ñ is on television, on India's version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. He is presented with the questions and we are shown, through extensive, vivid and sometimes brutally shocking flashbacks of his incredible life experiences, how he has come to know each of the answers.Without giving away too much, we see how Jamal and his brother Salim grow up in the slums of Mumbai, India, where they meet Latika. Jamal and Latika realize very early on that they are soulmates, and the film, we find, is actually at its heart a story of how of the power of their love survives all of the many (and there are many) obstacles thrown in their way. It also reminds us, brilliantly, through the structure of how Jamal has come to know the answers to the questions on the game show, that in life, things do happen the way they're meant to happen, when they're meant to happen ¬ñ it's the energy of the Universe, which works with our own energy, giving us the tools to achieve exactly what we are seeking, on a deep soul level.Danny Boyle has said in interviews that the city of Mumbai is a city of contradictions, where the slums exist literally in the midst of the more affluent sections, and he wanted to capture that reality. He has most definitely succeeded, both in the film's kinetic energy and in the way the story veers from horrific brutality to lyrical moments of beauty and everything inbetween, sometimes all at once. And Dev Patel is a real find, who can register childlike hope in one second and intense, gritty resolve in the next ¬ñ a perfectly modulated performance. And the actors who played the 3 characters as children were all brilliant and perfectly cast, as well.I did have a little problem with the writing in some of the off-camera game show scenes, plus in the scenes with the older Jamal and older Latika (the gorgeous Freida Pinto), it seemed that she was older than he was; it turns out she indeed was born nearly 6 years earlier. This sort of detracted from the power of these scenes, for me; if they could have either made Pinto look a little younger or made Patel look a little older, it would have been more effective, I think. It's a dazzling piece of film making, nonetheless, and make sure you stay for the dance sequence, over the end credits. It rocks.",9,1,3,31 January 2009
Donnie Darko," Deep, Deeper, Deepo Part TWO
","-=- spoiler alert -=-  I have decided to add this comment after reading so many reviews from PAID FILM CRITICS and IMDB reviewers who just didn't get the film. In this movie, Donnie gets a chance to NOT DIE in his bedroom at the beginning, when the jet crashes into the house.  He is allowed to live further into the future and he gets to see what would have happened.  He is also exposed to the possibility of time travel; he chooses to take this option when he sees how his life (and the lives of his closest companions) will turn out if he stays on the planet.
