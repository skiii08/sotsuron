Angels & Demons," A big disappointment
","This movie had all the potential.The book had the right ingredients for a blockbuster,thrill a minute,nail biting summer flick.But,unnecessary modifications has resulted into another insipid adaptation of a Dan Brown book.The pacing of the film is nowhere as racy as the book.Sometimes,it's plain boring.Changes are welcome in a film adaptation if it adds some value to it.However,the changes out here are plain unneeded and silly.Dropping Kohler for a character called Richter,reducing the whole Illuminati plot to a whimper isn't my idea of a change for the better.Tom Hanks simply reprises the role he did in the Da Vinci Code,which isn't saying much.Ayelet Zurer was far from perfect.Ewan McGregor could have made a good Camerlengo,but the role written for him isn't that great.Watch Angels and Demons with minimal expectations,you might enjoy it.If you liked the Da Vinci Code film,you are sure to enjoy this",6,1,4,6 June 2009
Ocean's Thirteen," Great fun
","Let's face it.Ocean's 11 was great,ocean's 12 was pathetic.But,finally Sodenbergh goes back to the roots of his original film and makes it a fun caper.No more Le Marc,no more Julia Roberts and all that crap.This is possibly the best heist film since ocean's 11.Ocean's 13 marries the heist part of the original film with the complexity of ocean's 12 but in no way does it appear self-indulgent or laboured.Clooney is great as always and so are the rest of the gang.Expect to see a lot of Linus in this film.But,I feel that Rusty fans will be disappointed.The poor guy hardly has much to do as compared to the previous 2 films.Al Pacino doesn't disappoint though I felt that his character lacked the ruthlessness of Terry Benedict.Forget the aberration known as ocean's 12 and go and get your kicks with ocean's 13.Can we have ocean's 14 Steve?",8,11,19,8 June 2007
