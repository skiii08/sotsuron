Ali," Editd By The Tea Lady
","Oliver Stone style documentary drama with good (earnest even) intentions but lacking the right touches to make this film really fly. The fight scenes are excellent documents of what happened in the ring; and, even though (or more probably because) they are safe and clean, they hold an emotional charge which makes them compelling to watch, especially the Rumble In The Jungle fight which climaxes the film. The music choices are excellent in capturing the essence of the period covered, the black soul, the political happenings, Ali's friendships, and underscoring the events on screen. The fight scenes and the music production are the best parts of an otherwise dull, confused, boring and weary film which brought this viewer no closer to an understanding of Ali. The editing for the TV version I watched must have been done by the tea lady because there were many confusions and oddities. Either that or the editor assumed the audience would already know so much about Ali's life and the political and cultural events of the time that it would be just too silly to give people basic information, such as Ali losing his come-back fight. There is much interesting material in Ali's life that would a great film - this is not that film.",3,1,3,25 September 2005
Casablanca," Why Does It Work?
","This is a movie so flawed it is in danger of falling apart. Bergman is cold, confused and remote - unconvincing as the woman who dominates the lives of the mysterious and highly respected American Rick Blaine, and the much sought after inspiration of the resistance Victor Laszlo. The Paris sequence is corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinema history - 'Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?' Yet this film remains my all time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. I get goosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's to sing La Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. I melt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at the references to America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitment and sacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawn characters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is it Bogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force opening where every character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey through Rick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally original story-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feels so right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome. 'Here's looking at you, kid!'",10,3,3,27 June 2003
Erin Brockovich," True Stories Are Dull
","'Based on a true story' is a phrase that almost always guarantees a bad movie. Straight from the off there is going to be a problem. If the scriptwriter strays from the truth people will say 'That's not what happened' - and also, let's face it, if the script ain't gonna stay with the truth then it ain't a 'True Story'. But if the scriptwriter does stay with the truth then the story is likely to be dull because life is mostly dull. That's why we have fiction. Fiction takes the essence of something vital and important and tells it in a gripping manner that reveals all the issues in a provocative and memorable way.Erin Brockovich is a brash woman - offensive, unpleasant, thoughtless and aggressive. Some people like her. Having the very likable Julia Roberts play her goes some way to softening her. Watching a movie about this unpleasant woman who made herself and her firm a lot of money by suing a power company is not my idea of high art nor pleasant entertainment. She won a big court case - big deal. That doesn't make her interesting. Not does it make her a hero.I didn't like this film.",4,4,12,26 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Boring
","A tiresome Walt Disney kiddies movie with appalling dialogue and a Bodger Award for the most dreadful performance by a leading actor in a major movie of all time. Everyone just woodenly and stiffly and badly moves through this movie repeating their dreadful lines with a lack of enthusiasm. Some embarrassment is evident. The storyline is pathetic and boring and dull. The initial action is limp and dull. In fact dull is the key word. Dull and boring and bad and wooden. And how on earth did this ever get filmed. Surely it can't be that hard to make an exciting, interesting and worthy pirate movie in such pleasant locations? The movie does pick up toward the end with some decent fight scenes, and a bit of swashbuckling, but it's too little too late.",4,3,6,11 February 2005
Spider-Man 2," From Art-House to Hollywood Failure
","The low-key opening third of the film in which Parker's character and situation is explored and revealed is quite engaging. Maguire has a soft, laid back approach that is quite appealing. This feels like a real film with real characters. The surrounding characters are a little over-blown, but seen as a film about a real person living in a comic-book fantasy, they work well, and there is a healthy, knowing tongue-in-cheek intelligence about the film that pulls me in. But at some point in the middle when the action film section really gets going I realized that I had become bored. The film had lost the art-house feel of the opening, had become yet another Hollywood No Brainer with big action sequences, no character development, no surprises, just the usual crash scenes. It was hard to stay focused, and I wondered why and where exactly the awareness of the intelligent viewer had been dropped. Certainly Molina plays the villain with wink-wink, thigh slapping gusto, and there is enough humour and drama in the ending to make most readers forget the tedium of the the middle third. But considered as a whole the film failed for me.",4,1,2,6 December 2004
Crash," Hard To Swallow
","It's good emotional stuff at the time, but the very real weaknesses nag at you as soon as the film ends. It's a real fader. After a month you've forgotten all about it.Once there's some distance from the emotion, I have to say that it sucks. Issues are isolated and blown out of proportion just to give an immediate emotional intensity. There is a lack of reality, intelligence, craft and creativity about the whole thing. And I found the racist, sex abusing cop's back story of being a dutiful son and then being a dramatic hero somewhat hard to swallow - after the event. Yeah, sure, at the time it felt like there was some significance there, but on reflection you see that it was just a dramatic scene in a Hollywood movie. And any suggestion that even a racist can also be nice to his mom is not worth making, except by racists to excuse and justify racist behaviour.The confusions you feel at the time are the result of some blunt emotional exploitation by the movie makers. It's like a series of big expensive, well made adverts strung together, some saying vote conservative and some saying vote liberal. At the time the adverts seem to be saying something. But by the next day real issues and real life take over and you return to reality.",3,16,23,8 November 2005
Grease," Whose Tongue In Whose Cheek?
","Surprisingly edgy, rough, and naughtily tongue-in-cheek, this is a great feel good movie that, well, makes you feel good. This is not smooth, flick and over-polished, it is a take it or leave it rough house of a movie. Nothing is ever pinned down, nothing is ever taken seriously, it just flickers  from one set scene to another, flashing knickers, posing, sticking out it's tongue like a bunch of schoolkids making a home movie. Great fun and great songs. My only complaint is the miming of the songs - for such a rough diamond I'd expect the singing to be as unpolished and dirty as the rest of the film.",7,1,3,2 August 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," This is the Walt Disney Version of Terminator
","If you've seen The Terminator, then you've already seen Terminator 2. Same plot line, same scenes, even the same lines crop up - the only difference is that this time there's a cute kid, and the cute kid insists on there being no deaths. Instead of the terminator blasting away at everyone in sight, he shoots them in the leg! The first film was original, shocking, disturbing and carried a powerful emotional charge. The dream of Kyle Reese, the man sent to protect Sarah Connor, is powerfully disturbing - a vision of the future in which mankind is being hunted to extinction, yet manages to just about hold on. In Terminator 2 we have the same scene - this  time it is Sarah Connor dreaming, and her dream is a clichéd one: the atom bomb dropping. A vision we long ago became familiar with and so holds no resonance at all. That lack of imagination and originality runs throughout this tired film. The fight in the first film was between a passionate human being (a man who feels pain, fear and love) and a remorseless cyborg. The end, in which a human uses cunning and ingenuity to destroy the machine, and uses another machine to do that, is satisfactory. In this limp re-make it is cyborg versus cyborg, and humans are on the side-lines. We are not engaged - indeed, it is like watching a computer game: empty and meaningless.",6,2,8,29 July 2003
The Piano," Soft Focus Porn
","Beautifully shot by Jane Campion in a dreamy soft focus The Piano gives the impression of being a better film that it really is. Some mud, some misty woodlands and a few tattooed and grinning Aborigines do not disguise the Mills & Boon plot-line. No matter how hard the viewer tries to get some depth out of the story you come up with nothing. Is this a story of women's lack of voice in the world? No - Ada McGrath is a strong woman who communicates very well, despite not speaking. Is this a story about the desire to create or express ones self? No - the piano is used as currency for sexual favour which Ada McGrath wants as much as George Baines. The seduction scenes are titillating rather than romantic, and the film slowly becomes sordid. The Piano is 9 1/2 Weeks meets The Draftsman's Contract, without the merit of either of those films.",5,3,8,14 July 2003
Black Hawk Down," Flat Perspective
","The consensus of opinion on Black Hawk Down is that as an action film depicting the reality of a battle it is extremely well executed.But that the personalities of the film's characters are mostly vacant, that they simply react to events without any real engagement with the wider issues of life. And that, even though it is clear from the film's portrayal of what happened that the raid on Mogadishu was badly handled, that the film somehow makes heroes out of the Rangers.That even though we are clearly told that over 1,000 Somalis died, that the film ignores their plight.It seems to me that the film is working. The soldiers personalities are largely vacant. We get enough to show that they are distinct enough to be real people, but that they mostly lack depth. That's all we need.The wider issues are there. Not exactly hidden. Not exactly in the background. There, clearly in black and white. In every frame. You can't escape from what is happening. We are shown and we are told. And the balance of opinion, as with the balance of weapon technology, is tilted very strongly in favour of the American soldiers.We are given the flat perspective - just like the aerial pictures of the battle scene the generals are staring at - and we make of it what we will.I saw an honest and brutal film that depicted quite clearly the imbalance of the battle in terms of numbers of people killed and weapons technology used. I saw the fear and thrill of the American soldiers. Some wanted to go back into the fight - other's were less keen. I saw the mess and the confusion. I saw angry Somalis, intelligent Somalis, violent Somalis, and lots of dead and dying Somalis. I saw the whole complex issue played out in front of me with astonishing clarity given the constant action of the film. I saw points in favour of the Ranger's philosophy of looking after your own. The beloved team spirit of the soldiers versus the clan spirit of the Somalis. The sense of community.'This is not your war.'",7,5,10,2 November 2004
Titanic," Big Enough
","An awesome tour-de-force of confident film-making. Adventure story, love story, disaster movie, and the mystery of the missing jewel running throughout the film. This is entertainment of the highest order. Gripping and oh so emotional. The story rocks along so tight that at no point do you feel that you are witnessing an accurate documentary of what happened the night the unsinkable ship went down.",9,2,4,17 August 2003
The Untouchables," Flawed Potential
","In any sensible scheme of things The Untouchables is not a Great Movie - but it somehow does attract serious attention. We want it to be a good movie - it has a big name crew and Serious Intent written all over it - but it fails. It doesn't fail badly - it fails in small, sad ways that in themselves are hardly noticeable, but which in the end just mount up to an unsatisfactory experience. De Palma wants to be a better director than he is - he uses intentionally 'interesting' camera angles and movement. And just sometimes he can make a powerful sequence like the shoot out in the railway station. That the very effective minimalistic approach to this sequence came about through budget cut restraints, and that he borrowed heavily from Hitchcock, doesn't take anything away from the scene's effectiveness - though it does take away from any claims to De Palma's ability as a director. De Palma's wannabe serious pretensions drag this movie down and hold it from ever taking off into the thrilling action picture it wants to be. Mamet's script holds potential - it is a dark and somber script. When given to an actor with presence, such as Sean Connery, the dour, mean, repressed and aggressive nature of prohibition Chicago is fully explored. But the script is flawed. The sequence in Canada should never have been shot. The characters could have been better drawn and given more life and, well, character. But there was potential there that a good director would have exploited. Costner is wooden. De Niro is limited. Garcia says little. And Martin Smith is ugly in big glasses. It is only Connery and Bradford who do well. The set design gives everything a comic book feel. But not on the dark Gothic scale of Batman - no, this is more like Doonesbury. Take little snippets here and there, give it a fast edit with lots of Sean Connery, and you have a great trailer. But sadly the movie does not live up to expectation.",6,10,23,28 September 2004
Any Given Sunday," Bone Crunching
","Every American Football cliché and issue and moment of heroism is thrown together in one bone crunching tackle of a movie. This is one fired up, drug enhanced super financed player of a movie. This is the touchdown! The games are played in a confused and confusing maelstrom of noise and sound. The players are larger than life both off and on the field. At no time do we see the crack in the war-paint. This is a full on movie. Compelling, exciting and completely daft. Failing miserably at the same time as succeeding heroically. Thoroughly enjoyable!",7,1,2,11 August 2003
The Wedding Singer," Romantic Comedy
","The Wedding Singer is a romantic comedy set in the 80's. It's the familiar boy meets girl story. The boy in this case being a singer at weddings. He's smoothly smooth, and just a little too nice to believe. He meets the girl when she starts waitressing at the same weddings in which he is booked to sing. But they are both engaged to other people so nothing is going to happen. Then the boy gets stood up for his own wedding. He is told by his ex-fiancé that he's too boring (and, boy, is she right about that!). The boy becomes depressed and listens to too much of The Cure. But there's now an interesting edge to him at least. The story then unfolds in typical romantic comedy style. The gimmick here is all the 80's references. Amusing at first, you need to have a big capacity for overkill to continue to laugh at that gag. The lack of originality. The same idea repeated over and over again until you want to scream. Yes. It certainly does capture the essence of the 80's! It's an enjoyable enough little film. A little more edge to the characters and a lot less 80's referencing might make it a better film.",5,0,1,23 September 2004
