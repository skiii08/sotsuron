Come and See," Hugely uneven WWII film
","There are scenes taking place that appear to be non-sequiturs; several lightly armed Russians going to some distant 'warehouse' to secure food in the boonies after their particular village has been savagely attacked (though there's no explanation provided to explain how so many villagers escaped the Nazi extermination regiment that left a mound of bodies next to a walled house on the outskirts of town.). Then we cut to a scene where the same men are running for their lives seemingly pursued only by a fixed and unseen machine gun's bullets. Not a clearly thought out scene! Another: Florya and a companion have requisitioned a cow. Suddenly massive tracer-laden machine gun fire inundates the area the three are in but the only casualty is one of the men. Question: How do you miss a standing cow in the field? (Answer: The cow is then killed for better theatrical value.) The director, Klimov, born in 1933, seems to never have seen a movie. How else to explain long, long static shots of people that provide no additional information about them. He's also deficient in any editing aesthetic after 1919; Mr. Klimov: your time is our time and you waste much of it in shots that need editing. Even the extraordinary section of the movie showing the horror of the destruction of the village.....and it is an extraordinary war horror section.....has a scene where a Nazi officer, about to die a violent death, delivers pure pedantic-inspired dicta. Propaganda, not reality and the scene stops cold in its tracks while this character speaks. The reverse-images montage near the end is something the illiterate and unschooled Florya couldn't possibly have been exposed to. Why hang this lecture on the kid? Yes, a powerful film but heavily uneven.",5,4,24,2 August 2010
Match Point," Drive Over A Cliff!
","1) As the film progressed it became hard to believe that the main male character, Chris Wilton,as portrayed by J.R. Meyers, was so complex and driven that he would murder two people to sustain his life. I think the script was OK on this but the casting wasn't. 2) The planning/execution of the murders as filmed was a class b movie. The suspense! Will he get caught in the planning or the act!? 2a) During the murders, committed with a shotgun (loud noise folks!), no movie neighbor could hear the gunshot. Why? Because the soundtrack was playing operatic music quite loudly. BUT FOLKS, THIS WAS THE SOUNDTRACK, NOT REAL AMBIENT SOUND. A Monty Python influence perhaps? 3) Without explanation the killer carries incriminating evidence with him from the city to the country He couldn't go to the Thames at night and dump the stuff? 4) With poetic license heavily imposed, the killer finds the ring of a victim he's killed and doesn't do a good job throwing it into the river. It bounces on the river's railing (tennis anyone?) and ends up on the walkway. WHERE A TO-BE MURDERED JUNKY FROM THE EARLIER SCENE OF THE TWO MURDERS MIRACULOUSLY FINDS IT. My goodness, what a coincidence! Miscellaneous: a)Other critiques have mentioned the initial Chris and Nola sex scene and I would underline their criticism: in broad daylight, during that rainstorm, would even that kind of passion permit the two of them to Let's Do It In The Road? Without a fear of being seen? I don't think so. b)Tired, tired, tired was the Son-in-law Also Rises clich√©. What the hell did he do at father-in-law's firm? c)The two cops at the end were almost cartoon-like in being added to flesh out the 'irony' of the story. Reminded me of Bugs Bunny cartoons where Bugs reaches into a pouch and pulls out a deus ex machina-like invention.But other than the above I loved the movie.",3,25,36,14 July 2006
Capote," *Based On A True Story But With Some Unfortunate Major Changes
","Yes it is a great performance by Hoffman and it shows the hustling Capote with his many personality and character flaws. *My main major complaint is that some huge reality issues of the true story were changed to accommodate a Hollywood story. You know, the usual BS that even talented writers engage in on this level of film-making. Two examples:1) To make the Capote/Smith bonding even more, errrrh, maternal, they show Capote giving Smith a reason to live as he feeds him baby food (get it folks!) when Smith is in an advanced stage of starving himself to death. The reality was that Smith's long lost father (who had a loaded rifle pointed at the junior Smith the last time they saw each other in Alaska) somehow heard of his son's plight and wrote a letter to him on death row. Ten years later, that is. This created an emotional response from his son that brought him back to life;his father cared for himand he credits this with making him want to continue the fight against the state's decision to kill him. It wasn't Capote's loving care. 2) At the end, as the execution grew closer, Smith pleaded with the only friend he had left in life (was Hickok a friend?), Capote, to witness the execution. He would find this something of a consolation. Capote said he would and arrived in Kansas but couldn't face the actual hanging. So the sociopathic Smith, before the hood was placed over his head, scanned the faces, hoping for a final human contact. What an ending folks! In closing, why can't writers/filmmakers stay with the facts, the truth, when they're dealing with people's stories? In 'Capote' they changed things to structure the story and make it (from their point of view exclusively) more 'dramatically balanced'. Make Capote more caring. Well, people's lives, in extremis, are often not neat;including scenes like this in a story is what can make for greatness in a movie.",6,1,2,27 May 2006
American Hustle," What's up, Doc?
","As the movie became more and more improbable (Gosh, how could that be? It's based on a 'true story' isn't it?) Bugs Bunny surfaced in my mind. Remember how he would reach into his body and come up with a deus ex machina to advance the story? That's what Singer and Russell did causing the movie to become torturously manic. The mayor of Camden was actually a good guy who committed felonies because of his love of the citizens? The screenwriters certainly didn't know Camden's history.",5,0,1,14 March 2019
Bad Teacher," A poorly written farce
","I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Cameron Diaz's makeup was so overdone; pancake, pancake and more pancake. (I thought possibly that they were trying to make her look younger since she seems to be too old for the part, by covering over facial lines.) More important for my low rating is that 'Bad Teacher' is a poorly written farce and at times, is excruciating to watch when it subjects some of the supporting characters to humiliation to get a laugh. More lines now to meet the ridiculous 10 line minimum: There is a scene in the gym where the plain looking, highly overweight teacher 'friend' of Elizabeth (Diaz) shows up. She's coaxed and bullied into taking her first toke of pot and then, nothing is made of it and the scene ends!",3,4,9,22 May 2013
The Illusionist," Silent Movie look alike
","Yes, the movement (see Editing)reminded me of a silent film (it may be that I've been educated visually by the extraordinary evolvement of movie editing over the years and have become unconsciously intolerant of this kind of editing).There are 344 reviews of this movie and while I have but read a sampling; some raves and some pans, I must say that the negative reviews are some of the best I've read at IMDb (usually people, both pro and con, deal exclusively with emotional reactions to a movie; nothing wrong with that by the way.) So with the above in mind I will not repeat the major objections most people had but will report a few odds-and-ends that I didn't see commented on. Again, I thought the negative reviews were spot on.1) Style of editing, mentioned above, was so slow that I remarked to my wife that whole feature films could have safely passed through the straits between scenes.2) A weakness or too sometimes shown by inexperienced feature film directors: The costumes, vehicles, interior furnishings were squeaky clean. As a retired film technician I've seen this happen plenty of times first hand. Filmmakers, prop people, set people get overly concerned with the things they rent and are timid about, well, dirtying them for instance. Was Vienna of the late 19th Century that clean? I don't think so. Did every passerby as well as more featured characters always have supremely clean and pressed clothes/uniforms; I think not.3) The cinematography was way too beautiful. It's a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses girl, etc. story and one didn't need to bashed over the head with the visual lushness. Restraint, restraint, restraint.4) Penn and Teller and David Copperfield, to mention just two contemporary magicians, are able to visually do amazing things that are perfect illusions. I couldn't buy into some of the illusions Eisenheim performed on stage. Yes, suspension of disbelief as far as one is able to do it counts for something but I couldn't cede this because of the sophistication of some of the illusions placed in the contest of where stage magic was at the time.Another final extension of 4): I find that many horror films and films like 'The Illusionist' are faith-based. To me, they are essentially asking for the viewer to become believers. If a religious movie is directly showing miracles, for instance, then you sub-consciously accept or not-accept it based on your own belief system, either religious or secular. 'The Illusionist's' illusions tap into the supernaturalism of religious belief and even the hideous *'explain all' ending confuses one when taking this tack. Inspector Uhl remembers the things that fooled him but doesn't think about something like how butterflies could be conjured that actually carry three a three dimensional object into the audience. *Hitchcock's brilliant 'Psycho' also has an ending that almost screws up an otherwise perfect film; a psychiatrist 'explains' why Norman Bates did what he did.",3,4,9,4 February 2007
Win Win," Phony from the beginning till the end
","1. Why wasn't Mike disbarred, something he deserved? 2. Cindy's face didn't have a trace of the ravages of her addiction. 3. I wanted the constantly irritating Terry and Stemler shot. 4. No reason shown for the middle aged Mike's lack of success. He must have been a terrible lawyer. 5. Kyle, shown to have a strong character succumbs, unbelievably, to Mike's 'honest emotional pitches' near the end of the movie. This was out of character for him but the hack writer's abrupt change in Kyle had to be done to achieve the 'happy' ending. 6. Alex Shaffer and Burt Young were brilliant. 7. Mike was a master manipulator who believed his own b.s. 7. Film ends with Mike agreeing to send $1500 a month to Cindy. We're to believe then that his part time job as a bartender will not only compensate for the 1500 'loss' of income but also supply the minus amount of money that caused him to feloniously cheat Leo in the first place? 8. We're to 'suspend our disbelief' about how competitive high school athletics are in this country? There's no way a ringer like Kyle would be allowed to compete for high school tournaments. The other teams coaches would make sure that didn't happen. 9. Did I say that Paul Giamatti's sincerity seemed like the pretending a sociopath engages in? 10. I give it a 3 because it was decently produced.",3,1,4,24 April 2013
In the Land of Blood and Honey," The Truth Sometimes Hurts A lot
","In the 11 years of IMDb membership I've never seen reviews that so reflect how a movie's story thoroughly got under some people's skins by so disturbing their consciences. '.....Land of Blood and Honey' certainly did that.The Bosnian War ended in 1995 and the ubiquitous atrocity stories, 90% of which were authenticated as being committed by the Serbian Orthodox faction, continue to be revealed to the world. In 2011, with 15 years of thought and research behind her, Angelina Jolie made, 'IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY', her movie directorial debut and what a magnificent one it is.This movie is not for the squeamish and virtually every part of it contains the blackest nihilism and is shadowed by that adjective's meaning. But it's a great film, a masterpiece really and should be seen.The story covers a few years of time starting in the nineties, beginning with the invasion of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbians, greatly aided by the well armed Serbian army.'Ethnic cleansing' something the Nazi's were committed to in many areas of Europe during WWII, included the Serbian people, something the collective Serbian memory forgot about since they practiced this barbarism as a war policy against the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. (The mass *rape of Muslim women was also initiated as political policy.) The movie touches on these horrors and much more and does so within a fictional framework that seems to be documentary; the highest compliment a movie can achieve. *One estimate is that 20000 to 50000 women were brutalized.",8,6,17,23 March 2014
