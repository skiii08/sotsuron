The Rock," Good solid action on Alcatraz
","General Francis X. Hummel has had enough of the way US service personnel have been treated; especially how the families of those who died on top secret missions are told a string of lies and not compensated for their loss to this end he decides to blackmailing the government by stealing a quantity of deadly VX gas; taking over the island of Alcatraz and threatening to launch the gas into the city of San Francisco if is demands to compensate the families aren't met within forty hours. Of course he can't do this alone; he is supported by a squad of ex-marines who expect to be paid handsomely.The government have no intention of paying him so assemble a team to go to Alcatraz and neutralise the VX rockets that are to deploy the gas. The team will consist of a squad of Navy Seals; Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI specialist in chemical weapons and finally John Patrick Mason, the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz who will be needed to guide the team in. Mason could be a problem; he is a former captain in the SAS who has spent the last thirty years in jail but has never been formally charged with any crime and is considered extremely dangerous. Once inside Alcatraz the Seals are quickly eliminated leaving Goodspeed and Mason to deal with Hummel and his men and neutralise the weapons.This film is packed with action; there are shootouts, a car chase, explosions and the threat of a deadly attack on a major city the action moves at such a pace it is easy to overlook many of the more unlikely moments the scenes in what looked like ancient mine carts under the old jail seemed too far-fetched but once that was over it was soon forgotten; at least while watching the film. The story may include numerous clichés but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun. Nicolas Cage does a solid job as Goodspeed and Sean Connery is in top form as Mason; he may be old but he makes us believe that is character is tougher than the young marines he is up against. Ed Harris does a fine job as General Hummel; a character who isn't just a pantomime villain. This is probably director Michael Bay's best film; he keeps the action moving at a cracking pace without losing the story in the process; don't be put off if you dislike his 'Transformers' franchise. Overall I found this to be a lot of fun; it won't be for everybody but if you want a solid action film it is definitely worth watching.",8,2,2,9 January 2017
The Double Life of Véronique," The Double Life of Veronique
","This film tells the story of two young women; Weronika and Véronique. Weronika is Polish and Véronique is French; their names aren't the only thing they have in common; both are musical and have had similar experiences in life... and they look identical.In the early part of the film we follow Weronika as she visits her aunt in Kraków. Here she auditions for a part in a concert. Later as she walks across a town square during a demonstration she sees a French tourist who looks just like her. Shortly afterwards the action moves to Paris and that French tourist, Véronique, takes centre stage.There is something strangely hypnotic about this film; at times it has a dreamlike feel even though there is no suggestion that anything we see isn't happening to the characters. Similarly there is a haunting relationship between Weronika and Véronique even though they never really meet; there is just the brief moment when one sees the other in the town square. While each of their lives clearly effects the other somehow the film is about more than that as we as we see their loves and lives; joys and sorrows. Iréne Jacob, who is rarely off screen, is mesmerising in the dual roles of Weronika and Véronique. Director Krzysztof Kieslowski does a great job bringing the story to life and creating the amazing atmosphere. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something rather different.These comments are based on watching the film in Polish and French with English subtitles.",9,0,1,23 January 2019
The Blair Witch Project," If you go down to the woods tonight...
","I'd heard rather a lot of hype about this film before seeing it, I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, on the one hand few films live up to their hype on the other without that hype I probably wouldn't have seen it at all. While I don't think it is the 'scariest movie ever made' it is certainly very creepy and makes the viewer feel that they are lost in the woods with the protagonists.At the start of the film we are told that three students, Heather, Josh and Mike, disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville (formerly called Blair) in Maryland while investigating the local legend and that a year later their equipment had been found and what we are then shown is the film recorded by them before their disappearance. Once the three of them have joined up and got their equipment together they head to Burkittsville where they interview some of the locals about the legends before heading off in to the woods to film the sites where the events in the legend are alleged to have taken place. All goes fairly well until the trio try to return to their car, while camping over night they here strange noises outside their tent and the next day despite following the map they don't manage to find their car. The same happens the next day and the next etc. as the days progress they get more and more distressed, especially as whatever is outside the tent each night is leaving strange items in the trees and messing with their equipment.I have tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum as the less you know about what happens in the woods the more disturbing the film is likely to be. If you are put off horror films by gore then this is a safe film to watch as there is almost no gore, the scares all come from being lost while some one or something is messing with your head. The way that it is filmed also adds to the atmosphere, quite often the camera is pointing and something away from the action or in the night scenes there is no image at all, just sound. The acting was very natural probably because most of it was unscripted.",8,2,5,8 January 2009
Despicable Me 2," An impressive sequel that is as funny as the first
","As this sequel opens an unknown villain steals a polar research station for reasons that become clear later. Meanwhile Gru, who has left the supervillain business and is now attempting to make an honest living making jam, is kidnapped by Lucy, an agent of the Anti-Villain League (AVL). It turns out that the AVL believe the best way to catch a supervillain is to use a former supervillain. It is explained to Gru that the research station had been working on a mutating virus that turns harmless creatures into ferocious killing machines. The virus has been traced to a shopping mall so Gru and Lucy are to open a shop there to undercover who is behind the crime. He suspects Eduardo, the owner of the Mexican restaurant who looks remarkably like El Macho, a villain who had apparently died some years ago he suspects him even more when his son starts to show an interest in Gru's oldest daughter. AVL believes somebody else is involved though. Eventually the identity of the villain is revealed and many of the minions are captured and mutated into purple creatures! If all this wasn't enough one of Gru's neighbours is trying to set him up with a date but over the course of the film he develops feelings for Lucy.After the success of the first 'Despicable Me' film a sequel was inevitable; thankfully this one was a lot of fun too. The story was entertaining with some decent twists however it is the funny moments that make the film such a joy. The minions are as funny as ever; they may be childish but that is what is so funny about them. Sadly the three girls Gru adopted in the previous film have a smaller role this time; mostly involving the subplot about finding a girlfriend for Gru and the eldest's involvement with Eduardo's son. The romance between Gru and Lucy won't surprise anybody but it provides some good laughs especially when she helps Gru get rid of an unwanted date. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first film; I hope the third film proves to be as good.",8,0,0,16 June 2017
Insidious: Chapter 2," Decent enough supernatural sequel
","This review assumes people have already seen the original film; if you haven't seen it yet I'd definitely recommend watching it before watching this or it won't make much sense.This film follows on shortly after the events of the first film. Josh and Renai Lambert have moved into Josh's mother's home, along with their children, and the police suspect Josh may be involved in the killing of psychic Elise Rainier. They had hoped that the strange events would have stopped but it soon becomes clear that whatever was haunting them has followed the family. Renai contacts Elise's associates, Tucker and Specs, and they start to investigate with the help of Carl, an old colleague of Elise. This leads to a series of creepy locations and the eventual identification of the being haunting the Lambert family.Horror is a fairly personal genre; a film that will terrify one person may leave another wondering what all the fuss was about. I didn't find it all that scary but it did have its moments. It is refreshing to have modern horror that isn't particularly gory, has no particularly offensive language and no gratuitous sex/nudity... instead it achieves its goals through decent jump scares and a nice creepy atmosphere. The soundtrack impressively adds to this atmosphere. I didn't find it as good as the first film but found it enjoyable enough. The story has some interesting ideas and others that seemed to be inspired by better films... most obviously 'Psycho'. The cast does a solid enough job with the material. Overall a decent enough film if you enjoyed the first.",7,0,0,20 November 2019
Moneyball," Winning for less
","Having lost in the playoffs Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland A's baseball team has to set about replacing his three top players who have been poached by wealthier clubs. Working for the poorest team in the league he can't afford good players but when he goes to buy a player from another team he is surprised when the sale falls through following a word from a young unknown member of the office staff this is Peter Brand; he hasn't spent years in the game in fact his back ground is economics not sport; there is something about him though and Beane ends up hiring him instead of a player! Together they set about building a new team of cheap overlooked players. At first this doesn't go down well they hire what appears to be a bunch of has-beens and never-will-bes and not surprisingly they start to lose a lot. Part way through the season they trade some of their best players and something surprising to the world of baseball happens; they start to win. They don't just win the odd game here and there; they start to build a winning streak that rivals those of the greatest teams and might even take the record.Not knowing much about baseball I wasn't that sure I'd enjoy this film but I did; in fact the lack of knowledge may have increased my enjoyment as I genuinely had no idea how it would end which kept things exciting. Brad Pitt did a fine job as Beane and was ably supported by Jonah Hill as Brand and the always excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays the doubting field manager. The story is told in a way that can be enjoyed by fans and non-fans of the game. Most of the action takes place in the offices away from the field of play but that doesn't mean we don't see any of the games. One of the things that surprised be most was the fact that there were quite a few laugh out loud moments more than many so-called comedies in fact! I'd certainly recommend watching this whether you are a fan of the sport or not; it was two hours well spent.",8,1,2,8 November 2012
Whip It," Fine first film from director Drew Barrymore
",Having enjoyed Ellen Page's performances in 'Hard Candy' and 'Juno' as well as liking Drew Barrymore I was keen to see this film even though I don't think I'm part of the target demographic. I was not disappointed; Ellen Page was great as Texas school girl Bliss who is being groomed by her mother to become a beauty queen but discovers her true ambition when she tries out for the 'Hurl Scouts'; a team in the roller derby league in Austin. The team has a reputation for always losing but the girls are clearly having a lot of fun even if their coach wishes they'd try a bit harder. Knowing her mother would not approve of her joining a roller derby team she tells her that she is taking extra classes before sneaking off to Austin on the pensioners' bingo-bus! Once there Bliss becomes 'Babe Ruthless' and with her natural talent the team start to win matches and are heading for the finals; there a few problems though; the final is in the same night as an important beauty pageant and her rival in another team has learnt that Bliss is only seventeen so shouldn't be competing without her parents permission.This film might not be the best known film of 2009 it is a lot of fun; as mentioned before Ellen Page is great as Bliss and Drew Barrymore did a fine job in her directorial debut as well as playing fellow Hurl Scout 'Smashley Simpson' and Juliette Lewis was impressive as Bliss's rival 'Iron Maven'. The idea of having a losing team get better to reach the finals might not be the most original sporting dramas there was still plenty of excitement watching the matches and when the characters took a blow it did look as if it genuinely hurt. While this film can be enjoyed by anybody I suspect it is targeted mainly at teenage girls who can take away the message that they can compete in sports and they don't need to be dating somebody even if they aren't suitable to enjoy themselves.,8,1,5,7 January 2011
The Avengers," Avengers Assemble
","When a revolutionary power source, known as the Tesseract, is brought into operation something goes wrong; it is meant to bring unlimited energy from outer space but instead it is used by the evil Loki to teleport himself to Earth. Using his powers he steals the Tesseract and takes control of scientist Dr Erik Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton. He intends to give the Tesseract to The Other in exchange for an army to conquer Earth. First he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army. Meanwhile SHIELD director Nick Fury assembles the world's superheroes to battle Loki. They aren't natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves. Loki is captured with surprising easeÂ… almost as if being captured was part of his plan.If you are a fan of the superhero genre then I'm sure this will be a must see; if like me you aren't exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching. The fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun. Having only seen the 'Iron Man' films and the old '70s Hulk TV series I wasn't familiar with most of them but that didn't really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isn't really important. There is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great; I particularly liked the Helicarrier, a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the 'Cloud Base' in 'Captain Scarlet' only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water. Even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect. The cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children.",8,0,2,12 September 2017
Blade Runner 2049," A visually stunning return to the world of Blade Runners and replicants
","Thirty years after the events portrayed in the original film Blade Runners are still hunting down rogue replicants; this time Nexus 8 models who have no expiry date. Newer models are considered safer as they must obey orders. One such newer model is 'K', a blade runner whose existence is thrown into turmoil after bones are found at the home of a Nexus 8 he 'retired'. They show evidence of something thought impossible; something that if made public could undermine the peace between humanity and replicants. He is tasked with ensuring that the most important evidence of what happened is destroyed... in the process he learns more about himself and eventually meets Deckard. He isn't the only person searching; the Wallace Corporation, successors to Tyrell are searching too.I've kept my plot synopsis as vague as possible to avoid any potential spoilers even though some of the main revelations come early in the film. The story is enjoyable; I liked how it added to the original without being more of the same. For the most part the characters are new and interesting as are the advances in technology. Ryan Gosling impressed as K; it was interesting to have a lead character who was undeniable a replicant but still had a degree of mystery about him. It was great seeing Harrison Ford return as Deckard even if the character isn't in the film for as long as one might expect; there was also a fun cameo from Edward James Olmos as Gaff. Of the other characters the three most interesting were all women; Ana de Armas, who delighted as K's holographic girlfriend Joi; Sylvia Hoeks; who was impressive as Luv, an enforcer for the Wallace Corporation and Robin Wright who is solid as K's superior Lt. Joshi. As well as being interesting the film is visually stunning with fantastic special effects and a very impressive design. The film isn't perfect of course; some scenes go on a bit too long meaning the film is quite a bit longer than it really needs to be... still I was really impressed overall and would definitely recommend it to fans of the original.",9,5,13,27 March 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The blood-spattered bride finally meets Bill
","After the almost non-stop action of volume one some people may be disappointed at the much slower pace of this film. The story opens with The Bride driving to her final Rendezvous with Bill and she announces that he is the last one left on her list. We then return to see what happened to Budd and Elle. Surprisingly this doesn't stop these confrontations from being intense... particularly the former where she finds herself facing almost certain death in a scene which is likely to disturb anybody who suffers from claustrophobia! At this point the story jumps back even further in time to the point where The Bride is in training with Pai Mei, an elderly kung-fu master; this explains how she can escape and ultimately what she will do when she meets Bill. While she was trapped Elle has killed Budd who had informed her that The Bride was dead; she learns that he was mistaken very shortly afterwards they clash Hattori Hanzo swords. Once Elle is out of the way it is time for The Bride to visit Bill and when she does she has a surprise; her daughter is still alive! Will this affect her plans or will she spare her daughter's father? I preferred Volume One but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this too; it was good to learn a bit more about The Bride's past and find out just what she had done to make Bill angry enough to shoot her in the head. The scenes between David Carradine and Uma Thurman were brilliant; this was largely down to Carradine's voice, some how he managed to sound totally calm yet still be menacing. After the spectacular conclusion to volume one the final confrontation here seemed less than spectacular although this did make sense; Bill wasn't going to hide behind henchmen and his words were more important than his actions. As one would expect from a Tarantino film the music, much of it inspired by spaghetti westerns, went well with the action and as with volume one the style of the filming changed to suit the scene. For the most part I found the story exciting but I could have done without the scene where The Bride meets Bill's father figure; it slowed the story down at precisely the moment it needed to speed up and get her together with Bill. Over all though I recommend this film to anybody who liked the first part; although I'm sure there aren't many people left who liked the first and still haven't got around to watching this!",8,2,4,16 January 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Katniss becomes the poster girl for the rebellion against President Snow
","After the events of 'Catching Fire' protagonist Katniss Everdeen wakes up in District 13; the underground rebel district that leads the fight against President Snow and his forces. The rebels want Katniss to be the 'Mockingjay'; their poster girl to help unite the districts against the capital. She is unsure until she sees what the Capital is doing; her home district has been destroyed and a hospital she visits is bombed just because she went there. She has some conditions though; she wants Peeta to be rescued from the Capital and pardoned for the broadcasts he has made condemning the rebellion.This instalment is quite different to the previous two; there are no games and more significantly the story has been divided into two this does mean the story doesn't have a natural ending in this film. That doesn't really matter as the story we get has plenty of exciting moments the best being when Katniss brings down an attacking plane with an exploding arrow a little far-fetched perhaps but certainly spectacular. The film nicely shows us how Snow's hatred of Katniss and what she represents is getting increasingly personal. The cast does an impressive job; Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss, she even demonstrates that she has a decent singing voice when she sings the haunting song 'The Hanging Tree', and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman impressed as Plutarch Heavensbee, it is tragic that this was one of his last films. Overall I really enjoyed this and look forward to seeing how the Hunger Games story finishes in 'Mockingjay Part 2'.",9,1,4,28 April 2016
Vertigo," Another masterpiece from Hitchcock
","As the film opens we see a rooftop chase taking place high above the streets of San Francisco; a policeman slips and is left hanging from a gutter; another policeman goes to help him but he slips and falls to his death. The man hanging from the gutter is John 'Scottie' Ferguson and after the events that day he is plagued by acrophobia which causes an intense sense of vertigo whenever he looks down from a height. With this condition he doesn't feel able to continue working in the police but is soon being asked to work in a private capacity for an old college friend. He believes his wife, Madeleine, is being possessed by one of her ancestors who committed suicide at her age; he asks John to follow her and it soon becomes apparent that something strange is going on. She visits a gave then goes to an art gallery where she looks at a portrait of the woman whose grave she visited; she then continues to a hotel where she is registered under that woman's name! The plot continues to thicken when he sees her jump into the bay; he rescues her but when she comes to she has no recollection of the events. She gets to know him and talks of a strange dream; he believes she is dreaming of a real place she once visited and from her description he knows just where it is. They head there hoping to break the dream but the trip ends in tragedy when she apparently jumps from the church tower as he is powerless to help her because of his acrophobia. This disturbs him and he has a breakdown; until one day he finds a woman that looks very similar to Madeleine.This Alfred Hitchcock film is a real classic featuring a great performance from the always reliable James Stewart as Ferguson and solid support from Kim Novak as Madeleine and Barbara Bel Geddes as his friend Midge. The story had me gripped from start to finish as I tried to figure out just what was going on with Madeleine. After the incident in the tower it was just as interesting to watch Ferguson's obsession grow as he tries to get the look-alike to change her appearance so she'd look even more like Madeleine. Hitchcock made the most of the San Francisco location without it feeling like he was using the shot just to show off the famous landmarks that appeared; he also used some interesting techniques to emphasise Ferguson's sense of vertigo and his growing obsession. If you are a fan of film this one really is a must see; it is a gripping story told in an original way.",10,2,6,2 August 2012
Black Swan," A disturbing paranoid thriller
","Nina is one of the best ballerinas in the company so it is understandable that she hopes to be selected to dance the part of the Swan Queen in an upcoming performance of Swan Lake. Director Thomas Leroy has told her that she is perfect for the role of the innocent White Swan; the problem is it is a duel role that also involves playing the seductive Black Swan and he believes she just can't let herself go in the way that part demands. She is further stressed because rival dancer Lily seems perfect for the Black Swan. As the pressure builds Nina starts to lose her grip on reality in a way that could ultimately lead to her self-destruction.If you sit down to watch this expecting a delightful film about the world of ballet you are in for the shock of a life time there may be plenty of dancing but this is very much a paranoid thriller about somebody losing their grip on reality in a way that is sometimes highly sexual and at others quite gruesome certainly it is one of the more disturbing films that I've seen. We see the world as Nina sees it so like her we frequently see things that aren't really happening and it isn't until later that we learn whether what we saw was real. This sense of paranoia is further enhanced by the way the camera almost constantly follows Nina around. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Nina; I'm not surprised that she won an Academy Award for her performance here. Mila Kunis also puts in an excellent performance as Lily and Vincent Cassel is good as the somewhat domineering director. The film's director, Darren Aronofsky does a great job keeping the sense of paranoia high until it peaks during the finale.",9,2,5,30 December 2012
Men in Black 3," Agent J must go back in time to save Agent K (and the Earth)
","This, the final 'Men in Black' film, opens with a jail break; it involves no ordinary prisoner and no ordinary prison Boris the Animal, a Boglodite, has been incarcerated in a Super-Max prison on the moon for forty years and he now wants his revenge on the man who put him there Agent K. Once back on Earth he unsuccessfully attacks K. Agent J asks him about Boris but he doesn't want to talk about it and all the files are highly classified. He does eventually learn that K stopped Boris at Cape Canaveral and the day of the Apollo XI launch and saved the planet by deploying a device known as the 'ArcNet'.Boris hasn't given up his plan for revenge and travels back in time the next day Agent J is the only person for remembers K. History has been changed; this time Boris killed K and ArcNet wasn't deployed. Now the Boglodites are about to destroy Earth. Agent Jay must travel back in time to save his former partner and help stop Boris. It won't be easy though; nobody in 1969 knows Agent J and the world then was rather different to that in 2012.This film is a solid conclusion to the Men in Black trilogy. It opens well with an exciting jailbreak; this introduces Boris well as it shows us how dangerous he is. The time travel plot is fun; I particularly liked how most of the aliens in 1969 looked like men in costumes rather than the CGI aliens of 2012 just like typical sci-fi of the time! There were plenty of good gags; perhaps the best being when they meet Andy Warhol I was expecting the obvious gag about him really being an alien but this was brilliantly dodged by having him be an undercover Man in Black. The final confrontation between Agents J and K and the two Borises (the one from 2012 and the original 1969 one) was exciting and having it take place at the Apollo XI launch was rather fun. The ending was a bit twee but not enough to spoil the story in fact I'm sure many viewers will really like it. Will Smith does a fine job as Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones is fun as the taciturn 2012 Agent K. Josh Brolin is a welcome addition as 1969 Agent K and Jemaine Clement makes a good bad guy as Boris. Sadly 'Frank the Pug' doesn't even get a mention in this film which is a pity as he was one of the funniest characters in the previous film. Overall this was a fun conclusion to the trilogy.",7,0,2,24 November 2016
Scarface," Nothing exceeds like excess
","Tony Montana came to America from Cuba in 1980 and from the moment he arrived he intended to make it big. After a month in a refugee camp he murders a man in exchange for help getting his green card. Once out he is soon working for a local drug dealer; he is unwilling to stay at the bottom of the business and is willing to risk everything to progress. He is keen to make deals, sometimes without clearing it with his boss first. He is also obsessed with his boss's girlfriend and excessively protective of his younger sister. After a few close encounters with death he soon appears to have everything he wants; the beautiful wife, the huge mansion and even a tiger chained in the garden however he forgets some of the main rules of the business; firstly 'don't get high on your own supply' and secondly don't become a liability to those higher up the food chain.This is a classic '80s gangster film; violent and excessive. Al Pacino is delightfully over the top as Tony Montana; as a character it is impossible to like him which makes it easier to enjoy his inevitable downfall. Like most of the characters he has little depth; he is just a greedy punk who thinks the world owes him a living and will do just about anything to attain it. The look of the film is also excessive with some horrendous '80s fashion; massive collars and unbuttoned shirts for the men and huge hair for Tony's sister it all looks delightfully tasteless; just like Tony and his associates who believe money must be flaunted. There is a lot of violence throughout the film; the most shocking moment being an early scene that featuring a chainsaw if you can get past that the rest of the film should be okay! There is also a lot of drug use; although this is hardly glamorised as we see the effect it has on Tony and his wife. Overall I'd recommend this if you want a dose of '80s excess; just don't expect much character depth.",9,0,2,6 March 2017
Howl's Moving Castle," Another classic from Studio Ghibli
","Once again Hayao Miyazaki has provided us with a beautifully animated film which can be enjoyed by people of most ages; very young children might find one or two scenes a little scary though.As with all of his films the animation is stunning and the characters are interesting. Once again the main character is a girl, in this case Sophie a young hat maker. One day when she is out she gets slightly harassed by two soldiers but is rescued from this predicament by the wizard Howl who it turns out is fleeing from strange blob-like creatures sent after him by the Witch of the Waste. They escape by flying away from them but soon after the witch visits Sophie in her shop and turns her into an old woman.After being cursed she heads out in to the wastes where she finds a scarecrow who brings the moving castle of the title to her. The castle is a wonderful creation that is hard to describe, it is a bit like a building that has been constructed by lumping several other buildings together and putting them on legs so it can walk about.Once inside sits by the fire to get warm and discovers it is no ordinary fire but a fire demon called Calcifer and that it is he who powers the castle after being trapped by Howl in exchange for his heart. Calcifer recognises that Sophie is cursed and offers to beak her spell if she can break his and thus free him.The castle has a strange door that opens into a variety of places including two cities that are in countries that are at war. In one city they think the wizard Jenkins lives behind the door and in the other they think it is the wizard Pendragon, of course both these are in fact aliases of Howl. Rather awkwardly for Howl both 'Jenkins' and 'Pendragon' are summoned by the kings of the respective countries to help with the war effort. Obviously there are plenty more things that happen but I don't want to spoiler the whole film.Howl isn't the standard cartoon hero, in fact he isn't that heroic at all, he is incredibly vain and he wants nothing to do with the war apart from to end it although he does fight against attacking planes.As one would expect from Hayao Miyazaki there are plenty of exciting flying scenes involving aircraft that could only work in an animated film. I can't really comment on the English voices as I haven't seen the whole film in English, I did however watch a few scenes out of curiosity and they sounded pretty good.",9,2,4,9 June 2008
Walk the Line," The early life of music legend Johnny Cash
","This film tells the story of Johnny Cash from his poor childhood till he marries June Carter. It isn't an easy life; he loses his brother while still a child then gets married while unable to support a family. He dreams of becoming a singer but even when that dream comes true his life isn't easy. Constantly touring he is away from his wife and children for long stretches of time and finds himself falling in love with fellow singer June Carter. She is also married with children and constantly rebuffs his advances but that doesn't stop him loving her.Johnny Cash is the country singer people who don't like country music like so it isn't surprising that this film contains some great songs; performed not by Cash himself but by actor Joaquin Phoenix, who puts in a great performance as Cash. He is more than ably supported by Reese Witherspoon who puts in an Oscar-winning performance as June Carter. The two worked well together making their difficult relationship believable. While these two are the backbone of the film the rest of the cast is fine too; most notably Robert Patrick who plays his father and Ginnifer Goodwin who plays first-wife Vivian. Given Cash's drug taking and infidelity this isn't a happy 'rise to fame' story but it does entertain and we get a happy endingÂ… although of course it isn't the end of the story as Johnny Cash and June Carter had thirty five years together and that was all after the film ended. I don't know how much was changed for dramatic reasons but I feel that whether one is a fan of Cash or not one can enjoy this film.",8,1,1,20 May 2015
Alien 3," It's not Aliens but it is still good
","Just as Aliens was very different from Alien, Alien³ is very different from Aliens so if you go in to this film expecting hoards of aliens battling elite space marines you'll be disappointed, however if you crave tension rather than all out excitement this is the film for you.The film starts with Ripley the sole survivor once more when the Sulaco's escape pod is jettisoned after a fire. She finds herself on Fiorina 161, AKA Fury, a prison facility housing violent offenders who have found religion. Unfortunately for her they had also brought an unwanted passenger along in the form of an alien face hugger which attacks a dog in the theatrical release and an Ox in the Special edition of the film. As the alien has grown inside a quadruped it turns out to be quite different from the ones seen in the previous two films.Initially Ripley isn't believed when she tells the prison governor (Brian Glover) that there is an alien there even after three suspicious deaths, which are regarded as either accidents or murder. However when the alien strikes in public they realise that they have a serious problem and turn to Ripley for advice. The rest of the film follows their attempts to kill the alien before The Company arrives, I won't say more as I don't wish to spoil it.This film has a much darker tone than the previous outings, where Aliens ends with hope for the future, this starts by dashing that hope and doesn't get any more cheerful as it progresses. The acting is solid, provided mostly by actors who will be familiar with British viewers, it was just a pity Charles Dance and Brian Glover's characters didn't survive a bit longer.This review is based on the Special Edition (Assembly Cut) in the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set. Having seen both versions now I'd recommend watching this version if you have the choice as it is superior to the original theatrical release.",8,4,68,29 August 2008
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The Game is Afoot – Again
","A series of bombings across Europe are threatening to start a war between France and Germany; Sherlock Holmes is convinced that the man behind it is Professor James Moriarty. The authorities don't agree though; Moriarty is a respected academic and counts Prime Ministers amongst his friends. Holmes is of course right but proving it will be difficult and Moriarty is aware that he is being investigated. He decides to make things personal, first killing Holme's friend Irene Adler then targeting the newly married Watson and his wife Mary. Holmes manages to save the latter two but their plans for a honeymoon must be put on hold as Holmes and Watson head to France. Here they find themselves working alongside Gypsy fortune-teller Madam Simza Heron as they race to uncover exactly what Moriarty is up to; all leading to the famous meeting at the Reichenbach Falls.After and enjoyable opening film this sequel manages to keep the enjoyment going. The story is fun and there is plenty of action from start to finish. Much of this action is fairly stylised; notably in a sequence where people are fleeing through woodland while under artillery fire where trees shatter in ultra-slow motion; I found this highly effective although I can see how some viewers won't be so impressed. There is also a particularly exciting fight on a train. As well as good action there are also plenty of laughs throughout the film. Most of the jokes are fairly obvious but some are more subtle; I loved the musical joke of having the theme from the film 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' play as Holmes rode a donkey behind his horse riding companions. The cast do a solid job; Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law continue to impress as Holmes and Watson and newcomers Noomi Rapace and Stephen Fry are fun as Madam Heron and Holmes brother Mycroft. Jared Harris makes a fine Moriarty; threatening without tipping over to be a pantomime villain. Overall I'd say this was a fun film and heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the first film however if you didn't like this first film I suspect you'd be equally disappointed with this as it is similar in style.",8,0,1,2 June 2016
Gremlins," Anarchic, vicious, mean-spirited and hilarious Christmas fun!
","If you are fed up of saccharine sweet Christmas films then this is the perfect antidote! It all starts well enough when Billy's father buys him a cute little pet for Christmas. This isn't an ordinary pet however; it is a Mogwai and there are three rules for looking after them; keep them out of bright light, don't get them wet and above all don't feed them after midnight! The rules aren't explained but we learn them soon enough; light harms them, getting them wet causes them to multiply and feeding them after midnight causes them to turn into vicious gremlins! Billy names his Mogwai Gizmo and all goes well until it gets wet and makes five more; the new ones aren't gentle like Gizmo however; they have a mean streak and are devious; devious enough to trick Billy into feeding them after midnight which causes all hell to break out in the town of Kingston Falls. The gremlins are determined to wreak havoc and after one gets to the town pool there are thousands to contend with! Out in the town they entertain themselves attacking Father Christmas, turbo-charging a horrid old woman's stair-lift, going to a bar and finally going to the cinema to watch Snow White! This film is great anarchic fun; while the gremlins are clearly meant to be the 'bad guys' the viewer will cheer them on as they do one malevolent thing after another; all the while cackling manically. The Gremlins certainly upstage the human cast; Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are good enough as Billy and his girl friend Kate but they aren't what the film will be remembered for. There are a lot of laughs to lighten the tone but it will still be scary for younger viewers; especially in the final scene where Billy must confront the meanest of the gremlins who is wielding a chainsaw... not to mention an earlier scene when a gremlin gets microwaved! The special effects may look a bit dated now but I'd take them over the excessively slick CGI a film would get today; also worthy of note is the delightful score by Jerry Goldsmith; it really fits the anarchic nature of the film. I'd certainly recommend this film but don't show it to younger children unless you are sure they can handle it.",8,1,2,17 January 2012
Antz," Must a worker ant always be a worker?
","Z (Zee not Zed; he is American) is a worker ant who is fed up with his lot in life; he wants to be allowed to make some choices but that isn't the way life works in the ant colony. One day as he moans about things to his friend, a soldier ant Weaver, in a bar Princess Bala visits the incognito to see how the lower orders live. She ends up dancing with Z but his individual dancing style leads to trouble and she is rushed to safety; it is only then that Z learns who she was. Determined to see her again he swaps place with Weaver at a military review. He doesn't realise that the assembled soldiers are about to be sent on a certain death mission to attack a termite nest! Somehow he is the sole survivor. He returns to the colony a hero but he soon crosses paths the General Mandible, who has rather drastic plans for the colony. Z escapes with a somewhat unwilling Bala. Outside the colony they make their way to the fabled 'Insectopia'. On the way they face a variety of perils then just as things look good for them Bala is grabbed at taken back to Mandible. Z is determined to see her again and ultimately the two of them will have to save the colony from Mandible's evil plans.1998 saw two animated films about an ant that didn't do what was expected of him and became a hero; this and Disney/Pixar's 'A Bug's Life'; while I slightly preferred the latter this is still a lot of fun and will probably appeal to older children a bit more. There is a greater sense of threat and the villain is more unpleasant. Mandible is clearly meant to be a Nazi with his plans to 'cleanse' the colony of its weaker members the very workers who built it. The battle against the termites features death and surprisingly for a PG rated film reminded me of a toned down version of the battle scenes in 'Starship Troopers'! There are some funny moments but this is more about the drama than comedy. The cast is almost entirely made up of actors who one wouldn't usually associate with animated films; notable Woody Allen, as Z; Sharon Stone, as Bala; Sylvester Stallone, as Weaver, and Gene Hackman, as General Mandible; they, along with the rest of the cast, do a fine job. The animation is pretty good given that it is almost twenty years old now. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of animated films.",7,1,2,6 February 2017
Mission: Impossible III," An exciting third instalment
","This, the third instalment in the franchise, opens with protagonist Ethan Hunt being questioned by villain Owen Davian. He wants to know where an item called the 'Rabbit's Foot' is and if Ethen doesn't tell him by the time he counts to ten he will kill his wife! When he reaches ten we hear a shot then cut to the opening credits. When he film restarts it is some time before the opening and Ethan, now retired from front line duty and engaged, is called back to rescue an agent he trained who has been captured by Davian. This sets in motion a series of events that will take Ethan and his team to Berlin, the Vatican and finally to Shanghai where the opening confrontation is destined to take place.Once again the series gains a new director; J.J. Abrams, and anybody who watched his TV series 'Alias' will be used to the device of opening with a scene that comes from near the end of the story a device that works because it gets the viewer wondering how we will get there and more importantly how it will be resolved. From beginning to end there is plenty of exciting action including gunfights, leaping from buildings and the almost mandatory exploding helicopter! Rather than the highly choreographed action of the previous film this feels rougher and more painful. The plot isn't exactly complicated but that doesn't matter; it is all about the ride. Tom Cruise and the regular cast put in good performances and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman is suitably unpleasant as the sadistic Davian. Overall it may be very far-fetched and a little predictable but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun if you enjoyed the first two films you are sure to like this.",8,4,5,26 April 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," An unexpected gem of a film
","When I watched this film I knew almost nothing about it, I just had a vague idea that it was some sort of gangster movie, I think this lack of prior knowledge help me appreciate the film even more.The film opens rather intriguingly with Bruce Willis telling another man a story about how a man and his family were murdered twenty years before after he ended up owing a lot of money to the wrong people after the horse he bet on in a fixed race failed to win. Once he has finished the story he kills the man he told it to. The action then moves to Josh Hartnett who is playing the strangely named Slevin Kelevra. He isn't having a good time; he has lost his job, his house has been condemned, he has caught his girl friend with another man and when he goes to stay with his friend Nick Fisher he loses his wallet in a mugging. Nick isn't in when he gets there and before he has had chance to get dressed after a shower he is accosted by two thugs who think he is Nick, they take him to see The Boss (Morgan Freeman) who says he has three days to pay him back $96,000 or kill the son of his rival: The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley). No sooner is he back at Nick's flat than another two thugs arrive and drag him off to see The Rabbi who tells him he owes him $30,000.Even though I ticked the spoiler box I won't say more about what happens as the various twists and turns need to be watched to fully appreciate the film, knowing them in advance would take the edge off it. The actors all do a good job, although there are a lot of big name actors in the secondary roles they just get on with playing their parts rather than trying to upstage each other. As well as the actors I mentioned in the summary Lucy Liu stars as Nick's neighbour Lindsey who befriends Sleven.This film was much better than I'd expected, whether it will be as exciting on second viewing when I know the twists I'm not sure. I suspect it will hold up well though.",8,0,2,9 August 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Dreams turn to nightmares in this tale of four Coney Island residents troubled by addiction
","In the summer four residents of Coney Island dream of better times. Widow Sara Goldfarb spends her days watching self-help programmes on television; then one day she gets a phone call inviting her to be on a show... she is determined to go on wearing her favourite red dress. Unfortunately she is a little too large for it; dieting doesn't work so she turns to pills. Her son Harry and his friend Tyrone are regular drug users who have a plan to fund their habit and raise money for a better life by turning to dealing... all goes well till their supply is shut off. Harry's girlfriend Marion is also using and resorts to prostituting herself to get her fix.It must be stated that this film isn't easy viewing; in the opening scene we see Harry taking his mother's television to pay for a fix. Then, even as things are getting better for him, we see his mother drawn into a different but no less dangerous addiction... prescribed by a doctor. As summer turns to autumn things get much grimmer and one wonders just how bad things will get... and it gets worse. Director Darren Aronofsky's use of rapid cuts captures the manic urgency of the addicts' lives. The cast is impressive; in particular the four leads; Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb; Jared Leto as Harry; Jennifer Connelly as Marion and Marlon Wayans as Tyrone. They really make us believe in their characters as their lives descend into a nightmare. Overall I'd certainly recommend this but prepare to be disturbed.",9,1,1,7 February 2019
Your Name.," Your Name
","This delightful Japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives; Mitsuha, a high school girl living in a rural area of Japan, and Taki, a similarly aged boy in Tokyo. They have never met but they somehow start switching places in their dreams. At first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but the following day as the 'dream' fades they are surprised when friends and family tell them that they had been behaving oddly the day before; not recognising anybody and not knowing where they are meant to be then each finds a note from the other. They continue to swap days until suddenly it stops Taki can't recall many details but he has a memory of the place Mitsuha lived and is drawn to find her. Armed with a sketch of the location he finds the village and learns a shocking truth it had been destroyed in a natural disaster three years previously and Mitsuha was amongst the five hundred people who died! He is determined to find a way to swap places again so he can save her.Anybody who has seen previous films from director Makoto Shinkai will immediately recognise the beautiful style of the artwork, with incredibly detailed backgrounds. Of course a good film must do more than 'look good' and this succeeds there too; the first half is a fun introduction to the characters and their situation. This is done with plenty of humour; the fact that they find themselves in bodies of the opposite gender is quickly handled in an amusing but not a crude manner. There are lots of delightful details such as while swapped they talk in different dialects and Taki talks like a girl of course this is better appreciated if you speak Japanese but is explained so non-Japanese speakers (like me) can realise that it is happening. The events that take place half way through the film come as quite a surprise and suddenly change to tone of the film. As Taki tries to find a way to save Mitsuha and her village it is far from obvious that he will be successful. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of good animation; the content isn't really unsuitably for younger viewers but it would probably be a bit confusing.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles; an English dub is also available on the DVD I bought.",10,3,4,10 November 2017
Captain Phillips," A gripping real-life thriller
","In 2009 the cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama set off from Oman; its destination the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Its route taking it through waters where Somali pirates routinely operated. The ship's captain, the eponymous Capt. Richard Phillips orders his crew to undertake anti-piracy drills but before they can finish real pirates are spotted approaching rapidly from the rear. When the pirates suffer an engine failure it looks as if Phillips and his crew have got away but the next morning the pirates return and four of them board the Maersk Alabama with the intention of taking it back to Somalia for ransom. The captain and the bridge crew are captured but other crew members set about disabling the ship. The leader of the pirates Abduwali Muse begins a search of the ship and is ultimately captured by the crew. An arrangement is made to swap him for the captain but this isn't respected and the four pirates escape on the lifeboat, taking Capt. Phillips with them. It isn't long before the USS Bainbridge is on the scene and things get tense as they negotiate while Navy Seals prepare to take drastic action should the pirates not surrender.This film is based on a true story but even if you know the outcome it shouldn't effect ones enjoyment of what is a genuinely tension filled thriller. Director Paul Greengrass does a great job capturing the action; the fact that it was filmed at sea rather than using green screens only improves matters. The cast do a fine job; most notably Tom Hanks as Capt Phillips and new comer Barkhad Abdi who was brilliant as Muse. His character wasn't a cliché movie villain but nor was he overly sympathetic. Overall I'd say this film is well worth watching; even if you aren't a fan of 'real life stories' I doubt this would have been any more exciting if it had been entirely fictional and you didn't know the outcome.",9,0,1,26 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," And so it begins...
","Like many people who watched and loved the original films when I saw them at the cinema as a child and teenager I was excited when I learnt that the prequels were going to be made. Of course no film could live up to the expectation especially as I watched it as an adult not as an awestruck ten year old. This isn't to say the film was as bad as some reviews suggest, I still enjoyed it despite its faults.The story begins with two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi going to negotiate in an apparently minor trade dispute involving the blockade of the planet of Naboo. It becomes clear that something far more serious is afoot when instead of negotiating the Trade Federation attempt to kill the two Jedi. They however escape to the planet below by stowing away on the Federation's ships that are landing a droid army there. Here they meet a strange alien by the name of Jar-Jar Binks, as they save his life he is obliged to help them, he does this by first leading them to the underwater Gungan city then through the planet's water filled core to find the ruler of the local human population. The ruler in question is the young Queen Amidala whom they rescue along with her entourage. Unfortunately for them their ship is damaged so they can't fly to the capital but are instead forced to land on the desert planet Tatooine in order to find spare parts.Here they meet a young boy called Anakin Skywalker who is a slave belonging to an alien that has the required parts, unfortunately they don't have the funds required. They do however learn that Anakin has built a pod-racer and is quite a good pilot so have a wager on an upcoming race to earn the parts and Anakin's freedom. While on Tatoonine Queen Amidala's handmaiden Padmé befriends young Anakin and Qui-Gon begins to suspect that the boy is the person spoken of in their prophesies as the force is so strong in him.Once the race has been won they return to the capital but not before encountering a strange warrior called Darth Maul who nearly defeats the Jedi. Unfortunately once back in the capital they can't persuade the senate to take action to protect Naboo so return to fight the Federation along with the Gungan army. Here the two Jedi must confront Darth Maul once again and young Anakin ends up in the middle of a battle above the planet.The story isn't without flaws and quite a bit of the dialogue is a bit poor but it looks pretty good and it isn't the actors best work they are still good actors. The CGI is pretty good although in some scenes it is starting to show its age but if one doesn't look too closely that isn't a problem. It was a shame that we didn't get to see more of Darth Maul, all the advertising prior to the films release suggested he would be a more important character so I was expecting him to have a role similar to that of Darth Vader in the original film. The infamous Jar-Jar Binks, the comedy relief character is somewhat annoying for an adult viewer but I suspect children, who the film is primarily aimed at, will like him. I think it would have been better if George Lucas had got somebody else to write the screen play and direct as these don't seem to be his strong points, this could have been so much better.I wouldn't recommend this film to everybody but I'm sure it would appeal to young boys, I know my nephew couldn't get enough of it when it came out on video when he was three.",6,2,5,29 September 2008
Sucker Punch," Welcome to the asylum
","In the opening sequence we see a girl attempting to save her little sister from her abusive stepfather; unfortunately she is too late and he has already killed her; he then has her committed to a sinister asylum. The director, Blue, tells her she must be ready to please High Roller in a few days the asylum appears to double as a brothel with the female inmates expected to satisfy rich 'visitors'. As part of their therapy the girls must dance; when our protagonist, who has been dubbed Babydoll, starts to perform she finds herself transported to a fantasy world where she meets a man who tells her she will need five things to gain her freedom; a map, fire, a knife, a key and another item only she will know he also gives her a variety of weapons that she will need to defeat three twelve foot demonic samurai! Once they are dispatched she finds herself back in the asylum; apparently her dance was amazing. She then tells the girls of her plans to escape and together they work to get the items; each time the try to get one Babydoll distracts people with her dance; during which times she is transported to a different fantasy world where she and the other girls battle a variety of dangers and any failures have consequences in the real world assuming anything we see after her arrival at the asylum is real.I probably wouldn't have watched this if my favourite reviewer hadn't been very negative about it; I was curious to see why! Perhaps because of this it proved better than my expectations; the story is dark; much darker than I expected. The fantasy scenes feature some fairly obvious CGI and music video aesthetics but that just emphasised that what we are seeing is fantasy rather than the reality of the film. The action is stylishly, rather than realistically, choreographed and looks great. One of the main complaints about the film is the fact that the girls are sexualised, even though they don't do anything sexual; this isn't too unfair and I'm sure some, but not all, viewers will feel uncomfortable with it others will love the sight of Emily Browning dispatching foes with a katana while wearing in a skimpy sailor fuku! Those expecting a happy ending with everybody escaping will be in for quite a shock as there are casualties and then the film delivers its final Sucker Punch which will leave the viewer wondering what if anything we've seen is real. The cast do a fine job; in particular Emily Browning is good as protagonist Babydoll and Oscar Isaac is delightfully creepy as the sleazy Blue. Overall I enjoyed this far more than I expected and would recommend watching it, although despite its '12' Certificate I'm not sure it is suitable for younger viewers.",7,4,6,17 September 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A fine coming of age drama
","Charlie is just starting high school and things aren't going well and it looks as if he is going to have a lonely three years. Then he becomes friends with Patrick, a senior who is in one of Charlie's classes, and his step sister Sam. He is soon hanging out with them and joins their circle of friends he is also rapidly falling in love with Sam but has no idea how to tell her just how he feels and to make it even harder she is dating somebody else. Things are still going well though, until another friend invites him to a dance; she takes his acceptance to mean they are now a couple and he can't think of a nice way to say he doesn't feel the same way. Inevitably he eventually does it in the worst possible way and it looks as if he has lost his group of friends. While this is going on we learn that both Sam and Charlie have had troubled pasts and in Charlie's case it appears he isn't over those events.Growing up in the eighties I enjoyed high school films like 'The Breakfast Club' and found this to be in the same league; indeed it felt as though it could have been made in the late eighties or early nineties and not just because it is set then. The film skilfully captures Charlie's feeling of being alone; indeed the opening scenes are quite painful to watch. Logan Lerman does a fine job as Charlie; the bookish teenager who feels totally alone, Ezra Miller is entertaining as Patrick and Emma Watson is a delight as Sam. Writer/director Stephen Chbosky does a great job bringing his story to the screen although I occasionally wanted a bit more detail. Overall I'd say this is a very enjoyable coming of age film but be warned it does have a few dark moments before we get a happy ending.",9,0,2,28 January 2015
3:10 to Yuma," A solid western remake
","This western, a remake of a 1957 film, is centred on two men. One is honest rancher, Dan Evans, a man who is in financial trouble and fears losing his ranch and letting down his family. The second is Ben Wade, the leader of a band of gangsters, who is captured after a raid on a stagecoach carrying railway wages. Needing the money, Evans volunteers to be part of the group escorting Wade to the town of Contention where he is to be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma. It won't be an easy journey; they will pass through territory occupied by renegade Apaches and have to face members of Wade's well-armed gang who are determined to set him free.Having enjoyed the 1957 version of the film I was interested to see how this would compare... I think it compares well. The story might be relatively simple but that doesn't lessen the film. It provides several impressive action set pieces; from the stage coach robbery at the start to the gunfight in Contention as Wade's gang try to stop Evans getting him to the train. Despite the impressive action it often feels character driven as we learn more about Evans and Wade. Both are interesting although Wade is slightly more so as there is a degree of ambiguity about the character... he is an unapologetic villain but can be kind at times. The cast is impressive; particularly Russell Crowe and Cristian Bale who are on great form as Wade and Evans. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoys westerns.",9,2,2,9 July 2019
The Expendables 2," Non-stop meat-headed action just what was required!
","After a ten minute opening sequence where Barney Ross and team of action heroes rescue Trench and a Chinese billionaire from a large force in Nepal the real story starts. Barney and his team are forced to take on a job in Albania where they are to recover an item from a crashed plane; unfortunately no sooner have they recovered the item it is taken from them by a terrorist named Villain who murders one of Barney's team before leaving. It turns out the item was a map to a mine where five tons of ex-Soviet weapons grade plutonium are stored. Barney and his band of expendables along with Chinese expert Maggie Chan set off to find Villain and foil his plans to sell the plutonium.If you are looking for serious drama or even something vaguely believable you will be disappointed however if you want full on meat-headed action then this is the film for you. The action is over the top but it is fairly full on from start to finish. The cast is chock full of action stars with Stallone, Statham, Lundgren and Van Damme in major roles as well as appearances from Arnie, Bruce Willis, Jet Li and Chuck Norris in extended cameos. It is great seeing such a variety of action stars in one film and none of them disappoint as they wipe out swathes of bad guys and swap catchphrases. The less well known cast members aren't overwhelmed by their better known co-stars. The action is pretty bloody and I dread to think what the final death toll was; bad guys are dispatched in a wide variety of ways. As this is all so over the top it isn't particularly disturbing though. Overall this was a lot of fun; fans of classic action films should love it.",8,0,1,21 March 2016
Source Code," An exciting sci-fi thriller
","When Capt. Colter Stevens wakes up on a Chicago bound commuter train he doesn't feel himself that is because he isn't; he has woken up in the body of school teacher Sean Fentress! He is understandably bewildered and struggles to make sense of what is going on, then, eight minutes later, a bomb goes off killing everybody aboard the train. Colter wakes to find himself in a capsule; a woman on a computer screen informs him that he is on a mission to discover who set the bomb so they can prevent a second far more deadly attack in downtown Chicago. He is part of a project called 'Source Code' which enables him to jump into the last eight minutes of a suitable person's life; he is to keep going back until he can identify the bomber; he can use whatever means he deems necessary as everybody aboard the train is already dead he is also told he can not save them for this same reason. He doesn't think he is being the whole truth and becomes determined to find out just how he got there and prove that he can change what happened.This sci-fi thriller starts with a bang and manages to keep things tense right until the end; there is more than one mystery as not only is the bomber's identity unknown there is also the matter of how Capt. Stevens got into the programme when his last memory was of serving in Afghanistan and the question of whether or not he can save anybody. Director Douglas Jones does a good job keeping the action going without sacrificing a decent plot and star Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a solid performance as Capt. Stevens. There are some good surprises during the film; most importantly concerning how he came to be selected for the mission I won't spoil that here though. The film isn't without its faults though; the explosion looks like CGI rather than a real explosion which was a shame as we see it several times. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you enjoy thrillers with a sci-fi twist.",8,0,1,17 January 2013
Skyfall," Top quality Bond
","The extended pre-credit opening sequence sees Bond attempting to stop an unknown assailant escaping with a computer hard drive that contains details of undercover agents; the chase will take him over the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorbike and conclude with him wrestling with his target on the roof of a train while fellow agent Eve prepares to take a shot she just has to make sure she doesn't hit Bond. Surprisingly when the shot is taken it is Bond who falls, apparently dead, from the train! Shortly after the credits somebody tries to access the hard drive from inside MI-6; then an explosion rocks the building forcing the service to relocate to a secondary site in the tunnels under London. Once it becomes established that Bond is alive he returns and then sets about establishing who organised everything. His mission will take him first to Shanghai and then onto Macau before he eventually learns who he is up against; a former agent known as Silva; a man who feels betrayed by M and is determined to have his revenge.This is what a modern Bond film is meant to be; there is dramatic action from start to finish, a solid plot, a delightfully over the top villain, a succession of impressive locations and no cliché gadgets. Daniel Craig continues to impress as Bond; doing a fine job portraying an agent who is more burnt out that in any previous film in the series. Judi Dench gets to do more than sit behind a desk and brings some humanity to the role of a woman whose job means that she must sometimes sacrifice those who work for her. Javier Bardem is a great villain; not the usual megalomaniac but somebody just as dangerous in his own psychotic way. The rest of the cast also perform well and I wouldn't be surprised if a few of those we first see in this film become series regulars. It made an interesting change to have things go so spectacularly wrong for Bond to such a degree that in the end it is the bad guy who is coming to him rather than the other way round even if that is part of a plan. Overall I'd say that this is right up there with the best Bond films and fans of the series should really enjoy it.",10,3,12,21 March 2013
Catch Me If You Can," He wasn't a pilot, a doctor a lawyer but he posed as all three
","In the opening scenes we see protagonist Frank Abagnale Jr. as he appears as a guest on a television show; then we flash back several years and see him being extradited from France by FBI agent Carl Hanratty we then go even further back and start to see how an apparently ordinary teenager would become the most wanted fraudster in America. He leaves home when his parents' marriage fails then tries to cash cheques but nobody will except a cheque from an unknown teenager; then he hits upon an idea; he will become an airline pilot! Not a real pilot of course but with a uniform and a fake ID getting cheques cashed is easy; he also learns that it can get him free flights on other airlines. As he racks up the miles and cashes more and more cheques Agent Hanratty takes an interest in him and at one point almost catches him. It is time to hang up the uniform but Frank isn't going to stop his game; he spends time working as a doctor and then a lawyer before he is forced to run; eventually he is caught of course we'd seen that at the beginning. That isn't the end of Frank's story though .This is essentially a caper movie with Frank trying one scheme after another; if we weren't told it was based on fact many parts would be unbelievable if it weren't for the way Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank as a person with extreme confidence. We get an hilarious example of this early on when Frank arrives at a new school and passes himself off as a substitute teacher for two weeks! Equally good is Tom Hanks' portrayal of the dogged Agent Henratty. There are well known actors doing fine jobs in minor roles too; these include Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. The story contains plenty of laugh out loud moments and little to offend although some may consider it somewhat amoral as Frank is such a likable character it is easy to want him to get away with his crimes! Overall I'd say that this was well worth watching; it may be over two hours long but that time just flew by.",8,2,3,1 January 2013
The Hangover," A fairly funny film
","When I sat down to watch this I wasn't sure what to expect; of the main cast the only actor whose name I recognised was Bradley Cooper and that was because I'd seen him in the TV show 'Alias' which is hardly a comedy. The idea of a group of men going out for a stag night in Las Vegas led me to expect a fairly puerile story about what they got up to there; and while the actual film was fairly silly it was also pretty funny and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.Most of the story is told in flashback after one of the group telephones the bride to be to let her know that they have lost the groom; the rest of the film follows their adventures as they look for clues as to what happened on that fateful night. This adventure will include a tiger in their bathroom, a missing tooth, one of them marrying a stripper, stealing police car, finding a naked Chinese man in their car's boot and a meeting with Mike Tyson. If that sounds fairly madcap it is because it is rather! Several scenes caused me to chuckle and some were laugh out loud funny; the scene where they were children got to shoot the group with stun guns was hysterically funny!The acting was decent, Bradley Cooper shows that he can do comedy as well as drama, Zach Galifianakis was funny as the less than intelligent Alan and Ed Helms was good as the hen-pecked dentist Stu. While some of the jokes missed the mark it was funny enough to be worth watching so long as you don't mind the adult tone of some of the jokes and a fair amount of swearing.",7,3,4,29 December 2010
Ghost," A super supernatural romance
","I hadn't seen this film for many years but having watched it again I'm glad that I did as it was as entertaining as it was when I first saw it.The film opens with Sam and Molly moving into their new apartment, every thing seems to be going right for them; they are in love, he is a successful banker and they have a lovely home. Things go wrong in the worst way possible when he is killed by a mugger as they return from an evening at the theatre. From the title of the film you probably guessed that this isn't the end of him. As a ghost he follows Molly home and soon learns that his mugging wasn't as random as it first appeared when the mugger breaks in to his home and starts looking for something. Unfortunately for him, with the exception of being able to scare the cat, he can't interact with the world of the living, luckily however when he follows the mugger he encounters a medium who can hear what he says. She is rather alarmed at this as up until now she believed herself to be a fraud. He persuades her to contact Molly to warn her about the mugger's plans to return but not surprisingly Molly isn't impressed with her story.With Sam dead his best friend Carl starts seeing more and more of Molly, first to comfort her then later he tries to seduce her. Sam understandably loses his temper and in doing so knocks over a photograph, an ability he didn't know he had. Earlier on his travels he had met another ghost who could move objects so seeks him out to learn how to do it himself. I won't spoil the ending by saying exactly what happens but we do learn why he was killed and that not everybody is quite what they appear to be.This film seems to fit in several categories, it is a love story, a comedy, a thriller and obviously a ghost story, it combines these elements well. The effects are pretty good given the film's age, especially the shadows that come to life to drag the bad guys off when they die, these were genuinely creepy. The acting was good, there was a chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore... especially during the now famous pottery scene and Whoopi Goldberg was good as the medium although she walked a fine line between funny and embarrassing.",8,3,5,22 September 2008
Iron Man 3," A solid addition to the Iron Man franchise
","Opening with a flashback to 1999 we see a pre-Iron Man Tony Stark meeting scientist Maya Hansen; she is developing an experimental process that if it works will ultimately help people recover from serious injuries. A test involving a plant is shown to have the possibility of explosive failure. The two of them are approached by Aldrich Killian, another scientist, who wants Tony to work with his company; an offer he rejects.Cutting forward to the current day a terrorist known as 'The Mandarin' is targeting American interests around the world; the attacks have one strange thing in common; an explosion but no sign of a bomb. Tony is currently working on yet another Iron Man suit while still troubled by the 'events in New York'. He issues a threat to the Mandarin, including telling him where he lives. Soon afterwards Maya visits Tony at home but the building is destroyed by attack helicopters. She and Pepper Potts survive the attack while Tony is reported dead however he has managed to fly to Tennessee where he starts investigating an explosion that matches the pattern of the other attacks but wasn't connected. Here he is helped by a young boy and meets some people with a strange ability; they can raise their bodies to temperatures that can melt metal. Soon afterwards it becomes apparent that Killian is behind the Mandarin and inevitably he has further plans.This is a solid third instalment In the Iron Man franchise although it follows on from 'The Avengers' with references to 'events in New York' there is no recap of what happened so if, like me, you haven't seen that film you may be a bit confused you just have to accept that something bad happened and now Tony Stark has PTSD or something similar. I've not read the original comics so can't comment on how this handled the characters compared to the source material but I thought they were pretty solid; I particularly liked Ben Kingsley's portrayal of 'The Mandarin' and really enjoyed the twist regarding his character. Guy Pearce was good as Killian although the character was a bit cliché as soon as Tony Stark rejected his approach in the prologue it was obvious that he'd return as the bad guy. Rebecca Hall was also good as Maya, one of the film's most 'normal' characters. The returning cast Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle are as good as one would expect. The story was solid and provided plenty of excuses for some spectacular action which feature top-notch special effects. Inevitably there are some weaker moments and I could have done without Tony getting help from a kid but overall I'd say this is a fun superhero movie that fans of the franchise are likely to enjoy.",7,0,2,20 October 2016
The Ring," Decent remake of a great Japanese chiller
","I'd seen the Japanese original a few times but had not seen the American remake until it was on television a couple of days ago. I hadn't bothered watching it sooner as I assumed it wouldn't have anything to say which the original hadn't already said; while I prefer the original this was better than I expected and had some decent chills.As in the original the film opens with two school girls talking about a mysterious video tape which after viewing you only has seven days to live. One of the girls had seen the tape when she went with a group of other friends to a remote mountain cabin the previous weekend. Soon strange things start happening, the television turns itself on and something happens which scares to death the girl who saw the tape and leaves the other so scared she has to be put in a mental hospital. This would have been put down to a mere tragic occurrence had the dead girls cousin not been a reporter who thought something strange was going on and overheard the tape being talked about during the funeral. Rachel, the reporter, heads up to the cabin and finds the tape which being sceptical she watches then gets a phone call telling her she has a week to live. She takes the tape back to work to examine it more thoroughly. She lets her ex husband see the tape when he insists he can help her.When they examine the tape they see that there are references to something that happened on an island several years before where many horses appeared to deliberately drown themselves and the woman who owned them committed suicide, she goes there and finds the house in the tape where the woman's widower still lives, he does not want to talk about his daughter however...Anybody who has seen the original will have a good idea of what to expect although there are quite a few changes which will either irritate the viewer or make them think it gives the film a degree of freshness. I preferred the way it was done in the original although that may just be a matter of taste. Naomi Watts put in a fine performance in the lead roll and Brain Cox is excellent as always in his small role as the man on the island. I was less keen on the way Rachel's ex was portrayed, he seemed far too laid back. The character of the reporter's son also seemed to have been changed unnecessarily, originally he was just an ordinary child but here he has some unexplained psychic connection to the cause of all the trouble.If you like a good scare without having to see lots of gore then this is worth watching on television although I'd recommend getting the original instead if you are planning to make a purchase.",6,0,1,21 June 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Introducing Indiana Jones
","In 1936 the US Government has learnt that the Nazis think they have found the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant at a remote location in Egypt. In order to prevent Hitler getting his hands on the Ark, which he believes would make his forces invincible, government agents ask archaeologist/adventurer Indiana Jones to find it first and retrieve it. Before going to Egypt he head to Nepal to retrieve an item he needs to locate the room that houses the Ark from Marion Ravenwood, the daughter of his former mentor. The Nazis know she has it and head their too. After fighting them off Indiana and Marion head to Egypt where they meet Indiana's friend Sallah. Marion is soon captured, and for a while presumed dead, leaving Indiana and Sallah to search for the Ark; inevitably he finds it and learns that Marion is still alive but he still has a long way to go before the adventure is over.This iconic adventure film feels as fresh now as when I first saw it in the early eighties. The opening is one of the most memorable in any film as it introduces us to our protagonist by showing him retrieving a gold monkey idol from a booby-trapped South American temple only to have it stolen by is rival a rival we will see again working for the Nazis. Once the story proper gets started the action rarely lets up; Indiana and his friends are almost constantly under threat from some particularly unpleasant bad guys these Nazis are even nastier than most shown in such films. The action is impressive, and at times surprisingly scary given the film's PG rating we see blood spray when a man goes through an aircraft propeller, snakes emerging from the mouth of a long-dead corpse and, in the finale, faces melting! Harrison Ford is on top form as protagonist Indiana Jones and Karen Allen is a lot of fun as Marion and John Rhys-Davies impresses as Sallah. The bad guys are equally fun with Paul Freeman as Indiana's rival and Ronald Lacey as the vile Nazi Arnold Toht. Overall I'd say this is a great action adventure for all people looking for plenty of thrills and quite a few laughs. It might be too scary for younger children but apart from that can be enjoyed by everybody.",9,0,0,20 September 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice returns for a fourth film in the series
","This, the fourth instalment in the ongoing 'Resident Evil' franchise, opens in Tokyo as Alice launches an attack on an Umbrella Corporation facility to be more accurate several Alices. With superhuman skill they illuminate the facility's guards but its director, Albert Wesker, escapes in a plane. As he takes off he detonates the facility's self-destruct mechanism entirely destroying it. The Original Alice manages to survive as she got aboard Wesker's plane; she confronts him but he injects her with something that neutralises the T-Virus in her, removing her superhuman abilities. The plane crashes shortly afterwards.Alice then makes her way to Alaska where she hopes to find the village of 'Arcadia'; a last outpost of humanity. What she finds is an apparently deserted settlement. It soon becomes clear that one person is still there; Claire Redfield although she has lost all memories due to a strange device on her chest. Once the device is removed the two fly south along the coast. When they get to Los Angeles they find a small group of survivors living in an abandoned prison. They think she has been sent from Arcadia to rescue them it turns out that Arcadia wasn't a village at all but a ship that is now anchored off LA. It won't be easy to get to it though; the prison is surrounded by hordes of zombies and they are starting to breach its defences. Even when those who survive get to the ship their troubles are far from over and Alice must confront an old foe.After the enjoyable third part this was a bit of a disappointment; the story contains few surprises I doubt many people will be surprised by the reveal regarding what has been going on aboard the Arcadia and who is behind it. There is lots of action, some of it pretty good, unfortunately some of it was also fairly obvious CGI. This might have looked good when watched in 3D at the cinema but wasn't too impressive on DVD. Milla Jovovich does a decent enough job as Alice and the rest of the 'good guys' are okay if a little cliché. Shawn Roberts had clearly been told to act as if he was Agent Smith from 'The Matrix' as much of his action and even gestures are clearly ripped off from that film. Overall I'd only recommend this if you are a fan of the series; if you equate zombies with horror and hope to be scared you'll probably be disappointed but if you want an hour and a half of fairly mindless action you could do worse.The ending is clearly a set-up for the fifth film in the franchise; let's just hope it is a bit better than this one.",6,0,0,1 October 2016
Deja Vu," Can Denzel save a girl who has already been killed?
","In the opening scenes a massive explosion kills hundreds of ferry passengers, including numerous US Navy personnel, in New Orleans. One of the investigators is our protagonist; ATF Agent Doug Carlin; he quickly establishes that the explosion was no accident. As he goes through the evidence he hears of the discovery of a burnt body on the shoreline; it sounds as though she died in the blast but she was found too soon somebody who knew about the impending explosion clearly wanted it to look as if she was just another victim.Things now take a turn for the science-fictional when Carlin taken to a facility where he sees what appears to be footage of the scene days before the explosion it turns out there is a government programme that allows the viewer to observe the past to be precise 4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds, 14.5 nanoseconds in the past no more no less. They are looking over the ferry but it is impossible to pick out anybody who might be planning to blow it up; Carlin suggests that instead they concentrate on solving the girl's murder; if they can solve that they will also solve the bombing. As he watches the past unfold he realises the doomed girl, Claire Kuchever, is somehow aware that she is being observed. Now he doesn't just want to solve Claire's murder he wants to save her! This film gets off to a great start with a spectacular explosion and continues nicely as a conventional mystery for the first half hour; so much so that when the sci-fi elements are introduced I was a bit disappointed even though I knew they'd be coming. Once the details of seeing into the past were dealt with things get more interesting again with plenty of good action, as one would expect from director Tony Scott; the most fun being when Carlin dons a special helmet and chases the villain who is four days in the past in an attempt to find where he might be in the present. The story is a bit convoluted and the rules of time travel seem designed to make the story more exciting than anything else still if you don't think about it too much it is a lot of fun. Denzel Washington does a fine job as Agent Carlin and Paula Patton is likable as the apparently doomed Claire. Jim Caviezel was good as the terrorist; it made a nice change that the bad guy wasn't part of some conspiracy. Overall a solid enough film with some great action but not really a must see film.",7,2,3,24 May 2015
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A classic sci-fi for young and old alike
","I first saw this film in the cinema when I was in my mid-teens and I must say I was disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype; so much so that I didn't watch it again for another thirty years. Watching it again though I think I was at just the wrong age to watch it the first time; too old to enjoy it as a child but not quite old enough to enjoy it as an adult.The film opens in the woods with strange half glimpsed creatures scurrying around picking various plants; that is until a group of people turn up and run into the forest; then the creatures return to their glowing spaceship and depart... at least most of them do; one is left behind. The creature is first seen by Elliot, a young boy who nobody believes when he says what he saw. Knowing he didn't imagine it he waits outside till he sees it again. He coaxes it indoors and shortly afterwards shows it to his older brother Mike and his little sister Gertie. The creature, dubbed ET, forms a sort of empathic bond with Elliot which causes the boy to feel what ET feels... with amusing consequences when ET starts drinking beer at home and Elliot falls off his chair drunk at school! After a while ET announces that he must 'phone home' to contact his people; to do this he makes a device and take it to the woods where he landed; something goes wrong though as Elliot starts to feel ill and passes out; when he wakes ET is nowhere to be seen. He gets home and Mike goes out looking for ET; he finds him close to death and brings him home. They aren't back long when government scientists turn up; they do what they can to save ET but it looks as though he will die anyway.I am really glad that I decided to give this a second go as it was a real delight; the opening scenes provide no real hint of what is to come; in fact the creatures moving around in the forest could have been something from a horror movie! It quickly becomes clear that is not the case though and we learn that the stranded creature is entirely benevolent. This is very much a film about childhood; the three main characters are all children and ET only ever interacts with them; indeed the film is shot from a child's point of view with a low camera angle giving a child's view of the world. Henry Thomas does a fine job as Elliot and young Drew Barrymore is a delight as Gertie; it is not a total surprise that she is the cast member who is best known now. If you haven't heard how it ends already it is likely that you will shed a few tears towards the end when things are looking rather tragic. Like most science fiction films there are a fair number of special effects; the most obvious being the brilliantly animated ET puppet; he is far more real than any CGI creature is likely to be; there are also the famous flying bicycle scenes which are a bit corny but should be fun for younger viewers. If you haven't seen this before I recommend watching it some time; and if you saw it when you were younger and didn't like it; why not give it another go? You might find you like it a lot more now.",9,1,2,12 June 2012
Casablanca," One of the greatest films ever
","If ever a film deserved to be considered a classic then this is it, even if you haven't seen it before you'll recognise much of the dialogue; it is probably the most quoted, and misquoted, film of all time. Humphrey Bogart is excellent in this career defining role as bar owner Rick Blaine who has come into possession of two 'letters of transit' which guarantee the holders unhindered passage out of Casablanca. He has these as Ugarte, the man who asked him to look after them, was captured by the Vichy French police before he could get them back. Ugarte had been planning to sell the documents to Victor Laszlo, a Czech nationalist who is fleeing from Nazi occupied Europe to the United States via neutral Portugal. Things are complicated by the fact that Laszlo's wife Ilsa had a relationship with Rick before the fall of Paris and he never really got over her.Right up until the end we don't know what Rick will do, perhaps he will let Victor and Ilsa have the letters, perhaps he will let Victor have them on condition that Ilsa stays with him or perhaps he will betray Victor and leave Casablanca himself with Ilsa. Bogart isn't the only great performance; Ingrid Bergman is fantastic as Ilsa, there is a real chemistry between her and Bogart, Claude Rains is great as the French policeman who's loyalty is likely to change depending on who he thinks is likely to be the most use to him and Paul Henreid's restrained performance as Victor Laszlo is faultless too.It is hard to say what genre this film is, it is one of the great romances, it is also a war film, a thriller and even has some subtle comedy moments. Don't be put off by the film's age, the fact that it is in black and white or that it has a U certificate, this film is a must see. Whatever your tastes you owe it to yourself to watch this at least once, although I suspect few people will only want to watch it just once.",10,4,6,23 July 2009
Minority Report," Great sci-fi thriller
","This film is an intelligent sci-fi murder mystery with a twist... we know who the victim is, we know who the killer is but neither we nor the killer have the faintest idea why the killing will take place. Set in a future where the future can be seen by three 'pre-cogs' murder is a thing of the past as the would be killers are arrested before they can commit their crimes. One day the head of this police department has terrifying shock when the pre-cogs tell him there is going to be a murder and he will be the killer.From then on the hunter becomes the hunted as Chief John Anderton must run from his own officers to determine why he is destined to kill a stranger before they can incarcerate him. He is never fully sure who he can and can't trust and only has thirty six hours to find out if his destiny is truly written.The acting is pretty good with Tom Cruise being believable as the fugitive police officer, however the best performance comes from Samantha Morton in the role of Agatha; the pre-cog who Anderton turns to for help and who in turn seeks his help in solving an old case. Steven Spielberg did a fin job directing this. Using just the right amount of special effects he never lets the story be overshadowed by explosions and excessive CGI. When I first watched it I wasn't too sure about the washed out colours used in every scene apart from the few flashbacks it the more of the film I saw the more I thought they suited the tone of the film. If you are a fan of slightly dystopian science fiction I'd certainly recommend this.",8,0,0,4 August 2009
Lifeboat," A gripping drama set in one small boat in the Atlantic
","After the sinking of their ship by a German U-boat a motley group of survivors end up in a lifeboat together; not long afterwards they pull another man out of the water; this one however is German; a survivor from the U-boat that was also sunk in the encounter. Some on board believe he should be thrown back in to the sea but the others argue that to do that would make them criminals themselves. They opt to keep him on board and as one of them, photographer and journalist Connie Porter, can speak German they question him; he explains that he is just a crewman. Things get grim very quickly when one of the survivors realises that the baby that she has been cradling has died and one of the freighters crew has a serious leg wound that quickly turns gangrenous. Not knowing if the ship was able to send an emergency message the survivors decide to head for the nearest land; the island of Bermuda; a small dot in a vast ocean. This won't be easy as they have no compass and opinions are divided about what is the best course... should they trust their German captive or would he take them in the wrong direction towards German shipping and certain imprisonment.This early Hitchcock film contains the tension that he is known for in his more famous films; the black and white filming worked in the films favour making the sea look almost black which created a particularly bleak feeling. Whenever the sea broke over the little boat it looked far more realistic than modern films and their CGI water! That isn't to say everything looked as good; the starlit night sky looked very much like a painted backdrop. The cast did a fine job as the varied group of characters; most notable were Tallulah Bankhead as the wealthy Connie Porter and Walter Slezak as Willy the German but they all contributed and each had a distinct character that brought something to the story. Keeping the action confined to the lifeboat for the entirety of the film created a claustrophobic atmosphere despite the fact that they were adrift in an ocean; more so when tensions between the survivors rises as they have no way of getting away from each other. The 'twist' when it comes isn't a total surprise; after all this was made during the war when the Germans were the enemy and people were hardly going to be encouraged to trust them! Whether you are a fan of Hitchcock or not this film we well worth watching.",9,0,1,22 April 2012
In Bruges," Laughter and tears in Bruges
","The idea of a film about a couple of foul-mouthed Irish hit men laying low in Bruges after one of them has accidentally killed a child in a church doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this black comedy.The two men are Ken, the older of the two who loves the culture and history in the ancient town and Ray who thinks two weeks stuck in Bruges is like purgatory. Ray is having difficulty coming to terms with the fact that he killed a child to such an extent that he is contemplating suicide... he might not have to do it however as Ken gets a call from Harry, their employer, telling him he is to kill Ray. Of course nothing goes quite as expected, Ray falls in love with a local con-woman and ends up dealing with her less than competent ex-boyfriend who threatens him with a revolver, a dwarf who has some strange views about race when on drugs and some large American tourists who don't like being told they are too big to go up a church tower.The Martin McDonagh wrote a great script the brilliantly directed a cast of talented actors; Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were great as Ken and Ray, they are able supported by Clémence Poésy as Ray's new girlfriend Chloe, Thekla Reuten as pregnant hotel owner Marie and Ralph Fiennes as the two killers' employer who had a strict rule about never hurting a child.If you are offended by swearing give this film a wide birth as it contains almost non-stop bad language, it also contains some bloody violence that might bother some viewers, however if these things don't bother you then I'd strongly recommend this, a laughed out loud many times and won't deny that I also shed a few tears.",10,3,6,7 January 2010
John Wick," They stole his car; they killed his dog; now they are going to pay
","John Wick's life is not going well; his wife of five years has recently died and he is barely holding things together. Then he receives one final gift from his wife; a puppy. It looks as if this is just what he needed to pull himself together but soon afterwards a group of young punks break into his house and attack him while looking for the keys to his classic car they also kill the puppy. They also had no idea who they were messing with until Wick met his wife he was the top assassin working for a Russian mobster in New York. The thief's father is that same Russian gangster and if he is to save his son he will have to kill Wick first. The killers sent after Wick are soon dispatched and now he is on the warpath; everybody who gets in his way is going to end up dead and a lot of people get in his way.If you are looking for a deep and meaningful story or even a sense of mystery you are likely to be disappointed with this; from the start we know who the bad guys are and we just know that before the film is over our protagonist will have killed them all along with countless heavies. If you want lots of action that feels real without obvious CGI, wirework, obviously choreographed fights and corny one-liners then this is just the thing. With its almost nonstop violent action it feels more like something John Woo would have made in his Hong Kong days than a typical Hollywood action movie. Keanu Reeves does an impressive job as Wick. Michael Nyqvist make a good bad guy and Alfie Allen is suitably unpleasant as his dog-killing son. They are also enjoyable turns from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane. My only real complaint about the film is that the subtitles that appeared when anybody spoke Russian were tiny and not at the bottom of the screen so that they weren't that easy to read before they vanished; that wasn't a major problem as this film is about action not dialogue. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody after a proper action movie.",8,2,5,24 July 2016
Kung Fu Panda," Fun animation from DreamWorks
","I hadn't got around to watching this film but as I'd heard good things about it I thought I'd check it out when it was on television. Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.While the two films are very different I couldn't help thinking about Star Wars due to the relationships between the main characters; Shifu was like Obi Wan as his best student turns bad, Oogway was similar to Yoda. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate reference, it didn't matter if it was though as they never really laboured the point; in fact the film was refreshingly free from obvious pop culture references which I suspect will lead to it having a greater longevity than some other Dream Works animations. The animation looked pretty good in a way that made the characters believable even though they are talking, kung-fu fighting animals! The voice actors did a decent job; they avoided giving their characters 'cartoony' voices that can be a problem with animation at times. Over all I'd recommend this as it is a good family film with nothing too offensive for children or too childish for adults; it might not be as good as Pixar's best but then what is?",8,6,7,18 June 2011
Chinatown," Great 'modern' film noir
","Set in late '30s Los Angeles this 1974 film opens with a woman, identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray, asking private detective Jake Gettes to find out whether her husband, chief engineer of the LA Water and Power Company, is having an affair. He follows him and ultimately photographs him with another woman. Somehow these pictures end up in the papers and he is approached by another woman who it turns out is the real wife of Mulwray... and she intends to sue. He continues to investigate Mulwray and suspects some odd goings on at Water and Power... then Mulwray turns up dead; drowned during a severe drought. His continued investigation brings him closer to the real Evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns the truth about Water and Power's activities which could make some people very rich at the expense of other, poorer, people.This film may have been made about a quarter of a century after the classic era for film noir but it perfectly captures the feel of those films. It has morally ambiguous characters inhabiting a murky world that contrasts with the bright Los Angeles sunshine. The story has many twists and turns without feeling unnecessarily complex or confusing. The cast does a great job; especially Jack Nicholson who is in every scene so that the viewer doesn't know anything Gettes doesn't know. Faye Dunaway is solid as Evelyn Mulwray and John Huston is suitably menacing as her father; a man standing to make a lot of money with many dark secrets. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good mystery or fans of film noir.",10,18,21,15 November 2018
Gravity," All alone in the night
","After the testing of an anti-satellite missile goes disastrously wrong; the debris quickly hits other satellites causing a snowball effect as more and more debris is created. This debris is heading at very high speed towards the crew of a US shuttle who are on a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope. When it strikes there are only two survivors; Ryan Stone, a female biomedical engineer on her first mission; and Matt Kowalski, a seasoned astronaut with many missions under his belt. With the shuttle effectively destroyed they must find another way home and understandably the choices are limited. There is a Soyuz module at the nearby International Space Station but that has been damaged in a way that makes re-entry impossible; it may be able to travel to the Chinese space station where there is a similar module but that is a hundred kilometres away.If you are looking for a film with a deep plot and lots of twists then this is not it; once the disaster strikes the only route home is quickly established. That doesn't mean the film is boring though; the action is spectacular as the two survivors struggle at each stage. There are some surprises too but I'll try not to spoil the main one! The cast does a fine job; Sandra Bullock carries the film as Ryan Stone nicely portraying her fear and determination, she is ably supported by George Clooney who plays Kowalski; a smaller part but equally important to the story. The special effects are amazing bringing the viewer right into the action even when watched on a small screen although this is the first film I've watched on a television for some time that I thought I would have liked to have seen it in the cinema. The tension is maintained from the moment the disaster strikes right until the end with very few moments when it didn't feel like disaster could strike. Overall a gripping film that I heartily recommend.",9,3,5,16 April 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," He's not the Messiah; he's a very naughty boy!
","Brian is an ordinary Judean who just happened to be born at the same time as Christ (leading to some confusion among the wise men). He grows up with a dislike of the Roman occupiers and falls in with a terrorist group known as the Judean People's Front. It isn't long before this gets him into trouble with the Romans and they plan to crucify him. He manages to escape, with the help of a passing spaceship, but soon has other problems. After posing as a street side preacher he picks up a group of followers who believe that he is the Messiah!These days it is hard to see why this film was considered controversial; it is clear from the opening scene that Brian is not Jesus under another name. It is however very funny; a series of hilarious and eminently quotable scenes that combine to make a great film. The Monty Python team are on top form, each of them playing a number of roles. Graham Chapman stands out as he plays the eponymous Brian; an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary events. The jokes are all pretty funny but if one doesn't particularly amuse you another will be along shortly. The film feels fresh and relevant today; in fact some of the satire could have easily have been written in the present day as we see rebel groups who hate each other more than their official enemy and people are executed for supposed blasphemy where the accusers won't repeat what was allegedly said as they would be considered blasphemous too. If you are a fan of laugh out loud comedy then this film is a must it is hilarious from start to finish.",8,1,2,5 June 2016
The Death of Stalin," A comedy about the paranoid aftermath of the death of a tyrant
","In Stalin's Soviet Union everybody is terrified of offending the 'great man'; especially those closest to him. They all know the slightest mistake will lead to their deaths. When he suffers a cerebral haemorrhage at his dacha members of the Central Committee hurry to the scene... if he survives they want him to know how concerned they were but should he die they want to be ready to further their own careers. He does die and his deputy, Georgy Malenkov, is declared the new leader. However he is clearly a weak man and others, notably head of the Moscow party, Nikita Khrushchev, and the head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria start planning to take ultimate control. As preparations are made for the funeral the scheming only intensifies and other members of the committee try to identify who will come out on top so they can support the winner and avoid the fate of those who upset Soviet leaders.One would expect a subject like this to be treated very seriously; after all Stalin was one of the worst tyrants the world has known and those jockeying to replace him were at least complicit in his crimes... however this portrayal is comic; and rightly so; tyrants deserve to be laughed at. The comedy is derived from the characters behaviour; each waiting to see which way the political wind blows before making a decision; often changing opinions mid-sentence. The cast, which includes plenty of well-known faces, does a fine job; always playing things straight which often serves to make things even funnier. While it is funny it is also very tense as the characters know one wrong word could be fatal. It may not be one hundred percent factually accurate but that doesn't matter too much given that it is a comedy not an historical drama. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of dark comedy.",9,0,1,29 May 2019
Mulan," The girl who saved China
","Disney is probably the best known name in animation but because their films are almost never on television I don't think I'd seen one since I saw Pinocchio in the cinema in 1972 when I was five! For that reason when I saw 'Mulan' was going to be on television I just had to watch it.This film tells the tale of the eponymous Mulan; a Chinese girl living with her invalid father. When China is invaded by the Huns every family must send one male to fight for the emperor; as Mulan has no brothers this means her father must go for the sake of the family's honour. Knowing that he will almost certainly be killed Mulan cuts her hair short before taking her father's armour and sneaking out of the house at night to enlist. This is a foolhardy move as it would mean instant death and dishonour should her true gender be exposed. In order to save her the family ancestors are summoned and Mushu, a small dragon goes off to help her he too wasn't meant to go but he is determined to regain his position. When Mulan gets into the army things don't go too well at first and more than once it looks as if she will be caught; eventually however she and her comrades go into battle against the dreaded Hun and due to Mulan's bravery and quick thinking they prevail. Unfortunately for her though they learn she is a girl; because of her bravery she isn't killed but she is left behind in shame. When she sees that the Hun aren't all dead she must tell her friends and save the emperor this time she won't be hiding her gender they will! I was surprised how much I enjoyed this; the story was great and I really liked the protagonist, Ming-Na did a good job providing her voice. The most recognisable voice was provided my Eddie Murphy, who played the comedy sidekick Mushu; he did a good job and provided plenty of laughs from a character I initially thought might turn out to be irritating. While there are plenty of laughs there is also a good amount of drama and action; the scenes where Mulan sets off to join the army and where her unit finds the site where the rest of the army had been defeated were particularly poignant. The action scenes were quite dramatic; especially the 'avalanche scene'. Being a Disney film there were some songs and while they didn't have me humming along they did add some enjoyable moments. Being a U certificate there is nothing in this film that makes it unsuitable for young children and it is nice to see a children's film where the female protagonist doesn't need a man to rescue her from danger; here it is she who does the rescuing! Given how much I enjoyed this; I just hope it isn't another forty years till I catch another Disney animation!",9,2,2,2 May 2012
Wayne's World," Stupid but a lot of fun
","Wayne Campbell lives in his parents' basement from where he broadcasts a show on public access TV with his friend Garth Algar. It is low budget, unrehearsed and most importantly they have total control over the show. That is until TV producer Benjamin Oliver, who is looking for something new that is popular with the kids, offers them $10,000 for rights to the show. Wayne doesn't want to sell out but having signed a contract he is asked to do things he doesn't want to do; most notably give air time to the show's new sponsor. While this is going on Wayne gets together with Cassandra Wong, the lead singer of a local band. Soon Oliver is offering her a contract and Wayne is sure that he has ulterior motives.I recall watching this in the '90s and thinking it was funny enough but a bit too silly so I was surprised to rewatch it and find myself rather enjoying it sometimes silly is just what is required. The plot is pretty basic and there are few real surprises. There are plenty of funny moments though and as the gags come thick and fast if one misses the mark there is a good chance the next will be better. Some of the gags are connected to the plot but plenty are completely random. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are good as Wayne and Garth; providing most of the laughs, often while directly addressing the camera. Tia Carrere is suitable sexy as love interest Cassandra and Rob Lowe is delightfully sleazy as Oliver. Overall I think this has aged pretty well if you want some good silly fun you could do a lot worse.",8,0,0,10 September 2017
The Big Lebowski," Simply Hilarious
","This is the funniest of the Coen brother's films that I've seen to date. The film follows the story of slacker Jeffrey Lebowski (AKA The Dude) who is mistaken for a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski by a couple of thugs wanting money owed by the latter's wife.Encouraged by his easily angered friend Walter, The Dude goes to see the other Lebowski to get a rug to replace one damaged by the thugs. When Lebowki's wife is kidnapped he asks The Dude to help deliver the ransom. While this is going on The Dude and his friends are also involved in preparations for a bowling match.From then on things get stranger and stranger in events featuring German nihilists, a pornographer, Lebowski's daughter and a bowler by the name of Jesus.The cast led by Jeff Bridges is excellent as the story is fun and in places rather surreal, if you don't mind a lot of swearing and enjoy a good laugh this film is a must see.",9,1,5,18 April 2008
Unbreakable," Is crash survivor David Dunn really a superhero?
","When a train travelling between New York and Philadelphia crashes there is only one survivor; David Dunn... and he isn't even scratched. Shortly afterwards he is contacted by Elijah Price; a man who suffers from a condition that means the slightest accident causes his bones to break... leaking to him being nicknamed 'Mr Glass' as a child. Elijah grew up reading comics and now believes that David survived because he has superhero like powers. David is understandable sceptical but when he thinks back he can only recall one time he got injured. Does he really have superpowers or is he just very lucky?This is an enjoyable film that almost defies genre. As it starts it looks as though it is going to be a disaster movie but we see nothing of the train crash or its aftermath; just our protagonist talking on the train then waking up in hospital. Then when he survives and is approached by Elijah the viewer is encouraged to wonder whether Dunn really has powers; something he denies while his young son is keen to believe in. The story plays out like a superhero origins story where we don't know whether the protagonist has powers until it is almost over. Since this was written and directed by M Night Shyamalan a big twist is inevitable and while key aspects weren't a total surprise many key details were. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are on great form as Dunn and Price respectively. Similarly Shyamalan does a fine job bringing his story to the screen; eschewing the look of a typical superhero film for a deliberately drab look. The story provides plenty of tense moments; the best being when Dunn's son tries to prove his father has superpowers in just about the most dangerous way possible. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Shyamalan's other films, fans of Willis and Jackson as well as people who enjoy superhero origins stories.",9,1,2,13 May 2019
Star Trek," Rebooting a sci-fi classic
","Having first watched 'Star Trek' as a child in the early seventies then watching the films and various new series I was unsure about having a different cast play the original characters after all William Shatner IS James T. Kirk! This film manages to get around that by being set before he is made captain of the Enterprise... in fact the opening scene takes place just before he is born. In that opening scene is father sacrifices himself so that the crew of his ship, including his pregnant wife can escape after an attack by a giant Romulan ship. The Young James Kirk grows up to be a bit of a tearaway but is persuaded to join Star Fleet by Captain Pike. At the end of his time at Star Fleet Academy he is in trouble for cheating in a test but an incident on Vulcan means that everybody including the cadets must head there straight away. Once they arrive they find the rest of the fleet has been destroyed and Vulcan is under attack from the Romulans. Once they have finished there the Romulans set off towards their next target: Earth. Pike has been captured so it is up to Kirk, Spock and the other characters we know from the original series to prevent a catastrophic attack on Earth.I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this; I suspect this is because the cast don't seem to be trying to imitate the original cast too closely. There is also a lot more humour than I expected and also a few shocks... I certainly didn't expect to see the destruction of Vulcan or the tragic loss of somebody close to Spock. The story itself was pretty good and the use of time-travelling Romulans to create an alternate time line means that any future instalments in the franchise won't be bound by what we know happened from the original series. The cast did a decent job, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock; the rest of the crew may have been there but it was essentially the story of how Kirk and Spock became close despite their very different personalities. The bad guys were suitably villainous even if they didn't look like most Romulans that we have seen before and the action and special effects were impressive enough to keep this viewer gripped. I started watching the as a sceptic but now look forward to seeing further adventures with this cast.",8,1,5,17 October 2011
Fury," Exciting if flawed Second World War tank action
","Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier is the commander of a US Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury'; he and his crew have been in the thick of it in North Africa, Normandy and are now in Germany in the dying days of the war. Private Norman Ellison has only been in the army for eight weeks and is trained as an office typist until for some reason he is assigned to Collier's crew to replace a dead member he is definitely not ready for the terrors of war. He is certainly the outsider in the crew. As they progress through various actions he sees is baptism of fire and becomes a hardened fighter. Eventually collier is ordered to take five tanks to defend a vital crossroads; four are destroyed leaving 'Fury to defend the location then a battalion of SS turn up and one hell of a firefight ensues.If you are looking for a war film with lots of brutal action then this is likely to be the film for you; people are decapitated; burn and are blown up. There is also the feeling that secondary characters could die at any time and as the end approaches it feels as if anybody could die. There is a problem with the characters unfortunately; early on we see Collier forcing Ellison to shoot a German prisoner and the rest of the 'hardened crew' are even less likable I almost found myself cheering for the German Tiger tank that was picking off the 'good guys'. The action scenes were intense and nicely captured some of the confusion of battle even if, as others have noted, the tracer fire looked like lasers in a sci-fi movie. The ending definitely requires one to suspend ones disbelief as hundreds of Germans take enormous casualties before they make the slightest headway against this single tank even though they have anti-tank weapons. The cast lead by Brad Pitt, in the role of Collier, does a solid job making us believe in the characters even if some of those characters are pretty hard to like. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of war films; just don't expect it to be too believable.",7,2,3,1 April 2017
Akira," An anime classic
","In the year 1988 the city of Tokyo was destroyed in the Third World War; now, thirty one years later the city of Neo-Tokyo has been built. Here a gang of teenage bikers led by Kaneda cause mayhem fighting with other such gangs. One day as they are fighting a rival gang Kaneda's friend Tetsuo runs into a strange child and is taken into military custody. He soon starts having strange nightmares then develops telekinetic powers. Meanwhile Kaneda is arrested but soon freed from custody along with Kei, a girl who had been involved in an anti-government protest. Kaneda is determined to help his friend but as Tetsuo's powers increase he doesn't want help and becomes drawn to somebody called Akira who apparently has powers that are even greater than his.This is one of those films that all anime fans should watch at least once; away from the works of Studio Ghibli this is probably the classic anime movie it is also probably one of the main reasons some people think of anime as 'weird Japanese cartoons' it starts normally enough for a post-apocalyptic story as we are introduced to Kaneda and his gang and see them fighting their rivals but once Tetsuo starts to be affected by his encounter with strange child things get weird fast; he has nightmares featuring giant, creepy stuffed animal toys and gets more and more bizarre as things progress. That doesn't mean it is too hard to follow though. As well as the aforementioned weirdness there are plenty of great action scenes as the rival gangs fight and as Kaneda and Kei attempt to enter the facility where Tetsuo is located. The animation and background designs look great as do the designs of the various futuristic machines. Overall this is a must see for anime fans which I suspect will be improved by repeat viewings.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",9,1,4,9 September 2015
Train to Busan," Train to Busan
","Seok-woo is a workaholic fund manager living in Seoul with his mother and Su-an, his young daughter. She is desperate to see her mother, who lives four hundred and fifty kilometres away in Busan. Eventually her father agrees to take her and together they board the train to Busan. As the train prepares to depart we are introduced to a few other characters; a man and his pregnant wife; a pair of older women; a school girl and her boyfriend a wealthy business executive; a homeless man who keeps saying 'everybody is dead!' and a girl who is behaving strangely. Soon after the train sets off this girl attacks a train attendant... it is clear that she was infected with something that causes extreme violence. It isn't long before more and more become infected and survivors are barricading themselves in the remaining safe parts of the train. If that weren't enough it is clear that the infection is affecting people throughout South Korea.I really enjoyed this South Korean zombie film; it provided tension from soon after the start right to the final scene. The zombies are more like those infected in '28 Days Later' than classic slow shuffling ones some people might not be keen on that but I think so long as they are scary all is good... and these provided the scares. The film nicely establishes rules that these particular zombies follow. Inevitably there are plenty of gory scenes, but nothing too excessive, and it isn't entirely obvious who, if anybody, will survive. The key characters are introduced well and fairly quickly; they include a good cross section of society and both heroes and cowards. Setting the film in the confined space of a speeding train adds an extra danger as there are limited places for survivors to hide safely for any length of time. The cast is solid and make us believe in their characters; similarly the special effects are pretty impressive. Overall I'd say that this is definitely a film to watch if you like zombie movies.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.",9,1,2,7 August 2019
Citizen Kane," One of the greatest films ever
","As this classic film opens Charles Foster Kane lies dying in Xanadu, his palatial home in Florida. The last word he speaks is 'Rosebud'. A newsreel film about his life in which we learn how he acquired a failing New York newspaper, rose to prominence, stood for the governorship, married and divorced (twice) before retreating to Xanadu and becoming a recluse. After this reporter Jerry Thompson is told to find a different angle to the story; in particular the meaning of 'rosebud'. Over the course of his investigation he talks to Kane's second wife; reads through the archives of Walter Thatcher, the man who raised young Kane; he also talks to his business manager, Mr. Bernstein and former closest friend Jedediah Leland.As Thompson sees each of them we see snippets of Kane's life how he was effectively sold as a child when gold was found on his mother's land; his idealist sentiments when he took over the newspaper; how he later manipulates public opinion; stands up to a corrupt governor only to be brought down by a scandal that ends his first marriage; a second marriage where he is determined to put his new wife, a singer, on the stage even if she knows she isn't good enough and ultimately how after others can't stand his controlling ways he dies in his private palace.This film is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made; this isn't just because it contains a fine story that is told in an interesting way but because of how innovative it was at the time it was made. This alone makes it a must see for fans of cinema. Orson Welles dominates the film; playing Kane through a variety of ages as well as writing, directing and producing the films. Even so he isn't carrying the film alone; all of the main cast are very impressive. The mystery behind 'rosebud' is intriguing but ultimately proves to be a McGuffin used to get Thompson to look more deeply into Kane's life and it is this life that drives the story. The way the story is told via a series of flashbacks works well as each person Thomson talks to reveals another aspect of Kane's life. Overall I'd say that this is a great film and certainly an important one; I don't know if it is the greatest but it is certainly in the running for that title.",10,2,5,12 June 2017
Monster," A sympathetic portrayal of a serial killer
","This film, based on real events, tells the story of Aileen Wuornos; a prostitute in Daytona Beach, Florida who went on to become America's first female serial killer. She is down to her last five dollars and contemplating suicide when she decides she might as well spend it on cheap beer in a local bar. Here she is approached by Selby Wall, a naïve young lesbian; the two get drinking and form an unlikely friendship. Unable to get regular work and needing money she returns to prostitution; a client attacks her and would probably have killed her if she didn't have a gun... instead he ended up dead. She takes his car and his money and hits the road with Selby. It isn't long before she kills again.Usually serial killers are rightfully portrayed as monsters, if based on real people, or somewhat charismatic if fictional; the portrayal of Aileen avoids both stereotypes. We see that her life is pretty terrible and her first victim is shown as fairly clear self-defence. As she progresses she behaves in a way that is clearly not justified but by then that degree of sympathy has already been evoked. The violence is shown in a fairly matter of fact way and in no way glamorised or made exciting. The relationship between Aileen and Selby feels real as does the way Selby naively accepts Aileen's version of how she got her money and 'borrowed' cars. Interestingly the story is centred on Aileen and Selby; we never learn about the police investigation apart from what our protagonists see on the news. Charlize Theron is on brilliant form as Aileen, it is little wonder she picked up an Oscar for her performance. Cristina Ricci also impresses as Selby making it easy to believe in her characters naivety. Writer/director Patty Jenkins did a fine job creating a feeling of desperation without making the film too depressing to enjoy. Overall I'd say that this film is definitely worth watching.",9,0,1,14 November 2019
The Maze Runner," Solid dystopian YA story which reminded me of 'Lord of the Flies' crossed with 'Cube'
","As this film opens our protagonist wakes in a large lift that takes him to a green area surrounded by high walls. He has no memory of what happened before, initially he doesn't even know his name although he later recalls that it is Thomas. There are other people there already; all teenage boys and none have any memory of what happened before they got there or knowledge of why they have been put there. Thomas is told that once a month a new person arrives along with vital supplies. He also learns that the area they live in is known as The Glade and the wall contain a giant maze; giant doors into the maze are open during the day and closed at night runners go into the maze during the day hoping to find a way out and if any are trapped in the maze when the doors close they will never be seen again. Apparently creatures known as Grievers come out at night although nobody has seen one and lived to tell the tale. That is until Thomas enters the maze to help two other boys and is caught inside. Not only do they manage to survive the night Thomas actually manages to kill a Griever. Things soon start to change; Thomas and another boy discover that the Grievers are man-made, they think they have found a way out and then the elevator delivers a new person; the first girl to be sent to the glade. Some people think that Thomas will be the one to get them out of the maze but one boy, Gally, is convinced that he has brought danger to them and insists that he is punished for what he has done. Sides are taken and a group make a bid for freedom.When I started watching this I wasn't expecting too much perhaps because of that I found myself pleasantly surprised. The idea of having a group of boys trapped in an enclosed location immediately made me think of 'Lord of the Flies' although the society depicted here isn't quite so fragile even if Gally's actions appear to push it that way. The fact that the maze changed each night and contained dangers reminded me of the Sci-fi film 'Cube'; although with this films young adult demographic it is far less violent. That doesn't mean there is no sense of real danger; it gets pretty intense at times and has moments when it is genuinely scary. A fair number of characters die including some one would expect to survive. The film has a good look with the maze having a real feel to it. The cast, which featured nobody I recognised in major roles, did a solid job making the viewer believe in the characters and their situation. There are some weaknesses, mostly when we are finally told why the boys were selected and why the maze was created in the first place, also the ending felt entirely like a set up for the next film in the series which of course it was. Overall though I found this to be a solid story and will keep an eye open for the sequel.",8,0,0,1 January 2017
Memento," Christopher Nolan plays with memories and time to create a gripping thriller
","Protagonist Leonard has an unusual condition; he can't form any new memories; anything that happens to him fades from his memory in a matter of minutes. He explains that he still recall events that took place before the night that he came home and discovered his wife being raped and murdered. He is hunting for the killer; to make this possible he must keep notes and take photographs to remind him who the people in his life are now, the most important facts he has tattooed onto his body. In the opening scenes we see him driving to a remote location with a man called Teddy; he looks through his pictures and on the back of Teddy's picture is says that he is the killer Leonard shoots and kills the man.Because of the way the story is told this is actually the end; as the film progresses two narratives unfold; on, in black and white, moves forward, and the other, in colour, gradually moves backwards. As the two narratives converge we learn more about Leonard as well as Teddy and a woman called Natalie who helped him.This early film from director Christopher Nolan is gripping and manages to avoid being too confusing as we gradually learn more about the characters. As time passes it becomes apparent that Leonard is a far from reliable narrator thanks to his condition. The way time is played with gives an idea of what Leonard's life is like; he can only trust his notes and what people tell him; not easy when his notes tell him not to trust certain people. When the truth is finally exposed it comes as quite a surprise despite hints that we have seen. The cast does a really good job; Guy Pearce does a great job as he captures Leonard's condition in a believable way, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also great as Natalie and Teddy. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a thriller that is different check this out; you might want to watch it again though as I suspect many details will improve on a second viewing.",8,0,2,2 December 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's War Movie
","This wartime movie follows two separate stories that are destined to meet in the final scenes. In the first Col. Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Landa enters a French farm house and, after talking to the farmer for some time, shoots the Jewish family he was hiding; one of them, eighteen year old Shosanna, manages to escape. When we next see her it is 1944 and she is running a cinema in Paris. Here she catches the eye of a young German soldier; she isn't interested in him but it turns out he is famous amongst the Germans thanks to his exploits as a sniper. A film has been made about him and he wants the premiere to take place in her cinema with all the top brass in attendance she sees this as an opportunity to avenge her family's murder. Meanwhile the second story follows a small group of Jewish American soldiers, nicknamed the 'Inglourious Basterds', who are working deep inside enemy territory killing any Germans they can get their hands on. When British Military Intelligence learns of the film premiere this group are brought into a plot to blow up the cinema with the help of a German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a double agent. As the big night approaches it emerges that Adolf Hitler himself will be in attendance along with other senior Nazis if everything goes to plan the war could end in 1944.If you like your war stories to fit in with real history you might find this rather annoying as some real people who did not die in 1944 end up dead in this film if however you are looking for a cracking war film with a good amount of action, some very tense scenes and a spectacular finale you could do a lot worse than this. The film opens more like a spaghetti western than a war film with the Germans arriving at a remote farmhouse. Here Landa and the farmer just talk for the first twenty minutes of the film the tension gradually rising as we wait for something to happen. Christoph Waltz is delightfully menacing without ever issuing a direct threat or raising his voice; in this scene and for most of the movie. After this prologue things get more interesting as we switch between the two plots to kill Nazis at the cinema; at any time either could be exposed or they could somehow ruin the other's scheme. Given that Tarantino's previous films are pretty bloody I expected this to be very violent but it isn't excessively; there are indeed moments of violence but more often there is just the feeling that something violent is about to happen; when it does it is short and bloody. The cast do a fine job; as well as the aforementioned Christoph Waltz there are great performances from Brad Pitt as the leader of the titular 'Inglourious Basterds', Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna and Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Tarantino's earlier films as well as people looking for a thrilling war movie.",9,2,5,4 March 2017
Underworld," A decent update of the Vampire/Werewolf mythology
","As this film opens we are told that a war once raged between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) but six hundred years ago the Vampires killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans and the war was over; since then the Vampires have been mopping up what was left of the Lycans. Then during one such operation Selene, one of the Vampires, senses that a nest of Lycans contains far more than had been seen in centuries. Her leader, Kraven, is dubious but she is convinced and investigates what the Lycans were doing. She is surprised to see they appear to be following a specific human; Michael Corvin.It turns out the he is a direct decedent of the ancestor of both Vampires and Lycans and could potentially become a hybrid of both! The Vampires are determined to kill him but Selene isn't so sure. As time passes she learns that much of what she has been told is untrue and if she is to survive she will have to battle both Lycans and Vampires.This is a decent fantasy adventure; they is lots of action throughout and an interesting story. The setting is dark and moody which gives the film a good feel; this is added to by the fact that the characters seem to have a thing about wearing black. This is especially true of Kate Beckinsale who looks fantastic in tight black PVC; she isn't just there for her looks though; she does a fine job in the role. She is ably supported by Michael Sheen as Lucian and Bill Nighy as Viktor, the most powerful of the Vampires. Scott Speedman is slightly less impressive as Michael but that could be seen as a deliberate attempt to make the human character less of a presence than the supernatural creatures. The action is directed stylishly and nicely updates the vampire/werewolf mythology with modern weapons used to fire special bullets that play on each creatures traditional weaknesses. Overall a solid enough film that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy.",7,1,1,10 July 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," An impressively dark 'Star Wars' story
","Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death Star this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.As the film opens Imperial forces order scientist Galen Erso, who had been working as a farmer, to return to work on a new project. His wife is killed but his young daughter, Jyn, manages to escape. Fifteen years later news of the new weapon leaks out when an Imperial pilot defects while carrying a message from Galen. The pilot is held by a particularly radical rebel leader Saw Gerrera, the man who had helped save Jyn all those years ago. Jyn has lost contact with him but other rebels want her to help them get to Gerrera and learn the content of the message. Rebel officer Cassian Andor rescues Jyn from Imperial forces and they, along with K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, go to Gerrera. By now the Empire is fully aware that a pilot has defected with a message and they will do anything to stop the rebels using that information. Jyn sees the message and learns that her father built a weakness into the Death Star but to use it the rebels will need to steal the station's blueprints from an Imperial facility. After seeing what the Death Star can do many rebels want to give up but Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, the pilot and a few others decide that they will do what needs to be done whatever the personal cost and so a single stolen Imperial cargo ship, call sign 'Rogue One' sets off to find the plans.This is what the original prequel films should have been like. It is the darkest 'Star Wars' film to date; for once we see just how oppressive the Empire is; not just when dealing with rebels but as a brutal power of occupation. It also shows that the rebels are willing to do questionable things for what they see as the greater good of their cause. It might be thought there would be less sense of jeopardy as we've known for almost forty years that the rebels get their hands on the Death Star plans however since we haven't seen these characters before there the lingering question of why that might be is it just because they were doing other things or is it because they don't survive?! This question played on my mind throughout the film. As one would expect from a 'Star Wars' film there are plenty of exciting set pieces on a good variety of planets. The central cast are impressive; these include Felicity Jones, whose performance as Jyn I really enjoyed; Diego Luna who brings some believable ambiguity to the role of Cassian; and Alan Tudyk who provides the voice of K-2SO; one of the films best characters. The rest of the cast were pretty impressive too the only thing I was unsure about was the use of CGI to enable the late Peter Cushing to reappear as Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Carrie Fisher to appear as Princess Leia; the effects were pretty good but there was something of the 'uncanny valley' about them. There are plenty of enjoyably nods to the previous films; most notably some brief appearances from familiar characters; I also liked the nod to 'Zatoichi the blind swordsman' in the form of a blind Jedi played by Donnie Yen. I know that not everybody will like this but I really enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to any 'Star Wars' fan.",10,6,11,10 April 2017
Coraline," Brilliant animation
","Having seen 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' many times and loving every minute of it I was keen to see Henry Selick's latest stop-go animation story. When I learnt that the film was based on a book by Neil Gaiman I was even more certain that I would enjoy it. When I watched 'Coraline' I was not disappointed in the slightest. I hadn't seen a 3D film since the awful Jaws 3D so wasn't sure how the 3D would work here, thankfully it felt immersive rather than just having the occasional item appear to jump out the screen. Watching on DVD meant wearing red/green glasses which obviously had an effect on the colour of the film, while many colours appeared washed out others appeared much more intense such as Coraline's blue hair and yellow coat. Thankfully this just had the effect of making the film slightly more creepy.The heroine of this film is the eponymous Coraline, her family have moved from Michigan to rural Oregon. She is bored there and her parents are too busy to do anything with her. While exploring the old house they have moved into she finds a small door; at first it is bricked up but later as she is asleep it opens, she wakes up and follows a mouse through the door. When she get to the other side she finds herself in what appears to me her own house but it isn't quite the same, everything is slightly better. When she goes downstairs she finds her mother cooking, at least she thinks it is her mother till she turns around and reveals that instead of eyes she has two black buttons. After initial concern she begins to love the new world and is tempted to stay until she learns what the price of staying is... to have her eyes replaced with buttons. Things then get creepier as her 'other mother' is determined that Coraline will stay.As one would expect from the creator of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' the animation is fantastic, be warned though this is a much darker story which parents might want to watch before letting younger children view it, while many children will delight in its creepiness others might have nightmares. The voice cast did a fine job notably Dakota Fanning as Coraline, Teri Hatcher as her mother and French and Saunders as the two ex-burlesque dancers who live downstairs. I certainly recommend this film for adults and most children, just remember it might be a bit scary for very young or timid children.",10,0,2,15 October 2009
Iron Man 2," Superhero sequel with plenty of laughs and thrills
","At the end of the first 'Iron Man' film Tony Stark announced to the world that he was Iron Man; I assumed that this would quickly be explained as a joke and he'd do back to being a standard superhero whose true identity is unknown I was wrong; this superhero wants the world to know who he is and he wants to enjoy his celebrity status. Not everything is going well for Tony though; the senate wants him to hand over his suit to the military and to make matters worse he is slowly dying. Tony is convinced that nobody else is close to developing a suit like his until one day he is attacked by Ivan Venko; a Russian with a grudge against the Stark family. Venko ends up working for a rival arms manufacturer, Justin Hammer, and Tony is approached by a shadowy individual who claims that there is a cure for Tony's condition but only Tony can find it. While Tony sets about finding that cure Hammer is creating a drone army, which ultimately Tony must confront.This was a fun sequel that sets things up nicely for a future superhero franchise; 'The Avengers'. There was lots of explosive action and some delightfully over the top acting from Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and a far more restrained performance as Pepper Potts, his erstwhile assistant now CEO of Stark Industries. Mickey Rourke was suitably menacing as Venko and Don Cheadle was good as Stark's friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Of the new characters the biggest surprise came from Scarlett Johansson who appeared to be a straight-laced lawyer but soon proved to be a martial arts expert who may be a superhero herself! Like the vast majority of modern action films this was full of CGI and special effects; thankfully they were well done and the CGI looked believable even when we were being shown the impossible. Overall this was a lot of fun and it is suitable for adults and older children alike.",8,1,3,9 May 2011
Alien: Resurrection," An interesting end to Ripley's story.
","Having seen Alien³ I was surprised when I heard that a fourth film was to be made and that Sigourney Weaver would still be acting in it. In the opening minutes we learn that the Ripley we see in this film is a clone of the original, not only has she been cloned but so has the alien queen that was in her. The military remove the queen before it bursts from Ripley's chest.Shortly afterwards a small cargo ship docks and its crew of smugglers unload an unusual cargo; twelve people in their cryogenic sleep tubes, it turns out these people are to be hosts to the next generation of aliens. One of the smugglers, an young engineer named Call, played by Winona Ryder, has an ulterior motive for being there; she has learnt of the military plans and had intended to kill Ripley before the queen could hatch. While the military are trying to apprehend the smugglers for Call's actions the Aliens escape from they holding cell and the alarm sounds ordering the evacuation of the ship... of course that doesn't go quite as well as it might as Ripley and the smugglers struggle past numerous aliens as well as encountering an entirely new type of alien that was live-born rather than needing a host.This film is probably the lightest in tone of the four films, the smugglers are a varied group who are likable and quite funny, especially Ron Perlman's character. Another surprise is that more characters than usual survive... I won't spoil it by saying which ones though.I found the story to be well written by Joss Whedon and the acting and direction was good too, I particularly liked Winina Ryder as Call. While it isn't the best film in the series I'd certainly advise those who liked the previous films to give it a go.",8,3,4,30 August 2008
World War Z," Brad Pitt races to find a way of saving humanity from zombie hordes
","When an infection sweeps the world turning ever increasing numbers into mindless zombies, former UN investigator Gerry Lane's first priority is to get his wife and daughters to safety. When his former boss calls he realises that the only way to guarantee their immediate safety is to return to his old job as is promised that his family will be kept safe on a ship far from danger. After a struggle against the zombies they get to a helicopter and fly to the ship. Once there Gerry learns that the disease came to the United States from a base in South Korea. He flies there with a disease expert hoping to find the first case. Once there things don't go well; the doctor is killed and it becomes apparent that there is no way of finding the first case. He does however hear that Israel has managed to stay disease free as they built a massive wall shortly before the zombie pandemic swept the world. Gerry gets back in the plane and continues to Jerusalem only to find its defences are breached shortly after he arrives. He does however notice that the zombies ignore a handful of people; this leads him to come up with a plan to save humanity; it won't be easy though and if he isn't careful his cure could be just as fatal.People expecting a full on horror movie may be disappointed as it lacks the gore most zombie movies feature; it does however manage to keep tension high from the opening scenes to the films conclusion. The fast moving hordes of zombies are pretty scary as they flood through the streets like a pyroclastic flow. The story is a bit episodic as Gerry moves from Philadelphia to New Jersey to the ship to South Korea to Israel and finally to Wales but that isn't a problem; each location presents different problems for him to overcome. There are some moments that are a little bit too unlikely, even in the context of a zombie apocalypse, most notably when Gerry and a young soldier he saved in Israel are the sole survivors of a plane crash! The cast does a solid enough job; Brad Pitt in particular in the role of Gerry Lane. The film's end is merely the 'beginning of the end' and a sequel is inevitably in production. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting an intense but not particularly gory time.",8,1,1,22 June 2016
Passengers," Superior sci-fi
","The star-ship Avalon has a crew of two hundred and fifty eight along with five thousand passengers; all of them asleep. They are thirty years into a hundred and twenty year journey to the colony world; Homestead II. Then something goes wrong; a meteor strikes the ship leading to a malfunction in one of the sleeping pods; passenger Jim Preston is awakened and finds himself on an empty ship. At first he thinks the journey is almost over then he learns the terrible truth; he will die of old age long before the Avalon reaches its destination. Inevitably the loneliness gets to him and he starts contemplating waking another passenger; eventually he wakes Aurora Lane but doesn't tell her that that he is responsible for putting her in that position. He is concerned what might happen if she were to find out; that isn't the only thing to worry about though.I really enjoyed this sci-fi drama; it started well as it introduced us to Jim and his situation. This wasn't rushed so the viewer can feel his growing desperation and be more sympathetic when he makes the morally questionably choice of waking Aurora. Similarly their growing relationship isn't too rushed. Towards the end the tension rises as it is far from clear if both of our protagonists will survive the growing technical threat. These two lead characters are believable and well-acted by Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. I also enjoyed Michael Sheen's performance as the ship's android barman, a delightful nod to the bar in 'The Shining'. The ship's design is impressive and the special effects are superlative. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of character led science fiction without aliens or antagonists.",9,1,3,6 December 2018
The Hunger Games," A great dystopian adventure
","Some time in the future in what was once America there has been an uprising; it was put down and now each year each of the twelve outlying districts must send two young people; one boy, one girl, to participate in the Hunger Games: here they must compete until only one is left alive. This year young Primrose Everdeen is selected in the ballot to represent District 12. She has little chance so her elder sister Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is skilled with a bow but the odds will still be stacked against her as some districts train people all of their lives for the games. Once selected, she is taken to the Capitol, along with Peeta Mellark the boy who will represent their district. Here they meet the other competitors and work to attract the sponsors who will be vital if one of them is to win. Once the games begin it is everybody for themselves although temporary alliances may form everybody knows only one of them can ultimately survive.Watching this film I couldn't help but be struck by the number of elements that reminded me of other films; teenagers fighting to the death, 'Battle Royale'; slightly sleazy TV presenter, 'The Running Man' and the leader worried about a contestant becoming too popular, 'Rollerball' to name just three this doesn't mean I thought this was derivative though and it certainly wasn't just 'Battle Royale for Tweenies' as I'd heard some people suggest. The games don't actually start till the film is approaching its midpoint; this means the first half is spent effectively introducing the main characters and the world they live in. Jennifer Lawrence is the undisputed star of the film doing a brilliant job as Katniss; she made the character believable with enough vulnerability for us to worry about her even though it was highly unlikely that she'd be killed she is the heroine after all! Josh Hutcherson did a good enough job as Peeta although his character was obviously less interesting. There were also a few well known names amongst the supporting cast; Woody Harrelson put in a fun turn as their mentor, former District 2 winner, Haymitch Abernathy and Donald Sutherland was suitably sinister as President Snow. Shot in a stunning woodland setting the games are filmed in a way that makes the viewer feel part of the action in a way that was surprisingly tense for a twelve certificate film starring a young cast. I would certainly recommend this for others but think parents might want to watch it first as it might be too frightening for some children even those officially old enough to see it!",10,7,17,27 October 2012
Zootopia," Zootropolis
","This Disney animation, retitled 'Zootropolis' in Europe, is set in a world without people; instead it appears that all other mammals have evolved to live like people... and not eat each other. Our protagonist is Judy Hopp, a rabbit who has always dreamt of becoming a police officer despite the fact that a rabbit has never been in the police. She exceeds expectations and becomes the first rabbit to serve in the Zootropolis Police Department. She is disappointed to be given traffic duties rather than 'proper' police-work but then an otter comes to the station saying her husband is missing. Her boss isn't interested but she insists on taking the case... he says she can do it but if she doesn't solve it in forty eight hours she will have to quit. With no access to police resources she has only one lead. This takes her to Nick Wilde; a fox who is quick to work a scam... after a little blackmail he ends up her unlikely partner and the two learn that there is a darker truth behind the disappearance; a truth that could end the peaceful coexistence of predator and prey species in Zootropolis.This film was a lot of fun... far more so than I expected. It starts well with a play featuring a young Judy which explains how predators and prey used to interact in this world but now live in peace. We then see that not all live up to the ideal. After this prologue the story proper gets started; this nicely spoofs cop-shows before the mystery gets started. This proves to be a surprisingly good mystery which is likely to keep viewers, young and old alike, guessing. There are moments that could scare younger viewers but these rarely last too long and ultimately things are resolved in a way that shouldn't leave youngsters worried. Most of the funny moments are aimed at all ages but there are some references to things children probably won't have seen such as 'The Godfather' and Breaking Bad'. As one might expect from Disney the animation is of a very high standard and the voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say this was a really fun film that can be enjoyed by all ages with the possible exception of very young children... if the opening scene doesn't bother them they should be okay.",9,3,4,10 October 2018
12 Monkeys," A fine time-travel movie
","In the not too distant future, in a world that has been decimated by a plague, James Cole's dreams are haunted by a childhood memory. In this memory he is at an airport and he sees a man gunned down while a woman looks on in anguish. Cole is volunteered for a special mission to find the source of the plague; most notably what it has to do with the 'Army of the Twelve Monkeys'. This mission involves being sent back in time to 1996 at least that is the idea; in fact he ends up in 1990 and is promptly certified insane! Here he meets psychiatrist Kathryn Railly and fellow patient Jeffrey Goines and has a profound effect on each of them before he vanishes from a locked room. The next time Kathryn sees him is when he kidnaps her in 1996 and demands that she take him to Philadelphia; he is raving like a madman but eventually she starts to believe him but if what he says is really true most of humanity will be dead soon.This is one of the best time travel films; Terry Gilliam's way of showing us the story makes us wonder if the protagonist might be insane even though we've seen that what he claims is true. Bruce Willis does a fine job as Cole; a man on a mission who is also forced to question his own sanity. Madeleine Stowe puts is a solid performance as Railly and Brad Pitt is great as the obviously crazy Goines. There is a good sense of danger and not just to the Protagonists; it is clear that Cole is dangerous to those around him. Some films are best just watched once but this stands up to repeat viewings; indeed knowing the ending will help you see new details when you watch it again. While the ending isn't exactly a surprise it still has an emotional impact. Overall this fine film is well worth watching if you like sci-fi that is a little strange!",9,1,1,15 October 2014
Mississippi Burning," Hatred in the Deep South
","Inspired by real events this film opens with the murder of three civil rights activists, two white one black, in Mississippi in 1964. When they are reported missing two very different FBI agents are sent to investigate. Rupert Anderson, is a former Mississippi sheriff who doesn't always play by the rules and Alan Ward is a by-the-book high-flier but both are determined to bring those responsible to justice. They won't get much help locally; the police are indifferent at best, complicit at worst and nobody is going to talk because they know what will happen if they are even suspected of talking to the FBI. Soon Ward calls in more personnel and tensions rise even further as local racists try to intimidate the black population. It soon becomes obvious that if the FBI are to get anywhere they will have to break a few rules.Some may have problems by the fact that this is inspired by real murders but then gives a fictionalised investigation... that wasn't a problem for me though. The story presented shines a light on sinister events and attitudes that are far from being ancient history. The overt racism portrayed is disturbing; it isn't just the killers and Klansman who have such attitudes. While the identity of the killers isn't in doubt just how they will be brought to justice is. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as Agent Rupert Anderson; Willem Dafoe is solid as Agent Alan Ward and Frances McDormand impresses as Mrs Pell, wife of a deputy involved in the case. The rest of the cast impress too; they make some very unpleasant characters believable. Overall I'd definitely say this is worth watching; it has an important message but also proves to be a gripping thriller.",9,3,4,5 November 2018
The Impossible," One families struggle to survive the Boxing Day tsunami of 2006
",When a family go to Thailand for Christmas in 2006 they expect to have a relaxing time in a tropical paradise; they don't expect to get caught up in the worst natural disaster of modern times. When the tsunami hits mother Maria and eldest son Lucas are swept away and can only believe that father Henry and younger sons Thomas and Simon must have perished. The two of them struggle though the water and manage to get to safety although Maria is badly injured; even though they get to a hospital it is by no means certain that she will not die of her injuries. Meanwhile it becomes apparent that the rest of the family has survived and Henry is desperate to find his wife and son amongst the ruins.This isn't like most disaster films; mostly because it is based on real events but also because little time is wasted introducing the characters instead the disaster strikes in early on and the rest of the film follows their struggle to survive. The tsunami itself was shot in a way that made it look terrifying and there were many wince inducing moments were we see how Maria sustains her injuries. The sense of realism was increased by the lack of dramatic music during these scenes; we just hear the water and the screams of the survivors. I feared the tension would be lowered by knowing the outcome but it managed to be exciting though out. Stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor were great as Maria and Henry as was young Tom Holland who had a substantial role as Lucas.There are some pleasantly uplifting moments when we see families reunited but the film doesn't shy away from showing the impact of the tragedy as we see many bodies as they travel through the country and search for each other. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching although it is quite gruelling at times so probably isn't suitable for younger viewers.,8,2,5,26 July 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Plenty of laughs and a fair amount of gore
","Having enjoyed the television series 'Spaced' I was keen to see this film as it features many of the same creators. Here Simon Pegg plays the eponymous Shaun, a salesman in a dead end job who lives with his best mate Ed who just lazes around playing video games all day before spending the evenings down the pub with Shaun, Shaun's girlfriend Liz and her friends Dianne and David. His life is so mundane that he doesn't notice that the streets are slowly filling with the walking dead. When he finally does notice he decides that he and Ed must go and rescue his mother and his now ex-girlfriend and seek sanctuary in The Winchester. Things are complicated by the fact that his step father has been bitten and the area around the pub is crawling with the living dead! While this is primarily a comedy there should be enough gore to please horror fans; in fact I suspect they will enjoy the comedy more too as they will spot references that those not familiar with the classics of the zombie genre, like me, will miss. The story is pretty basic but that doesn't matter; extra subplots would just have been a distraction. The acting was pretty solid; Simon Pegg was ideal as Shaun and Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy were great as his mother and step father; both providing some surprisingly emotional scenes for a film of this type. There is a fair amount of gore; once or twice things get extremely gory however it isn't really dwelt on too much. Fans of 'Spaced' will be pleased to see Jessica Hynes even though her role is much smaller here. If you are in the mood for a horror film but also want a good laugh then this could be just the film you are looking for.",8,0,2,16 February 2012
Argo," Escaping from a revolution
","When the American embassy in Tehran is overrun shortly after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 six US diplomats manage to slip away and take refuge in the Canadian ambassador's house. The Iranians don't initially know that anybody is missing but it is only a matter of time before they can reassemble the shredded documents and learn what has happened and ultimately who is missing. Back at the CIA they are trying to find a way to get them out but all the ideas they come up with are deeply flawed. Then Tony Mendez; a specialist in extracting people comes up with an audacious plan that is so crazy it might just work he will fly in and join up with then then they will all fly out again posing as a Canadian film crew that had been location scouting for the Sci-fi film 'Argo'. The CIA knows that the Iranians aren't idiots; they will have to make it look real and that means getting Hollywood producers on board and getting the sort of publicity that a real film would have. With this in place Tony just has to fly to Iran and hope the six diplomats can bluff their way past the crowds of American-hating Iranians and the Revolutionary Guards.Stories based on fact have one big advantage over entirely fictional thrillers they can do things that would appear unbelievable in a work of fiction because they actually happened; escaping from revolutionary Iran while pretending to be making a Star Wars rip-off is certainly pretty unbelievable! Director Ben Affleck did a fine job capturing the feel of 1979; the film even looks like films of that era, He also does a great job acting as protagonist Tony Mendez. The rest of the cast, including the likes of Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman also perform well; I especially enjoyed the latter two who provided some nice laughs which lightened the mood nicely at times. Even though most viewers will know the mission was successful there are quite a few surprisingly tense moments; especially towards the end. There are inevitably some factual inaccuracies although I think they can be forgiven as the story works well and trying to make it entirely accurate would have served to lower the tension without necessarily adding to the story.",9,2,4,18 September 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," The return of Khan
","This, the second of JJ Abrams reboot of the franchise, opens with Kirk breaking the Prime Directive in order to save Spock; this leads to him being relieved of his command and Spock being transferred to another ship inevitably events soon prevents this from happening. John Harrison; a renegade Star Fleet operative attacks a Star Fleet facility in London then attacks senior members at Star Fleet headquarters before teleporting to Kronos; the Klingon homeward. Admiral Marcus orders Kirk to take the Enterprise to Kronos and kill Harrison using new undetectable missiles. Scotty objects to having the missiles on board and resigns and Spock questions the order to kill Harrison; a clear breach of Federation law. Kirk ultimately decides to ignore Marcus's order and captures Harrison alive; at this point he learns that Harrison is not who he had been told he is the genetically engineered psychopath Khan! He also learns that Marcus has his own agenda; he wants to militarise Star Fleet and is willing to destroy the Enterprise as part of that plan.This is an impressive film that has plenty of details that should please fans of the original series without distracting from the story for people new to the franchise. The appearance of Khan is the most obvious of course but there are also passing mentions of tribbles, Mudd, Gorn and no doubt some that I missed! The story is impressive and as well as a good plot we get plenty of action. This action is both exciting and varied. The story builds up to a conclusion that nicely mirrors that in 'The Wrath of Khan' without being an exact copy. As one would expect from a Star Trek film the characters and their interactions are at the core of the story; the main cast has a great chemistry making us believe that their characters are real people who have been working together for a while. Benedict Cumberbatch does a fine job as Khan; quietly menacing but not to such a degree that he is obviously evil. Peter Weller is also impressive as the imposing Admiral Marcus. Overall an impressive film that should satisfy both fans of the original and those who joined the franchise in the JJ Abrams era.",9,2,7,26 July 2016
Stripes," A bit too silly at times but plenty of laughs make this military comedy worth watching
","John Winger's life is not going to plan; he quits his job, his car is repossessed, his girlfriend has left him and he is about to lose his apartment it is time for something different so he persuades his friend Russell Ziskey that what they need to do is enlist in the US Army. They find themselves in a platoon of similar misfits under the instruction of Sgt Hulka commanded by Capt. Stillman. Hulka is unimpressed by his platoon; especially Winger whose attitude is not what the military expects. Somehow they manage to pass basic training and the platoon is posted to Italy where they are to be the first troops to use the Army's latest vehicle an armed and armoured RV! While there Winger and Ziskey decide to take the vehicle to see their girlfriends, a pair of female MPs, in West Germany. Stillman thinks they must be working for the Russians and takes the rest of the platoon to find them; unfortunately a map reading error takes them into Czechoslovakia it will be up to Winger, Ziskey and their girlfriends to rescue them; preferably without starting a war in the process.This film is pretty funny most of the time even if it does get a bit too silly at times. If one hopes for a vaguely believable story you will be disappointed; just about everything is played for laughs and with the exception of Sgt Hulka it is hard to believe that any of the characters would progress as far as they have in the Army; the recruits don't get moulded into believable soldiers; Capt. Stillman is clearly incompetent from the start and it is unlikely that the two female MPs would keep getting Winger and Ziskey out of trouble this isn't really a problem though because they more than enough laughs. Bill Murray and Harold Ramis are on good form as Winger and Ziskey and Warren Oates impresses as Sgt Hulka. The rest of the cast, which includes quite a familiar faces, is pretty solid too. The story has the sort of gags that would probably appeal to all ages but some swearing and gratuitous nudity mean it is only really suitable for older viewers. Overall I found this to be good silly fun, not a must see but worth watching if you are a fan of Bill Murray.These comments are based on watching the 'Extended Cut' version of the film.",7,0,0,15 December 2016
12 Angry Men," One of the greats
","As the film opens we see the inside of a court room; the evidence has already been put to the jurors and the judge is reminding them of their solemn duty... the twelve of them must reach a unanimous verdict and a guilty verdict will mean an automatic death sentence for the accused. The way the jurors talk as they enter the jury room it sounds like an open and shut case; they call for a quick vote before any discussions take place; eleven men say he is guilty, but one dissents. Juror Eight explains that he doesn't necessarily believe that the accused, an eighteen year old slum boy, is innocent but he won't allow him to be executed without the jurors even discussing the evidence. On the face of it the evidence is compelling; the accused bought a knife just like the murder weapon a couple of weeks previously, the woman across the railway line says she looked out of the window and saw the killing, the man below says he heard the accused shout 'I'm going to kill you' before hearing the body fall and seeing the accused leave the building. Gradually they look at each piece of evidence in turn and as doubts are raised the number of 'not guilties' increases but some jurors are adamant that they just know he did it; to get an acquittal prejudices must be overcome too.Set almost entirely within the confines of the jury room this film is rightfully considered a classic; it may not contain any action but it is taut from start to finish. The fact that we haven't seen any of the trial means the viewer must rely on what the jurors say to decide whether or not they think the accused is guilty and for the whole time they are deliberating we don't even know their names. The cast of twelve do a great job playing each of the very different characters; obviously Henry Fonda stands out as he is the best known actor and plays the man arguing against the majority but each of the others also put in fine performances; especially Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley who play the two jurors most determined to bring in a guilty verdict. The way some of the evidence is questioned in the jury room in a way that it was never questioned in court may be a little unlikely... especially the incident with the second knife but it isn't too far fetched and that particular moment is a brilliant piece of theatre that anybody who watches the film will remember for years afterwards. This is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.",10,2,3,18 December 2012
Public Enemies," Johnny Depp plays Public Enemy Number One: John Dillinger
","Set in the days of the Great Depression this film follows the actions of notorious bank robber John Dillinger and the hunt for him which led to the creation of the FBI. We are introduced to Dillinger as he goes back to prison to break out his associates. He is declared Public Enemy Number One by Hoover's Bureau of Investigation but that doesn't mean he plans to lie low; instead he sets about hitting a string of banks. The more he gets away with it the more desperate the investigators, led by Special Agent Melvin Purvis, become. Dillinger forms a relationship with Billie Frechette and the Bureau think his love for her will provide them with the opportunity to catch him. He is eventually caught but that isn't the end of him as he escapes from prison and once again robbing banks across the country it is only a matter of time before the Feds catch up with him and criminals like him.While the film is based on real people and many real events some liberties have been taken with other details; several people who we see killed before Dillinger actually died in different events after Dillinger's death; that doesn't detract too much from the film though. Johnny Depp puts in a solid performance as Dillinger making him a likable character despite his crimes something that seem suitable given the real Dillinger's folk hero status at the time. Christian Bale is also good in the supporting role of Purvis and Marion Cotillard is likable as Billie Frechette. Michael Mann does a good job directing; keeping things more matter of fact than his more obviously stylish early works. The frequent action is tense and brutal rather than overly exciting. Overall an entertaining film that is well worth watching; it is fairly inevitably violent but there is little else to offend.",8,0,0,30 September 2014
The Babadook," A superior chiller from Down Under
","This Australian chiller follows single mother Amelia and her troubled six year old son Samuel. She hasn't got over the loss of her husband, who was killed in a car crash as he drove her to hospital on the day of Samuel's birth, and he believes that there are monsters in the house and has even gone as far as making weapons to fight them off. His behaviour affects his relationships with other children and ultimately his mother removes him from his school. Each might she reads him a story, one day he hands her a book she hasn't seen before; 'Mister Babadook'. The story is distinctly creepy and Samuel is screaming before the end. Soon he is convinced that The Babadook is real and becomes more troubled; a doctor suggests he sees a psychiatrist and proscribes some pills to help him sleep. Amelia however can't sleep; she gets more and more exhausted and starts to see things things that may or may not be there. She tears up the book and throws it away only for it to be returned; glued back together and disturbingly there is more to the story and ending that gradually starts to come true for her.This is a superior chiller; eschewing the jump-scares, gore and other excesses of most horror films it works by having an oppressive atmosphere and a protagonist whose exhaustion is almost contagious. Essie Davis does a great job as Amelia as the character gradually changes from a concerned mother at the end of her tether to an exhausted woman to a potential threat to her child. Noah Wiseman is also impressive as young Samuel; a distinctly creepy child. What special effects there are are distinctly old-school; shaking beds and objects moving about. While it is quite different I couldn't help being reminded of 'The Exorcist' times although here it is the mother who seems to be effected and the possible possession is far less obvious. Writer/director Jennifer Kent does a fine job gradually increasing the tension till things are distinctly creepy. There aren't many scenes that are scary in themselves but the creepiness was enough to give me goose bumps. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for a good chiller.",9,4,6,13 October 2016
Madagascar," Fun enough but not a classic
","This Dreamworks animation isn't a classic of the type their rivals at Pixar seem to churn out however it is entertaining enough and I'm sure children will have a good laugh even if many of the film references will pass them by. The film follows the adventures of four animals from Central Park Zoo; Marty, the zebra, Alex the Lion, Gloria the hippo and Melman the hypochondriac giraffe. As Marty celebrates his tenth birthday he starts to wonder what life in the wild would be like so one day he escapes from the zoo with the intention of going to Connecticut, which has heard is 'the wild'. Upon realising he is gone his three friends leave the zoo with the intention of bringing him back but when they are caught in Grand Central station people assume they all left because they felt they didn't belong in a zoo; in order to give them the freedom it is thought they desire the animals are all put on a ship to Kenya. They don't end up there though as a group of penguins hijack the ship to go to Antarctica; during the hijack our protagonists get washed overboard and find themselves on the island of Madagascar. Here they learn what the wild really means; especially Alex who starts seeing the other animals as tender steaks as he gets hungry. Terrified he might kill one of his friends he heads over to another part of the island... he never wonders where the tender steaks he ate at the zoo came from though! On the island they get to know the native lemurs and come across the lemurs' enemy; the carnivorous fossa.While I didn't think this was a classic it passed the time well enough and had some funny moments; although unfortunately the best laughs weren't provided by the protagonists but by two chimpanzees and a group of penguins. The story didn't have the depth one finds in Pixar's films but it does have more gags which should keep the children laughing; there are also a few references to classic films for the older viewer to enjoy. For the most part the jokes are of the type one would expect in a film aimed at children however some parents might not appreciate a reference to a rectal thermometer or jokes about 'throwing poo'. Over all I'd say this is a fun film that doesn't outstay its welcome but isn't really a must see.",7,0,0,16 May 2012
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Very funny... Very crude
","First off I must warn anybody thinking of watching this film, it contains quite a lot of material that many people would find offensive... that said if you aren't offended you will probably be in hysterics as it is very funny. If you are familiar with the television series you will be familiar with the crude style of the animation, although if you have only seen the later episodes this may seem cruder.The film starts with the four boys going to the cinema to watch the 'Terrance and Philip' movie, an R-rated film from Canada. Unlike their television programme their film is full of swearing and when the boys come out they are all swearing like troopers. Soon all the children in South Park seem to have seen it and are swearing in class. When their mother's are told Kyle's mother decides that something must be done and that something is to arrest Terrance and Philip and begin hostilities against Canada. While this is going on Kenny has more serious problems; after copying a stunt from the film he dies and ends up in Hell where he learns that if the US goes ahead with its plans to execute Terrance and Philip Satan and his gay lover, Saddam Hussein, will take over the world.Unlike the television series this film is a musical; the songs are actually rather good, not just the comedy lyrics, they have good tunes too. The comedy isn't only crude it is also a fairly biting satire about censorship in the US where a few naughty words are considered more offensive than acts of violence. I'd recommend this film to any adult who isn't easily offended and likes a good laugh, just don't assume that because it is animated it must be suitable for children; Disney this is not.",9,2,2,31 July 2009
Elizabeth," The early years of Queen Elizabeth I
","This film tells the story of Queen Elizabeth I's ascension to the throne and the beginning of her reign as she learns what it means to be queen as rivals manoeuvre around her. As the film starts Elizabeth's older sister, the Catholic Mary I, is on the throne and her ministers are counselling her to execute the Protestant Elizabeth to prevent her from becoming queen and England becoming protestant again. Mary dies before producing an heir and Elizabeth becomes Queen. Once on the throne she learns the England is in a very weak; the army is run down, the treasury is empty and French troops are garrisoned in Scotland. It is suggested that she forms an alliance with either France or Spain by marrying either the Spanish king or a French duke; neither option appeals to her as she is clearly keen on Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. It isn't long before her various enemies, backed by the Vatican, are moving against her; if she is to survive she will have to strike back.Cate Blanchett carries the film as the young Elizabeth making us believe in this woman leading in a very male world. She is ably supported by the likes of Christopher Eccleston, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough and even French footballer Eric Cantona! Even minor roles are filled by fairly familiar faces. All the court intrigue and plotting is like something out of 'Game of Thrones' but with somewhat less sex and violence at least on screen. Even though we know Elizabeth will survive there are plenty of tense moments and other characters are far from safe. It isn't all plotting though; there are plenty of funny moments such as when Elizabeth discovers one of her suitors wearing a dress! Director Shekhar Kapur has given the film a great look with lots of impressive colours, especially in the many court scenes. Overall I'd highly recommend this film; you don't have to be interested in the history of the time to enjoy this.",8,0,0,30 September 2016
Oldboy," A Classic Revenge Thriller
","Oldboy was my introduction to Korean cinema, and what an introduction it was. Initially it seems to make little sense the first thing we see is a man with a dog leaning backwards over the edge of a tall building and another man is holding onto his tie which prevents him from falling, this man says he has a story to tell. Then the story begins with the man, Oh Dae-Su, drunk in a police station, a friend collects him but while his friend is making a call in a public phone box he vanishes. The next time we see him he is imprisoned in a room never seeing his captor who feeds him through a hatch in the door and gasses him anytime something needs doing in the room. He learns from the television that his wife has been murdered and that evidence at the scene suggests that he is the killer even though he has been in his room for a year at this point.As the years pass Oh Dae-Su plans his revenge while trying to escape but shortly before he manages to break out he is gassed again and wakes up outside on the roof of the tall building where he meets the man with the dog. After letting his story he leaves the man who then jumps but Oh Dae-Su does not look back. While looking at the fish in a restaurant window a stranger gives him a wallet and a phone. He goes inside and after eating a live octopus receives a call during which he passes out. When he wakes up he discovers that the girl who served him in the restaurant has taken him home. Although he initially doesn't trust her they soon falls in love. Shortly after this he is told he has five days to discover why he was kidnapped or the girl will be killed. He only has a few clues as to his captor but as he follows them and gets closer his life gets more confusing till eventually he realises what he did to earn such a terrible punishment.The action is exciting and and a few places fairly gruelling such as when he uses a claw hammer for tooth extraction although some people might find the octopus eating more disturbing. Min-sik Choi did a great job as Oh Dae-Su and Chan-wook Park's direction was top notch. Although an English dub was available on the DVD I watched it in Korean with English subtitles.",9,6,15,11 February 2009
The Fifth Element," A great sci-fi action comedy
","While this film isn't a master piece it is very entertaining it never takes itself too seriously nor goes it go in for lame jokes or slap stick, the humour comes from the characters and the situations they find themselves in. There is a degree of campness but what would you expect in a film where Jean-Paul Gaultier designed the costumes.In the prologue, set in 1914, we learn that there is a weapon which is used to protect the Earth from an evil which attacks every five thousand years, when its existence is discovered it is taken away by an alien race for safe keeping, they promise that it will be returned when it is needed. The rest of the film takes place three hundred years later when the evil returns. As promised the aliens return the five elements that make up the weapon, unfortunately they are shot down en route and all that remains are a few cells from the fifth element; a perfect being. Luckily in the future these few cells are enough to recreate the being who turns out to be Leeloo, a red haired girl played by Milla Jovovich. She escapes from the lab and leaps from the skyscraper it is housed in; landing in a taxi driven by Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). The other four elements, four stone objects, are still missing and are being sought be a priest (Ian Holm) and the evil Zorg (Gary Oldman). The stones are being delivered by another person who will hand them over on another planet in a luxury hotel in orbit. Korbin and Leeloo go there after winning a rigged competition where unfortunately for Korbin he has to hang around with radio personality Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) as part of his 'prize'.The film is very stylish and has plenty of action and funny moments, when I first watched it I wasn't impressed with Chris Tucker's character but on later viewing grew to find him quite funny. Gary Oldman was entertainingly over the top as the pantomime villain the other main characters were well played too. It is nice also to see non-CGI monsters that still look good.If you enjoy science fiction and want to watch some thing that isn't too serious this will is worth watching.",8,0,1,4 September 2008
Black Book," Black Book
","This Dutch wartime thriller opens in Israel in 1956 when a Dutch woman recognises woman teaching at a kibbutz; it turns out they knew each other during the war. We then see what the latter woman did during the war as the action switched to German occupied Netherlands in 1944. The woman is Rachel Stein, a Jewish singer, who is hiding with a Christian family. When that home is destroyed she seeks out a family friend who has contacts that can get her out of the country. She is passed on to a member of the resistance then meets up with a group of refugees, including her parents and brother. The boat they are travelling on is ambushed by the Germans and Rachel is the sole survivor.She manages to contact the resistance and after an accidental meeting with a local German commander, Ludwig Müntze, she is told to get close to him to help gain useful information. She soon learns that the man responsible for the death of her family, SS Officer Günther Franken, is working in the same headquarters as Müntze. After planting a microphone in his office the identity of the man who betrayed the refugees is found and the resistance must decide what to do next as striking against any friend of the Nazis can expect repercussions. That isn't Rachel's only worry; she is developing feelings for Müntze. Even after the war is over the troubles haven't finished as those who worked with the Germans will do anything to protect themselves and anybody even suspected of collaboration won't get a fair hearing from the mob that quickly forms.Writer/director Paul Verhoeven may be better known for over-the-top violent action films like 'RoboCop' and 'Total Recall' but here he shows that he is more than capable of making something more serious. That isn't to say there is no violence; there is quite a bit but it isn't gratuitous instead it feels real rather than exciting. The story isn't simply the heroic resistance versus the evil Nazis and collaborators... Müntze spares Rachel even though he realises she is Jewish and refuses orders to execute prisoners and we see resistance members showing anti-Semitic views and quickly turning on each other when it becomes apparent that somebody betrayed them... the identity of the traitors provides a good mystery. There is a good level of tension throughout the film and it is hard not to fear for Rachel's safety even though we know from the start that she survives the war. The cast does a really fine job; most notably Carice van Houten who does a great job as protagonist Rachel and Sebastian Koch as Müntze. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a war film that is more morally ambiguous than most.",9,0,0,11 May 2018
Batman Returns," Batman comes up against the diabolical Penguin and a slinky, kinky Cat Woman
","Thirty Three years ago the deformed baby, later identified as Oswald Cobblepot, was thrown into a stream and floated into the sewers. Here he was raised by penguins and now as an adult he wants to return and find out who he really is. Meanwhile businessman Max Shreck is pressuring the mayor to allow him to build a new power plant for Gotham. Shreck is due to turn on the city's Christmas lights but the ceremony is interrupted by a nightmarish group of clowns and acrobats and Shreck is captured by their leader; Cobblepot, who is now known as The Penguin. He knows Shreck's dark secrets and blackmails him into helping him become a respected citizen. He isn't the only person to learn Shreck's secret; his timid secretary learns one too but he pushes her through a window. She doesn't die but she is changed less timid and somewhat demented she makes herself a masked costume and becomes the Cat Woman. Of course it will be up to Batman to deal with these threats and ultimately make an unlikely alliance to save Gotham.The previous film in the franchise may have been dark compared to the '60s TV series but it still had a fair degree of camp this is much darker and to my mind better. Danny DeVito's Penguin is a vile creature; physically repulsive but also bitter and rather perverse. Christopher Walken is suitably wicked as Shreck as he manages to stay just the right side of becoming a pantomime villain. Michelle Pfeiffer is suitably sexy and confident as Cat Woman in a delightfully kinky costume as well as being believable as the timid Selina. Michael Keaton is also impressive as he returns in the role of Batman. The story itself is decent although it mainly serves to deliver a variety of enjoyable set-pieces where the bad guys to bad things and Batman tries to stop then. The dark tone and general nastiness of some of the characters means it won't be suitable for younger viewers but I'd still recommend it to older Batman fans.",9,3,9,2 April 2017
Finding Nemo," An early classic from Pixar
","Marlin in a timid clown fish living with his son Nemo in an anemone on the Great Barrier Reef that is until Nemo is captured by a diver. Now Marlin must brave the dangers of the open ocean to find Nemo again. He is accompanied by a regal blue tang named Dory; Dory has a problem with her short term memory so quickly forgets everything. Together they find a mask lost by one of the divers and learn that they came from Sydney; on the way there they encounter sharks, an angler fish, jelly fish and a group of sea turtles. Meanwhile Nemo finds himself in the aquarium of a North Sydney dentist. Here he meets a variety of other fish and learns that the dentist intends to give him to his niece as a pet something that means almost certain death given how she treated the previous fish she was given.This, Pixar's fifth film, got off to a great start, it was darker than I expected but done in a way that shouldn't be too upsetting for even the youngest of viewers. Marlin's wife is killed by a barracuda and every egg except Nemo is lost but none of the details are shown. Once that is over it quickly moves on to introducing young Nemo then his capture by the diver that sets the story in motion. The parallel stories of Marlin, and his new friend Dory, searching for Nemo and Nemo's interaction with the other fish in the aquarium and their plans for his escape are nicely interwoven. Each has plenty of drama; none of it is too scary though and where there are scary moments they are lightened by some comedy such as the trio of sharks that are trying to stop eating fish. The characters may be fish but they still have plenty of personality; especially the central trio of Marlin, Dory and Nemo. Each of these is distinctive; Marlin is timid and pessimistic, Nemo is full of youthful enthusiasm and Dory is cheery despite her memory problems. The secondary characters are fun too; I particularly liked the 'surfer-dude' sea turtles! As one would expect from Pixar the animation is top notch, the undersea environment looks fantastic and the actors who provide the voices to the characters to an excellent job. Overall this is a fun film that, while aimed at a younger audience, can be enjoyed by all ages.",9,0,1,1 September 2016
Blade," Wesley Snipes the Vampire Slayer
","Vampires are living amongst us with the collaboration of those in power; they manage to keep a low profile though that is until upstart vampire, Deacon Frost, decides that the old order needs to be overthrown. Standing against the vampires is Blade, the 'Day Walker', a half vampire who has none of the usual vampire weaknesses and, with the help of a serum, can control his lust for blood. Other senior vampires look down on Frost because he was turned rather than born a vampire but unlike them he is interested in the past and has deciphered ancient text with tell how to summon the Blood God to do it he will require Blade's blood.Early on Blade rescues a doctor. Karen, who has been bitten and takes her back to his base where, with the help of his friend Whistler, they attempt to cure her. Once treated she tries to help him find a cure as well as working to make more effective weapons to battle the vampires. After many fights with Frost's underlings the final confrontation and the ceremony take place inevitably it will be fairly bloody.I haven't read any of the comics that inspired the film so can't say how close this is I can however say that this is an exciting take on vampire films. Gone are the usual crosses and holy water; instead we get swords and silver stakes and bullets. While there are plenty of horror elements it is effectively an action film with lots of shooting and martial arts action. Wesley Snipes is great in the title role as he makes the action look real rather than excessively choreographed. Stephen Dorff is menacing enough as bad guy Frost; it helps that the character is an intelligent villain rather than an obviously matched evil version of Blade. N'Bushe Wright is likable as Karen, Kris Kristofferson is solid enough as Whistler and Donal Logue provides some needed levity as a vampire who keeps getting an arm hacked off. The action scenes are pretty intense and at times quite bloody. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Snipes, vampire films or exciting action.",8,1,2,27 January 2017
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Enjoyable if slightly inferior X-Men Prequel
",Set before the original trilogy this film follows Logan and his brother Victor from their birth two hundred years ago up to the moment Logan's memory is eliminated. In the opening scenes we find the pair fighting in various wars from the American Civil War to Vietnam where Col. Stryker realises that there is something special about the pair. He sets up a unit of super-powered mutants in order to capture other mutants but before long Logan becomes disenchanted and leaves. He settles down in Canada but his brother comes looking for him and kills his girlfriend. Stryker offers to give Logan the means to kill Victor but after the process is complete Logan hears him give the order to erase his memory and escapes. The process replaced his skeleton with the almost indestructible metal adamantium so Logan is tougher than ever and determined to get his revenge against Victor and Stryker.Of all the mutants from the original X-Men films Wolverine was the obvious choice to make the main character in a prequel as we have learnt enough to know it should be interesting. Of course one problem with any film about a character's back story is that there is less sense of danger before it even begins we know that Logan will survive but loose his memory. That doesn't mean characters we haven't seen before will make it though. There is a decent amount of action though; much of it fairly physical due to the nature of the featured mutant's powers. Hugh Jackman does a fine job as Wolverine but while the rest of the cast aren't bad they don't stand out the way he does. Fans of the original films may be pleased to see another original character being introduced as well as a brief cameo from another. Overall I'd say that while this wasn't great it was better than I had expected; it is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the original films.,7,2,2,29 December 2013
Hot Fuzz," Funny and exciting police action!
","PC Nicolas Angel is the Met's most successful police officer so it isn't surprising that he gets a promotion; however he would rather that it didn't mean a transfer as well. His superiors and colleagues, worried that he is making them look bad, have him transferred to the Gloucestershire market town of Sandford; the town with the lowest reported crime rate in England. When he gets there he quickly learns that something isn't quite right; the pub is full of under-aged drinkers and the man he arrests for drunk driving turns out to be his new partner PC Danny Butterman. Most of his fellow officers resent having somebody sent in from London as they think he will just try to show them how to do their jobs and Danny just wants to know what sort of action Nick has seen. He hasn't been there long when two people are found decapitated on the road into town; everybody seems to think it is a tragic accident but Sgt. Angel isn't so sure; as further 'accidents' occur he becomes convinced that there is a murderer on the loose... is he just paranoid or is there something rotten in this sleepy market town?Having enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead' I was keen to see what Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright would come up with next... while I don't think this is quite as good it still has plenty of laughs; including some genuine laugh out loud moments; who couldn't laugh at the sight of a shotgun wielding granny being kicked in the face?! The story nicely combines the typical English country mystery anybody who watches 'Midsomer Murders' will be used to with the action of an American action cop movie; spoofing both genres as it does so. The action is deliberately over the top as it references a variety of well known films; if you don't get all the references it doesn't matter as most of the scenes are funny anyway. The cast does a fine job and is packed with well known British actors including Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton; the latter is particularly entertaining as the slimy supermarket manager Angel initially suspects of being the killer. While this is a comedy first and foremost there are a few wince inducing moments when we see a few fairly horrific injuries; this and the frequent swearing make it unsuitable for younger viewers but older viewers who want a good laugh should enjoy it.",8,0,1,2 December 2012
The Mummy," A fun adventure
","In the prologue; we high priest Imhotep is having an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress; he catches them but the pair murder him. Shortly afterwards they are caught; she takes her own life but Imhotep isn't so lucky; he is condemned to the worst punishment imaginable; he interred with hundreds of scarabs which eat him alive. His sarcophagus is buried beneath a statue in the city of Hamunaptra; the city of the dead.Three thousand years later in 1925, long after Hamunaptra has disappeared into the sands and become almost mythical, American adventurer Rick O'Connell finds it once again. Back in Cairo Jonathan Carnahan gives a strange box to his sister Evelyn; it contains a map to the location of Hamunaptra. It turns out he's stolen it from Rick who is now in gaol awaiting execution! Needing his help Evelyn and Jonathan buy his release and they head to Hamunaptra. They aren't the only people going there though; a group of American treasure hunters have learnt of its location as well. What none of them know it that Imhotep is still there waiting for somebody to release him from his grave. Once released he will be a treat to all the world!Given that this film is rated '15' here I assumed it would be a bit more gory or contain other offensive material but to be honest I thought it was less scary than the 'PG' rated 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'Â… it might frighten younger children but I'd say it was suitable for everybody else looking for an exciting adventure/monster movie. The story is simple enough, without unnecessary twists and the monster, when we finally see it is suitably creepy without being too scary. There is plenty of action from start to finish and some great special effects. The cast do a solid enough job in a way that makes it clear that we aren't meant to be taking it too seriously. Brendon Fraser is fairly impressive as Rick and Rachel Weisz is good as Evelyn. They are ably supported by the likes of John Hannah, Jonathan; Arnold Vosloo, Imhotep and Omid Djalili as the gaoler who accompanies then. Overall I'd recommend this; it was a lot more fun than I expected.",8,2,3,13 July 2016
The Others," An atmospheric chiller
","It is nice that there are still horror films like this around, ones that rely on atmosphere and good acting rather than shocks and gore, not that there is anything wrong with that, it is just nice to have alternatives. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the devout mother of two children, living in a large house on the island of Jersey shortly after the end of the German occupation. The film opens with three strangers coming to the door to work as servants, as Grace shows them around the house she explains certain strange rules the must keep, all doors must be locked after use and all the curtains must be kept closed, this is because her two children are so photosensitive that any sunlight would make them very ill or possibly kill them. Not long after this Grace's daughter Anne claims she has seen a boy called Victor in the house along with his family, Grace doesn't believe her initially but after a while grows to believe that the house may in fact be haunted.There are few shocks in the film but an oppressive atmosphere is maintained by the darkened rooms in the house and the ever present fog outside, as the film progresses Grace seems to get more and more paranoid and irrational to the point where we are led to believe she might even harm the children. All the main actors perform well, especially Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the two young children. While I didn't find it as scary as some reviewers I'd still recommend it... just try to avoid spoilers before watching it.",8,1,3,29 January 2009
Ed Wood," A fun and tender biopic of 'Hollywood's Worst Director'
","This film tells the story of Edward D. Wood Jr; the man often described as the maker of the worst film in history. What Ed lacks in film making ability he makes up for with enthusiasm. When he can persuade anybody to let him make a film he works fast; never worrying about more than one take and shooting numerous scenes each day. As well as seeing his film making and attempts to get funding, we see insights into his relationships with two woman and his professional relationship with fading horror star Bela Lugosi.This film could easily have been very mocking of Wood but director Tim Burton treats him with respect. Wood might not have been a good film maker but he strived to be and thought he was. He was also a transvestite in an era that such behaviour was considered a perversion but even this is shown in a matter of fact way leaving those who don't approve, excluding the girlfriend whose clothes he borrowed, looking more laughable than him. There is also a tenderness about his friendship with Lugosi. The cast does a fine job; most notably Johnny Depp who is on great form as Wood and Martin Landau who picked up an Oscar for his performance as Lugosi. Burton's decision to film in black & white works as it fits in with the films Wood was making. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of Burton and Depp... it even left me wanting to watch 'worst film ever' 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' again!",9,0,0,29 December 2019
Orphan," Isabelle Fuhrman is great as orphan Esther
","After suffering a miscarriage Kate and her husband John decide to adopt nine-year old Esther to complete their family. At first it seems that she is doing everything she can to become part of the family; even learning sign language so she can talk to her new sister Max. The only person who doesn't get along with her is brother, Daniel; although it appears that he is the one being unreasonable not her. Things start to go wrong when Esther is bullied at school because of her old fashioned dress sense and soon after one of her tormentors is injured in what Esther claims was just an accident. It soon becomes clear that Esther isn't the innocent she first appeared when she actually kills somebody then blackmails Max into keeping quiet. Kate starts to suspect Esther is a malevolent presence in the house but her husband can't see it and the children are too frightened to say what they know; this leads people to believe that Kate is the one who is losing her sanity. She continues to investigate Esther's origins but by the time she learns the shocking truth it may be too late to save her family.This was a good enough shocker although I think it would have been better if it hadn't been made clear how bad Esther was so early on so the viewer would have to decide whether she was bad or whether Kate was indeed going insane. Twelve-year old Isabelle Fuhrman did a fantastic job as Esther making her believable as she switched from friendly to malicious in the blink of an eye. The film wasn't too scary although it did contain a few decent jump scenes; the most shocking scene wasn't one where anybody was in danger but when Esther makes herself up and tries to seduce her adoptive father. This scene was handled well managing to be quite disturbing without even coming close to being offensive as could have easily been the case. The finale was rather cliché but for the most part it was a fairly taut chiller. There was a good surprise revelation near the end but I won't spoil it here; I'll just say that I didn't see it coming!",7,2,4,22 May 2011
Home Alone," Anarchic Family Fun
","The night before eight year old Kevin and his family are due to depart for their Christmas holidays in Paris he misbehaves and is sent to bed early; feeling hard done by he wishes they would disappear. In the morning events conspire to cause a rushed departure and Kevin is accidentally left behind in the panic; when he wakes up his wish has come true! His parents meanwhile have discovered their mistake and are struggling desperately to find a way to get back to Chicago. With nobody to look after him Kevin quickly learns to look after himself. Meanwhile Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars, are robbing houses in the area and the one they consider the best target is Kevin's; he will have to be extra smart if he is to prevent a robbery. On the first night he tricks them into believing there is a party on but he won't be so lucky the next time but the neither will Harry and Marv; by the time they return Kevin has prepared an interesting welcome for them; one that will leave them bleeding, burnt, bruised and battered!When I first watched this film over twenty years ago I was surprised just how much I laughed and watching it again now it is just as funny; the early part of the film has a decent number of laughs but later on when the attempted burglary takes place it is hysterically funny in a slightly malicious way; Harry and Marv may be unpleasant criminals but I'm not sure anybody deserves what happens to them! Young Macaulay Culkin does a great job as Kevin; he really managed to carry the film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were also entertaining as the two burglars. While it is primarily a comedy there are some touching moments; most notably when Kevin talks to the scary neighbour and learns that he hasn't spoken to his son for years because of a silly argument. Overall I'd say this is a great film that can be enjoyed by young and old alike; definitely one to watch!",9,0,1,6 June 2012
Terminator Salvation," The first Terminator film to take place after Judgement Day
","In the prologue we see a convicted killer, Marcus Wright, being asked if his body can be used for an unspecified project after his execution this is in 2003. We then jump forward to 2018 and John Connor is part of a team infiltrating a Skynet facility; they discover plans for the T-800 series of Terminators before everything goes wrong. They are attacked and Connor is the sole survivor from his squad. He is taken to the resistance headquarters where he learns of a plan to attack Skynet after a means of deactivating the machines is discovered. Shortly after the attack on the facility a prisoner, Marcus, escapes. He makes his way to Los Angeles where he meets the young Kyle Rhys. He heads out of town with Kyle and Star, a young mute girl, but the latter to are captured and taken to Skynet Headquarters in San Francisco. Marcus later meets resistance pilot Blair Williams who takes him to Connor here a shocking discovery is made about Marcus. With the attack on Skynet imminent Connor determines that he must save Kyle before the attack.This film is very different to the previous instalments; apart from the prologue it takes place after Judgement Day and John Connor is a leading resistance fighter not merely a target of time travelling Terminators. This post-apocalyptic setting made it feel very different. The action was impressive and almost non-stop; unfortunately this was at the cost of character depth. The story itself is interesting enough and I liked the twist concerning Marcus, probably the film's most interesting character. Sam Worthington does a solid job in the role and Christian Bale was equally solid as Connor. The rest of the cast were pretty good although I was a bit disappointed that Michael Ironside was somewhat underused as the leader of the resistance. The CGI used to make a T-800 look like a 1980's Arnie was rather fun. Overall I'd say this is a decent enough sci-fi action film but I preferred the first three.",7,1,1,20 November 2017
My Neighbor Totoro," An enchanting story for all ages
","My Neighbour Totoro is one of the most enchanting films that I've seen. As one would expect from a film made by Hayao Miyazaki the animation is beautiful and detailed and the story engrossing.The film start with a man and his two young daughters, Satsuki and Mei moving to a house in the country. When the girls explore the house they find strange creatures that look like tiny black fur balls which scurry away as soon as anybody enter the room. While Satsuki is at school Mei sees a strange little creature, about the size of a rabbit, in the garden and chases it into the forest, here she finds a similar creature which is much larger. She names them 'Totoro', which I believe is a slight mispronunciation of the Japanese word for a troll.When here father and Satsuki find her sleeping in the woods we are left unsure whether it was real or whether Mei had dreamt it. Not long after while waiting at the bus stop in the rain Satsuki also sees Totoro as he is waiting for his bus... not just any bus though, he rides in the Cat-bus, a wonderful eight legged creature who's eyes are its headlights.This film is suitable for people of all ages, there is no antagonist and the only slight worries are when Mei gets lots while trying to walk to see her mother who is in hospital.This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles, I've only seen a little bit of it in English but what I saw gave me no cause for complaint.",10,2,4,25 April 2008
500 Days of Summer," Falling in love with Summer
","Protagonist Tom works for a greeting cards company and when the boss's new assistant, Summer Finn, walks through the door he is instantly smitten. We know they will get together as the narrative constantly switches between the beginning of relationship and a time a year later when it is falling apart. Before he even invites her out she has told him that she does not believe in love and doesn't like labels like girlfriend and boyfriend but still he ends up inviting her out and things start off well. When she decides to finish things he does not take it well; he loses his happy go lucky attitude and ultimately walks out of his job as he comes to believe he is writing nothing but meaningless platitudes.This may all sound like a fairly depressing anti-romantic film but in fact it is pretty funny; Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel do great jobs as Tom and Summer and even though she only has a small role Chloë Grace Moretz does a fine job as Tom's little sister who is wise beyond her years and gives him advice. Tom and Summer's relationship was believable from the start where he was in a state of ecstasy to the end where he was devastated and couldn't get over her. There are plenty of good laughs and one which is as disgusting as it is funny... if you've seen it you will know the one I mean! Over all this is worth watching if you want to see a different take on the romance genre.",8,1,1,12 March 2012
Juno," Ellen Page delivers the goods
","Having enjoyed Ellen Page's performance in Hard Candy I looked forward to seeing this. Once again Ellen's performance was first rate, this time playing a sixteen year old who gets pregnant after having sex with her friend Bleeker (Michael Cera). Her initial reaction to the situation is to seek an abortion but changes her mind when she is unimpressed with the clinic.Juno realises that she is too young to raise the child so seeks a couple to adopt it. The couple she finds finds seem perfect, she is desperate to have a child and he is a cool guy that Juno relates to as the discuss their tastes in music and horror films. Of course there are some problems along the way but I won't go into details as I'd rather not spoil the film too much.If you haven't seen this film yet I'd certainly recommend it, I enjoyed it from start to finish and laughed out loud a few times. The acting is top notch, both from Ellen and from the supporting cast. The dialogue is sharp through out, perhaps a little too sharp for a girl of Juno's age but I don't think that matters as it is delivered believably. I'm not surprised that Ellen Page got an Oscar nomination for this film, I'm sure it is only a matter of time before she wins one.",10,2,6,9 November 2008
L.A. Confidential," Sleaze and corruption in the City of Angels
","It is the early 1950s and Los Angeles is a great city to live in; the police keep everybody safe and everybody has a chance of making their dreams come true at least that is the Hollywood version. The reality is less pleasant; cops are more than willing to rough up a suspect or plant evidence to secure a conviction and many who dream of becoming famous end up in vice. This story is centred around three detectives; Bud White, a man who is willing to get rough but won't tolerate those who hurt women; Ed Exley, an honest cop who would rather see a guilty man go free than break the rules; and Jack Vincennes, a celebrity cop who takes payment to make sure any newsworthy people getting arrested make the front page as well as working as an adviser for a popular police show. They end up working for a common purpose after a massacre in a local diner where one of the victims was a recently fired cop, White's ex-partner. Evidence points to a trio of black youths but evidence isn't always what it seems and the detectives soon start to believe they got the wrong people. As they dig deeper they uncover corruption in the LA Police Department, high end prostitutes who look like movie stars and the blackmail of city officials.This is a great thriller with a real noirish feel; it may be twenty years old but it still feels fresh thanks to the great performances from an ensemble cast of quality actors. The story has a grittiness to it as few of the characters are particularly pure and even those who are will have to bend the rules more than a little at times. There is a good central mystery concerning who is behind the killings and when the truth comes out it is neither too obvious nor too much of a surprise. There is a sense that our protagonists are in real danger as those who they should be able to trust are the very people who present the threat. Over the course of the film we learn about the characters backgrounds in a way that makes them more sympathetic; even some who initially come across as brutish or sleazy. I can't say I know that much about '50s LA, apart from what I've seen in movies, but this certainly feels authentic. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of crime drama; it is a great example of the genre.",10,1,2,23 April 2017
The Jungle Book," An animated classic with some great songs
","This classic Disney animation, based on the story by Rudyard Kipling, tells the story of Mowgli; a young boy who was raised by wolves after being found in the Indian jungle as a baby. He has been with the wolves for ten years when news of Shere Khan, the man-hating tiger's, return to that part of the jungle reaches the pack. It is decided that for Mowgli's safety he must be returned to the man-village; Bagheera, a panther, volunteers to take him. On the way they meet various dangers as well as some friendly creatures; most notably a sloth bear named Baloo.This film is a lot of fun with a combination of a simple but solid story; enjoyable characters and a variety of catchy songs. 'The Bare Necessities' and 'I Wanna Be Like You' may be the best known of the songs but the others are pretty good too; especially 'Trust In Me', sung by Kaa the hypnotic python. The story contains elements that are mildly threatening but these are balanced by the comedy and songs. The characters are great; I particularly liked Baloo and the way he was portrayed with a John Wayne like drawl; and Kaa's hypnotic stare and hissing voice. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all top notch. One or two gags might have dated a little... today's children might not spot that a quartet of vultures are based on The Beatles but that doesn't matter as the characters are still funny. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic film to viewers of all ages.",9,1,1,16 March 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," The Ice Age Cometh
","Paleoclimatologist Jack Hall is taking ice core samples in Antarctica when a massive ice sheet breaks off from the continent. He believes his research suggests that this is caused by global warming but rather than raising temperatures it could ultimately change the currents in the North Atlantic and trigger another ice age. He doesn't realise just how soon it will happen though. First it starts snowing in New Delhi, then hailstones as large as ones fist bombard Tokyo, then huge tornadoes ravage Los Angeles. This is just a hint of what is to come; massive super-storms form over Canada, Northern Europe and Siberia causing the temperature to drop so fast that anybody caught outside freezes instantly. Jack is heading up the research in Washington DC but his son, Sam, is on a school trip to New York when the effects of the weather starts to take effect; first a massive tsunami his the city causing a flood then the temperature starts to drop. Sam, his friends and other survivors take shelter in the library. As an evacuation of the United States gets underway Jack, along with two colleagues, heads north to try to rescue his son.This is a decent enough catastrophe movie; there are some great special effects as we see the expected variety well known landmarks getting destroyed or frozen. It also suffers from the cliché of concentrating on a small group of 'designated survivors' who we are meant to care about while vast numbers of others die who won't guess that the homeless man with his dog will survive while the man who tried to stop him entering the library will ultimately freeze?! The cast do a solid job; most notably Dennis Quaid as Jack and Jake Gyllenhaal as Sam. It is weather effects that are the real star of the film though. At times the film does feel a bit too preachy; I don't mind a film with a message but this was too heavy handed at times. Overall this was a pretty good film; I expect fans of the genre will enjoy it.",7,0,1,10 July 2017
Deadpool 2," Deadpool is back; as hilarious as ever
","As this sequel begins the unkillable superhero is trying to kill himself. A short flashback sequence shows the tragic events that led up to this. Inevitably he doesn't die; Colossus recovers his body parts and puts him back together. He is encouraged to become a trainee X-man but his first mission goes wrong; he realises the out of control young mutant, Russell, he is meant to stop is actually being abused at a Mutant Re-education Centre and kills one of the abusers. Deadpool and Russell are taken to a high security facility where control collars supress their mutant powers. While there Cable, a super-soldier from the future, turns up determined to kill Russell for crimes he has yet to commit. During the fight Deadpool gets out of the facility but Russell is left behind; convinced he has been abandoned. Deadpool determines to rescue him; to do that he assembles his own team of superheroes: The X-Force. Not surprisingly things do not go according to plan.If you enjoyed the original 'Deadpool' you are sure to love this; it has all the irreverence that made the original so much fun. It may be crude and violent but it isn't mean-spirited. The story starts well with his explosive suicide attempt; this is followed by a fun flashback sequence where he kills bad guys as Dolly Parton's 'Nine to Five' plays in the background (priceless) followed by a shocking tragedy. This all serves to lead to the main story about Deadpool's attempt to save Russell... this contains lots of action and plenty of good twists. Cable made a good adversary for Deadpool and the X-Force members were amusing, even if mostly ineffectual. Ryan Reynolds really carries the film as Deadpool; he is really great I the role; Josh Brolin impresses as Cable and Zazie Beetz is a lot of fun as the lucky X-Force member, Domino. The special effects, both physical and CGI are impressive throughout. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the first film... and advise viewers not to switch off when the credits start; there is more to come including some very important details.",9,1,2,15 May 2019
X-Men," Excellent Mutant Superheroes
","I must state in advance that this film was my introduction to the X-Men so I had no preconceived ideas about what the characters should look like or how they should behave as fans of previous versions would understandably have.Set in a world where mutants with super powers exist the story opens during the Second World War were a young Jewish boy is being separated from his parents in a concentration camp. As the guards try to pull him away from them the iron gates start to buckle and they are pulled towards them. After this introduction the action moves to the present day where we are introduced to Rogue, a young girl who sucks the life out of anybody she touches. When she runs away from home she heads to Canada where she meets Wolverine, a man who heals from any injury and has had metal parts attached to his skeleton including long claws that he can produce at will. As they drive along they are ambushed by a large man who we later learn is called Sabretooth, thankfully they are rescued by two other mutants who go by the names Storm and Cyclops.The next time we see them they are at a strange school where mutant children are taught by Professor Xavier. He explains that there are two factions of mutants, one led by himself that wants to live peacefully with normal people and the other led by Magneto (The young boy from the opening scene) who believes that the only way for them to survive is to prepare for a war with humanity.The rest of the film follows Xavier's X-Men as the try to foil Magneto's plans which seem to involve Wolverine for reasons the professor can't understand.I really enjoyed this film, the characters were interesting and well acted and while the plot was the standard 'save the world' type one expects in such movies it did have a few surprises and the actions scenes are fairly exciting. I'm sure everybody will have their own favourite mutants, mine are Rogue, played by Anna Paquin for the good guys and Mystique, who can change shape to look like anybody else for the bad guys.",8,0,1,13 November 2008
Children of Heaven," Made me smile from start to finish
","Until a fortnight ago I'd never seen an Iranian film and assumed any film from their would just be religious or political propaganda... perhaps there are films like that but having just watched this film and 'Offside' it is clear that they also make fantastic character based films that are a delight to watch.On the face of it a film about a poor boy losing his sister's only pair of shoes doesn't sound the basis for a film that is both interesting and a joy to watch but it works. With his mother too ill to work and his father in a low paid job young Ali promises his sister Zahra that he will get her shoes back if she doesn't tell their parents about the loss. When he fails to find them he offers to share his own footwear; an old pair of trainers. This means that as soon as her school is over Zahra must run through the narrow back streets to get the shoes to Ali so he can go to his school, even though he runs he is slightly late each day and is getting in trouble. Director Majid Majidi did a great job getting such natural performances from his two stars, both of whom were young children. It is surprising that the children didn't go on to star in further films as they were both a joy to watch and made the viewer really care for their plight. The film might sound a bit boring and depressing but it isn't, there are a few sad scenes but for the most part it is a film that had me smiling from start to finish, I'll have to look out for more films from Iran.",9,1,1,9 December 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," The T-Virus has spread around the world
","Five years have passed since the events of the previous instalment of this zombie franchise. The T-Virus has spread around the planet; this has not only turned most of the population into zombies, it has also affected wildlife and caused almost global desertification. Alice is travelling alone through the American West where she meets up with a convoy of survivors just as they are being attacked by a giant flock of infected crows. She manages to help them but there are inevitably casualties. They find evidence suggesting that there are areas still unaffected by the T-Virus in Alaska but that is a long journey that will require a lot of fuel. With the smaller filling stations now drained they will have to brave the city of Las Vegas if they are to get the required fuel.While Alice is helping these survivors the Umbrella Corporation is still looking for her; Dr Isaacs needs her blood for his experiments to create a serum that will create tame zombies. He has also been working with clones of Alice which he tests to destruction. His schemes don't exactly go according to plan and he becomes infected after one of the 'improved' zombies he created bites him; he gets the antidote but mutates into a new more powerful creature; inevitable Alice will face him as the film reaches its climax.I think this film was a step up from the second in the series despite the absence of Valentine who seems to have gone AWOL since the end of the previous film. Things start well as we are introduced to Dr Isaacs' Alice clones in a scene that is so similar to the start of the first instalment that I wondered if I might have put the wrong disc in! When we get back to the real Alice it is quickly established that there are some survivors who are almost as dangerous as the zombies when she meets a family that behave as though they've just come off the set of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. That isn't the only film similarity; the convoy of survivors is an enjoyable nod to 'Mad Max 2' and the crow attack is clearly inspired by 'The Birds'. This scene is one of the best in the film as there is something inherently frightening about being attacked by something as common as a crow. The effects for this scene were pretty impressive. On the down side the creators' desire to take things to another level went a bit far; now Alice isn't just an awesome fighter, she has telekinetic powers and the final fight against the mutated Isaacs felt as though because this is based on a series of computer games it must end with a 'boss fight' against something much more dangerous than the regular zombies. The cast did a solid enough job, by now Milla Jovovich has almost become defined by her role as Alice and Iain Glen is pretty good as Isaacs. Overall this is a decent enough sequel with some great action and some nicely scary moments although you really need to have watched the earlier films, especially the first, to know what is going on.",7,0,0,10 August 2015
Zodiac," A cartoonist hunts for a serial killer
","This films tells the story of the hunt for the infamous, who himself 'Zodiac', who has committed a series of murders in Northern California in the late sixties and early seventies. The crimes probably wouldn't have been linked if the killer hadn't contacted the police in each case then written to various newspapers listing his killings, which took place in different jurisdictions. His letter includes a code which he demands to be published. Both the police and the media work to identify the killer and as more letters arrive claiming responsibility for more murders and attempted murders as well as issuing a threat to target school children. As time passes various suspects emerge and are eliminated, largely due to handwriting evidence and there being no match for the fingerprint left at one of the crime scenes. Eventually the trail turns cold, the letters and killings stop and people gradually forget about the case except for Robert Graysmith of the San Francisco Chronicle; not as a reporter but as a cartoonist. Over the years he talks to witnesses and pours through police files until he finds a suspect he is convinced committed the killings.Director David Fincher did a fine job bringing this real life mystery to the screen It may have helped that all I knew about the case was that it inspired the film 'Dirty Harry' but I was gripped from the start. Thankfully the film doesn't dwell too much on the killings or even the killer; instead in concentrates on those investigating the case; how they go about trying to identify the killer and the effect their work has on their own lives. Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job as protagonist Robert Graysmith making us believe in his obsession with the case. He is ably supported by Robert Downey Jr. who plays a colleague; Mark Ruffalo who plays the San Francisco detective leading the case and Chloë Sevigny who plays Graysmith's wife. Given that the original case is still officially unsolved there is no cast iron identification of the killer but those wanting resolution will be happy that by the end we are given a prime suspect and it is made clear that most of those involved are convinced of his guilt. There are a few shocking scenes early on and some tense moments later on but there is little that could be considered gratuitous and the film in no way glamourises the crimes or the chief suspect as some films in the genre do. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to people who enjoy a good mystery but don't demand that every loose end is wrapped up.",8,0,0,7 January 2017
The Prestige," Rivalry and obsession in the world of magic
","This film tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, in late Victorian London. After a brief introduction we see Angier drown as a trick appears to have been sabotaged by Borden and the latter in put on trial for his murder but are things what they seem? The story then unfolds from the time they were friends to the final revelation concerning what really happened in that opening scene.Angier and Borden's friendship is irrevocably broken when Angier's wife is killed when a trick goes wrong; Angier is convinced that it was Borden's fault. The two go their own ways and put on rival magic shows. Angier sees a chance for revenge when Borden attempts the famous 'bullet catch' trick; he hides himself amongst the crowd then volunteers to be the man who pulls the trigger, slips a real bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger; Borden survives but loses two fingers. Time passes and Borden develops a new trick; 'The Transporting Man'. This seemingly impossible trick sees Borden enter one cupboard then emerge from another almost instantly. Angier is desperate to replicate the trick but can't figure out how it is done. His ingénieur (trick creator), Cutter, is certain that it must involve a double but Angier is certain that the only man on stage is Borden. He performs his own version, using a double but is unsatisfied; determined to learn the truth he sends his stage assistant, Olivia Wenscombe, to pretend to work for Borden to learn the secret; she steals his notebook but it is encrypted. Angier forces Borden to tell him the key word (Tesla) and this leads him to search out scientist Nikola Tesla in Colorado to get the equipment he needs this ultimately works but not in a way anybody would expect.Anybody familiar with the films of director Christopher Nolan will know to expect the unexpected and shouldn't be put off by the non-linear narrative it isn't just that the story is told in flashback; instead it moves back and forward revealing aspects of the story. This isn't just a gimmick as it works to make things interesting. The way the two magicians' rivalry escalates perfectly encapsulates their obsessions; not just to be the best but also to destroy the other. The cast does a fine job; most notably Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine who play Angier, Borden and Cutter respectively. They are ably supported by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as Borden's wife Sarah and Olivia Wenscombe, there is also an enjoyable cameo from the late David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The final resolution is rather surprising; largely because it is blatant science-fiction rather than a magic trick this might disappoint some viewers although others will enjoy the dark twist when they realise the secret behind Angier's version of 'The Transporting Man'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this impressive and intriguing film.",9,2,3,26 May 2016
The Terminator," An '80s sci-fi classic
","In the year 2029 mankind has been virtually wiped out by intelligent machines but humanity is fighting back under the leadership of John Connor. It is too late for the machines to defeat him so they send a cyborg killer, a Terminator, back to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, before he is even conceived! John couldn't stop this plan so he sends his closest friend, Kyle Reese, back to protect her. Sarah is just an ordinary young woman who has no idea what is about to happen to her; the first she knows that something strange is happening is when two other women, also named Sarah Connor, are reported brutally murdered. It looks as if she will be next but Kyle rescues her just in time she isn't safe though; the Terminator is virtually indestructible and it has only one mission; to kill her.It is hard to believe that this film is now thirty years old; apart from the '80s 'big hair' it has hardly dated. The plot is relatively straightforward and little time is wasted on unnecessary twists. Arnold Schwarzenegger understandably dominates as the merciless Terminator; he may be a character of few words but those he does say have become iconic; 'I'll be back' has become his catchphrase thanks to him saying it once in this film. Linda Hamilton does a fine job as the ordinary woman, Sarah Connor, we can believe that despite her obvious vulnerability she has an inner strength. Michael Biehn is also good, playing Kyle, a tough but very human character. Director James Cameron gets the action started early on and it doesn't let up until the end. The action is fairly violent, for the most part it doesn't dwell on injuries but there are still a few shocking moments as innocent people are gunned down. Overall I'd say that this is a great film that stands multiple viewings; I know a lot of people prefer the second instalment in this franchise but for me this is the best.",9,1,2,23 August 2015
Cloverfield," Good found footage monster movie
","When Hudson 'Hud' Platt gets roped in to film his friend Rob's going away party in Manhattan he doesn't expect that he will end up documenting the destruction of the city. After about twenty minutes the party is disturbed by what appears to be an earthquake. Wanting to see what has happened they all head to the roof and learn it certainly wasn't an Earthquake; they see buildings collapsing and what appears to be flaming meteorites crashing down into the city. Realising the danger they rush downstairs into the street and are stunning when part of a very familiar monument crashes into the ground in front of them! With the danger clearly extreme they head for the Brooklyn Bridge but it is destroyed as they try to cross. When Rob gets a call from the girl he loves saying she is unable to move in her apartment he decides that he must help save her; his friends go with him and along the way they encounter further dangers.Having managed to avoid major spoilers I was intrigued to see this film as I remembered all the hype in the run up to its release. The most obvious feature of this film is the way the camera is constantly moving around; this does serve to make it look as if it was really filmed by somebody caught up in the events but it is quietly to cause a degree of motion sickness if watched on a larger screen. The feeling of realism is increased by the use of an unknown, at least to me, cast. The cast did a good job, meaning that for the duration of the film I could believe they were caught up in this terrible situation. The special effects were also pretty good; it helped that we didn't see too much of the creatures till near then end. The DVD case quoted a review that said it was 'truly terrifying' but despite enjoying it as a gripping thriller I didn't find it particularly scary; I certainly didn't find it anywhere near as frightening as that other found footage film 'The Blair Witch Project'. At seventy minutes, excluding credits, this film is very short but this can be justified by the fact that it is meant to be recorded on a single tape this idea is reinforced by occasional gaps in the filming where we see what was on the tape before. Overall I wouldn't call this a much see film but it is worth watching if it is on TV or picking up if you see the DVD in the bargain bin.",7,0,1,3 November 2012
Sleepy Hollow," Heads will roll...
","This film has a macabre atmosphere as one would expect from Tim Burton, it feels more like a dark fairy tale than a horror film... although like many fairy tales it has its gruesome moments which means it isn't suitable for children.Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane a New York City policeman in 1799 who is sent upstate to the village of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a recent spate of murders. Each has one thing in common, the victim has been decapitated and their head taken. The locals tell Ichobod that they have been killed by a headless horseman who was killed during the War of Independence. As the death toll increases he grows to believe that the people aren't being killed at random, being a logical detective however he doesn't believe that anything supernatural is involved, not until he sees the horseman with his own eyes. While investigating he is rather smitten Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the the town's headman, he is also assisted by Young Masbath, a boy orphaned by the horseman.The film full of good actors, not least Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the lead roles, the lesser roles are nearly all played top quality character actors who viewers will recognise from other well known films. The special effects are good, especially the numerous decapitations. I would definitely recommend this to fans of Tim Burton or of fantasy horror in general so long as they are mid-teens or older, it is a bit too gory for younger viewers.",8,3,4,29 June 2009
Silent Hill," Starts well but has a weak final confrontation due to CGI
","Before giving my views on this film I must point out that I have never played the game on which it is based so can't say how it compared or how close it stayed to the original plot. After an introduction where we learn that Rose's adopted daughter Sharon is prone to sleep walking and while asleep keeps referring to Silent Hill; the town of her birth. Rose decides she must go to Silent Hill with Sharon if she is to discover what is the matter with her. Silent Hill isn't a normal town; it was abandoned after the coal seem under the town caught fire about the time of Sharon's birth. Shortly before getting there Rose is pulled over by a police woman, called Cybil, however as the officer approaches she accelerates off and drives at high speed to Silent Hill with the officer in pursuit. On arrival she crashes and when she regains consciousness there is no sign of Sharon.There is something not quite right about the town; it appears to be snowing at first put it soon becomes apparent that it is ash from the still burning fire. Seeing a child she thinks is her daughter she runs after her but is confronted by strange creatures. Returning to her car she meets the police woman who handcuffs her and tries to take her out of town; they can't get out though as the road inexplicably ends in a precipice which wasn't there when they arrived. Trapped in the town Rose is determined to continue the search for her daughter and sets about searching for her, starting at the school as she remembered a picture she drew. Each place she goes gives a clue as to where she should look next... after she has survived the threat in that location of course. Eventually she finds a girl that looks just like her daughter but she claims her name is Alessa. Strangely she disappears soon after they meet and Rose and Cybil are taken to the church where a strange cult hides from what they call 'The Darkness'. These people tell Rose where she can find this Darkness, when she gets there we learn just what her daughter's connection to Alessa is and just what happened to the town all those years ago. While Rose is looking for her daughter her husband comes looking for her. Here we learn that she isn't in the real world as we see them in the same place at the same time but the weather is different and they don't see each other however he get a sense of her presence when he smells her perfume.For a film adapted from a game I never got the feeling I was watching somebody playing a game as I have with other adaptations although the progressive encounters did have a sense of advancing game levels where a clue must be found to go to the next location. The atmosphere was delightfully creepy early on and the faceless creatures were quite chilling. Unfortunately the final confrontation between Alessa and the townspeople wasn't frightening, it was just CGI gore. I was pleased that even though the end suggests that all is not as it should be there wasn't the cliché of having one more attack after we thing the threat is over. Radha Mitchell did a good job as Rose making the character believable in an unbelievable situation and young Jodelle Ferland stole the scenes she was in as Sharon and her counterpart Alessa. I don't think this was a great film but it is worth watching if it is on late night television, it was certainly better than some game adaptations I've seen.",6,0,1,15 March 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not all movie spies are like James Bond
","When Jim Prideaux is sent to Budapest to arrange the defection of a senior Hungarian officer things do not go according to plan; he is shot and we presume killed. One of the reasons Control, the head of MI-6 was so keen to get his hands on the officer was that he had come to believe that their was a mole high up in the service and this man could identify him. With the operation failing Control is soon replaced along with those closest to him. One of those let go is George Smiley; he is recruited to find out who the mole is without those still in the service knowing. As the case progresses we will learn more about what happened to Prideaux after he was shot; the details of 'Operation Witchcraft', which concerned an apparent Soviet agent who was passing valuable information to the west and ultimately the identification of the mole.Having seen the television adaptation of the story starring Alec Guinness I was curious to see how this would compare. Now I have seen both I'd probably rate the series higher but that might just be because I saw it first; inevitable a fair amount has been removed in this version but the key parts remain. The acting was top notch; Gary Oldman made a fine Smiley and the rest of the main cast was made up of fairly well known actors all of whom did well. People who don't know anything about the story before watching may be a little disappointed if they are expecting James Bond style action; there is none of that here; these spies aren't glamorous action men they are ordinary people; the sort you'd barely notice in a crowd; in other words far closer to what I imagine real people working at MI-6 are like. That isn't to say there is no action at all; there are a few shootings; one of which is particularly shocking. Over all this was a quality film which I'd certainly recommend.",8,5,7,21 March 2012
The Hateful Eight," A violent western from Tarantino
","Set in the middle of the winter in Wyoming, this western opens with Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, stopping a stage coach to ask for a ride to Red Rock. Aboard the coach are fellow bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue. Sometime later they pick up another passenger, Chris Mannix, a former Confederate soldier who claims that he is the new sheriff of Red Rock. Unable to get to town before a blizzard strikes they stop at Minnie's Haberdashery. Here they immediately think something is wrong; there is no sign of Minnie and the story told about her absence seems unlikely. Already there are Bob, a Mexican who claims to be running the establishment in Minnie's absence; Oswaldo Mobray, who claims to be the hangman heading to Red Rock; Joe Gage, who claims to be a cowboy going home to visit his mother and General Sandy Smithers, formerly of the Confederate Army.Here tensions rise as Ruth is convinced that one of those men is there to free his prisoner. There is also tension between Warren, a black, former Union officer, and the two former confederates. It is only a matter of time before these tensions explode into bloody violence. Before the film is over many of those present will end up dead and we will learn what happened before the stage coach arrived at Millie's.At two hours and forty minutes in length this film is certainly rather long but I never felt bored. The opening scenes did a fine job of introducing the various characters and telling us a little about them that makes the viewer wonder if what we are told is true in some cases it is and in some cases it isn't and not always in the cases we expect. The setting is great; a single room where everybody is trapped for the duration of the blizzard provides a sense of claustrophobia that increases the tension even more. It is very much a film of two halves; the first is tense but gently paced people talk but there is little violence. The second half is far more violent; this violence is very bloody and at times very shocking. The cast does a fine job; most notably Samuel L. Jackson as Major Warren, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue and Kurt Russell as John Ruth. As one would expect from a film from Quentin Tarantino this won't be for everybody and certainly isn't for younger viewers with its extreme violence and frequent use of the racist 'N-word' not that the film is racist, just some characters. Overall I'd recommend this for fans of Tarantino's other films.",8,3,5,5 April 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," A fun family adventure film
","When young reporter Tintin buys a model of a sailing ship he has no idea what an adventure it will lead him on. The model itself isn't that valuable but it holds a clue to a cast treasure that has lain at the bottom of the ocean for centuries. To be more accurate it holds the third of a clue; to find the treasure one must reunite three scrolls secreted onto three models of the ship; The Unicorn, and legend has it with these three scrolls a member of the Haddock family will be able to find the treasure. It takes a while before Tintin learns this of course; at first he just knows that a couple of people are very keen to buy the model off him and one of them won't take no for an answer. Shortly after one of the potential purchasers is shot dead in Tintin's doorway he is kidnapped and taken aboard a freighter bound for Morocco. If he is to survive he will have to get off the ship along with its drunken captain Captain Haddock; the last descendant of Sir Francis Haddock; captain of the Unicorn!When I saw trailers for this film I thought the CGI looked a little too good; distinctly in 'uncanny valley' territory but when I came to watch the film itself I soon stopped noticing it; in fact I think it may be the most realistic looking fully animated film I've seen. While the characters don't look quite real; often due to their large noses, they do look surprisingly human. The use of motion capture rather than more traditional animation means that the movement looks particularly natural; so much so that when something cartoony does happen it comes as quite a surprise.The story is a good fun adventure that can probably be enjoyed by all but the youngest children. There is a good plot but it isn't convoluted and never gets in the way of the almost constant action. There is a degree of violence although it is rarely bloody; in fact the only blood I recall was part of a clue and definitely not excessive. The cast of fairly well known actors does a fine job although none of them look like themselves due to the characters being made to look like their comic counterparts rather than the actors. I'm not sure how the story compares to the original comics as I never read them but it is a fun film for the whole family to enjoy.",8,1,1,1 December 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A classic western and a classic buddy movie!
","This film may be most famous for its Bolivian Army Ending but there is a fine film before its iconic end. The eponymous Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are a pair of outlaws who specialise in robbing banks in the American west along with their 'Hole in the Wall' gang. One day a member of the gang tries to usurp Butch's leadership of the gang and suggests that they should rob a train... twice; once on the outward journey once on the return! He is quickly put in his place but Butch and Sundance go ahead with the plan. All goes well until the second robbery; far from being unexpected as thought, the owner of the railroad has sent a second train behind the first and it is carrying a group of men that includes the toughest lawman and the best tracker in the country. The outlaws split up but those in pursuit stick with Butch and Sundance; following them through the night, across rocky terrain and up mountains. They only lose them when they jump from a cliff into a swirling torrent! After collecting Sundance's girlfriend Etta they head east to New York before catching a ship to Bolivia where Butch is convinced they will prosper. As it turns out life there is little different from what it was in America with the exception of the fact that here they don't speak the language and need Etta to help them. Inevitably they are cornered and Butch suggests they try Australia next!This film is rightfully considered a classic; Paul Newman and Robert Redford are great as Butch and Sundance; and more importantly they work well together. Katherine Ross puts in a solid performance as Etta although her role is obviously much smaller. The action is gripping, especially in to prolonged chase scene... that might not have been dramatic but the way their pursuers couldn't be shaken led to a feeling that a deadly confrontation would be inevitable. I was surprised at just how much humour was to be found in the film; and thankfully it didn't feel forced; particularly funny moments include the scenes where Butch fights the man trying to take over his gang and the later scene where they confront another gang in Bolivia with very limited knowledge of the language! All this adds up to make a classic western and a classic buddy movie; something that all film lovers should watch at least once... although I suspect most will want to watch it more than that.",9,1,2,1 September 2012
Ocean's Twelve," A rather messy sequel
","A few years have passed since Danny Ocean's band of thieves robbed Terry Benedict's casino in Las Vegas, now he has tracked them all down and he wants his money back with interest. Obviously most of the money has been spent; if they are to avoid being killed they will have to steal more within a fortnight. Since they are too well known in the United States they head to Europe and set about planning a job which has been given them by a contact. Their do the job but find somebody has got there before them and left a message. Danny immediately realises that this thief is the person responsible for telling Benedict where everybody was. The other thief is 'The Night Fox', a French master thief who sees himself as Number One. Danny meets him and they make a bet; each will try to steal a Faberge egg that is due to be exhibited in Rome; if Danny's gang gets it the Night Fox will pay their debts; if they lose Danny will acknowledge that The Night Fox is the better thief and Benedict will have his revenge! If that wasn't enough Europol agent Detective Isabel Lahiri, who had previously dated Danny's partner Rusty is hunting the gang and the Night Fox.The previous film was a fun caper movie; with a bunch of thieves working together to rob a single 'impossible' target this sequel has plenty of fun moments but it is too messy. Here we have two robberies, a rival thief determined to beat them, a cop who one of the team dated and the knowledge that if they fail Benedict will have them killed. There are some good jokes and at one point is gets very Meta as Danny's wife Tess, played by Julia Roberts, tries to pass herself off as Julia Roberts and meets Bruce Willis who is playing himself! While there is an obvious threat and at times it looks as if everything has gone wrong for the gang I don't imagine many viewers will think things won't work out for them in the end. The cast, which is almost entirely well known, do a solid job and are clearly having fun. Overall this is hardly a must see but it isn't terrible and is a pleasant enough way to pass a couple of hours.",6,2,3,26 November 2017
Crash," Intertwined LA Stories
","The film opens with a car crash where we know at least one body has been found before jumping back to the previous day. We are then introduced to the large cast of characters whose intertwining but apparently unconnected lives we will observe. They represent a cross section of the Los Angeles population; a black detective, a rich white couple, a successful black couple, an Iranian shopkeeper, a Hispanic locksmith, a racist white cop and his offended partner, a pair of black car thieves and a 'Chinaman' they run over. Normally it wouldn't be necessary to say what race characters are but in this film race, stereotypes and our assumptions about characters are key to the story.Few of the characters are as good or as bad as they seem; situations driving apparently good people to dangerous or even terrible things while apparently bad people do good or incredibly brave things whether they are finding a form of redemption is for the viewer to decide; perhaps they have, perhaps they just did one good thing. This ambiguity makes the various characters feel quite real. The way we move from one character to another reminded me of Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts'; we never stay too long with any one part of the story before moving on to somebody else. The large cast includes several well-known actors, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton but also many who were; all put in fine performances. I liked how the film played with our preconceptions; setting up a character one way then having them do something unexpected. The various stories were gripping with moments of tension, moments of humour, some shocks and an ending that was happier than I'd expected. Overall I found this to be a gripping slice of LA life; just don't expect everything to be resolved by the time the credits roll.",9,1,2,1 March 2015
Snatch," Another stylish gangster comedy from Guy Richie
","This film from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' creator Guy Richie is centred on more gangsters, hard men and chancers. The intertwining story lines feature Turkish and Tommy, a couple of unlicensed boxing promotors who get in a spot of bother when their fighter gets beaten by 'One Punch Mickey', an Irish Gypsy, just before a fixed fight... the boys must get Mickey to fight for them if they are to avoid being fed to the pigs by mobster 'Brick Top'. Meanwhile Franky Four Fingers has stolen an eighty six carat diamond in Antwerp only to go missing in London... many people are after the diamond. Inevitably the two plots will eventually collide.There may be a fair amount of violence and few of the characters are really that nice but this film is a lot of fun. There are laughs in most scenes whether it is the sight of incompetent thieves trying to rob a bookies which has no money, a dog that squeaks because it has swallowed a squeaky toy or gangsters armed with replica pistols the gags all hit the mark. The cast is large but the characters are all very distinctive so one is unlikely to get confused about who is who. I don't think there were any weak links amongst the cast which includes the likes of Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina amongst others. Not surprisingly Brad Pitt is probably the most memorable with his fine performance as Mickey; a character whose accent is deliberately almost impossible to understand at times. Overall I'd say that it doesn't matter that the film is more style than substance... that doesn't matter when it is as much fun as this. If you liked 'Lock, Stock' you will want to see this.",9,0,1,14 January 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Occasionally heavy handed but still well worth watching
","This film is inspired by real life events in the 1970s when Ron Stallworth, an officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department, infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. Officer Stallworth is actually African American and contacted the Klan by phone so when members of the local chapter ask to meet him he has to find a white officer, in this case a non-religious Jew named Flip Zimmerman, to attend any face to face meetings while he continues the phone contact. Flip is welcomed by most of the chapter but one is highly suspicious; Ron eventually finds himself talking to, and ultimately befriending David Duke, the Klan's leader. Ron also gets involved with Patrice Dumas, a local black power advocate who distrusts the police and is in the sights of the KKK.When I first heard about this film I thought it must be a comedy; the concept sounded too crazy... then I learnt that it was inspired by true events. Like many such films plenty of liberties have been taken with the actual events but the core of the story is true; a black police officer did infiltrate the Klan. The film creates an interesting narrative; from Ron Stallworth joining the police, dealing with racism there then going undercover at a black power student meeting to joining the Klan. The story does provide many amusing moments; mostly at the expense of those that deserve to be mocked, namely the Klansmen and other racists. There is also plenty of real tension as it often looks as though Zimmerman's cover might be blown. There are times when elements of the Klan's history and historical racist incidents are discussed; most potently when a character played by Harry Belafonte tells black students about the real life lynching of a seventeen year old black boy in Texas in 1916. The central cast is solid; most obviously John David Washington and Adam Driver, who play Stallworth and Zimmerman but also those playing the Klansman; they make them believably disturbing rather than just pantomime villains. On the down side the attempts to link what happened then to events in modern America is very heavy handed; we even get an epilogue showing an admittedly terrible event; something that detracted from the main story of the film... still this wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film that is well worth watching.",8,3,6,25 August 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Cold War Classic
","The cold war may have ended years ago now but this film seems both as funny and as dark as ever, with a great cast that includes Peter Sellers playing three different characters; RAF Group Captain Mandrake who is on attachment to the US Air Force, President Merkin Muffley and the eponymous Dr Strangelove, a former Nazi scientist now working for the US government.The action starts when General Jack D. Ripper orders the B-52s under his command to attack the Soviet Union, he does this because he believes that 'the evil commie plot of water fluoridation' caused his impotence.Once the authorities learn what he has done they assemble in the War Room to discuss how to prevent the planes dropping their nuclear payload on Russia. This includes both attacking Gen Ripper's airbase in an attempt to force him to give the recall codes and inviting the Soviet ambassador to the War Room to warn the Soviets and assist them in shooting down the planes.When the Russians are called we learn that they have just built the ultimate deterrent; a doomsday machine that will automatically detonate if Russia is attacked, unfortunately they have neglected to tell the world as they wanted to make a surprise announcement at a party conference in a few days.The other location in the film is one of the B-52s flying into Russia, it is captained by Major T.J. 'King' Kong, played by Slim Pickens in wonderfully over the top form.The plot doesn't sound likely material for comedy but it works wonderfully as almost all the characters appear to be slightly insane yet somehow it is possible to imagine that people like that could rise to positions of power as their insanity only shows after the attack has been launched. This is particularly true of General 'Buck' Turgidson played by George C. Scott who is more worried about the 'Commies' seeing the war room than at the prospect of global Armageddon.While the film is almost constantly amusing the ending will send a chill down the spine of most people as we see the nuclear detonations while Vera Lynn sings 'We'll Meet Again'. These detonations aren't special effects but real footage of explosions which as the film is in black and white look almost as if they were done for the film.",10,3,6,16 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Luke confronts his Nemesis
","While this is probably the weakest of the original trilogy it is still an enjoyable film with all the thrills we'd come to expect in the series and it provides a good conclusion to the saga.When the film start we learn that the Empire is building a new Death Star and Darth Vader has been sent to oversee its construction. Meanwhile on Tatooine Luke and the gang are attempting to rescue Han, who is still frozen in Carbonite, from Jabba the Hutt. Things don't appear to be going according to plan as most of them get captured and Jabba plans to execute most them by throwing them in to a pit inhabited by a strange beast. Leah however was put in a very skimpy costume and chained to Jabba which might be a fate worse than death. Not too surprisingly our heroes escape and head back to the rebel fleet.On the way Luke pays a visit to a very old friend on Dagobah to finish his training but he is told that he has finished but to become a Jedi he must face Darth Vader once more. He gets back to the fleet as they are planning their attack on the new Death Star. Before the main assault can take place they must disable the shield generator on the planet below, a mission will me lead by our heroes.On the planet they meet a strange race of creatures known as Ewoks who after a little misunderstanding is sorted out trust the group and help them confront the Imperial forces. Luke however realises that Vader is there and knows his presence is endangering the mission so he surrenders and is taken to Vader who flies with him to the Death Star where he meets the emperor and has his final battle against Darth Vader whilst the rebel fleet is attacking.As with all the original Star Wars films the isn't the cluttered CGI of the new films however some of the once great effects took dated as the blue screen scenes are fairly obvious, they are still exciting though, especially the chase though the forest on 'speeder-bikes'. The acting was good and it was nice to see Sir Alec Guinness return is a cameo as the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Ewoks do look like overgrown teddy bears but I'm sure they will appeal to the younger viewer.This review was based on an older video release so doesn't include the various updates George added later.",8,0,3,12 October 2008
Fast & Furious 6," Fast & Furious 6
","After the events in the previous film Dom, Brian and the rest of the team have retired from their lives on the wrong side of the law. Then Hobbs comes round asking for help bringing down a gang who recently attacked a military convoy in Moscow and stole a component of a weapons system. He persuades Dom to take the job by showing him a picture of Letty, his presumed dead former girlfriend, who is now working for the gang lead by Owen Shaw, a former Major in the SAS. Dom, Brian and their team assemble in London, where Shaw's gang are now located. Here is becomes apparent that Letty is indeed alive but she has no memory of her life before the accident that everybody thought killed her. After a number of incidents in London the action moves to Spain where Shaw steals the final component in the system; the team will have to take some of their greatest risks yet if they are to stop him getting away with it.If you are looking for realism then this isn't the film for you but if you want great, almost non-stop, action then you could do a lot worse. Vin Diesel and Brian O'Conner continue to impress as Dom and Brian and it was a lot of fun having these characters work with, rather than against, Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs. It was great to see Michelle Rodriguez return as Letty; having her character suffer from amnesia may be a bit of a cliché but it works as a means of explaining why she never contacted Dom and justifies having her working for the bad guys. As one would expect there is lots of great over-the-top-action; this includes explosions, gunfights and the inevitable chases one of which involves a tank! The film also goes back to its roots with a street race between Dom and Letty; they aren't trying to kill each other; just be the fastest round the course. Overall I'd recommend this to all fans of mindless action; it might not be realistic but the action is great and the whole film is a lot of fun.",8,1,2,19 February 2017
The Expendables," Explosive action with a big name cast
","As the film opens we see a group of Somali pirates preparing to execute their hostages; suddenly their leader is lit up with red laser sights and a bag lands on the deck it is the ransom money; but now he wants more; inevitable that leads to the death of the pirates and more importantly serves to introduce our heroes; a group of mercenaries led by Sylvester Stallone. The mission is a success but one of his men, Dolph Lundgren, gets carried away and has to be let go from the group. Soon after Stallone is approached by Bruce Willis; he has a job for the team; he wants them to go to a small South American island nation and depose the brutal general who is oppressing the population. Stallone goes on a reconnaissance mission with Jason Statham. The make contact with a local who just happens to be the general's daughter; not long afterwards all hell breaks loose and the two of them are lucky to get out alive. The do learn one very important fact; the general is just a pawn of a former CIA operative played by Eric Roberts. Initially they think the job is impossible and plan to turn it down but Stallone decides he can't leave the girl behind to he and the team fly south once again and this time they mean business! If you want almost non-stop action with gunfire, knife fights and huge explosions then this might be the film for you. It features some of the best known action stars from the '80s to the present day. Given the fact that Stallone isn't a young man any more I thought this might be a bit tongue in cheek but in fact it there are very few Jokey parts and Stallone still has what it takes to lead an action movie. The story isn't original; there were clear nods to 'The Dogs of War'; most notably their 'bird photographer' cover during their recon. The action is fairly relentless, especially towards the end but unfortunately it is a bit confused because everything is so dark. Over all I'd say this is worth watching but I couldn't help thinking all the main stars have been in better action films than this.",7,1,3,10 December 2012
MASH," Classic war comedy
","Having watched the television series in the seventies I was keen to see the original film, when I first watched it on television many years ago it seemed strange not to see the familiar cast however I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD when I saw it on sale recently. I'm glad I bought it as it was even better than I remembered, causing me to laugh out loud several times.The film is fairly episodic but didn't seem any weaker for that. As it follows Capt. Hawkeye Pierce and his colleagues Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest through their time at MASH 4077 during the Korean war. These doctors may have been drafted into the US Army but they have no time for military procedure. This aversion to the military way sets them at loggerheads with sticklers for the military way Majors Frank Burns and Margaret 'Hot Lips' O'Houlihan. This is a conflict that can only end badly for the two majors. Other episodes involve a dentist who is convinced that his womanising ways were just a cover for latent homosexuality when he 'fails to perform' with a nurse, a trip to Japan to perform surgery on a senator's son and a football match that is played in a less than sportsmanlike manner.The acting was great through out, making it hard to pick out any particular actor for praise although leads Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt and Sally Kellerman as Hawkeye, Trapper John, Duke and Hot Lips really need mention as their characters carry the film. Robert Altman's directing style initially made it hard to get into as he had several characters talking at once which while realistic took some getting used to, once I'd got used to it however this style gave a realistic feel to the film even during some of the more slap-stick moments.",10,1,4,6 December 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Not all fairy tales are for children
","I probably wouldn't have thought to buy this film but I heard a very positive review on the radio and thought it might be good to watch something different. I'm glad that I did as it is a fantastic film combining fantasy with brutal realism.In the beginning we are told that a princess from an underground kingdom left her realm and died and her father was waiting for her soul to return. We then see Ofelia, a young girl, reading a book of fairy tales as she and her pregnant mother are driven through Franco's Spain shortly after the civil war on their way to their new home with a captain in the Army.On the way they stop and Ofelia sees a creature that looks like a giant stick insect that she takes to be a fairy, when they continue on their journey the fairy follows them and later that night, when shown a drawing of a fairy by Ofelia changes shape to look like the image. The fairy then takes Ofelia into the labyrinth next to the mill she is living in. Here she meets the faun who tells her that she is in fact the princess mentioned at the start of the film and that she must complete three tasks to prove that her soul has not been corrupted my mortal life.Unlike many fantasy films Ofelia doesn't leave our world and remain in the fantasy world but goes there to complete a task and returns. In many ways the real world is far more frightening than the fantasy world as her mother is very ill due to complications with her pregnancy and her new step-father is a brutal man who we see casually killing and torturing people while fighting the rebels who remain in the hills.The viewer is never explicitly told whether the fantasy world is real or a creation of Ofelia's so different people will differing opinions on the matter. The acting is is very good, especially Ivana Baquero as Ofelia and Sergi López as the wicked Captain Vidal and the cinematography is stunning throughout.Be warned though, this may be a fairy tale but it is not suitable for children as there are scenes of brutal violence which may not be gratuitous as they help establish the character but certainly shouldn't be seen by youngsters.",10,0,4,29 April 2008
Blade II," Blade must fight alongside his old enemies
","As this instalment opens we see a man going to a rather sinister looking blood bank in Prague; it is run by the vampires and they intend to drain him little do they know that they are his prey. He is Nomak, a 'Reaper' or mutated vampire that will kill people and turn other vampires into a reaper like himself. Meanwhile Blade rescues his friend Whistler from his two years of captivity with the vampires. Shortly afterwards Nyssa; the daughter of the leading vampire approaches Blade with a surprising request; the vampires want his help to eliminate the reapers. He agrees but it is a very unstable alliance; many of the vampires he has been asked to fight alongside want to kill him there and then. Once the action gets underway they learn something rather worrying; the reapers aren't effected by silver of garlic only sunlight or intense ultra violet light will stop them. As the film progresses it emerges that not everything the vampires told Blade was true; in fact some facts about the reapers was even withheld from Nyssa.This film isn't quite as good as the first but it still provides plenty of entertainment. There are lots of impressively choreographed fight scenes and some spectacular vampire deaths; the use of CGI meant these looked cool rather than gruesome. Wesley Snipes impresses as Blade especially in the numerous fight scenes which he makes look real. The supporting cast is solid enough with Kris Kristofferson returning as Whistler; Ron Perlman putting an entertaining performance as the vampire Reinhardt; Leonor Varela as Nyssa and Norman Reedus, who plays Blade's new weapon designer 'Scud'. The story itself is perfectly fine if fairly predictable for the most part; there is a decent twist later on. I liked the design of the reapers; their mouths were possibly the most disturbing thing in the film. This may not be director Guillermo del Toro's best film but he does a fine job keeping it pretty dark without making it hard to see what is going on. Overall I'd say this is a decent sequel; I imagine most fans of the first film will enjoy it.",7,0,1,8 May 2017
Megamind," A villain needs a hero
","One day two alien babies were sent to Earth; one landed in a wealthy household, developed superpowers and grew up to be the superhero Metro Man; the other landed in prison, developed a powerful mind and grew up to become the supervillain Megamind this film follows the latter. The two are rivals; Megamind plots his schemes against Metro City and Metro Man thwarts them and sends him to prison. Then one day Megamind kidnaps reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who everybody believes is Metro Man's girlfriend, and waits for him to try to rescue her. He manages to captures Metro Man and fires his death ray at him knowing he will escape only he doesn't. While using a disguise he rescues Roxanne and the two grow close; until she realises who he is. He soon realises that without a hero to fight against his life has no meaning. To solve this problem he sets about creating another hero with Metro Man's powers; unfortunately the wrong man gets the powers and Metro City ends up with a much more unpleasant villain: Titan. With a new villain in town Megamind will have to change; he will have to become a hero then maybe he will win and even get the girl.This movie turned out to be a lot of fun; there are so many films centred on the superhero so it made a refreshing change have one that followed the villain. The early scenes played with the genre clichés in an enjoyable way that led up to the genuinely surprising 'death' of Metro Man. It later emerges that he isn't dead but not for quite a while. The main characters were fun; Megamind is suitably dastardly without actually being malicious; Metro Man is sickeningly perfect and Roxanne is feisty and avoids many of the character traits we would expect; notably her not being romantically interested in Metro Man. Titan is a decent enough bad guy; he is clearly not very bright and emotionally backward. The character designs are good, the animation is of a high standard and the voice cast do a fine job of bringing them to life. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for an animation that can be enjoyed by all ages.",8,0,0,25 January 2017
Alien," The Classic Horror SciFi
","It is hard to believe this film is nearly thirty years old, despite knowing when all the shocks are coming it is still frightening.As I suspect most readers will know the plot follows the crew of the Nostromo, a long range space tug. At the start of the film they are awakened from hyper-sleep and are surprised that they aren't back at Earth as planned but in a strange system where they have intercepted a possible distress beacon's message. When they investigate they find a strange alien ship that appears to have been there a very long time, the pilot has fused to his chair and his ribs are broken in a way that suggests he was killed from the inside.As they continue to explore the ship Kane (John Hurt) discovers a room full of strange leathery pods, when he touches one it opens and a strange creature jumps out, burns its way through his helmet and clamps itself onto his face. Back on the shuttle they attempt cut it off only to discover that the creature bleeds an acid so strong that a few drops burn through several of the ship's decks. After a while the creature detaches itself and dies for no apparent reason. When Kane awakes he is very hungry and wants a good meal before they go back in to hyper-sleep for the return home. During this meal the alien makes its dramatic appearance as it bursts out of Kane's stomach to the shock of his colleagues. The rest of the film follows their attempts to kill the alien which for some reason one of the crew appears to be protecting.Unlike most other science fiction films of its time Alien doesn't feature a spaceship with gleaming white surfaces instead it is a dirty claustrophobic vessel which is clearly a work horse and far from new, another difference with other such films is that the hero of the story is actually a heroine in the form of Ellen Ripley played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver in her first major role. The rest of the cast are also great as is the design of the alien, by only showing bits of it at a time it never looks like a man in a suits so remains terrifying till the end.If you've yet to see this film and like horror or sci-fi I strongly recommend that you give it a go.",10,0,1,26 August 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A macabre musical melodrama
","Being a fan of Tim Burton's films I wanted to watch this despite not being a huge fan of musicals and having a phobia about cut throat razors. I'm glad I did, as it was an enjoyable film even if I did have to look away from the screen a few times. Johnny Depp plays Sweeny Todd, a barber who has returned to London after fifteen years of penal servitude. The only crime he had committed was to fall in love and be loved by a lady who was fancied by the local judge. He soon learns that his beloved took poison and his daughter is now the ward of the judge. Heading back to his old shop he finds the downstairs premises is now Mrs Lovett's Pie Shop. This woman, played by Helena Bonham-Carter boasts that her pies are the worst in London! He is determined that he will have his revenge on those people who have wronged him, but first he must get back to work as a barber. He is soon confronted by a former employee who recognises him and threatens to report him to the authorities for returning to England. Having killed this man Mrs Lovett comes up with the ideal way to dispose of the bodyÂ… her pies will no longer be the worst in London; she will need a regular supply of meat though! This film was a lot of fun and rather dark, as one would expect from Tim Burton; it was also quite gruesome with buckets of blood being spilt. While the singing wasn't great and the songs weren't exactly what one will find oneself humming they weren't bad; the acting was good, as one would expect from this cast. As well as Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall were great; they played the judge and his odious beadleÂ… characters that made the murderous barber and the pie-maker seem positively saintly. The London of 'Sweeny Todd' never feels quite real; it looks more like the set you'd find in films made forty or fifty years ago, this combined with the singing gave it an unreal almost theatrical feel which I think added to my enjoyment.Over all if you are an adult fan of Tim Burton or any of the stars this is a must see; it is not however suitable for children; it may be a musical but it has an '18' certificate for a reason!",8,0,0,2 December 2010
Horrible Bosses," Pretty funny but not for everybody
","Nick, Kurt and Dale are three friends working for bosses who make their lives a misery. Nick's boss, Dave Harken works him hard with the promise of a promotion that never materialises; Dale, a dental assistant is sexually harassed by dentist Julia Harris and Dave's new boss is running down the business to fuel his drug habit. Eventually they can take it no more and decide their bosses have to die. Attempts to find a hitman don't go well but eventually they decide to kill each other's bosses. Inevitably it isn't quite as easy as they thought.As the characters acknowledge the basic plot is 'Strangers on a Train'/'Throw Momma from the Train'... being a comedy more of the latter. The premise is simple enough and it does provide a good number of laughs; it also manages to get near the knuckle at times as certain situations could offend some viewers... if Dale and Julia's positions had been reversed I'm sure it wouldn't have been allowed. The characters are a fun bunch; each of the bosses is unsympathetic in nicely varied ways and the three protagonists are amusingly incompetent when it comes to planning a murder. The cast is solid with Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sukeikis being amusing leads; Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell are equally fun as the titular Horrible Bosses... particularly Aniston who plays against type as the sexually predatory dentist. There is also a very funny turn from Jamie Foxx as the trio's 'murder adviser'. Overall I found this to be pretty funny but some of the material is likely to offend some viewers.",7,0,0,25 September 2018
Nacho Libre," Very silly, but also very funny
","This Jack Black comedy sees him playing Nacho, a young monk working as a cook in the remote Mexican monastery/orphanage where he was raised. As a child he dreamt of becoming a luchador, wrestler, but this is forbidden as such activities are seen as a sign of vanity. He regularly goes into town to get food for the orphans and one day he is robbed by a street thief, Steven. Shortly afterwards he sees champion masked luchador Ramses being mobbed by fans... he has a plan. He persuades Steven to become a tag-wrestler with him; if he wears a mask the monastery won't find out what he is doing. They aren't very good at wrestling but still they get paid so continue, determined to get better and turn professional so he can buy a bus for the orphans and thus impress the attractive Sister Encarnación.Not surprisingly this film is very silly; thankfully it also provides lots of laughs. Much of this is physical with fights that are funny but still feel like the characters are wrestling and some hilarious training scenes. Jack Black is hilarious as Nacho; his put-on Mexican accent is so ridiculous it is funny rather than offensive. Héctor Jiménez is equally funny as his wrestling partner Steven. The rest of the cast are solid although their characters are mostly not comically. The story doesn't deliver any real surprises but it does serve to deliver the laughs. Overall this may be fairly light weight but I'd recommend it to anybody wanting a good laugh and little to cause offence.",8,2,2,15 August 2019
Underworld Awakening," An action packed fourth instalment in the 'Underworld' franchise
","As this film opens we learn that humanity as discovered the existence of the two non-human species, vampires and lycans, and set about eliminating both. Selene, the vampire Death Dealer, and Michael, the vampire/lycan hybrid and cryogenically frozen. Twelve years later Selene escapes and is united with a girl named Eve who turns out to be her daughter. She is wanted by individuals who believes that she holds the key to their research. The action that follows will see Selene return to the lab where she had been frozen and confront numerous super-lycans to save her daughter.After missing the third film, which was a prequel, this film sees a welcome return of Kate Beckinsale as Selene; she does a fine job in the roll providing quality action scenes... as well as looking great in her tight fitting costume! The Story is solid enough; it provides some good twists and lots of thrilling action. Stephen Rea and Charles Dance add a touch of class as the Dr Jacob Lane, the films main antagonist, and a vampire elder respectively. I also liked Michael Ealy's performance as Detective Sebastian, a policeman who helps Selene, and India Eisley is solid as Eve. On the down side the CGI isn't the best and the way guns seem to be able to rapid fire a near infinite amount of ammunition without reloading is too silly. Overall I certainly wouldn't call this a great film but it is definitely worth watching if you enjoyed previous Underworld films.",7,1,1,16 August 2019
Closer," An anti-romance
","As this film opens one could be forgiven for thinking it was going to be a romantic comedy; we see a man, Dan, walking down a London street as he notices Alice, a beautiful girl with hair dyed as red as the London buses, approaching him; she turns to cross the street and is hit by a taxi. After accompanying her to the hospital they chat a bit and he reveals that he already has a girlfriend. In the next scene Dan is being photographed by another attractive woman, Anna, he kisses her than tells her that he is currently with a girl called Alice. The forth protagonist, Larry, is introduced when Dan goes to on online sex chat pretending to be a women called Anna; Dan suggests they meet at the Aquarium somewhere he knows Anna the photographer often goes. This leads to an awkward meeting between Larry and Anna which ultimately leads to a relationship then things start going wrong. There is infidelity, there is jealousy and there is hypocrisy as the relationships fracture and reform.Anybody hoping for a happy romantic comedy is going to be in for quite a disappointment; once the introductions are over there is little more in the way of romance it is all bitterness and jealousy as the characters find out what their other halves have been up to. Dan and Larry are the most hypocritical; sleeping with other women then acting as if they have been wronged when their partners tell them they have been with somebody else. The cast does a fine job making their characters believable which makes them quite unlikable. While there is a lot of talk about sex this is deliberately crude and unsexy in a way that makes for uncomfortably viewing at times. Even the scene between Clive Owen's Larry and an almost naked Alice, played by Natalie Portman, is cold rather than erotic; in fact it is far more chaste scenes such as the first view of Alice that are sexier. For the most part the film felt uncomfortably believable but there were one or two moments that didn't seem real; most notably the online chat between Dan and Larry; the text-speak looked like something only a child would use; not a doctor and a writer! Overall though I'd say this was a sharply written and well-acted film but I'm not sure that I can say I really enjoyed it as the characters aren't that likable. I'd still say it is worth watching but only if you are an older viewer; the content is both unsuitable for younger viewers and unlikely to appeal to them.",8,0,0,1 October 2015
Suicide Squad," The 'Dirty Dozen' with super-villains
","After the death of Superman those in power worry how the Earth would cope if the next super-powered being to turn up used their power to defeat rather than help humanity. To that end Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, is established; a group made up of the most dangerous super-villains who have been captured! Of course they cannot be trusted but with an explosive charge placed in their necks they might just behave. When a threat emerges they are led by Col Rick Flag to confront that threat... which just happens to involve the woman Flag loves.Even before I watched this I'd heard it was pretty terrible... I wouldn't say it was that bad but it could have been so much better. Too much of the film's opening was dedicated to showing us how the various villains got caught; something that wasn't really necessary. Then when the action started much of it was too dark... as in it was hard to see what was happening. Tonally it wasn't dark enough; these are meant to be super-villains but the film didn't seem that violent... it would have been better had it been as violent as 'Kick-Ass' or even 'Dredd' but I guess the makers wanted a teen-friendly rating. The cast are solid enough; Margot Robbie stole just about every scene she was in with her performance as the crazy and dangerous, but still likeable Harley Quinn; Jared Leto impressed as The Joker, although his character wasn't in the Squad and was sorely underused. Overall I'd say this was entertaining enough but if you expect something great you are likely to be disappointed.",7,0,0,21 April 2019
Battleship Potemkin," A silent classic
","There are many films that film fans should try to see at least once and this is one of them. Sergei Eisenstien's 1925 silent classic features the sort of techniques one still sees today but at the time were, if you'll forgive the pun, revolutionary. Set during an uprising against Tsarist oppression in 1905 the crew of the eponymous battleship have had enough of ill treatment and being served soup made from maggot-infested meat is the last straw. They refuse to eat it and the captain orders them to be shot! Luckily for them the firing squad refuses to obey their orders and soon the officers are in the sea and the men are in control of the ship; although not without the loss of the man who inspired their revolt. When the people of Odessa hear what has happened they rally in support of the men, but in one of cinema's most famous scenes many of them including women and children are gunned down on the now famous Odessa steps.Before I watched this film I must admit I didn't know what to expect; I knew it was a classic but I wasn't so sure that somebody used to modern films where people actually talk could be gripped by a film with only the occasional inter-title to give some idea of what was being said of course I needn't have worried; it is a classic for a reason. The action scenes where they take over the ship and even more so where the Cossacks gun down innocent civilians were more gripping than many of today's action directors could hope for. Being made in the Soviet Union less than ten years after the successful revolution of 1917 it is obviously a propaganda piece but that doesn't matter as the story is gripping and the action is believable. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody who can cope with the idea of watching a eighty-five year old movie.",10,3,4,23 September 2011
Taxi Driver," A classic that is still fresh after over forty years
","This 1976 classic follows Travis Bickle; an insomniac who spends his nights driving a New York taxi. Unlike other drivers he will drive anybody to any part of the city; this leads to him seeing the very worst of the city and he starts to think that something must be done about it. Initially it looks as if that might be joining the campaign for presidential candidate Senator Palantine although he is clearly more interesting in campaigner Betsy. He goes out with her a couple of times but can't see why she won't see him again after he takes her to see a pornographic film! After purchasing a small arsenal he sets about rescuing twelve year old Iris from a life of prostitution; something that leads to a bloody shootout.This film certainly won't be for everybody; it isn't easy to like our troubled protagonist and he is rarely off screen. Many other characters are even worse; director Martin Scorsese is clearly showing New York as a moral cesspit. Robert De Nero is on top form as Bickle; one of cinema's iconic characters. He makes us believe in Bickle as a real person rather than a caricature. He is brilliantly supported by Jodie Foster as Iris; it is hard to believe that a thirteen year old could give such an impressive performance. This does inevitably leads to some uncomfortable scenes as she offers herself to Bickle. Other notable performances come from Harvey Keitel, who plays Iris's sleazy pimp, and Cybil Shepherd, who plays Betsy. For the most part there isn't much violence; this makes the finale, which is very bloody, all the more shocking. Overall I'd definitely say that this deserves to be considered a classic and would say it is a must see for adult movie fans; just be prepared for some disturbing moments.",9,1,4,18 February 2017
Shutter Island," Can we believe anything we see?
","As this psychological thriller opens; we see protagonist US Marshall Teddy Daniels being sick as the boat he is aboard travels to Shutter Island; home to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. One of the patients; Rachel Solando, a woman who drowned her three children, has disappeared quite a mystery as she was meant to be locked in her room at the time. Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule set about interviewing staff and patients and soon Daniels is convinced that there is more to Shutter Island than meets the eye. It turns out Daniels has an ulterior motive for visiting the island; he believes that the man responsible for killing his wife is incarcerated there but his name appears on none of the patient lists something he sees as further evidence of something wrong going on. The more he searches the more convinced he is and starts to believe that he won't be allowed to leave the island because of what he has discovered. We also see, in flashbacks, how Daniels has been affected by his experiences in the war; most notably by what he saw at the liberation of Dachau concentration camp.Going into this I knew there were some surprises to be revealed but had no idea what they would be; and that is the best way to watch the film for the first time. The opening premise of a prisoner escaping from a locked room is interesting but not as interesting as trying to figure out what is actually going on is the story as first explained? Is there a dark secret on the island? Is our protagonist gradually going insane or is it something else? Director Martin Scorsese does a fine job keeping the tension high and keeping us guessing what is really happening until the final scene and even then some people will be debating what really happened. The cast, which includes several well-known actors, does a great job; this is especially true of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays our protagonist; we certainly believe his character's increasing paranoia but as somebody once said, 'just because you are paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you'. Overall I found this to be a taut thriller that kept me guessing to the end I'd certainly recommend it.",9,0,4,9 June 2014
Capote," I fascinating look at how Truman Capote came to write 'In Cold Blood'
","Following the murder of a family of four in a remote corner of Kansas author Truman Capote decides it will be the subject of his next article for the 'New Yorker' magazine. He heads there with his friend and research assistant Nelle Harper Lee. They interview various locals and gradually befriend the lead investigator and his wife. It isn't long before he starts to think the story is more suited to being told in a book. When two young men are arrested he befriends then and after they are convicted he continues to visit them as they wait on death row and recommends they get a better lawyer and appeal. He now has two problems; to finish the book he needs them to tell him just what happened in the house that led to the four deaths and just as importantly he needs an ending which ongoing appeals won't provide.This is a really interesting film even if you haven't read 'In Cold Blood'... perhaps more so as there is much to be learnt about the crimes. It must be stated though that this is about Capote's research, his relationship with the arrested men and the effect the story has on him. We are told what happened in the house on the night of the killings but this is a relatively small part of the story. The characters are impressively complex; most obviously Capote himself who we see manipulating the accused men and hoping for a conclusion that isn't in their interests; there is also a feeling that Smith is also trying to use Capote to save himself from the noose. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a fantastic job as Truman Capote; it is little surprise that he picked up an Academy Award for it. There is a solid supporting cast; notably from Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Clifton Collins Jr as suspect Perry Smith. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film whether you are already interested in Truman Capote or are just after a fascinating story based on real events.",9,0,0,20 June 2019
Life of Pi," Alone with a tiger in the middle of the Pacific
","This story opens with a writer visiting our protagonist; an Indian named Pi. He wants to hear the story of how Pi survived alone on a lifeboat after a shipwreck; Pi corrects himÂ… he wasn't alone he had Richard Parker for company. As Pi introduces his story we learn how he got his name, his unusual 'multi-faith' belief system and most importantly we learn that Richard Parker is an adult Bengal Tiger! His father runs a zoo in their hometown but when it looks like they can't continue running it he decides to emigrate to Canada with his family and the animals. Shortly after entering the Pacific Pi goes on deck to watch a storm then Pi finds himself thrown into a lifeboat as the ship starts to sink. He isn't alone; part of the menagerie is with himÂ… an injured zebra, an orang-utan and a vicious hyena. The hyena soon kills the zebra and orang-utan then the previously unseen tiger erupts from under a canvass and kills the hyena; it then turn its attention to Pi. He gets out of its reach and constructs a raft so he can keep away from the creature. Over the course of the film he comes to realise that Richard Parker's presence is keeping him saneÂ… while never forgetting he is still on the menu!This film was a delight. Even though we know Pi must survive to tell his tale there are plenty of tense moments and I was genuinely concerned for Pi's safety. For most of the film we are just watching Pi and the tiger; this works because both characters are so believableÂ… perhaps a little surprising when one knows the tiger didn't existÂ… it is however the best CGI I've seen; it is hard to believe it isn't real. Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a great job convincing us that he is on a small boat in the middle of the ocean with a tiger. The whole film looks great; at times it takes on an almost dream like quality as the boat is becalmed on a mirror flat sea and when the sea lights up thanks to bioluminescent plankton. Some may find the ending a bit of a cop out as it appears that much of what we have seen didn't actually happen; an alternate scenario is presented and, as Pi says, the viewer must decide which story they prefer.",9,1,3,10 December 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Back in Vegas to break the Bank
","After the events of the previous films the gang are now going straight. One of them, Ruben, is even starting his own casino in Las Vegas unfortunately his business partner Willy Banks cons him out of his half of the business and seems to find it funny when Ruben collapses and is hospitalised. Danny Ocean decides that they must get back together and take Banks for everything he's got. This won't be a conventional heist; they intend to rig a number of games so that the casino will have to pay out a massive $500,000,000 on its opening night. Since it is so personal for them they are also determined to ensure that the casino doesn't win the prestigious 'Five Diamonds' award for this casino and steal the four diamond necklaces he had made to represent the awards won by his other casinos. Obviously none of this will be easy.This is a decent enough conclusion to the Ocean's trilogy; I liked the fact that it went back to its roots in Las Vegas without becoming a remake of the original film. The plot is obviously very far-fetched but that isn't really a problem if you can suspend your disbelief. There are plenty of good laughs, most notably their efforts to make sure the casino doesn't win the Five Diamonds by tormenting the reviewer and the way the man responsible for infiltrating the factory that makes the dice for the casino to rig them starts a strike over workers' pay, nearly spoiling the gang's plans. There are moments of tension as the plan moves into operation although I doubt many viewers will think they might ultimately fail. Most of the regular cast make a welcome return although Julia Roberts is missing, which was a pity. Al Pacino is suitably unpleasant as Willy Banks; a character it is easy to dislike. Overall I'd say this wasn't quite as good as 'Eleven' but it was a definite step up from 'Twelve'; definitely worth watching if you enjoyed the first film.",7,2,2,8 December 2017
Lost in Translation," Two strangers in a strange land
","Actor Bob Harris is past his prime so instead of making popular movies he is shooting an advert for whisky in Japan; he doesn't want to be there and what is more he can't sleep. The much younger Charlotte is another American staying that the same hotel; her husband is working as a photographer and she is rather bored and also can't sleep. Bob and Charlotte seem an unlikely pair but they get chatting over a drink and start to explore Tokyo together.At first one would expect this to end up a romance despite the fact that they are both married and she is much younger than he is neither seems that happy in their marriages and films are full of older men involved with younger woman; this however is different it is just two people enjoying each other's company.The story is told at a gentle pace; some would say slow but I was never bored despite the fact that boredom is one of the things that drives our protagonists together. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both do fine jobs; there are other characters but these two are very much the centre of attention. Their characters are believable if not totally likable. There are a good number of laughs to be had along the way; many due to their difficulties understanding Japanese but not entirely. The way Tokyo is filmed, mostly at night or twilit gives the film a slightly claustrophobic atmosphere that adds to the feeling of being somewhat lost in its alien culture. Overall I found this bitter-sweet film really enjoyable although I can see how others might not be such fans.",9,0,2,20 January 2015
Tangled," An enjoyably take on the Rapunzel fairy tale
","As this story opens leading man, Flynn Rider, tells us how a sunbeam once fell to Earth and became a magical golden flower. This flower was kept by Gothal, an old woman, who used its magic to stay forever young and refuses to share its power. One day, when the pregnant queen is on the verge of death the palace guard search the kingdom and find the flower; they turn it into a medicine that saves the queen. The magic remains though; this time locked within the newborn Princess Rapunzel's hair. Gothal sneaks into the palace to steal a lock of the child's hair but as soon as she cuts it, it turns brown and loses its magic so she takes the baby. The years pass and Gothal raises Rapunzel as her own child; keeping her locked in a tall tower to 'protect' her from the dangers of the world. Rapunzel begs her mother to let her leave the tower to see the lanterns being released on her birthday but the request is refused. As luck would have it Flynn ends up in Rapunzel's tower after fleeing from the royal guard he has just stolen a priceless tiara from the palace! Rapunzel talks him into taking her to see the lanterns and along the way she learns the truth about her 'mother' and the two of them have the expected series of adventures before things appear to go wrong again.This Disney 3D animation may not have been made in collaboration with Pixar but it has a charm of its own and a distinct 'Disney' look and more importantly sound; the characters sing a succession of songs throughout the film. The story is enjoyably with plenty of action, a good number of laughs, enough scares and even an apparent tragedy that may cause a few tears to be shed if you think a Disney film could let a protagonist die. The film's PG certificate is due to the mild violence; this is mostly comical though and frequently involves frying pans so it should be okay for most children to watch unless you are worried they will copy the protagonists and batter each other with frying pans! The animation looks really good; the characters move and show emotion in a genuinely human way even though they are clearly cartoon characters rather than realistically proportioned. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Disney animation; it may not be classic hand drawn animation but it is still classic Disney.",8,1,4,26 December 2012
Interstellar," A journey across the galaxy to save humanity
","Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.",9,0,2,27 January 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick's disturbingly brilliant war film
","This film brilliantly depicts the brutality of warfare from the beginning of basic training to the battlefield, it is set during the Vietnam war but could probably have been set during any modern war.The film opens with a group of young men having their hair cut so short that they are virtually bald. We next see them in their barracks as they meet they drill instructor for the first time, he soon gives each of them nick names and we don't hear their real names again. It is clear that one of them, Private Pyles, isn't really cut out for life in the Marines Corps, whatever they are expected to do in training he seems incapable of doing it. As training progresses it is clear that Pyles is going gradually insane and we see just how insane he has become in a shocking scene on the night after the recruits have finished training and been given their assignments.The film then moves to Vietnam where we follow Private Joker who as been assigned to work for 'Stars and Stripes', the US Military's newspaper. Apart from Joker the only character from the first half of the film is Private Cowboy, Joker is reunited with him when sent to report of efforts to drive the enemy out of the city of Hue after the Tet offensive. We don't see large battles, instead the main action focuses on the engagement with a single sniper who has wounded one member of the squad in an attempt to draw the others out into the open.This is very much a film of two halves with only one character having a major role in both. While Matthew Modine is the star of the film the most memorable characters are foul mouthed Gny. Sgt. Hartman played perfectly by former US Marine drill instructor Lee Ermey and Private Pyles played by Vincent D'Onofrio. The action is believable through out, I would never have guessed that it had been filmed entirely in England if I hadn't been told even though I've been to one of the locations used many times. As one would expect from one of Kubrick's films the direction is virtually flawless and he gets the best out of his cast.I was surprised that this film has recently been reclassified down from 18 to 15 as it is fairly brutal and disturbing through out, in particular Private Pyles descent in to madness as he is bullied and humiliated relentlessly during training. That said it is still a great film that I would recommend to anybody interested in war films.",9,1,4,18 September 2008
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A search for justice... or vengeance?
","Seven months after the rape and murder of Mildred Hayes's daughter the police are no closer to catching the killer. One day Mildred drives past three billboards on a quiet road outside town; it doesn't look as if a new advert has been but up in decades. She goes to the advertising agency in town and tells them she intends to hire all three for a year. Her three adverts say: 'Raped While Dying', 'Still No Arrests?', and 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?'. This immediately gets the attention of the police; Willoughby tries to explain that he has done everything he can but the killers DNA doesn't match any on any national database and there are no other leads, he also tells her he has terminal cancer. His deputy, the violent and bigoted Officer Jason Dixon is angrier and starts threatening Mildred and those close to her. Other townspeople don't like being reminded of the incident and side with the police. As tensions rise things get dangerous and people get hurt... but will it bring Mildred any closer to getting justice for her daughter?Having seen adverts for this film it didn't particularly appeal but when I was given the DVD as a present I thought I should watch it. As it turned out I really enjoyed the film. The basic premise was interesting but it was the strength of the main characters that made the film so engrossing; and the fact that the protagonists all seemed flawed but not irredeemable only helped. Frances McDormand was on great form as Mildred Hayes; a woman who, fuelled by a sense of righteous outrage goes to extreme measures. Sam Rockwell is equally good as Dixon; a policeman whose anger is matched by his lack of intelligence and Woody Harrelson impresses as chief Willoughby. The story progresses in ways I wasn't expecting; good characters to bad things and bad characters do good things. Some of the things that happen might not be too realistic but when I watch a drama I want a good story so don't mind the odd lapse from what would really happen if somebody did what characters here get away with. The conclusion might be too open for some viewers but it worked for me. If I have one complaint it is that there is a lot of strong language; enough to put off some viewers who would otherwise be drawn to such a story. Overall I thought this was a really good story and would definitely recommend it.",9,0,3,11 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An impressive conclusion to a film series I started watching way back in '77
","As this, the ninth and final chapter in the Skywalker Saga opens Kylo Ren makes his way to the planet Exegol where he finds Emperor Palpatine. He is ordered to find and kill Rey. Meanwhile a spy aboard the First Order fleet passes on a message warning that the Emperor is back and is will destroy any world that doesn't surrender. Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron and others must find a way to get to Exegol and stop the Emperor before it is too late. Inevitably this won't be easy and they will have to visit new worlds, face threats both new and old and make new friends.When I first watched 'Star Wars' it was in the cinema when I was ten years old in 1977 and I, like all my friends, was awestruck. All these years later I may not be quite as awestruck watching this on DVD but I still really enjoyed it. The story provides lots of excitement and characters I care about; some like Rey and Finn first appeared in this trilogy, others like Leah and Luke have been there from the start. I wasn't expecting any real surprises but one was delivered... which I won't spoil here. There were also some genuinely emotional moments. The cast does a fine job; I particularly liked Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey. It was a treat to see many of the cast of the original films returning; it was especially poignant to see Carrie Fisher's final performance. As one would expect the special effects were top notch. I know a lot of people were disappointed but I really liked it and would say it is a must see for Star Wars fans... love it or loathe it; decide for yourself.",9,12,50,22 April 2020
Pacific Rim," Mechas vs Monsters!
","In the near future giant monsters known as kaiju start attacking cities around the Pacific Rim, they have come through an interdimensional portal called 'The Breach'. The kaiju are virtually impervious to attacks from normal weapons so giant robots known as Jaegers are constructed; each is piloted by two pilots who must link minds to control their Jaeger. At first it looks as if humanity has gained the upper hand but things get worse and soon only a few Jaegers remain. Working out of Hong Kong their leader, Stacker Pentecost, brings ex-pilot Raleigh Becket, who is haunted by the loss of his brother/co-pilot, back into the Jaegers where he is partnered with new pilot Mako Mori. As the attacks increase in frequency the remaining Jaegers will have to attempt to destroy the breach; a dangerous mission which if they fail could be the end of mankind.Even though I'd heard good things about this film I wasn't expecting anything too great and as it started I soon thought all the tedious clichés would be appearing again many of them did but I also found myself enjoying the film. The cast doesn't include many well-known actors; the only two I recognised were Idris Elba and Ron Perlman and the latter only has a small role. This didn't matter though as they all did a decent job. Charlie Hunnam may be playing a cliché action hero as Raleigh but he makes the character sympathetic and Rinko Kikuchi is likable as Mako. Also notable are Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who provide some levity as scientists Dr. Newton Geiszler and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb. While the story and characters are good this film is really about the action between the kaiju and the jaegers and I must say it was pretty impressive even when watched on a small screen cities are devastated and at one point a jaegers beats a kaiju with a ship! Overall this might not be the greatest of films but if you are looking for large scale action involving giant robots you could do a lot worse and as there is little to cause offence it can be enjoyed by younger viewers too.",7,0,2,16 May 2015
American Sniper," Bradley Cooper does a fine job playing sniper Chris Kyle
","This film is based on the story of Chris Kyle, a sniper in the US Navy Seals who earning to sobriquet 'The Legend' for the number of enemy combatants he killedÂ… more than any other member of the US Armed Forces.The action opens in Iraq as he observes a woman giving what appears to be a grenade to a small boy; as the child runs towards US troops he must decide whether or not to take the shot. We then flash back to his childhood in rural Texas. Here his is taught to shoot by his father and also to stand up to bullies. As he grows up he becomes a ranch hand and rodeo starÂ… then he hears the news of terrorist attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and enlists in the Navy. He trains and eventually becomes a sniper with the elite Navy Seals. During this time he meets and marries Taya. Then the unthinkable happens; terrorists fly planes into the World Trade Center in New York and the rest is history.We then return to Iraq and see that he takes the shot; the child is dead but he has saved lives. As his tour progresses he quickly becomes known for the number of enemy combatants he has killed. He is soon helping to hunt a particularly vicious enemy known as 'The Butcher' as well as an enemy sniper who had previously competed at the Olympics. After the tour he returns home but he isn't the same; his mind is still in Iraq. He returns for three more tours before finally returning home to his wife and two children but is still troubled.Before watching this film I knew how Chris Kyle's story ended but not much else about him; this meant the details that were changed to make the film more dramatic didn't spoil it for me. Director Clint Eastwood tells the story in a no nonsense manner; there is little in the way of gung-ho flag waving nor is there condemnation of the war. Instead we see men doing a dangerous job in a dangerous place and the consequences it has for them. The action sequences are intense, especially the climactic battle which ends in a sandstorm. This scene brilliantly captured the confusion of war as we can hear gunfire but can only see the occasional silhouette. Bradley Cooper does a great job in the lead role; bringing an intensity to the character without making him some sort of super-soldier. Sienna Miller is fine in the supporting role of Taya; showing how those thousands of miles from the battlefield struggle while their loved ones are in danger. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for a good modern war film that doesn't shy away from showing the effects of war on those who take part.",8,15,20,7 February 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," An enjoyable but gentle dig at the importance of fashion
","Andrea 'Andy' Sachs has recently graduated and hopes to become a serious journalist; when sent for an interview at 'Runway', a prestigious fashion magazine, she sees it as a possible gateway despite having no interest in fashion. Nobody there expects Miranda Priestly, the magazine's domineering editor in chief, to offer her a job but to everybody's amazement she is made her second personal assistant. She is completely out of her depth but gradually manages to impress. This with the help of Nigel, the art director, who provides her with the right clothes for the job and Christian Thompson, a writer, who helps her with an 'impossible' task. As Andy works all hours to impress Miranda her relationships with her boyfriend and friends suffer and ultimately she starts to become somebody she never thought she could be as she first takes a job that somebody else had been looking forward to all year then, while trying to be kind, accidentally costs somebody else the opportunity of a lifetime.I have to admit that on the face of it this isn't my type of film but sometimes it is good to watch something different and I certainly don't regret watching this. The story may be fairly conventional but it is fun to watch. There are one or two enjoyable twists but nothing too major. Anne Hathaway does a really fine job as Andy and Meryl Streep dominates every scene she is in just as her character Miranda dominates those around her. They are ably supported by Emily Blunt as Miranda's first assistant, Emily, Stanley Tucci as Nigel and Simon Baker as Christian. Overall I enjoyed this more than I expected despite not being interested in the world of fashion I couldn't tell the difference between Prada and Primark but while watching I cared about the characters and enjoyed the story.",Null,1,2,8 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better but not perfect
","While this film is by no means a masterpiece I'll always have a soft spot for it as it was the first film I ever saw on DVD. It is a step up from the previous instalment with a better story and more excitement.Set a decade after the events in The Phantom Menace this film has a darker tone; we see far less of comedy relief Jar Jar Binks and Anakin is no longer a child but an almost fully trained Jedi. As the film opens we learn that Padmé is no longer the queen but the senator representing Naboo and somebody is trying to kill her. Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to protect her and in doing so learn that a weapon used was made on the planet Kamino which strangely appears in no records.Obi Wan heads to the site Kamino is meant to be Anakin takes Padmé back to Naboo where they grow closer then they should. On Kamino Obi Wan discovers that a vast army of clones is being prepared apparently at the request of a Jedi who had died ten years ago. Also there is the man this army was cloned from, a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, and his son Boba. When Obi Wan attempts to take him back to be questioned by the Jedi council he manages to escape but not before Obi Wan can put a tracking device on his ship which enables him to follow Jango to the planet Geonosis where a droid army is being constructed.Meanwhile back on Naboo Anakin is being haunted by dreams of his mother and decides he must return to Tatooine to help her. There he learns that she is no longer a slave and has got married, unfortunately a month before she was captured by Tuskan Raiders. He sets off to rescue her but is too late as she dies shortly after he finds her, in a fit of blind rage he slaughters everybody in the encampment.On returning to his ship he learns that Obi Wan has been captured on Geonosis so along with Padmé he heads there to attempt a rescue but this doesn't go according to plan and they too are captured and sentenced to death along with Obi Wan. They manage to break free but are still trapped in a large arena with three deadly creatures trying to kill them thankfully Mace Windu and the other Jedi arrive to help them fight the battle droids.Most of the major characters in film appeared in the previous film although Anakin is now played by Hayden Christensen. His character changed quite a lot too, instead of being a fun loving young boy he has become a whining teenager. The CGI seemed better than the previous film thus the battle scenes were much more believable. The dialogue has also improved but still contains several less than impressive one-liners, the romantic scenes between Padmé and Anakin don't seem very believable proving that George does special effects not people.If you liked The Phantom Menace or even thought it was just okay then I think this a film you would enjoy. I would certainly recommend watching that film before viewing this. The darker tone of this means it might not be suitable for very young children.",7,1,4,30 September 2008
Corpse Bride," Delightfully Dark
","Having seen The Nightmare Before Christmas many times, and loving it, I had to see The Corpse Bride when it came out on DVD. At first I was a little disappointed as it lacks the memorable songs of the earlier film. When I watched it again I found that it had grown on me. It may lack the songs but it has a delightfully dark story, the animation is brilliant and the voice actors all do a great job.Victor, the son of a successful fishmonger is due to marry a woman he has never met; Victoria who is the daughter of a pair of bankrupt aristocrats who think that Victor's family are beneath them but sanction the union as they need the money. When they meet the day before the wedding Victor and Victoria get on very well, unfortunately Victor is so nervous he can't remember his wedding vows at the rehearsal. He goes for a walk in the woods to practise his vows alone and eventually gets them right, as he doesn't have his bride-to-be with him he slips the ring onto the 'finger' of a hand shaped branch which is sticking out of the ground. Of course it isn't really a branch but the arm of Emily a woman who had been murdered on her wedding night.He flees but after running into a tree he wakes to find himself in the underworld where he is distressed to find that he is married to Emily, the eponymous corpse bride. Meanwhile in the world of the living Victoria's parents are less than impressed at Victor's disappearance so when eminently more suitable Lord Barkis says that he finds Victoria delightful and he'd never treat her the way Victor has they quickly decide that he should marry her instead. Of course there is more but I wouldn't want to spoil it.This film is a lot of fun and I'm sure most people will really enjoy it, it is suitable for all but the most timid of children. As stated before the animation is fantastic, I especially liked how the world of the living was very grey but the underworld was full of bright colours.",8,0,0,27 June 2009
Romeo + Juliet," A modern version of the greatest love story
","There isn't much to say about the story of 'Romeo and Juliet' as it is probably the greatest and best love story written. In the city of Verona the Montague and Capulet families are mortal enemies. That is until one day Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet meet and fall in love; knowing that their families won't tolerate their relationship they marry in secret. While no one else knows of the union Romeo intervenes in an argument between his friends and Tybalt, one of the Capulets; he refuses to fight even when Tybalt attacks him. Coming to Romeo's defence his friend Mercutio is killed by Tybalt who in tern is slain by Romeo. For this crime Romeo is banished and Juliet's parents arrange for her to be married to another suitor not knowing she is already wed. To solve the problem the priest gives Juliet a drug that will make her appear dead and writes a letter to Romeo explaining the situation. Romeo does not get this letter and when he hears Juliet is dead he returns to Verona and takes poison himself. Juliet wakens as he is taking it but by then it is too late; he is dying, she then takes his gun and shoots herself.Director Baz Luhrmann has brought a new twist to this old story; setting it in the present day. Surprisingly the Shakespearian language doesn't seem out of place, instead it comes across as the local dialect and references to 'swords' continue to work as we are shown that they are makes of guns. Leonardo diCaprio and Claire Danes are great in the lead roles; there is a real chemistry between their characters. Harold Perrineau is also notable as Mercutio; his opening scene is one that once seen you will never forget he is in drag wearing a silver costume, matching wig and bright red lipstick! Forcing school children to study the scripts often spoils Shakespeare; it was always intended to be watched as it is performed; in his day on the stage but now film brings another way to see it. This version might not be the most traditional but I think it could be one of the best ways of introducing somebody to his works.",9,0,0,4 March 2011
"Monsters, Inc."," Another delightful film from Pixar
","James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan and his friend Mike Wazowski work for 'Monsters Incorporated; the company that provides power in the city of Monstropolis like everybody else in the city they are monsters; Sulley is a blue bear like creature and Mike is a green ball on legs with one huge eye. To generate the power monsters go through doors that act like portals to the human world and scare children; the problem is children scare as easily as they used to. It isn't considered a safe job either; the monsters believe that if the child touches them they will die and any item accidentally brought back much be vigorously decontaminated; along with the monster who brought it back. Sulley is the champion scarer although his rival Randall Boggs isn't far behind. Randall has a plan to revolutionise the scaring process, when Sulley stumbles upon this scheme he accidentally releases a two year old human child into Monstropolis when she is spotted it causes a city wide panic. Sulley and Mike sneak her back into work but getting her home will be quite and adventure!This Pixar film was a delight from start to finish; Sulley and Mike were great protagonists, Randall was a suitable slimy villain and the girl, who Sulley dubbed Boo, was really cute. The animation was up to Pixar's usual high standards; the hair on Sulley looked almost real and the chase sequence towards the end looked great; it gave a real sense of motion even on a small screen! The voices are provided by top Hollywood stars including John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly; all of whom demonstrate they can do voice acting just as well as they can do live action. The story was simple enough for young children to follow but enjoyable enough for their parents and adults who in touch with their inner child to enjoy. There are lots of laughs and just the right number of mild scares. I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to anybody looking for a fun film that is suitable for all ages.",9,0,1,24 September 2012
Ant-Man," The world's smallest superhero!
","After three years in prison cat burglar Scott Lang finds it difficult to find work so soon gets involved in a robbery. His criminal contacts have learnt about an old man with a massive safe in his basement they don't know what it contains but given the security it must be valuable. He is rather surprised to discover that all it contains is what looks like an old biker-suit. He takes it and tries it on later suddenly he shrinks to the size of an ant! It turns out the suit's owner, Dr Hank Pym, intended for him to steal it he wants somebody who is a skilled burglar to use the suit for a very specific job. Initially Scott isn't interested but inevitably he is soon pulled in. Hank explains how the suit works and tells Scott that he is worried because his former protégé Darren Cross has replicated the technology and intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Scott won't be working alone; he will have support from Hank, his daughter Hope, his three criminal friends and lots of ants it turns out Dr Pym has developed technology that enables ants to be telepathically controlled! Ultimately Scott, in his Ant-Man suit will have to face Cross who is wearing his fully armed 'Yellowjacket' suit.Not being a comic reader I wasn't familiar with Ant-Man before this film came out but when heard about it I thought the premise sounded rather fun and so it is. There are some humorous moments, mostly provided by Scott's criminal friends; these are fun and don't detract from the story. Scott/Ant-Man is a good protagonist as he isn't a typical superhero; he has no natural superpowers and the technology he uses wasn't invented by himself. Paul Rudd does a fine job in the role and is ably supported by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly as Dr Pym and Hope. Corey Stoll is suitably menacing as Cross and Michael Peña, Tip 'T.I.' Harris and David Dastmalchian are fun as Scott's criminal friends. The special effects are very impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and accept that Ant-Man can change size and interact with actual ants. I liked the fact that while it is made clear that this film takes place in the same reality as other Marvell superhero films it doesn't guest star any other well-known superheroes just one less well known one in a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates an Avengers facility to steal a needed piece of equipment. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the superhero genre; it is lots of fun and has plenty of exciting moments.",8,1,1,27 November 2017
21 Jump Street," A really funny action comedy
","This action-comedy opens back in 2005 where we are introduced to protagonists Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko while they are still at school. Schmidt is hard working but definitely not cool enough to get a pretty girl to go to the prom with him; Greg is athletic and considered cool but his academic record is so bad he is banned from attending the prom. Cutting to 2012 they have both joined the police; it isn't what they expected though; first they are given the job of patrolling a park on bicycles a job they manage to make a mess of. They are then transferred to 21 Jump Street, a programme to put young undercover cops into high schools. Their task is to find out who is behind the production of a new synthetic drug that has already killed one student. They are given student profiles fitted to their individual skills; unfortunately they prepare so poorly that they don't bother learning their undercover names and end up having to try to be plausible playing the other's role.This film was much better than I expected; there were lots of genuinely hilarious moments as well as some surprisingly good action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry as Schmidt and Jenko; they provided plenty of laughs throughout; they may have looked a bit old for high school students but that wasn't really a problem, after most high school films cast people who are much older than their characters at least here the characters are actually meant to be older. The rest of the cast is pretty solid too; notably Ice Cube, as the gruff Captain Dickson; Brie Larson who plays Molly, a girl Schmidt gets involved with and Rob Riggle, as PE teacher Mr. Walters. The comedy won't be to everybody's taste but I thought it was hilarious for the most part; it certainly didn't go quite as far into gross out territory as many recent comedies the one possible exception to this is a scene where a bad guy becomes 'less of a man' after being shot in the groin then tries to pick up what he lost with his teeth! Hilarious? Disturbing? Disgusting? You decide! Overall I'd certainly recommend this to viewers wanting a good laugh with some decent action.",8,0,0,12 February 2017
Bridget Jones's Diary," More com than rom
","The titular Bridget Jones is in her early thirties, smokes too much, drinks too much, thinks she is overweight and most worryingly for her single. Her mother tries to set her up with stuffy lawyer Mark Darcy but she takes an instant dislike to him. Instead she ends up dating her boss, Daniel Cleaver, who is clearly a cad and a bounder who claims Darcy once took the woman he was engaged to. Over the course of the film she comes to realise she is with the wrong man but by then it might be too late.I probably wouldn't have picked up this film if it hadn't been on the 50p bargain shelf at the local charity shop I'm glad that I did though as it was a lot of fun. There are plenty of great laugh out loud moments and Texan Renée Zellweger does a great job as the English Bridget. She is ably supported by a cast of well-known British actors; most notably Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as Darcy and Cleaver it was particularly fun watching Grant play the cad rather than the sympathetic male lead; not that he plays the two all that differently! It was also a highlight to see the two scrapping; not a well-choreographed fight but a believable brawl with them kicking, punching and grabbing each other in a messy but realistic and hilarious way. Overall an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half; it may be considered a bit of a 'chick-flick' but blokes can enjoy it too!",8,0,0,4 November 2014
American Hustle," A great '70s look and an enjoyable story
","It is 1978 and conman Irving Rosenfeld has been forced to help the FBI set up a sting against a New Jersey mayor who wants to see casinos developed in Atlantic City. After this brief introduction the action jumps back some time and we see Irving meeting his business partner/ mistress Sydney Prosser. They work their cons together until Sydney is caught in an FBI sting by agent Richie DiMaso; he gives them a choice; either they work with him to entrap much bigger players or she goes to jail. DiMaso's boss isn't keen on his operation; especially when he starts going after senior politicians, the mob and requests large sums of FBI money to impress their targets. If this wasn't enough Irving's wife is somewhat unstable and he isn't happy when Sydney gets close to DiMaso.The opening scene introduces protagonist Irving perfectly; we see him walking around with his paunch on show and rather bald; he then proceeds to glue a hairpiece on and carefully sculpt his remaining hair about it; he is clearly vain and a phoney. This leads to a quick and effective introduction to the other main characters and the situation. The cast which is loaded with big name actors such as Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner do a great job making the story believable. There are plenty of amusing moments but there is also a sense of danger once our protagonists start getting involved with the mob. The '70s time period was nicely captured with clothes and hair that came close to parodying the era; seeing Bradley Cooper with rollers in his hair and sporting a 'Medallion Man' look was hilarious and the necklines of Amy Adams' dresses plunged to a level that bordered in indecent when people say the '70s were 'The decade that taste forget' they meant this sort of look!",8,0,3,30 September 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," A thrilling conclusion
","Having enjoyed the first two Bourne films I looked forward to seeing this one and I wasn't disappointed.Surprisingly this film opens with Bourne still in Moscow just after the car chase in the previous film; in fact the majority of this film takes place between then and when he telephones Landy in New York as seen at the very end of the previous film. Somebody in the CIA decides to leak certain information to a reporter working for the Guardian; this person makes the mistake of mentioning 'Operation Blackbriar' on a mobile phone, this is intercepted by the CIA and they soon have a team ready to pick him up in London. What they don't know is that the person he is planning to meet is none other than Jason Bourne who is still trying to learn about his past. The meet goes wrong when the reporter is shot but Bourne gets his note book which leads him to Madrid where he runs in to Nicky in the apartment of the reporters contact. Soon they are on the run together, following the contact to Tangier. Here we are treated to a dramatic rooftop chase as Bourne and Nicky are chased by the local police and an assassin who has been ordered to kill them both. He then heads to New York where he can finally find out who he really is.As in the previous films Matt Damon is great as our hero Jason Bourne and Julia Stiles does well in the roll of Nicky, the other actors are convincing too. Once again there is plenty of action which is well directed and we get a nice conclusion to the story.",9,1,2,8 December 2008
10 Things I Hate About You," 'The Taming of the Shrew' in a '90s high school
","This film, loosely based on Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' is set in a high school near Seattle. New student Cameron James is smitten by Bianca Stratford; there are two major problems though; she is keen on the wealthy Joey Donner, who also likes her, and her father has banned her and her older sister Kat from dating till they graduate high school. This latter rule is changed to state that Bianca can only date when her sister does... potentially a stricter rule as she appears to show only contempt for boys and they are all scared of her. Cameron tutors her hoping to get closer and when he learns of the rule he, and his friend Michael, plot to find a boyfriend for Kat. The candidate for this role is bad boy Patrick Verona; he will need some persuading though. Here things get complicated as he approaches Joey suggesting he pay Patrick to date Kat... inevitably things get a bit messy.The way the film ends won't surprise too many people but how we get there is fun and provides plenty of laughs. The cast does a fine job; most notably Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as Patrick and Kat respectively; they have a good chemistry that makes the potential relationship seem believable. Other notable performances come from Larisa Oleynik; as the pretty, and not as vacuous as she first seems, Bianca; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron and Andrew Keegan as the vain Joey. If you are a fan of high school romances I expect you will enjoy this. It has many good characters; both the teens, their teachers and the Stratford sisters' father. While it doesn't reference its source material as much as 'The Easy A', for example, there are plenty of nods with references to other Shakespeare works in class and even the sisters' surname. Overall this is definitely one to watch if you are a fan of the genre.",9,1,2,25 March 2019
Fargo," A bleak thriller with some dark laughs
","Set in the bleak snow covered country side of the American Midwest car dealer Jerry Lundegaard has hit upon a scam to fun a business venture; he pays a couple of crooks, Carl and Gaear, to kidnap his wife; then when her wealthy father pays the ransom they will divide it between them; he also provides them with a new car. The kidnap goes ahead as planned but as the kidnappers drive through Brainerd they are pulled over by a state trooper; Carl tries to talk his way out of the ticket but Gaear pulls out a gun and kills to policeman; then when Carl is disposing of the body Gaear gives chase to a car that drives past the scene and shoots its too occupants. Local police chief, the heavily pregnant Marge Gunderson is called out and sets about investigating the brutal triple murder. It isn't long before Jerry's plan starts to unwind; the kidnappers start demanding all the ransom, Jerry's father in law insists that he will deliver the money and Marge starts quizzing him about the criminal's car.This Cohen brothers' film is a great thriller with a great cast including Frances McDormand, William H Macy and Steve Buscemi as Marge, Jerry and Carl. There are some laughs to be had and these serve to make the violent moments all the more shocking. The bleakness of the crime is brilliantly mirrored by the bleakness of the landscape; flat, snow covered and so overcast they the horizon in frequently invisible... it makes one cold just to look at it! The characters are interesting; Jerry is basically a loser, Carl is somewhat overcome by the events and gets more violent as things spiral out of control, Gaear hardly says a word but acts as though the events are the sort of thing that happen every day and I don't recall seeing a film where the leading investigator was a pregnant woman! This is definitely not a film for younger viewers but I heartily recommend it to any adult looking for a great drama that is a little different.",10,1,3,20 September 2012
Rush," A gripping real life tale of rival F1 racing drivers
","This film tells the story of the rivalry between two very different racing drivers; Austrian Niki Lauda and Briton James Hunt. The former is very precise, studying the track in detail and doing everything he can to optimise his car and his performance; the latter is a bit of a playboy, living life to the full and willing to take a chance if it might net him a victory. This isn't set in the modern era, where serious accidents are rare, but in the seventies when crashes were common and every year saw drivers killed on the track.We see how Hunt and Lauda first meet in Formula Three before finding their way to the top flight in Formula One. Once there Lauda has the better car and becomes world champion first. By 1976 they are both in great cars but Lauda still takes a large early lead but after a horrific accident in Germany he is hospitalised and Hunt starts to close the points gap; it looks like, barring accidents, Hunt can't fail to overtake Lauda's point score. Then Lauda defies all the odds and medical advice to return to the race track it looks as though the championship will be much closer than expected.Director Ron Howard does a great job of capturing the '70s feel and the tensions between the two rivals; somewhat exaggerated for the film. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl are great, as Hunt and Lauda respectively, they make their rivalry and subsequent growing respect utterly believable. As well as seeing the pair compete on the racetrack we are also shown their personal lives and how that affects their performance and attitudes on the track. The race scenes are utterly gripping and even those who know what happened in 1976 will feel the tension. These scenes felt real; something helped by the fact that the English race commentator sounded just like Murray Walker, possibly the most famous F1 Commentator. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for a great story with plenty of excitement; being a fan of F1 certainly isn't essential.",9,0,1,7 September 2016
Predator," Violent sci-fi action in the jungles of Central America
","This is a classic '80s 'Arnie' film with plenty of violent action so if you liked previous films like 'The Terminator' and 'Commando' you are bound to like this too. Once again there is a large body count as our heroes first wipe out a rebel camp then find themselves hunted by the predator of the title.The film opens with a short scene where a spaceship drops off a smaller craft which we see descend to Earth... we are not shown what it contained. We then join Arnie and his team of military experts who are given the job of flying in to a war torn Central American country to rescue a friendly local politician from the rebels. They are joined by CIA officer Dillon, played by Carl Weathers, who seems to know more about the mission than he is saying. It is soon clear that this isn't going to be a routine mission when they find the remains of the previous rescue mission skinned and hanging from a tree. When they find the rebels they kill them all apart from Anna, a young woman who they take with them. It is after this that the Predator really joins the story as it starts to pick off members of the team. At first they don't believe Anna when she tells them that 'the jungle came alive' but soon realise that while that isn't literally true there is something out there that isn't human.The action is pretty exciting throughout the film, it is also fairly violent with people dying after being shot, blown up, set on fire or impaled by a thrown machete.. and this is just the early scene where our heroes take on the rebels. As well as Arnie doing well in the lead role as Dutch the other actors do a decent job, especially the always good Bill Duke as Mac. The special effects are great for a pre-CGI film, especially the look of the predator's chameleon-like armour.Even though I don't think this was as good as 'Alien' in the space-monster genre I'd recommend this to any fans of '80s action movies as this is a great example of the type.",8,1,2,21 October 2009
Nightcrawler," Jake Gyllenhaal excels as a sociopathic freelance cameraman
","Louis Bloom is a low level thief in Los Angeles until one day he stops because of a car crash. Here he sees a freelance cameraman filming the aftermath. Louis asks why he is filming such a thing and is told that local news stations pay top dollar for such footage the grizzlier the better. He sells some stolen property to buy a cheap video camera and police scanner. At the first potential story he attends the police tell him to leave because he is getting to close; but he has the footage and sells it to a local TV station. News director Nina Romina tells him that she is impressed by his work and that he should bring any more stories to her. Soon his footage is appearing on screen regularly; as time passes he buys better equipment and takes on an assistant, who he pays a pittance. He frequently goes too far; entering properties and even moving a body at a car crash to get a better shot but that is only the start. What he is prepared to do to get a story escalates till one day he hears a message about a home invasion in a well-to-do area; he is minutes away and not only gets there before the police arrive but also before the criminals have left; he films the villains as they flee then enters the house and films the victims; three dead people. The footage in the house is aired but he holds back footage that shows the killers he wants to make sure that he has their arrest on camera; preferably in a public place.This is a darkly comic film with a protagonist who is clearly a sociopath; he may not be as obviously psychotic as American Psycho's Patrick Bateman but he is clearly cut from the same cloth. Jake Gyllenhaal is on brilliant form as Bloom; he makes the character entirely believable in a world where violence dominates the news; not foreign wars but murder and accidents in affluent Los Angeles it is made clear early on that poor, non-white victims barely count in this macabre ratings war. He is ably supported by Rene Russo who plays Nina, a character who is more than willing to sacrifice morals for ratings and Riz Ahmed, who plays Bloom's assistant Rick; the closest the film has to a moral character. While this isn't really an action film there are still exciting moments; most notably a really good car chase in the film's closing scenes as Bloom and Rick film the police chasing after the killers as high speed. Given the sort of footage Bloom is after it is of no surprise that there are some fairly gory moments as we see the aftermath of violent events. Overall I'd recommend this although I would point out that it certainly won't be for everybody thanks to its amoral protagonist and the subject matter.",9,1,1,7 May 2017
Léon: The Professional," A Tale of a hit-man and a young girl
","Matilda was a young girl living with an uncaring family until one day that family was killed by corrupt DEA officials and she seeks sanctuary with her neighbour Leon. While she didn't care about most of her family she loved her younger brother and asks Leon to help her get revenge on those responsible for his death.Natalie Portman puts in a fine performance as Matilda in what is one of her best roles to date and Jean Reno is good as the quiet killer Leon, however the film is stolen by Gary Oldman playing Stansfield, the corrupt DEA officer in brilliantly over the top fashion.The story is fairly exciting throughout, especially during a siege where Leon and Matilda are surrounded by a large number of heavily armed police. The only week scene in my mind was when Leon was teaching her how to shoot a sniper's rifle and when she fires we learn she wasn't using live ammunition but some sort of paint-ball, it just seemed a bit of a cop out.. perhaps it was thought having a young girl killing a random person would have led to problems with the censors.",9,1,4,28 May 2008
Oblivion," Solid sci-fi where things aren't what they seem
","As this film opens narrator/protagonist Jack Harper explains the situation to us; the film is set some time after a war during which the Earth was attacked by aliens dubbed 'Scavs'; these Scavs destroyed the moon which led to cataclysmic events on Earth and although the Scavs were defeated humanity was forced to relocate to Titan. In order to provide energy for those on Titan the Earth's oceans are used a fuel for giant fusion reactors. Jack is a technician who works, with colleague Victoria, to maintain the drones that protect the reactors from the few remaining Scavs. In order to protect the Earth's secrets they have both had their memories wiped before their five year mission.Despite this memory wipe Jack dreams of a woman who he has apparently not met before and has an interest in pre-war items he finds. Everything changes for Jack when a pre-war spacecraft returns to Earth; the drones eliminate all but one of the survivors the woman of Jack's dreams. He soon learns that nothing was quite what he believed; friends become enemies and enemies become friends as he must decide how to save humanity and the woman he loves.I didn't know much about this film before watching it; just the blurb on the DVD box and the fact that it starred Tom Cruise this is probably the best way to go into the film as there is an enjoyable sense of mystery as we wonder what Jack's dreams mean and start to question the 'facts' he has told us. There are hints that things aren't quite what they seem but nothing definite until the 'big revelation' half way through the film and even then not everything has been revealed. This gradual revealing of the truth kept me gripped. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack and he is ably supported be Andrea Riseborough as Victoria and Olga Kurylenko as the woman in his dreams. Morgan Freeman also puts in a solid performance but his part is much smaller than his second billing would lead one to expect. The special effects are great; I especially liked the aircraft Jack uses and the tower he and Victoria are based in one could almost believe they were real. While this isn't really an action film there are moments of impressive action including a fight between Jack and another technician who looks remarkably familiar. Overall I found this to be a really enjoyable film that fans of sci-fi and Tom Cruise are likely to enjoy.",8,1,2,1 October 2015
Burn After Reading," A sub par film from the usually excellent Coen Brothers
","The first review I heard of this film was fairly negative but I took it with a pinch of salt as the reviewer didn't like 'The Big Lebowski' or ' Oh Brother Where Art Thou', both of which I really enjoyed, unfortunately he was right this time. If I hadn't read on the DVD box that it was meant to be a comedy I wouldn't have realised for much of the film. A comedy really needs to get a few good laughs in the opening scenes which this sadly lacks, in fact the funniest scene is right at the end when its a bit late to grab the viewer's attention.The film starts with CIA agent Osbourne Cox quitting the agency when he is demoted. He decides to write his memoirs which leads to trouble when his wife copies his computer files as she thinks they may contain financial information she could use when she divorces him. The disc with the files is lost in a gym and found by two less than intelligent employees who see it as an opportunity to make some money, little knowing that the information on it is fairly low level. Against this spy story we also have Cox's wife having an affair with Treasury agent Harry Pfarrer who is also involved with one of the two gym employees.The actors did a good enough job as one would expect from such big names, although I thought the best performance came from J.K. Simmons in his small role as an unnamed CIA Superior which provided more laughs than the rest of the film did. Some viewers might be put off by the constant swearing and while it isn't a particularly violent film there is one scene where somebody is shot which is bloody and shocking.I can't really recommend buying this to anybody who isn't a completist who needs to see every film of a particular actor or the Coen Brothers. It might be worth watching when it is on television if there is nothing better on.",4,4,9,30 September 2009
Watchmen," Not all superheroes are nice
","When I saw just how long this film was I nearly decided to give it a miss but I am glad that I didn't as the two hours forty minutes flew past. Set in an alternative 1980s where President Nixon is in his third term and superheroes exist. This is not a happy reality though; the superheroes have retired and for the most part are living ordinary lives assuming they aren't dead or insane and the world is in the brink of nuclear war as the Soviet Union prepares to invade Afghanistan. Against this backdrop 'The Comedian' one of the heroes is murdered. Another of them, Rorschach, is determined to track down the killer before any more of them are killed. As he searches we are introduced to the rest of his group of superheroes, known as The Watchmen; we are shown their back-stories as well as learning what they are up to now; Dr. Manhattan is working on an energy source with his assistant the beautiful Laurie Jupiter, Adrian Veidt is the world's most intelligent man and Dan Dreiberg is living a comparatively normal life. Their search will lead them into extreme danger as well as teaching them some things about themselves that they did not know.I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this film; I really liked the film noir aesthetics such as the voice-overs and the consistently dark tone. These heroes may be super but many of them are not nice; in fact more then one of them are bordering on being sociopaths! There was a time when superhero films were for children; this certainly isn't as it includes some fairly extreme violence, swearing and even some sex and nudity. The acting was pretty solid throughout and the special effects were great; all to often the CGI used in action films looks too unbelievable but here I didn't find my suspension of disbelief broken even during the most impossible scenes. I can't comment on how true the film is to the original characters and story of the graphic novels as I haven't read any of them but as a stand-alone film I heartily recommend it.",9,7,14,13 August 2011
The Bourne Identity," What a spy thriller should be
","This film is exciting from the start where a man who has lost his memory is pulled from the Mediterranean until the end where he confronts his erstwhile employers.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an assassin with amnesia who must piece together who he is from the contents of a safety deposit box in a Swiss bank. Unfortunately for him he is spotted and his CIA bosses assume something is wrong with him and attempt to arrest him when he visits the US consulate. He escapes and pays a German girl (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. They realise just how much danger they are in when an assassin attacks them in Bourne's apartment. From then on he must play cat and mouse with the CIA and the French police until he can finally identify and confront his former employers at the end.The acting is solid throughout, both from the two main characters and from secondary characters, especially Clive Owen in a small roll as another assassin sent after Borne. It is also nice to have a leading lady who, while pretty, isn't an exotic, unrealistic beauty like we tend to get in another spy franchise. The action never really lets up, we have plenty of fights and an exciting car chase where Bourne must evade the Paris Police while driving a clapped out old Mini. If you enjoy spy thrillers I'd certainly recommend this as well as the other two films in the trilogy. It is good to see that a really exciting film doesn't need to resort the excessive swearing or violence which would have taken it above the 12 certificate.",9,2,2,24 November 2008
Baby Driver," Part heist movie, part music video, all action
","After stealing the wrong car from the wrong man our protagonist, Baby, finds himself working as a getaway driver for that wrong man, Doc. Baby stands out from the other criminals; he doesn't say much and lives with music in his ears to drown out the tinnitus he suffers thanks to a childhood accident. Everything he does is done to music and he must have the right track for the job. The first job we see goes well but the second gets a bit messy... luckily Baby has been told this is the job that will clear his debt to Doc... unluckily it isn't long before he is told that doesn't mean he can stop driving for Doc. If he refuses it won't just be bad for him but also for those he cares for. The next job is to be a raid on a large post office... things will soon get bloody.If found this film to be a lot of fun; early on it almost felt like a musical as we see Baby dancing through the streets as he goes to get coffee for the thieves after the first stylish car chase. We then spend some time getting to know key characters; as well as Baby and Doc these include waitress Debora, who Baby meets in a diner and crooks, Bats, Buddy and Darling. With each job the tensions increase and the body count rises. Ansel Elgort does an impressive job as Baby and Lily James is likeable as Debora. The rest of the cast features many well-known players, notably Kevin Spacey, as Doc; James Foxx, as Bats; and Jon Hamm, as Buddy. There are several really good chase scenes as well as a few impressive shootouts. There are inevitably some genre clichés as Baby falls in love, issues of trust arise and things ultimately go fairly wrong; that wasn't really a problem though. While this is primarily a stylish heist movie there are some genuinely funny moments... the scene with the wrong masks was priceless. Overall I really enjoyed this but can see that some might think it is too much style over substance.",8,1,3,28 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great adaptation of a classic story
","This is a great film, unlike most films that are the first part of a trilogy you really do have to watch the remaining films to get the most out of the story as there is no sense of closure at the end of the film, it is merely the end of one part of their quest and the beginning of the next. This is not a bad thing; just make sure you'll have enough time to watch all three films fairly close together. The film is very long but I don't think there were any scenes that could have been removed or trimmed so the length is justified.I think the film followed the book fairly well, although I confess it has been a while since I read it. After a short prologue where we are given a history of The Ring. We then find ourself in the Shire, the home of the Hobbits; the wizard Gandalf has come to attend a birthday party for his old friend Bilbo Baggins. During the party Bilbo announces that he is going to be leaving the Shire, he then slips a ring onto his finger and vanishes into thin air. When he takes the ring off again he is confronted by Gandalf who tells him he must leave the ring behind when he goes as it is dangerous.Unfortunately his use of the ring has been noticed by the evil Sauron who has dispatched nine wraiths; horsemen who's sole purpose is to retrieve the ring for their master. Gandalf instructs Bilbo's nephew Frodo to take the ring to Elves at Rivendell. On the way he and three Hobbit friends meet up with a mysterious man who helps them flee from the riders although Frodo is wounded and needs the Elves to recover. At Rivendell the group learn that their quest is not over, they must continue on to Sauron's land of Mordor where they can finally destroy the ring. The group are joined by Gandalf, an Elf called Legolas, Gimli the Dwarf and a man called Boromir.This film doesn't go as far as Mordor, in fact it only shows the first part of the journey which will see our heroes battling Orcs, other strange creatures and their own desire for the power the ring may bring; not all of the group will survive.As this is a fantasy film they are a lot of special effects, thankfully they are so well done that they don't look like effects even though we know they must be, I especially liked how they made the hobbits look so small, had I not seen the actors in other films it would have been almost possible to believe that the actors really were that short. Peter Jackson did a great job on this film getting a good performance from all his actors; a combination of well known veteran actors and young actors who will probably go onto be stars although I suspect this is the film they will be remembered for.",9,3,4,16 July 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Action packed but a disappointing end to the series
","The Matrix Trilogy draws to a close and the final battle between man and machine and between Neo and Agent Smith approaches. Set immediately after the events of 'The Matrix Reloaded' the people of Zion prepare for the attack of the machines while Neo appears to be in a coma back on one of the two ships to have survived the recent conflict. He is in fact trapped somewhere between the real world and the Matrix; in a location that looks like an underground station. If he is to get away he must confront 'The Train Man' and Morpheus and Trinity must re-enter the Matrix and visit The Merovingian once again. Once he is out there problems are far from over; Neo has a feeling that he must head to the City of the Machines, something nobody has successfully done before, and the others must head back to Zion with the last remaining pulse weapon. When the attack begins swarms of Sentinels enter the city dock; they must not be allowed to advance any further or Zion will be lost.There is plenty of action in this film... too much in fact; the plot lacks the depth of the original leaving us to watch a variety of spectacular fight scenes. These scenes are exciting and look great but go on for too long; while the fighting is going on the plot doesn't advance. At the end there is another Neo vs. Agent Smith fight but after the previous films this has a feeling of inevitability about it. The core cast do well enough although for much of the film they aren't really doing much as everything is focused on the battle for Zion. The military types are all gravel voiced and gung-ho in a way that is almost comical and you just know that the kid who has talked his way into the fight is going to play a key role in the end. It isn't a terrible film; it passes the time well enough and looks good; it is just a bit of a disappointment that the series had to end this way... to be honest I think it would have been better if 'The Matrix' didn't have any sequels as it didn't need them.",6,0,0,27 August 2012
Footloose," A fun '80s classic
","This eighties classic is centred on Ren McCormick, a teenager from Chicago, who has moved to a small mid-west town with his mother after his parents divorced. He is shocked when he learns that the town council has banned dancing, largely at the behest of the town's minister. Many of the town's adults think dancing, along with popular music and certain books are a menace that lead youngsters to sin... it quickly becomes apparent that the teenagers, including Ariel, the minister's daughter can be fairly wild without dancing. Somewhat inevitably Ren and Ariel grow close, leading to bad feeling with the boy she was dating, and ultimately Ren leads a campaign to allow the kids to have an official school dance.One might think of this as a music/dance film but it is so much more than that. Yes there is lots of enjoyable eighties music and some fun dance scenes but really it is about the characters. Some may be a little clichÃ©, most notably local bad boy who we just know will ultimately be put in his place by our protagonist. Other characters are deeper than expected, the minister is shown to be a good man despite his draconian views on music; we are given a reason that makes it understandable why he would feel the way he does even if we disagree with him. The actors playing the youngsters may be rather old for the characters they play but they do a good job; most obviously Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer as Ren and Ariel, but also from Chris Penn as Ren's friend Willard. Of the 'adults' John Lithgow stands out for his performance as the conflicted minister. The story is fun; as well as providing reasons for the enjoyable dance scenes, the youngsters dance amazingly well considering it is meant to be banned. Surprisingly the most memorable scene doesn't involve dancing... it involves playing chicken in tractors! Overall it may be a little cheesy but it is definitely an '80s teen classic; a must see for fans of the genre.",8,2,2,9 December 2019
Cast Away," Tom Hanks is all alone of a tiny South Pacific island
","Chuck Noland is an executive with global delivery company FedEx and he is obsessed with punctuality that is until the plane he is travelling on goes down in the South Pacific during a storm. He is the sole survivor and when the storm is over his life raft has washed up on a small island. He quickly establishes that there are no other people around and it isn't much longer before he realises that there is no immediate likelihood of rescue as the plane was four hundred miles away from its designated flightpath due to the storm. All Chuck has to survive is his punctured raft, a few FedEx packages that washed ashore and the limited food on the island. He will learn how to exist in a far more primitive manner; lighting fires without matches, cracking coconuts and catching fish; he will also have to cope with no medical help when he injures himself. His only company on the island is 'Wilson' a volleyball that he has drawn a face on and increasingly talks to whether this is a sign of insanity or a method of preventing it is hard to say. The only other things keeping him going it the knowledge that he has a loving fiancée back in his hometown and one FedEx package that he didn't open and is determined to deliver one day.For a film that is over two hours long surprisingly little happens once our protagonist has been marooned on his island; that does not mean it is boring though. This is almost entirely down to Tom Hanks' performance as Chuck as we don't see another living soul from the time of the crash till almost the end of the film. That is not to say that nothing happens and his location means that things that would merely be unpleasant become life threatening. Some of these events are fairly wince inducing such as the time he is cut on coral and the less said about how he deals with a bad tooth the better! Without going into too much detail the film's conclusion is suitably bittersweet. As previously stared Hanks is great; the camera is on him for almost the entire film and he makes us believe in his character even when he is having a conversation with a volleyball. The rest of the cast inevitably have much smaller roles but they are impressive enough too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody who doesn't need none stop action.",9,0,0,7 September 2016
The Thing," Horror in the Antarctic Winter
","From the beginning the viewer knows that there is something alien in the Antarctic as we are shown an alien vessel in the opening scene. The next thing we see is somebody trying to shoot a dog from a helicopter; as the dog reaches an American base it looks as if the people in the helicopter aren't quite sane as the man with the rifle wounds one of the Americans while trying to shoot the dog; realising they are in danger they shot him and take the dog into their camp. Of course this was a very bad mistake; one which will cost many lives. The dog wasn't actually a dog; it had been taken over entirely by an alien creature at a cellular level; an alien that isn't content to take the form of a mere dog! When the people realise what they are up against paranoia sets in; anybody could be alien and nobody trusts anybody else. Each time they thing of a way to identify or beat the creature it is thwarted and eventually they realise if they are to prevent it getting off Antarctica and infecting everybody on the planet they may all need to die.This is a classic horror where a group of people are trapped in a confined area with no means of communication or escape to the outside world. In the respect it reminded me of the superior 'Alien' although the way the alien here could mimic its victims increased the sense of paranoia. The effects looked pretty good and were delightfully grotesque in a way that could only be achieved with models and make-up rather that the CGI that would inevitable be used today. The cast, led by Kurt Russell did a fine job as did director John Carpenter; they managed to keep the frights coming right till the end and even then there was some ambiguity about the creatures survival!",8,0,1,4 January 2012
Lilo & Stitch," Not your typical Disney animation but still great
","There are certain things one expects from classic Disney; beautiful princesses, handsome princes and characters who regularly break into song... one doesn't expect malevolent, genetically engineered alien creatures coming to Earth and befriending a girl who bites and punches her friends; that is what we get here though!Lilo is an orphaned Hawaiian girl who lives with her sister, Nani; she is a real handful and social services are investigating to see if she should be taken into care. 'Experiment 262' is the alien creature that crashes to earth and is mistaken for a dog; it is taken to the pound and adopted by Lilo, who names him Stitch. At first he just sees her as something to put between himself and the two aliens sent to recover him but gradually they become friends and learns about 'ohana'; the Hawaiian family ideal. As the story progresses Stitch may cause trouble for Lilo and Nani but not through the deliberate malice he was designed for.I must say this film was nothing like I expected... and it was all the better for that. I loved the fact that neither Lilo nor Stitch felt like typical Disney protagonists. Both characters get great introductions before being brought together. Their relationship develops well providing plenty of laughs. There are also many thrilling moments, but nothing too intense, as other aliens try to retrieve Stitch. The main pair after him are funny and even though one of them is the 'mad scientist' who created Stitch they don't come across as too unpleasant for younger viewers. While characters don't break out in song effective use is made of Lilo's love of Elvis's music. I really liked the modern Hawaiian setting; it made the human characters feel more real than those in most Disney cartoon. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of animation, whatever their age, who enjoy a good mix of humour and action.",10,1,1,24 June 2019
The Village," Atmospheric drama
","I'd heard some fairly mixed reviews for The Village but decided to give it a go when it was on television as I'd enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's earlier film The Sixth Sense. While I didn't think it was as good as that film it was still fairly good.Set in what appears to be a nineteenth century village the locals live in fear of the strange creatures that live in the surrounding woods, this fear is so great that none of the younger generation have ventured through the woods to the towns they know are beyond them. Since the village elders have had bad experiences in the towns the younger villages aren't that keen to risk going through to woods to go to them any way. This changes when Lucius asks permission to venture through the woods to get medicine from the town that he thinks may help his friend Noah who has learning difficulties. While he isn't given permission to go, Ivy the blind girl who loves him, has to make the journey when Lucius's life is in danger.I've tried to avoid as many spoilers as possible as hinting at plot twists could spoil the film. I suspected the final twist fairly early in the film but right up until the reveal I wasn't certain about it so it still worked. The acting was good, especially Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy and William Hurt as her father Edward Walker. While there are a few scares and there is a fairly creepy atmosphere there is very little gore and no offensive language so it is suitable for most ages. If this is on television it is worth watching and perhaps worth picking up on DVD if you spot it in the bargain section; I've only seen it once but suspect it would be enjoyable even when one knows how it ends.",7,1,3,23 May 2009
The Revenant," A gripping tale of survival and revenge
","Hugh Glass is working as a guide for a group of trappers when they are ambushed by a group of native Arikara who are looking for their chief's kidnapped daughter. The surviving trappers along with Glass and his son escape down river but not long afterwards Glass is horrifically mauled by a bear. He manages to kill it but only just survives. While the main party go ahead to get help Glass is left with his son and two of the trappers. Fitzgerald, the elder trapper thinks they should leave him despite being paid a bonus. When he thinks they are alone he tries to smother Glass but is stopped by his son who he then murders. Glass is then left all alone in the wilderness and isn't expected to last more than a few hours however he does survive and struggles back to health and starts to make his way back to Fort Kiowa. He will have a struggle to find anything to eat and must cross hostile territory to get there; it will test him to the limit of his endurance. Meanwhile Fitzgerald has made it back to Fort Kiowa and has told everybody he did everything he could to save Glass; when Glass finally gets there he will want his revenge.Like so many stories 'based on real events' a little bit of reading suggests quite a few liberties have been taken with the actual facts that doesn't matter too much though as this is still a fine story. The opening ambush is exciting and quickly got me gripped. The story got even more tense afterwards. The bear attack was brilliantly shot in a way that made it look very real and very brutal. Once he is alone in the wilderness the film perfectly captures the bleakness of terrain; you can almost feel the cold as Glass struggles through snow, icy water and even shelters inside the remains of a dead horse. The cast does a fine job; it isn't surprising that Leonardo DiCaprio earned an Oscar for this he did a great job as Glass and certainly suffered for his art in the freezing conditions. The rest of the cast are impressive too; especially Tom Hardy, who plays the villainous Fitzgerald. At two and a half hours this certainly isn't a short film but at no time did I find myself looking at the clock. Overall I'd certainly recommend it although some of the more violent scenes might bother some viewers.",9,0,1,2 June 2017
Bridge of Spies," A gripping cold war thriller
","Set at the height of the cold war Soviet spy Rudolf Abel is arrested in New York; nobody is keen to represent him in court but eventually James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer with previous experience at the Nuremberg trials, takes on the job. He is not expected to do much more than go through the motions but he is determined that Abel will represented to the best of his ability even if that makes him unpopular. Donovan is adamant that Abel must be given the best defence as demanded by the US Constitution not doing so would make America little better than countries that don't have fair trials. Somewhat inevitably Abel is found guilty but Donovan makes a very logical plea against the expected death sentence if for no other reason he should be kept alive so that the United States will have somebody to trade if one of their spies is caught by the Soviets. Not long afterwards just such an event happens when US pilot Gary Powers is shot down while flying a U2 spy plane high over the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards another American is arrested on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain; this time a student in East Berlin. Donovan soon finds himself in Berlin, where he is to negotiate with the Soviets to exchange Abel for Powers however he wants both Powers and the student; it won't be easy though as the latter is held by the East Germans and the CIA aren't at all bothered about getting him back; they just want Powers before he cracks and starts to spill secrets about the U2 project.This is very much a film of two halves; both of them gripping. The first half is a court room drama where Donovan represents Abel to the best of his abilities even though it makes him very unpopular with a population that seems to think that anybody who represents a suspected spy is little better themselves; during this we also get scenes showing Powers entering the U2 programme and explanations of his mission before his eventual shooting down. These scenes serve to introduce the main characters and their situations but are still gripping in their own right. Tension raises significantly once the action moves to Berlin as it is made clear that if anything goes wrong while Donovan is in East Berlin he doesn't have any formal protection. There is a sense of anti-communist paranoia in America but this is nothing compared to the tension in East Berlin were people are being shot trying to cross the newly erected Berlin Wall. Tom Hanks does a great job as Donovan; an apparently ordinary man who has found himself in an extraordinary situation. Mark Rylance also stands out as Abel; a likable character with a dry sense of humour. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story gripping and capturing the feel of the era. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film.",9,1,3,17 March 2017
Pitch Black," Be afraid of the dark
","It is possible to look at this film as a cheap imitation of the Alien franchise, this however would be unfair as it is a decent science fiction monster film in its own right.The film opens with a spaceship being holed when it flies through a shower of small yet deadly meteors, the surviving crew wake up to find themselves plunging towards a desert planet. Carolyn Fry, the pilot is forced to start jettisoning the cargo and would also jettison the passengers if a fellow crew member hadn't stopped her. Luckily she and a handful of the passengers survive, including Riddick, an escaped convict being transported back to prison. Once safely on the ground the survivors start to explore the surrounding desert hoping to find much needed water. They find an apparently abandoned settlement which has an escape shuttle, they also find that there is something dangerous there which attacks in the dark. This shouldn't be a problem as the planets three suns ensure perpetual daylight apart from a period of eclipse which occurs every twenty two years, one can guess how long it was since the last eclipse. As the escape shuttle is out of fuel they must race back to the crash site to get the required power cells. By the time they are ready to return the eclipse has started so their solar powered vehicle will no longer work meaning they must get back on foot, all the time avoiding the deadly alien creatures while never being totally sure which of their own group can be trusted.The cast did a good job, I especially liked Radha Mitchell's performance as the Pilot Fry. Vin Diesel's portrayal of Riddick was decent enough too. The special effects worked well, making the creatures genuinely scary. There is also a nice twist involving one of the survivor which I won't spoil here. To get the full effect of this film watch it in the dark.",7,2,2,13 July 2009
Kung Fu Panda 2," An enjoyable sequel
","A prologue explains how a peacock named Shen's family were the city's ancestral rulers of Gongmen City but his parents exiled him after he massacred the pandas because a soothsayer told him one would thwart his ambition to rule china. Now he has taken the city by force, using cannon to defeat the kung fu masters would had protected it.After the events of the previous film the panda Po has been accepted as the legendary Dragon Warrior but his training is far from over; before he can truly be a master he must find inner peace. After his first clash with Shen's forces he starts recalling his past and realises that the goose who raised him wasn't his actual father. When word of what happened in Gongmen gets out he, and the 'Furious Five' must go there and defeat him; if they are to prevail Po must come to terms with his past.This sequel is a lot of fun; I'm sure anybody who enjoyed the opening instalment in the franchise will enjoy this too. There is lots of enjoyable, well animated martial arts action and plenty of humorous moments; frequently at the same time. It is fun seeing the established characters again, if anything it is more fun than before as they have become friends. Shen is a fine antagonist; the backstory we are shown at the start of the film gives him a touch of King Herod as he attempts to eliminate the pandas because one is foretold to defeat himÂ… of course as with all such prophecies it is ultimately correct. The animation is impressive with great looking backgrounds and nice character designs. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those who enjoyed the first film.",8,0,1,16 September 2017
American Psycho," An amusing satire about a psychotic yuppie
","When I first watched this I wasn't sure what to expect as I recalled the fuss when the book was first published, thankfully the film wasn't too gory. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it was more than just another serial killer film, as well as that it was a very funny satire about '80s Yuppies.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a self obsessed twenty seven year old who works on Wall Street. He and his colleagues are obsessed with having the best items and dining at the trendiest places. In an early scene Patrick and his colleagues compare business cards and he is mortified when one of the others has one which is more tasteful than his, even though they all look virtually identical. Strangely this seems to bother him far more than the fact that people routinely mistake him for other people. He uses this anonymity to invite out a fellow stock broker then murders him with an axe while calmly explaining how he thinks the band Genesis improved under Phil Collins influence. As the film progresses his psychosis deepens and he starts killing more and more people including a homeless man, a model and a prostitute he calls Christie.It is never one hundred percent certain that he is in fact killing people or if he is just delusional, I used to believe the latter but on later viewings think how he was getting away with his crimes was part of the satire, I liked that there are hints at both possibilities.Christian Bale's acting in this was superb, he seemed far more chilling than most movie serial killers in that while he is clearly insane he is also no different from those around him on the outside. I also thought Chloë Sevigny acted well as Patrick's secretary, possibly the only really normal person in the film.",8,3,7,5 September 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," An amusing road trip with a dysfunctional family
","Little Olive Hoover wants to be a beauty queen and it looks like she may get a chance when she is invited to participate in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' pageant in Redondo Beach, California. There are a couple of problems though; she is almost a thousand miles away in Albuquerque and for one reason or another her entire family must come with her. These include her suicidal uncle; her brother, who has taken a vow of silence; her foulmouthed grandfather; her father, an unsuccessful motivational speaker; and her relatively normal mother.They take the journey in a clapped out VW Camper van and along the way things don't go according to plan. They didn't exactly get on well before they were cooped up in the van and it isn't surprising that tempers fray somewhat as they travel along not helped when the clutch fails and they have to push it every time they want to get started. They do eventually get to the competition but nobody will be surprised that things don't go quite as expected.Initially I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film; many of the main characters are hard to like at first and they are all a bit odd. However as time passes we see that they aren't entirely bad and the various adversities ultimately bring them together to give a feel good ending. Along the way there are plenty of comical moments, as well as a tragedy. When they get to the pageant it delightfully showed us the creepiness of children's beauty pageants before Olive's jaw-dropping performance that was genuinely shocking as well as very funny! The cast does an impressive job; this includes the secondary characters who include several familiar faces. Overall I'd certainly recommend this although not for younger viewers as there is plenty that parents probably wouldn't approve of.",8,0,0,17 July 2016
North by Northwest," A classic thriller
","This film might be over fifty years old but years old but it is still highly entertaining and demonstrates that a film can still be thrilling at a PG rating. The film opens with advertising executive Roger Thornhill being abducted when he is mistaken for a man called George Kaplan. He is taken to a large house where a man calling himself Lester Townsend questions him but as he isn't Kaplan he can't answer. Townsend assumes he is just trying to tough it out and arranges for Thornhill to have an 'accident'. He manages to escape though and after a run in with the police goes to see Townsend but discovers that the man he met the night before wasn't Townsend. The real Townsend is murdered and it looks like Thornhill did it. In an attempt to clear his name he tries to find the real Kaplan who is apparently in Chicago. On the train there he meets the beautiful Eve Kendall, who surprisingly helps him evade capture despite knowing what he is accused of... or it would be if she wasn't involved with the fake Townsend who we now know is called Vandamm. In the scenes that follow Thornhill must survive an attack by plane; discover exactly what is going on and finally confront his would-be killers on the face of Mount Rushmore! This film is rightly considered a classic and not just because of the iconic scenes involving the crop-duster and the finale on the faces of the presidents on Mount Rushmore; it is a classic because it is a good story that is well told. Every scene is part of the story with no distractions such as 'family moments' or endangered children. Cary Grant does a great job as the ordinary man who finds his life taking an extraordinary turn... even if his drunk scene did look like somebody playing drunk rather than actually being drunk! He was ably supported my James Mason who was suitable villainous without going over the top as bad guy Vandamm and Eve Marie Saint as Eve Kendall who may or may not be very dangerous to Thornhill. Hitchcock did a great job directing this; even a scene as simple somebody running from a building to a car looks amazing because he chose to film if from high up directly over the action. As well as some genuine thrills; there is a good mystery and even a nice little romance that might be subplot but is still essential to the main plot. If you have not seen this yet watch it the first chance you get; I doubt you will be disappointed.",10,2,4,12 February 2012
Coriolanus," Shakespearian tragedy in a modern setting
","Caius Martius is Rome's most successful general; leading from the front to secure victory over the Volsces. However he is not popular with the people; they take his soldierly attitude to be arrogance and to be fair he has a fairly low opinion of them too. After his latest victory he is given the title Coriolanus and encouraged to run for the position of Consul in the senate. Tributes Brutus and Sicinius are uncomfortable with this fearing he will one day seek to control Rome without the senate. They quickly turn the people against Coriolanus and he is forced into exile. With nowhere else to go he heads to the Volscian city of Antium. Here he joins forces with his erstwhile enemy Tullus Aufidius and starts his revenge against Rome.Ralph Fiennes does a brilliant job, both as director and in the role of Coriolanus. He captures the military brilliance of the man as well as his sense of betrayal when cast out from the city he has served for so long. As such he rather overshadows Gerard Butler's Aufidius, although this may be because we get to see far less of his character. The rest of the main cast do a fine job, most notably Brian Cox who plays Coriolanus's friend Menenius, Vanessa Redgrave who plays his mother and James Nesbitt who is delightfully unpleasant as Sicinius.Before I started watching this I was unsure how the modern day setting would work but I need not have worried; in fact it worked very well. The Serbian locations clearly reminding the viewer that this is a timeless story; the battle scenes reminding one of the all too recent war that ravaged that part of the world in the '90s. Some viewers may have difficulty with the original Shakespearian dialogue but I found it engrossing as I had to concentrate just that little bit harder while watching. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film even if Shakespeare isn't 'your thing'; just be warned it is quite bloody at times.",9,0,1,19 March 2015
Hugo," An utter delight
","'Hugo' tells the story of young Hugo Cabret; a young orphan who lives in Gare Montparnasse station in 1930s Paris. His father was a watchmaker and together they were repairing an old automaton but when his father was killed in an accident he was taken to the station by his uncle where he keeps the clocks running. In his free time he continues to repair the automaton with parts he steals from the station toy shop. When he is caught the shop owner confiscates his notebook and so begins an adventure as he struggles to get it back. He befriends the shopkeeper's goddaughter, Isabelle, and together they manage to get the automaton working; Hugo had expected it to deliver a message from his father but instead it draws a familiar picture and signs it with the name of the shopkeeper; Georges Méliès a pioneer of early cinema. Georges believes that his work has been lost and forgotten; Hugo and Isabelle must prove otherwise.Director Martin Scorsese may be better known for fairly violent films but this shows that he has the lightness of touch to make a charming tale with young protagonists that can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. I found it an utter delight and the two hours just flew by. Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz put in fine performances as Hugo and Isabelle. The rest of the cast, which includes many well-known actors also perform well. Watching on television I can't say how good the original 3D effects were but even on the small screen everything looked beautiful; with many scenes referencing famous moments in early cinema. The main story is a delight with moments of sadness and moments of pure joy. Some viewers might be less impressed with the side-story involving Sacha Baron Cohen's Station Inspector who is constantly trying to catch Hugo and have him sent to the orphanage something strange for what is essentially a comic relief character! Initially I thought the character would prove interesting but gradually warmed to him as the story progressed. Overall I'd certainly recommend watching this as I found it utterly delightful.",9,0,1,22 July 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A decent third instalment that is full of action
","It is ten years since the events of Terminator 2; Judgement Day did not take place and John Connor is a drifter rather than the saviour of humanity. At least that is what he thinks; as a virus plagues the internet the military plans to use Skynet to fight itÂ… soon two terminators will show up. The first is a new T-X model, this looks like a woman and is programmed to kill those destined to be John's lieutenants. The second is a T-850, the familiar model payed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, which has been programmed to ensure John survives Judgement Day. By coincidence John meets up with Kate Brewster, a girl he last saw the day before the events of the last film and destined to be an important part of his future, just as the T-X comes to kill her and the T-850 arrives to save him. They manage to escape but the T-X is never far behind and Kate takes some persuading to accept what is going on. Kate's father is the Air force officer who will release Skynet; John believes that they can get to him and stop Judgement Day again; the T-800 states that Judgement Day is inevitable.After a great original film and an impressive sequel this film has a lot to live up to so I can understand why plenty of Terminator fans aren't keen on this instalment. It isn't as good as the previous films but I still really enjoyed it. John Connor is no longer a smart Alec teen and his mother Sarah has died; the first detail is good news but the second is a pity as Sarah Connor was such a great character. Arnie's T-850 is much the same as he was in T2; which is good and I really liked the new T-X model terminator even if it seemed to break some of the rules established in previous films with her built in weapons. The action is almost non-stop with plenty of really impressive set pieces; most notably when the T-X chases her targets in a massive crane wreaking havoc along the way. Nick Stahl did a fine job as the slightly jaded Connor and Claire Danes impressed as Kate; I also liked Kristanna Loken's portrayal of T-X and as for ArnieÂ… well he is The Terminator so no complaints there. Overall an enjoyable addition to the franchise.",8,12,15,16 November 2017
The Orphanage," Superior haunted house chiller
","Having enjoyed Guillermo Del Toro's Spanish language films Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone I looked forward to this even though he only produced it. I was not disappointed although it is fairly different in tone to those two films.Set in present day Spain; Laura, her husband and their young son Simon move into the abandoned orphanage that Laura lived in as a child. They are a little concerned that Simon's only friends are imaginary but hope that will change when they reopen the orphanage as home for disabled children. Things don't go according to plan though when Laura is attacked by a strange masked child on the day the children arrive, at the same time her son disappears and the remainder of the film covers her desperate search for him.If you are looking for gore and violence in a horror film this might not be for you, however if you want something that is genuinely creepy and has a few good scares then I'd strongly recommend this. The acting seemed good although I had to rely on the subtitles as I don't speak Spanish. Throughout the film there is a very creepy atmosphere that kept me on edge the whole time. There is also an interesting subplot concerning an ex-employee of the orphanage and sinister things that happened there in the past.",9,2,5,10 November 2008
The Shining," A top rate chiller
","Writer Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies hoping the solitude will help his writing; once the few remaining members of staff depart he will be alone, with just his wife, Wendy, and his son, Jack, for company. He is warned that the loneliness can get to some people, he is even told that ten years previously the caretaker had killed his wife and children before shooting himself, but Jack is sure he will be fine. As they are shown around the hotel Dick Hallorann, the head chef, takes Danny aside and talks to him; it appears that they share a gift that he calls 'The Shining'; a sort of telepathy. Once everybody has gone Jack gets down to his writing but it is clear that something isn't quite right; Danny keeps seeing two creepy girls and even has visions of corridors literally awash with blood! As more time passes tensions rise and ultimately Wendy realises that she and her son are in great danger from the person who should be there to protect them. Jack, meanwhile, starts seeing former staff members; he even has a conversation with the former caretaker who explains that he had to 'correct' his family and it is time for Jack to 'correct' his.If you prefer horror movies that have a high body count, inventive deaths and plenty of jumps then this might not be for you; if however you like a chilling atmosphere, a claustrophobic setting and a sense of near constant dread then this is the film for you. While there are few really scary moments there are plenty that are chilling enough to make ones hair stand on end; for example the two girls Danny keeps seeing and the caretaker who calmly explains murdering his family as 'correcting' them. The camera-work adds to the creepiness; often following Danny as he rides through the hotels long corridors or runs through the large maze in its grounds. The small cast does an impressive job; Jack Nicholson is at his scary best as Jack Torrance and Shelley Duvall makes Wendy's terror entirely believable. Young Danny Lloyd does a fine job as Danny. The story might not be told at a fast pace but I was never bored. Overall I'd recommend to any fan of Stanley Kubrick's work or to anybody wanting a genuinely scary chiller.",9,1,2,11 May 2016
"I, Robot"," Decent sci-fi thriller
","Having read the Azimov collection of short stories of the same name many years ago I was interested to see this. At first I was a bit disappointed that it had little to do with the book however it is a little unfair to try to compare a film to a set of short stories. Ignoring the source of the title this is a decent sci-fi thriller with plenty of action and decent special effects.Del Spooner is a detective who does not trust robots even though everybody else believes them to be one hundred percent safe and trustworthy. When an old friend apparently commits suicide and leaves a holographic note for him he suspects foul play and the only being in the room at the time it happened was a robot. The robot doesn't help its case when it flees the scene in apparent breech of its core programming. Spooner is helped in his investigation by Susan Calvin who doesn't share his suspicions about robots in general but realises that there is something different about this particular robot. As the investigation continues it becomes clear that there is a greater threat than one rogue robot.The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent although obviously CGI. There was some rather obvious product placement which I could have done without although not enough to spoil the film. I was surprised that the film received a 15 certificate here in the UK as there is a minimal amount of swearing and the violence is never bloody or overly scary. If you like sci-fi action I'm sure you'll enjoy this, just don't expect it to be like the book.",7,0,0,28 June 2009
American Beauty," Trouble in suburbia
","The Burnhams; Lester, Carolyn and daughter Jane, seem to be a typical, happy family living in a typical American suburb... of course things aren't as perfect as they outwardly appear. Lester's opening narration tells us that he will be dead within a year but he might as well be dead already. He appears to be having a midlife crisis; he hates his job and is fantasising about his teenaged daughter's friend Angela. Meanwhile Carolyn is also frustrated with her work and has an affair while Jane holds her parents in contempt. They aren't the only less than perfect family in the street; their new neighbour Colonel Fits it a bigot who beats his son Ricky for the slightest reason and Ricky is constantly watching, and filming Jane.Lester's life changes when he overhears Angela telling Jane that she'd sleep with her father if he toned up a bit. He starts exercising, quits his job and starts smoking dope that he has bought from Ricky. As the film approaches the end there are hints at who might kill Lester but there are several possibilities; Carolyn has started going to a shooting club, Col Fits thinks Lester is involved in a sexual relationship with his son and Jane is telling Ricky she would like it if somebody killed her father.This is a really good film; it could easily have been excessively melodramatic but a combination of a fine script, excellent direction and a top-notch cast make it engrossing and possible for the viewer to care about characters who are in many ways unsympathetic. Kevin Spacey is on top form as Lester and is ably supported by Annette Benning and Thora Birch as Carolyn and Jane. The story nicely combines moments of comedy with tragedy. Even though the ending is fairly unforgettable the film still stands up to repeat viewings. Overall a top quality film that shows a darker side to apparently ordinary lives.",9,1,2,24 February 2016
BASEketball," A fun comedy about a couple of losers who invent a new sport
","As children friends Joe 'Coop' Cooper and Doug Remer dream of growing up to be sports stars... when they grow up they are just a couple of losers. Then one day they crash a party and a challenged to a game of basketball... when they realise their opponents are much better they tell them that they play a new game... BASEketball. They quickly make up the rules and soon its popularity spreads. After a while they are approached by wealthy businessman Ted Denslow, he is keen to set up a National BASEketball League. He wants to create a pure sport without corporate sponsorship, teams moving cities and trading of players. The boys agree and soon the game is a national sensation. Then Denslow dies, leaving the team to Coop. It isn't long before the Dallas Felons' team owner Baxter Cain starts scheming to take over the game and introduce ways to make money. While this is going on both Coop and Doug fall for the same woman, Jenna Reed, who runs a charity of dying children.Given to plot it is not surprising that this film is fairly silly; that doesn't matter too much though as it provides more than enough laughs. Some of the humour is fairly crude but nothing is really offensive. The rules of the game are fairly well thought out and the fact that distracting the opposition is part of the game it is also funny. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are solid as Coop and Doug; I can only imagine they have acted in so few films is because they are busy with 'South Park'. Dian Bachar also impresses as their friend Squeak Scolari, who they treat fairly badly. There are also some well-known faces, including Ernest Borgnine as Ted Denslow and Robert Vaughn as the delightfully unpleasant Baxter Cain. My only mild problem with the film was that it got a little mawkish towards the end. Overall though I'd recommend this; it might not be a classic but it provides plenty of laughs.",7,0,0,25 March 2019
Wanted," Okay action film
","When I sat down to watch this I wasn't expecting anything great; I was hoping for plenty of action and tension though. On the first count I wasn't too disappointed as there was plenty of action although most of it was highly stylised and full of CGI, unfortunately it wasn't all that tense though as I didn't find myself caring about the characters. James McAvoy plays Wesley an accountant who is put upon both at work and at home until on day he is told that his father who he never knew was in fact part of a group of elite assassins. Unfortunately he learns that a rogue member of the group who is picking them off one by one killed his father. He is then recruiting into this 'Fraternity of Assassins' and is trained until he is ready to kill the man who killed his father although nothing is quite what it seems.James McAvoy was good enough as Wesley although he was more convincing as the pathetic accountant than he was as an assassin; Angelina Jolie was okay as Fox, the person who first introduced Wesley to the assassins and trained him and Morgan Freeman was as good as one would expect him to me as the group's leader. The training scenes seemed to drag on a bit longer than was necessary and once he was told he could go after his father's killer he got to him rather quickly. There was a twist at the end that wasn't entirely a surprise although it was well handled. Overall this is okay if you want some mindless action but it certainly isn't anything more than okay.",6,0,0,3 April 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The Terminator is back this time to save John Connor
","Set almost fifteen years after the original film we learn that Skynet sent a second, more advanced, T-1000 Terminator back in time; this time to kill the teenaged John Connor. The T-1000 is nothing like the original; it is a liquid metal machine, able to change its form to look like anyone or anything of the same volume. To protect John the resistance and reprogrammed a captured T-800 Terminator and sent it back to defend him.When the film starts John is living with foster parents and his mother is in a secure mental institution still convinced that Skynet will destroy civilisation in 1997. The T-800 manages to save John from the T-1000 then, on John's orders helps Sarah escape. Once out she knows what must be done; they must find the man responsible for the creation of the technology behind Skynet and prevent him from finishing his work all the time staying ahead of the T-1000.Even though this film was made a quarter of a century ago the special effects still look very impressive and there is a lot of exciting and spectacular action there are shootouts, a truck vs bike chase along on of Los Angeles's concrete rivers, explosions and final chase involving trucks and a helicopter. Those who want action should certainly be pleased on the other hand it does feel a bit safe at times; John orders the T-800 never to kill making it like a defanged cobra; scary looking but no longer deadly. Arnold Schwarzenegger continues to impress in the role, managing to inject some humour into the character. Linda Hamilton is also pretty solid as Sarah Connor; it is interesting to see how much her character has developed since the original. Edward Furlong is okay as the young John Connor although his character can be a bit irritating at times in a way that didn't seem real. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the shapeshifting T-1000. The level of violence is considerably lower than the original; the T-1000 kills a few people but even when blasting away with a minigun the T-800 only destroys property and causes non-life-threatening injuries this of course means the film is suitable for a slightly younger audience. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original; personally I prefer the first film but I can understand why others would rate this one higher.",8,2,5,10 August 2016
Salt," Far fetched but contains plenty of excitement
",Salt is a fairly standard spy thriller; as it opens CIA agent Evelyn Salt is being freed from a North Korean prison and soon things are going well for her. Things turn worse though when a Russian agent walks in claiming that Salt is in fact a Russian sleeper agent planted many years previously. At first the CIA don't believe him but when Evelyn runs it looks as if he may have been telling the truth. As the drama progresses it look more and more likely that this is the case and her actions could start a war. She isn't the only potential sleeper agent and as the drama reaches its conclusion the viewer is left wondering whether Salt is an enemy agent trying to reach her target or whether she is in fact racing to protect the target from the true danger.This wasn't a bad film but it did feel as though the creators though it was somewhat better than it really was; if they wanted to create a female Jason Bourne they didn't succeed. Angelina Jolie was good in the title role making the viewer believe in her character even though some of the stunts looked a little far-fetched. Other notable performances were Liev Schreiber as Salt's boss who appeared to keep his faith in her long after everybody else thought she was an enemy agent and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the secret service agent on her trail. If you want a bit of action with a few twists in it you could do a lot worse than this.,7,6,9,21 February 2011
Duck Soup," Madcap mayhem from the Marx Brothers
","The nation of Freedonia is in dire financial trouble and on the brink of revolution; its leader asks its wealthiest citizen, Mrs Teasdale, to bail it out with a twenty million dollar loan... she has one condition; Rufus T Firefly must be the new leader of the country. The leadership of the neighbouring country are determined to control Freedonia; when it looks as though the revolution has been stalled the plan to ferment a war between the two countries. To further this goal two spies are dispatched.The basic plot could come from a serious film but as this stars the four Marx Brothers there is almost nothing obviously serious about it. The gags come thick and fast. We get the usual screwball slapstick, sight gags, verbal jousting and puns... if one joke doesn't amuse you there is a good chance that the next will. Groucho is on fine form as Firefly and Chico and Harpo impress as the two spies; as is often the case Zeppo has a fairly small role. While there are many great scenes my personal favourite had to be the perfectly executed 'mirror scene' where Groucho and 'Harpo disguised as Groucho' move in unison as if an image in a mirror with Groucho unsure if he is looking at a reflection of not. Overall I'd definitely say this is a classic and should be watched by anybody wanting a good laugh whatever their age.",10,1,2,3 October 2019
Edward Scissorhands," A Modern Fairytale
","This story has many elements of a classic fairytale, it opens with an old lady being asked by her grand daughter why it snowed, she then tells the story shown in the film...In a strange mansion a scientist (Vincent Price) has made a man, unfortunately he died before he could attach proper hands leaving him with strange hands made of large scissors, it is never explained why he gave Edward (Johnny Depp) hands made of scissors before adding his permanent hands but such an explanation isn't really needed. Edward is 'rescued' from his solitary like by Peg, the local Avon Lady (Dianne West) and taken to live in her house in the suburb below.Almost all the locals are curious about her new house guest and are keen to meet him, soon he is busy using his scissors turning their hedges and shrubs into amazing topiary, cutting their dogs' hair and eventually cutting their hair too. Things start to go wrong however when Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) and her thuggish boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) return... she is understandably scared when she returns home from a few days camping and discovers Edward in her bed. When they learn that Edward can use his scissors to open locks Jim decides to get him to break in to his father's house to help him steal various items which he claims were stolen from him, when Edward is captured by a security device the others flee leaving him to face the police alone, from now on the locals distrust Edward is soon demonised although Kim sees her boyfriend for what he is and attempts to protect Edward.In some ways this is the opposite of a traditional fairytale where one would expect an unpopular character to become loved. The acting is good, the direction is classic Tim Burton and the setting is great; the perfection of the pastel shaded suburbia is more creepy than the Gothic mansion upon the hill and the ordinary townsfolk are far more sinister than the strange Edward.As to what this all has to do with snow... well you'll have to watch the film to learn that.",8,0,0,18 July 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," A good film despite its cliché ending.
","As the film opens protagonist Pat Solitano is being released from an eight month sentence to a mental institution. He has lost his job as a teacher, his home and his wife has a restraining order against him but he is still convinced he can win her back. Soon after his release he meets young widow Tiffany, who has issues of her own, at a dinner after which she invites him to spend the night with her but he refuses. That isn't the end of things and soon he is trying to persuade her to get a message to his wife; she agrees but has a condition; she wants to take part in a dance competition and wants Pat to be her partner. Pat's parents are a little bit concerned about him seeing Tiffany although his father's reasons is somewhat peculiar he believes the Philadelphia Eagles will lose if they don't watch the game together! As the day of the dance approaches it gains greater significance following Pat being told his wife will be watching and the fact that his father has made a large bet on the outcome.Given that all the main characters seem to have mental issues; bi-polar disorder, anger control problems and obsessive behaviour; one would be forgiven for thinking it was either going to be overly worthy or in poor taste thankfully that wasn't the case. This is largely down to the leads; Bradley Cooper is great as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence positively shines as Tiffany. They make their characters believable and likable. Of the supporting cast it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro gives the most memorable performance; his character's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles is both disturbing and amusing. The film isn't without its flaws of course and unfortunately the biggest flaw is the cliché ending even if that is the ending that viewers probably want. Overall this film is engaging, funny, sexy and well worth watching.",9,1,6,1 September 2014
Van Helsing," Van Helsing fights Dracula with a little help from Frankenstein's monster!
","As this film opens Dr. Frankenstein has just finished his famous creation when a hoard of torch carrying villagers attack his castle. His patron, one Count Dracula, isn't too concerned; he just wants the creature for his own nefarious purposes and has no further need of the doctor. On the other side of Europe monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing has been summoned to the Vatican; here he is told to head to Transylvania and help the last remaining members of the Valerious in their generations old battle against Dracula. Upon arrival he quickly finds himself helping protect a village from an attack by Dracula's three brides. After this battle he teams up with Anna Valerious (and later Frankenstein's monster) for a battle that will see them fighting werewolves, vampires assorted monsters before a final confrontation with Dracula himself!If you are looking for a scary horror movie you are likely to be rather disappointed; I can't see this really scaring anybody has reached their teens. However if you are looking for an action packed adventure that tries to pack in elements from every classic Gothic horror as well as quite a few laughs then you should enjoy this. The action barely lets up from start to finish as our heroes battle the forces of evil. Hugh Jackman is great in the title role as he uses an array of weapons such as an automatic crossbow to fight the Brides of Dracula. These brides are suitably seductive without being overly so. Other notable performances come from Kate Beckinsale as Anna and Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. With all the action it may seem surprising that there is time for humour but there are quite a few laughs; many provided by Friar Carl; the Vatican's answer to James Bond's Q, and Igor, Dr Frankenstein's former assistant. The CGI effects are good especially during the many scenes where various creatures transform from their human appearance to a more monstrous one. There is little here to offend and the violence is fairly fantastical so this film can be enjoyed by people of most ages the BBFC '12' certificate is probably about right as children younger than that might find it too scary. Overall a fairly fun film that passes a couple of hours without requiring too much thought.",7,2,4,2 August 2015
Divergent," A solid 'young adult' dystopia
","This, the first film of three, is set in a world one hundred years after a cataclysmic war. Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice 'Tris' Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series.",8,2,3,10 July 2019
Monsters vs. Aliens," Enjoyable retro sci-fi animation
","When a meteorite made of quantonium strikes Susan Murphy on the day of her wedding it doesn't kill her; it causes something strange to happen though... just as the service is getting underway she starts glowing slightly green then starts to grow. She doesn't stop growing till she is fifty feet tall! Understandably everybody flees in terror and the army turns up, tranquilises her and takes her to a secret facility where they keep monsters. These include Dr. Cockroach; BOB, a gelatinous blob; (Missing) Link, a strange fish/ape and Insectosaurus an enormous caterpillar like creature. It looks as if Susan will have to spend the rest of her life in captivity with these creatures until evil alien Gallaxhar sends a giant robot probe to Earth to recover the quantonium. The military is powerless to stop the robot so they use the monsters; they manage to defeat it but Gallaxhar realises that Susan has his quantonium so comes to Earth to recover it himself. If Earth is to survive his plans Susan and her monster friends will have to defeat Gallaxhar and his army of clones.This Dreamworks animation has quite a lot going for it; the animation looks good, the characters are fun, the story is exciting enough without being too scary for younger viewers and the numerous references to older films are done in a way that people who haven't seen those films won't feel like they are missing a joke. The voice work was done well with none of the characters sounding overly cartoony. On the downside there are a few jokes which seemed out of place in a film aimed at children... do we really need a joke about the president soiling his trousers? I think not. The opening scene suggested that we were going to be reminded that this was filmed in 3D at every opportunity but thankfully that was the only moment that I thought was gratuitously 3D, which was good as I was watching on television. When compared to the works of Pixar or Dreamworks own 'How to Train Your Dragon' this looks distinctly second best; however it is still pretty good; it might not be essential viewing but it is well worth watching if you are a fan of animated films.",7,4,5,9 January 2013
Face_Off," Travolta and Cage swap roles
","Of John Woo's Hollywood Films that I've seen this is the one that comes closest to capturing the excitement of the films he made when he was still in Hong Kong. John Travolta plays FBI agent Sean Archer, whose son was killed six years previously by Castor Troy, played by Nicolas Cage. Since that time Archer has been desperate to capture Troy and one day he succeeds in capturing Castor and his brother Pollux. Castor is in an apparently permanent coma and Pollux is sent to a maximum-security prison. It looks like the case is solved until it emerges that the brother's have planted a chemical weapon in Los Angeles that is set to go off within a week. The only person alive to know where the bomb is located is Pollux and he won't tell anybody other than his brother. To get the information Archer undergoes radical surgery; he literally wears Castor's face. While he is in prison the real Castor awakens and takes Archer's face and his life. Having killed everybody who knew about the face swap Archer is trapped in prison while Castor uses his new FBI position to get his brother released, defuse the bomb and become a hero. Archer must then escape from prison and use criminal contacts that think he is Troy to regain his life and his face.This is a proper action film with plenty of shooting, fighting and explosions. Travolta and Cage are fine in their roles; it was fun watching them switch characters after their faces were swapped. Those looking for John Woo's hallmarks won't be disappointed; there are plenty of times where the characters stand with guns in each other's faces and a gun fight in a church while doves fly around them. Of course the face swapping and the nature of the prison aren't that realistic but anybody who can suspend their disbelief shouldn't worry too much about that; this film is about action not realism!",8,0,1,19 March 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A Jedi in Iraq!
","I had heard fairly mixed reviews of this film but as the only clip I'd seen was very funny I thought I'd give it a go when it was on television; I'm glad I did as it was laugh out loud funny. Ewan McGregor plays Bob Wilton a journalist who heads off to war torn Iraq when his wife leaves him. While waiting at a hotel near the border he meets Lyn Cassady; a man who he had heard about before; a man who had apparently been part of a secret US Army Psychic Corps known as The New Earth Army. At first Lyn isn't too keen to discuss matters but when he sees a doodle Bob has drawn he believes that the two of them are meant to head into Iraq together as part of his mission. As they go into Iraq where they will have to deal with local insurgents, trigger-happy 'contractors' and finally Lyn's nemesis from his army days; Bob reads Lyn's diary and we see how the New Earth Army came to be and was later disbanded. Bob is understandably sceptical about Lyn's talk of psychic powers and soon regrets going with him although as Lyn says, 'it is his destiny'.Ewan McGregor does a good job as Bob but George Clooney stole the show as Lyn; he played the role dead straight making him far funnier than if he'd played it for laughs. Even the secondary characters were played by well-known actors including Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and Robert Patrick. It was fairly clear early on that things were be played for laughs Clooney referred to the men of the New Earth Army as Jedi and Ewan 'Obi Wan Kenobi' McGregor had no idea what he meant! There isn't too much to offend people in this film although the language is quite strong in places and there is a brief scene featuring topless women; the camera never lingered though. I wasn't too keen on the very last scene as it gave the answer to the question 'are they really able to do the things Lyn claimed', I'd have preferred it if that was left up to the viewer; it is however a minor quibble and I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch something a little different and have a laugh.",8,1,5,9 July 2011
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," An impressive addition to the franchise
","This, the fifth instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise, sees Ethan Hunt and the IMF working to bring down an organisation known as 'The Syndicate' and its leader Solomon Lane. This is apparently made up of agents from a variety of countries who have either been disavowed or believed dead it is also so shadowy that many people believe it is a figment of the IMF's imagination. The director of the CIA is one such doubter and he has successfully called to IMF to be shut down leaving Hunt officially unsupported. A lead takes him to Vienna where, with the help of Benji, he attempts to prevent the assassination of the Austrian Chancellor. Here he bumps into Ilsa Faust, a woman who previously helped him escape from The Syndicate. Later he will have to work with her but it isn't obvious whether she is also working to bring down The Syndicate or whether she is working for them to get Hunt to help them with a particular problem.This is a fine addition to the Mission Impossible films. It gets off to an impressive start with an opening that sees Hunt clinging to the outside of a plane as it takes off that contains stolen nerve gas. Once the main story gets underway it is quickly explained what the latest mission is and that IMF have been officially shut down. The story is relatively simple but there is plenty of tension as we don't know where the loyalties of some key characters really are. Inevitable there lots of exciting moments, as well as the opening we get several impressive chases, a raid on a computer facility that requires Hunt to stay under water without breathing apparatus for a dangerously long time and a fight high above the stage of an opera house while a performance is underway. The pace of action means the viewer doesn't have time to think about how far-fetched it all is if it wasn't far-fetched it wouldn't be Mission Impossible! The cast does an impressive job, Tom Cruise continues to do a great job as Ethan Hunt as he makes the most unlikely things seem believable. He is ably supported by Simon Pegg, who brings some light relief as Benji; Rebecca Ferguson, as the ambiguous Isla and Sean Harris who is suitably menacing as the villainous Lane. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the franchise; it provides two hours of solid action that isn't too violent for younger viewers to watch.",8,0,0,19 June 2017
Jarhead," Waiting for the war to start
","Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford could have gone to college; instead he enlisted in the US Marine Corps he soon starts to wonder if he made the right choice. He isn't very enthusiastic but shows aptitude with a rifle and ends up a Sniper Scout. When Saddam Hussein's forces invade Kuwait in the summer of 1990 it looks as though Swoff and his comrades are about to see action. They deploy to Saudi Arabia and await their orders to cross the border. They wait and they wait and they wait; as the weeks and months pass they stew in the desert and boredom takes its toll. Tempers fray, discipline breaks down and Swoff starts to question his sanity. When the order is finally given the war moves so fast that the Marines are behind the action; all they see is the aftermath of air attacks and burning oil fields then just as it looks as if they are going to see action the war is over.This is unusual for a 'war' movie in that there is so little actual war. Before that we get training scenes that will be familiar to anybody who has seen 'Full Metal Jacket' and the bulk of the film that shows us the marines waiting to go into battle. These scenes impressively capture the boredom and frustration the men suffer. Some of the ill-discipline is rather surprising; one can only hope that it is exaggerated for dramatic effect especially the scene where Swoff threatens a fellow Marine with a loaded rifle! The scenes showing what the squad see during the war are disturbing without being too upsetting; most notably the night scene amongst the burning oil wells. The cast is solid with Jake Gyllenhaal dominating as Swoff. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a war film that is somewhat different to most; importantly for a film that is largely about boredom I never found it boring.",8,1,1,16 July 2017
Shrek Forever After," A somewhat darker fourth instalment
","Shrek, the ogre who was once feared throughout the land, is now living an ordinary life with his wife Fiona and their three children but sometimes he misses his old life and finally during his children's birthday party he has had enough and storms out. Soon afterwards he 'rescues' the evil Rumpelstiltskin and afterwards as they talk he says he would like just one day of his old life. Rumpelstiltskin says he can give him that in exchange for one other day in his life, a day he can't even remember. Shrek can't see any catch so signs the deal.Suddenly he finds himself in an unfamiliar world; at first it is great, everybody fears him again, but then he realises there is something very wrong. He is captured by witches who take him to the castle in a cart pulled by Donkey who has no memory of Shrek. Once at the castle he finds that Rumpelstiltskin now rules. He is told that the day he gave up was the day he was born; after the one day he asked for he will cease to exist! In this world he was never born so he didn't befriend Donkey and Puss in Boots. He didn't rescue Fiona. And the King and Queen were tricked into a deal that gave the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. All hope isn't lost though; there is a get out clause 'True Love's Kiss' will save him. This isn't easy though; not only will he have to find Fiona he will have to make her fall in love with him once again all in one day.After a slightly disappointing third instalment this is a step up; it still isn't quite as good as the first two films but that would be difficult. The story is quite a lot darker as we see Shrek make a mistake that costs him everything he holds dear and could potentially lose his life. This adds a sense of urgency to proceedings and makes each step towards fixing things satisfying. The fact that Shrek hasn't impacted on their lives means familiar characters have changed; most notable Fiona who, after escaping from the tower on her own, has become a warrior princess leading an ogre rebellion against Rumpelstiltskin and Puss who is fat! Rumpelstiltskin is the most villainous of the antagonists in the 'Shrek' films to date; he is genuinely unpleasant and may disturb some younger viewers I thought he was a great character though. The animation is good, as one might expect, although some scenes look as though they were done to show off 3D effects which may have looked great in the cinema but merely look good when watched on DVD. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the series even if part three disappointed them.",8,2,2,16 February 2017
Collateral," Tom Cruise plays against type in this solid thriller
","Jamie Foxx plays Max; a Los Angeles cab driver who dreams of owning his own limousine company; he is fooling himself of course but that dream gets him through the nights as he drives various people around. Usually people just want to be taken somewhere and be dropped off but tonight is different; a man wants to be driven to five different locations before catching a morning flight. That man is Vincent, played by Tom Cruise. Vincent is a hired killer; very cool, very professional it's just a job to him. Max learns what Vincent does at the first stop off when a body crashes onto the roof of his cab; after that he is forced to take Vincent to his other stops and it is very clear that if he fails to do as instructed even more people will die.Going into this film I had little idea what to expect; all I knew about it was what was written on the box; it turns out it was a pretty good film. It was great seeing Tom Cruise playing against type as the sociopathic gun for hire; he made the character frightening yet strangely likable even though he was doing terrible things. Jamie Foxx also put in a solid performance as Max. The action was solid and there were quite a few tense scenes as well as some real surprises; I certainly wasn't expecting the police officer investigating the murders to get killed himself. If you like your humour dark there are quite a few good laughs to be had as well as some more poignant moments. There are some flaws of course; the finale is a little cliché and relies of one hell of a coincidence but that doesn't spoil the film. Director Michael Mann did a great job keeping the action tense and filming night time LA in a way that made the lights of the city and its constant traffic seem genuinely beautiful. If you are a fan of thrillers this is definitely worth checking out.",8,1,2,4 December 2013
Cross of Iron," Peckinpah on the Eastern Front
","The vast majority or films set during the Second World War unsurprisingly follow the exploits of heroic Allied forces as they battle for our freedom; this however is different, it follows the exploits of a group of German soldiers who are no less heroic in their battle to survive as the retreat from the Red Army. Chief protagonist is Corporal, later Sergeant Steiner; he is no Nazi, like the rest of his men he is just fighting to survive. His world is complicated when a new officer is transferred to command him; Captain Stransky isn't a Nazi either but he is desperate to win an iron cross which makes him very dangerous. After their base is attacked Steiner ends up in hospital and upon his returned learns that Stransky is claiming to have led the counter attack and has named him as a witness. Steiner informs the colonel that Stransky was nowhere to be seen at the time and a lieutenant who died in the attack actually led the counterattack! Stransky is now likely to be court-martialled rather than get his iron cross unless he can get rid of Steiner; in the confusion of retreat that might not be too difficult and Stransky doesn't mind if Steiner's men are lost with him.This film was really gripping and it was refreshing to see the German's depicted as something other than a bunch of evil Nazis; most are depicted as honourable men. Coming from 'Bloody' Sam Peckinpah it will surprise nobody to learn that there is quite a lot of blood spilt here; often in gory slow motion spurts. The cast did a fine job, notably James Coburn as Steiner, Maximilian Schell as Stransky and James Mason as the honourable Colonel Brandt. Amongst all the brutality there are some touching scenes; notable those between Steiner and a young Russian prisoner. If you are a fan of war films I'd certainly recommend this; it is excellent and very different from most films of its genre.",10,4,6,21 March 2011
Ratatouille," Remy the Rat wants to be a chef
","Having enjoyed several other Pixar films; The Toy Story Trilogy, Wall-E and The Incredibles, I was keen to see this when it was on television recently, and while I don't think it was quite as good as those it was entertaining and as one would expect from Pixar it was beautifully animated.This film tells the story of Remy the rat; he isn't any old rat though; he has a nose for the finest foods and has even learnt how to cook from watching the great chef Auguste Gusteau on television. One day he is forced to flee from his rural home and is separated from his family in the sewers; when he climbs out he finds himself in the heart of Paris within sight of his hero's restaurant. When he looks through the window he sees garbage boy Linguini making some additions to the soup; realising the soup is being ruined he sneaks in and adds a few touches of his own... the soup is served to a critic and is a triumph... which doesn't please Skinner, the chef who took over after Gusteau died. Linguini is told he must make it again... something he can't do until he meets Remy. Being a rat Remy can't talk but they find a way to communicate and his cooking gets more and more popular; of course he can't tell anybody who is really doing the cooking! While this is going on we have a romantic subplot involving Linguini and Chef Colette, Skinner worrying that Linguini may be the rightful heir to Gusteau's restaurant and a visit from a famous critic who caused the establishment to loose one of its stars on his last visit.At almost two hours in length this did feel a little bit too long but not hugely so; the story was enjoyably and provided a decent number of laughs; largely from the deliberately unlikeable Skinner; although I suspect the biggest laughs for younger viewers will come from Remy's method of controlling Linguini. As well as laughs there were plenty of thrills, although none too scary; it is rated 'U' after all. The animation is absolutely stunning with the virtual camera moving in ways that gives shots that would be almost impossible in a live action film. As mentioned before this film is rated 'U' but that doesn't mean only children will enjoy it; there is plenty here to entertain viewers of all ages.",8,0,2,4 June 2012
The Lego Movie," Everything is Awesome well almost everything
","Lego construction worker Emmet is a bit of a drone; he watches the most popular TV show, he listens to the most popular song and most importantly he always follows the instructions. Then one day he loses his instructions; he searches the construction site for it and stumbles upon the 'Piece of Resistance'. Also there is a girl named Wyldstyle who was looking for the piece. She explains to him that is a near mythical item that will enable the 'Special' to defeat the evil President Business. She assumes that Emmet is the Special but the more she sees of him the less sure she is. Far from being the Master Builder she expected he has just about zero imagination. Before they can conform Business they will team up with Wylestyle's boyfriend, Batman; recruit other Master Builders and keep one step ahead of Business's henchman, Bad Cop.When I played with Lego as a child I never imagined that one day there would be a Lego movie and if I had I doubt I'd have imagined that it would be enjoyed by anybody apart from young children but here I am, almost fifty, and I must say I really enjoyed this film. It is chock full of references to other films in a way that older viewers will love without boring younger viewers who don't get the references. The characters are a lot of fun; Emmet and Wyldestyle are great leads but it is Batman who steals the show, it is no wonder that he just got his own movie. The story is simple enough for younger viewers and the execution is imaginative in a way that should entertain all ages. If there is a weakness it is when the action moves to the real world and we see a boy playing with his father's Lego; here we get the message of the movie and it is about as subtle as a brick (not a Lego brick); it also pulls the viewer out of the story just as it reaches its peak; still it isn't enough to spoil this entertaining film. The animation is great; it is especially impressive when we see Lego creations being made in front of our eyes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fan of animated movies; it is fun from start to finish.",9,1,3,22 February 2017
Aliens," A great sequel to a classic film
","Too often sequels are shallow rehashes of what was done in the first film, thankfully think isn't the case with Aliens which is almost as good as the first and quite different in style. While I think it helps to see the original film first this also works as an excellent piece of stand alone entertainment.This film is set fifty seven years after the events of the first film however for Ripley it is as if no time has passed as she was in hyper sleep the whole time. Upon waking she is horrified to discover that the planet where the crew of the Nostromo found the alien is in the process of being Terraformed. A family group is sent out to investigate the location of the ship and one of those people is attacked by a face-hugger, soon after all contact with the outpost is lost. Ripley is asked to join the group of marines being sent to investigate but initially doesn't want to go, she changes her mind once assured that they are going to eliminate the aliens.Unlike the first film where there is a single alien this time there are hundreds although they are more easily killed as the marines are obviously well armed. The frights and horror of the first film are much reduced but are replaced by the excitement of full on action as the marines battle against the aliens. The acting is solid through out and particular mention should be made of Carrie Henn, who played 'Newt' a young girl who was the sole surviving colonist. In many films the presence of a child is rather annoying but Newt was a good character who wasn't overly cute, she could also scream rather well!This review and rating are based on watching the longer Special Edition of the film which includes many scenes not in the original release.",9,5,6,27 August 2008
The Fast and the Furious," Fun if fairly mindless action flick
","Brian O'Connor is a Los Angeles police officer who is working undercover to discover the identity of a group involved in a series of truck hijackings. To this end he tries to get in with the street racing community. To do this he will not only need to take part in the races he will have to impress the other racers. His bosses are convinced that one Dominic Toretto is behind the crimes but as Brian gets to know him he becomes less sure and is soon convinced that a group of Chinese racers are the ones involved is this really the case or of Brian becoming a bit too friendly with Toretto? He has also fallen for Toretto's beautiful sister which leads to some friction with another one of the group who also has the hots for her.If you are looking for the 'Citizen Kane' of action movies this isn't it; however if you just want some good mindless fun with fast cars and a good looking cast you could do much worse. Early on I thought this would just be 'Point Break' with street racers instead of surfers in many ways it is but there are as many differences as similarities. As one might expect there are a succession of action set pieces; this include several races, fights, shootings and a spectacular truck robbery that goes horribly wrong. These are pretty exciting even if they are a bit unrealistic at times an example of this is the truck hijacking; it takes place on what appears to be a main road but we don't see a single other vehicle for the entire scene if you can ignore this sort of thing this shouldn't detract from the film. The cast might not be Oscar contenders but the do a solid job. Overall this is a solid enough brain-in-neutral action film.",7,0,2,12 November 2015
The Exorcist," A classic
","This is one of those films that people think they should see as it is one of the most famous films of its genre. Often such well known films suffer from the fact that even before one sees it the viewer has probably heard a lot about it or seen the most famous scenes being spoofed in other films or on television, unfortunately this was the case for me when I watched The Exorcist with many of the classic scenes losing their impact. That said I still really enjoyed it even though I wasn't scared by it.Unlike more modern films we aren't suddenly thrown in to the action but slowly introduced to the characters; Father Karras a Catholic priest who is starting to question his faith, Chris MacNeil an actress living in Georgetown and her twelve year old daughter Regan who starts out as a normal girl but starts to exhibit disturbing behaviour which is initially thought to be a lesion on her brain. When scans fail to show anything and her behaviour becomes more extreme one of the doctors suggests something more radical: an exorcism.When Regan's mother approaches Fr. Karras he initially refuses to perform an exorcism saying such things are ancient history and have no place in the modern church, he does agree to see Regan as a psychiatrist though and when he does he is shocked that she knows personal things about him and is claiming to be the Devil himself. Eventually he comes to believe an exorcism is needed and the church call in Father Merrin, a priest with some experience in the field.While the special effects may look a bit dated by today's standards however they still look pretty good and don't have that fake look much CGI does. The main reason the film works so well is the quality of the cast, Jason Miller does a fantastic job as Fr. Karras and Linda Blair did such a good job as Regan that to this day it remains her most famous role. While I didn't find the film frightening there were quite a few shocks, not least of which is when Regan, who started off a sweet child, starts uttering obscenities in a strange voice.",9,1,2,13 December 2009
Now You See Me," Four magicians commit three 'impossible' crimes
","In the opening scenes of this heist film we are introduced to four magicians; Danny Atlas, a street magician who entertains people with card tricks; Merritt McKinney, a hypnotist who uses his skills to blackmail people; Henley Reeves, an escapologist and Jack Wilder another street magician who uses his tricks to distract people while stealing their wallets. We see each of them perform a trick then find a tarot card; the messages on the cards bring them together in a New York apartment. Who brought them together is a mystery but one year later the four of them are putting on a show in Las Vegas under the name 'The Four Horsemen'. Here they perform an apparently impossible trick they use a member of the audience to rob a bank on the other side of the world! FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes is soon on the case alongside Alma Dray, a French Interpol agent. They are also being followed by Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician who now debunks other people's tricks. Their next trick involves emptying the bank account of their sponsor, millionaire Arthur Tressler and putting the cash into the accounts of the audience. After this they announce one more spectacular event which will take place in New York.If you are looking for anything vaguely realistic then this isn't the film for you. Like many heist movies we are invited to sympathise with the criminals; not only are they likable it is made clear that the victims of their tricks a getting what they deserve. The pace is fast enough for us not to worry too much about just how implausible it really is. The cast, which includes some well-known stars, do a solid job and work well together. Like most good magic tricks this film relies on misdirection; while the viewers are concentrating on the Four Horsemen and trying to figure out how they are committing their crimes and how they will evade the authorities they won't be thinking about who is behind their operation and even if you are thinking about it suspicion is pointed at several possible characters and it obviously isn't anybody too likely. Overall I'd say that this is a fun, inoffensive heist movie that passes a couple of hours nicely.",7,0,0,12 May 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Can the past be changed?
","In a not too distant future mutants, and those who may give birth to mutants are hunted down by Sentinels; robots that can sense mutant DNA and are resistant to mutant attacks thanks to a design that incorporates mutant DNA taken from Mystique in 1973. There is one way to prevent the war but it won't be easy. Kitty Pryde uses her powers to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his 1973 body in order to stop Mystique killing the Sentinel's designer Bolivar Trask the murder that led to the programme being authorised. It won't be easy; he will have to persuade both Charles Xavier and Magneto to help him; the former is taking medication that removes his power and the latter is imprisoned deep below the Pentagon! Even when he has them it won't be easy and the clock is ticking as time passes at the same rate in the future and the Sentinels are closing in on the Mutants.This is a solid addition to the X-Men franchise; it starts with an exciting battle scene before setting up an enjoyable and interesting story. The story moves at a good pace and incorporates several impressive set-pieces; most notably the prison break to rescue Magneto and a scene at the Paris Peace Conference where the mutants are revealed to the world. All the action leads to an exciting show down in Washington DC. As one would expect the special effects are great and the cast does a fine job. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine naturally dominates the proceedings but the rest of the cast are impressive too; most notably Jennifer Lawrence who is great as Mystique. Peter Dinklage makes a good 'bad guy' as Trask; I liked the fact that he isn't played as an evil character. The ending does undo some of the things that happened in the opening trilogy leading to some enjoyable appearances from some familiar characters that hadn't been seen for a while. Overall an enjoyable film that fans of the franchise should enjoy.",8,0,1,31 July 2016
Ocean's Eleven," A fun caper film
","I'm aware that it is a remake of an earlier film but as I've not seen that I can't say if it is as good or not. This is a fun caper film with a star cast who all appear to be having a great time, that isn't to say that they don't do a good job however.The film opens with Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, being released from prison. He has no plans of going straight though, he has a job planned, a big job that will require a large team of expert criminals. The job in question is robbing a Las Vegas casino, something considered impossible by most people but he thinks he has found away.The early part of the film concentrates on recruiting the team and their preparations for the job itself, when they start their on site preparations it becomes clear that money isn't Danny's only motivation for robbing this particular casino; its owner is going out with his ex-wife. The robbery itself is pretty exciting even though the viewer is never in much doubt that nothing bad will happen to our anti-heroes, after all it is a fun film not a gritty drama.I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch a fun will that doesn't contain lots of violence, it might not be all that realistic but if you can suspend your disbelief it is a well made, well acted caper film.",7,0,2,5 August 2009
Spirited Away," A Masterpiece From Studio Ghibli
","This is probably Hayao Miyazaki's best film and given the very high quality of his other films that is saying a lot. As always with Studio Ghibli films the animation is absolutely beautiful and the story is enthralling.The story follows the adventures of ten year old Chihiro who finds her self trapped in a spirit world when her parents take a wrong turn on the way to a new house. They enter this world through a tunnel which they think leads to an abandoned theme park. Her parents help themselves to the food at a restaurant and while they eat Chihiro explores fearing they will get in trouble for eating the food. While exploring she meets Haku, a young boy, who tells her she must leave before it gets dark, unfortunately when she gets to where her parents were eating she finds two pigs and she can't return to the car as a river now blocks her way.As it is too late for her to leave and she wants to rescue her parents she has to stay. Haku tells her that humans are not allowed in the spirit world but if she can get a job there she will be allowed to stay. She manages to get a job in the bath house where she impresses the others when she deals with the stink god who isn't quite what he originally appears to be. She also lets the mysterious No-Face enter, at first he is welcome as he hands out gold to the workers but as he eats more and more they realise he isn't as benevolent as he seems. There are further adventures involving Haku, No-Face, Yubaba (a witch) and a giant baby amongst others.The film is full of strange and wonderful characters, some are friendly, some are creepy but none seem really malicious. This film is suitable for all but the youngest or most nervous of children, it ends with Chihiro earning freedom for herself and her parents not slaying some evil monster. If you enjoy traditional animation and have yet to see this then you really should give it a go, I'm sure people will be enjoying this for decades to come.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",10,0,0,28 June 2008
Duck You Sucker," A Fistful of Dynamite
","Set during the Mexican Revolution in 1913, Juan Miranda isn't too worried about politics so long as there are valuables to be stolen. Shortly after robbing a stage coach he and his family cross paths with John Mallory, an Irish terrorist on the run who just happens to be an explosives expert. John tells him that he is going to work at a local silver mine but Juan has other ideas with John's help he thinks he can rob the bank in Mesa Verde; something he has dreamt since he was a youngster. John isn't so keen but ultimately the pair end up in Mesa Verde and attack the bank only to discover that there isn't a single peso inside; its vaults are instead being used to house political prisoners. This is the first of many major confrontations with the authorities and reprisals are inevitable by the end Juan isn't so worried about getting rich but by getting even.This is another solid western from Sergio Leone; as one would expect there are some good laughs to be had; it is also its serious moments though the film doesn't shy away from showing some brutal moments; most notably when large numbers of people are gunned down by the soldiers. It isn't totally on-sided though; soldiers are gunned down and blown up by the protagonists in situations where they don't have a chance. There is plenty of action in the film's two and a half hour run time as well as some deliberately slow moments. Leone makes good use of the Spanish desert as a substitute for Mexico. Rod Steiger does a great job as Juan; it is hard to believe he is the same actor who appeared in 'In the Heat of the Night' thanks to the totally different accent and a scruffy beard. He is ably supported by James Coburn, who plays John. Overall I'd certainly recommend this even if it isn't quite as entertaining as Leone's best known westerns; it is a shame this one isn't better known.",8,2,3,3 June 2016
Tropic Thunder," Very funny although it may offend some
","When I got this I wasn't sure what to expect, I only bought it because it was very cheap. I'm glad I did get it though as it was hilarious. I was a little unsure at the start when the characters were introduced by showing trailers for the characters previous films although in retrospect it did serve to quickly introduce them and let us know the sort of performers each of them were; Ben Stiller is a Hollywood leading man who has fallen out of favour after a string of superhero sequels, Jack Black is known for films where he dons a fat suit and plays an entire family and Robert Downey Jnr. is a method actor who is willing to go further than most to get into the character he is playing.When the film proper starts we find the characters playing parts in a big budget Vietnam war movie directed by Steve Coogan; unfortunately he blows that budget on a pyrotechnic spectacular which he didn't even catch on film. Threatened with having the project shut down he decides to turn it into a low budget more realistic film shot on hand held video and cameras hidden in the jungle. To this end he takes the cast into the jungle and explains to them what he expects them to do. He then treads on a old land mine and is blown to bits. Most of his cast think this was just a special effect and to Stiller even laughs and plays with his head thinking it is a fake. As they go off to make their film they don't realise that area of jungle is run by a drug dealer's private army. So sure is Stiller that everything is part of the movie he doesn't realise what is going on even when he is captured and they start to torture him.This film was littered with hilarious moments although some may offend some viewers. Of the main cast Robert Downey Jnr. stands out as an actor who went so far as to get his skin darkened so he could play a black man... much to the understandable annoyance of a real black actor who thought blacking up had ended years ago. It was a pity that Steve Coogan's character got killed off so soon as he was very funny. Tom Cruise was also impressive as the producer, he was almost unrecognisable in a bald wig and heavy make up. Talking of make up credit must go to that department for the work the did on Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jnr. as neither looked like themselves. The film is obviously full of clichés but that is all part of the kind of films they are spoofing. Over all I thought it was a very funny film which got close to going too far and causing offence without quite doing so, although different people will have different views on that.",9,0,2,6 May 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A live action comic book - great fun!
","I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy this film but when a couple of people I know raved about it I though I should check it out; I'll have the thank them as it was a lot of fun. It is essential to know that this film is not meant to be in any way realistic in one scene the hero gets punched through three brick walls and is barely hurt! That is part of the fun though; it is a live action film that has the same rules as a Loony Tunes Cartoon; it could so easily have been terrible but instead it was a lot of fun.One day Scott Pilgrim spots a beautiful girl with bright pink hair, called Ramona, and he is immediately smitten; he must date her even though he is already dating a seventeen-year-old schoolgirl called Knives. At the time their relation starts he doesn't realise that he will have to battle each of Ramona's seven evil exes if he wishes to keep her... and live. The fights aren't normal scraps; they are like something out of a video game, complete with sound and visual effects and when he wins he gets points and just as his vanquished foe disappears money appears in their place. As he works his way through the exes Scott learns a bit about himself and realises that he hasn't behaved all that well to his exes.Director Edgar Wright did a fine job bringing the story to the screen; managing to make the cartoon-like elements seem fun rather than just a gimmick. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were great as Scott and Ramona; the fact that he isn't the typical action star made it easier to root for his character even though he was clearly flawed. It wasn't just comic-book fight scenes there were also some good laughs; frequently provided by Scott's sharp-tongued gay roommate. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to anybody looking for something a little different.",9,4,10,17 May 2011
Enchanted," A great modern fairytale
","Even though I'd heard good things about this film I wasn't sure what to expect as I haven't watched an animated Disney film in decades, aren't that keen on romcoms and dislike it when film characters break out in song... in the face of it I should have hated this film but as it turned out I loved it! Starting in a saccharine sweet animated kingdom we are introduced to Giselle; a princess attended on by a variety of overly cute forest creatures; one day she is attacked by a troll but luckily she is saved by Prince Edward. This being a fairy tale they fall in love and are due to be married but Edward's wicked step mother pushes her into a magical fountain and she finds herself in New York City. As she wanders round looking for her prince Robert, a divorce lawyer, and his young daughter help her. Edward follows through the fountain to find his beloved.As I watched the opening scenes I was fairly sure I wasn't going to like the film but once the action moved to New York where everything became live action I really enjoyed it and laughed often even though I'm sure I'm not part of the target demographic. Amy Adams was an utter delight as Giselle; making the character a naïve innocent without being irritating. James Marsden hammed it up in an entertaining fashion and Timothy Spall was fun as his less than trustworthy sidekick. Also of note was Patrick Dempsey who played Robert; it can't have been easy playing the one normal main character amongst a group of fairytale characters. While this is a fairytale it is rather nice that for once the heroine wasn't just a damsel in distress; when there is danger Giselle is quick to get stuck in. This is a film that adults and children can enjoy equally and I heartily recommend it to both.",9,1,1,22 April 2011
The Usual Suspects," What really happened?
","This is one of the most gripping films I've seen, it is one of those films you have to watch again so that you can appreciate early events in the light of what is revealed later in the film. Even now that I've seen is several times I'm not 100% sure what is true and what is misdirection.The cast all do a great job, especially Gabriel Byrne as the charismatic ex-corrupt police officer Dean Keaton who is trying to go straight after a life of crime, Pete Postlethwaite as the mysterious Kobayashi and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, a crippled con artist who is explaining what happened to the authorities (and us) what may have happened in the run up to his arrest.The film opens in the aftermath of a battle on a boat in a harbour in Los Angeles, there are only two know survivors; Verbal and a badly burnt Hungarian. Dave Kujan, a US customs officer, is sure that Keaton masterminded the attack and has escaped so he interviews Verbal who has done a deal with the police and is soon to be released. Verbal tells a tale of how the group met up when they were all hauled in by the NYPD for a robbery and put in a line up together. There they plan a job to get back at the police before heading to LA to lie low and to fence their ill-gotten gains. Here they are approached by Kobayashi, a lawyer claiming to work for Keyser Soze, a mysterious character who strikes fear into the hearts of criminals even though none have actually met him. Kobayashi explains that they must do one job for Mr Soze. All this is told us by Verbal so we never really know if he is telling the truth, and if he is lying is it to protect himself, his friend Keaton or perhaps he is just making up a story for his own personal amusement while awaiting release.The story is brilliantly told and it is rightly considered a modern classic, if you haven't seen it yet then I strongly recommend watching it... twice! Although even then you'll not fully understand what has happened.",10,1,1,27 July 2009
Inside Out," A bitter-sweet masterpiece from Disney/Pixar
","This Disney/Pixar film is primarily set in the head of eleven year old Riley Andersen where five emotions; Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger are based. They live in 'Head Quarters' from where they control her temperament and help organise her memories. Overall they are primarily joyful but when her family moves away from her friends in Minnesota to a new home and a new life in San Francisco things start to go wrong. As Riley goes to her new school for the first time Sadness accidentally causes her to cry in front of her new classmates and for the first time a sad core memory is created. Joy tries to stop it being processed and in the process disrupts the other core memories deactivating Riley's 'personality islands'. As Joy struggles with Sadness the two of them and the core memories and removed from Head Quarters; this leaves Disgust, Fear and Anger trying to control Riley's emotions with disastrous results if Joy and Sadness can't get back with the core memories Riley will suffer permanent emotional damage.I had heard that this film was something very special long before I eventually watched it for me it definitely lived up to the hype. It is rather appropriate that a film about emotions is one of the most emotional I've seen for some time and fittingly, given that Joy and Sadness are the main characters, I shed tears of both joy and sadness before it was over. The creators did a beautiful job anthopomorphising the emotions in a way that created a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. The voice actors do a fine job bringing these characters, as well as the human characters, to life. The story is told at a good pace and there are some gentle scares as well as some loss; particularly in an emotional scene of self-sacrifice involving Riley's previously forgotten imaginary friend. While it is sad at times there are just as many joyful moments as well as some good laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film to people of all ages; I've only just watched it but want to watch it again soon.",10,7,24,25 August 2016
The Duchess," When a woman's duty was to provide a son
","On the face of it life for Georgiana Spencer is going to get even better as William, The Duke of Devonshire; the most senior peer in England was to marry her. The problem was he had little interest in her apart from her ability to provide him with a male heir. Their relationship worsens when she produces two daughters but no sons. Life at home may be strained but she is one of the most popular in London society; drawing a crowd where ever she goes and even getting involved in politics. She also draws the attention of up and coming politician Charles Grey; at first they are just friends but that changes after she has produced an heir for the duke and he has not only started having an affair with Georgiana's friend Bess but actually moved her into the marital home. Being that this is the eighteenth century standards are quite different and the duke does not see her behaviour as mirroring his; he is just concerned that the gossip about his wife's affair will become public; he gives her an ultimatum; she will stop seeing Charles or she will never see her children again.This isn't the sort of film I usually watch but I'm glad I did as I rather enjoyed it. Keira Knightley does a fine job in the title role; showing both the joy and despair of the duchess at various stages of the film. Ralph Fiennes is very good as the duke; a man who clearly has difficulty showing emotions and whose only real desire is to have a son... the only time he appears genuinely animated is when he is talking to Bess's sons. As one would expect from a quality period drama everything looks great; beautiful houses in beautiful settings inhabited by beautifully dressed people; even the numerous servants are dressed in impressive attire. It isn't all beauty though; the way society treats women of the day is fairly shocking and at one point the duke rapes his wife and nobody does a thing. If you like period dramas this is certainly worth watching; even if it isn't your favourite genre you may find yourself enjoying it; I know I did.",8,0,0,20 November 2012
Die Hard 2," More action doesn't make a better film
","It is Christmas again and for cop John McClane that means dealing with terrorists! While waiting for his wife's flight to arrive at Washington DC's Dulles International Airport he sees a couple of guys behaving suspiciously; follows them and ends up in a firefight that leaves one of them dead. The airport cops say it was probably just punks stealing from the baggage but when McClane checks the dead man's fingerprints he learns that he was supposed to be dead two years previously. It looks as though he was a mercenary and he was clearly up to something it doesn't take long before that something becomes apparent; former army officer Col. Stuart and a group of mercenaries have taken control of air traffic control system and are threatening to start crashing aircraft if their demands aren't met they want foreign drug dealer Gen. Ramon Esperanza handed over to them when the flight bringing him to US custody arrives. It is up to McClane to foil Stuart's plans before his wife's plane runs out of fuel while local authorities are unimpressed by his presence.The original 'Die Hard' was a taut action thriller with a small group of terrorists, led by a charismatic leader, being confronted by a lone cop of a sealed skyscraper here there are far more bad guys and the action is set in a sprawling airport complex and even though there is more action the story is less exciting. Col. Stuart is lacking the charisma required to be the main villain and with every confrontation McClane survives virtually unscathed it becomes even less believable. The conspiracy to free Gen. Esperanza is too large; we are expected to believe that as well as Stuart's mercenaries there is a squad of US soldiers who are in on it, we must also believe that they have the skills to take over the air traffic control system entirely and that there are no other airports capable of receiving the circling planes! If you can ignore all that there are several exciting moments and some spectacular explosions as well as some amusing moments; mostly involving McClane's wife and sleazy TV journalist Richard Thornburg. The acting is solid enough with Bruce Willis doing what Bruce Willis does as John McClane and the rest of the cast being good enough but not really providing memorable characters. Overall this is entertaining as a mindless action thriller but somewhat disappointing as a Sequel to a great original.",7,0,2,31 May 2015
Resident Evil," Solid enough zombie movie based on a video game
","As the film opens we that the film is set in a near future where the Umbrella Corporation is the world's largest business and that some of its activities are distinctly shady. The action then starts in a lab where an unknown thief steals a case containing a biological weapon that we later learn is called the T-Virus. As he fleas he smashes one of the vials releasing the virus into the facility, known as The Hive. As the virus is spread through the air-conditioning The Hive's computer seals the facility and kills everybody inside. We then cut to the sight of a naked woman, Alice, wrapped in a shower curtain; she gets dressed and is surprised first by an unknown man then by a whole squad of commandos! Their leader addresses her as 'Soldier' but she has no idea who she is. The other man identifies himself as a newly transferred police officer. These two are then taken by an underground railway to The Hive where we learn they intend to shut down the computer, known as Red Queen. Red Queen's defences kill many of the commandos and before the others shut it down its avatar informs them that they will all die. It soon becomes apparent that the people in The Hive have come back to life as zombies! Perhaps Red Queen was right; certainly many of them won't make it; some of them will become zombies themselves and not all of the dangers are outside the group.I have not played the computer games this film was inspired by so can't say how the story compares but it didn't feel like there was much unexplained within the film. The fact that Alice has no memory means that we are told everything we need to know as the leader of the commandos tells her. The film opens strongly with the scenes with Red Queen killing everybody in The Hive and after we have been introduced to Alice and her situation the action is pretty good. It is also varied; we have Red Queen's futuristic defences that literally slice and dice some commandos with a laser, hordes of zombies, zombie guard dogs and a mutant creature for our protagonists to battle against. While nobody is going to be winning any Oscars for this the cast do a decent enough job; Milla Jovovich is good as Alice; putting in some good action scenes and Michelle Rodriguez is fun as the hard-core commando Rain Ocampo and Colin Salmon adds some class as the commandos' leader although sadly he doesn't last too long. In many ways this film feels like 'Aliens' with the aliens replaced by zombies; we have an evil corporation, one of the group who is working against their interests and the fact that the protagonist and the toughest soldier are both women... I guess if one is going to borrow ideas from another film one could do a lot worse that take from 'Aliens'. The effects are fairly mixed; the zombies, both human and canine, are impressive but some of the CGI is far too obvious. The Red Queen is delightfully creepy due to the fact that it speaks with the voice of a young girl and prior to shutdown appears to be all-seeing. Overall this film is far from perfect but it is surprisingly fun in a fairly trashy way.",7,1,2,5 August 2015
Dirty Dancing," An enjoyable romance which has become something of a classic
","It is 1963 and the Houseman family are spending their summer at a resort on the Catskill Mountains; it is the sort of place well to do families go to holiday and boys get waiting jobs before heading off to Ivy League universities. It is quite clear that many of the families hope their daughters might meet a nice prospective husband there they certainly aren't expected to get involved with the other staff; the professional dance instructors who are seen as being from the wrong side of the tracks. Frances 'Baby' Houseman finds herself attracted to one of these 'bad boys', Johnny Castle, after she strays into the staff area and sees them 'dirty dancing'. Initially he sees her as just another rich girl who thinks she knows it all, but then she helps when his dance partner Penny needs money for an abortion. This means he needs a new dance partner for an event at another hotel and Baby volunteers; so begins her dancing lessons. After the event they return and learn that Penny's abortion was horribly botched; Baby takes control of the situation and gets her father, who is a doctor. This has an obvious effect on their relationship; he feels he can no longer trust her and he certainly doesn't want her seeing Johnny again.I first saw this film many years ago but had forgotten most of it so thought it might be worth watching again. The overall story is reasonably predictable but there are some surprises; the illegal abortion subplot is certainly darker than one might expect in a romantic story. This does add to the plot though; bringing Baby and Johnny closer together as well as driving a wedge between Baby and her father. In a film like this the music is obviously important and even though the music isn't of the period it is effective; this is especially true of the finale where Baby and Johnny dance to 'The Time of Your Life' which provides the film's most memorable moment. The leads do an impressive job; Jennifer Grey may not be conventionally sexy but she has plenty of attitude which makes her character and her relationship believable. Patrick Swayze also impresses as Johnny. These two have a good chemistry and their relationship develops nicely through the film as does Baby's dancing ability. Overall I'd say this film is well worth watching even if you aren't a fan of romances.",8,0,2,6 May 2016
Quantum of Solace," A weaker than average Bond Film
","I had put off watching this for a while as I'd heard negative things about it and after the excellent 'Casino Royale' I didn't want to see Bond in a poor film. When I had an opportunity to borrow a copy of the film I decided I'd put off viewing it long enough. At first I wasn't too impressed, the car chase opening was good enough but nothing we hadn't seen before and the title song was a contender for the worst opening song to date.Set just after the end of 'Casino Royale' Bond is seeking revenge for death of Vesper, he has captured Mr White and is about to interrogate him. Before he can get started Mr White says he is part of a secretive organisation with people placed everywhere... a second later one of M's bodyguards shoots her and facilitates White's escape. Bond gives chase but fails to catch him. He ends up following a lead that takes him to Haiti, Austria and finally Bolivia. The lead he is following is supposed environmental campaigner Dominic Greene during this pursuit he meets the main 'Bond girl' Camille, a member of Greene's organisation who appears to have crossed him. As Bond gets closer to Greene he is ordered to stand down; second 'Bond girl' Fields is dispatched to bring him home and the CIA are trying to kill him because they think Greene has found oil in Bolivia.The film wasn't as bad as I'd feared but it was a bit of a mess; we were given little information about the sinister organisation apart from its name: Quantum, presumably this was to partly justify the film's title. I won't spoil Greene's goal here but will say it didn't exactly seem the sort of thing a Bond villain would usually be up to. Thankfully the acting was good, Daniel Craig is great in the role and could go on to take Sean Connery's title of 'Best Bond' in time, Olga Kurylenko did well enough as Camille and Gemma Arterton was sadly underused as Fields.Overall it was a decent action film but a sub-par as a Bond film, I hope the next film has more plot to it, this one felt like the second unit director was in charge of procedures as the film lurched from one action scene to the next with little time in between to explain what is happening and why.",6,5,10,25 October 2009
The Dirty Dozen," An unconventional major leads a dozen army convicts it kill Nazi generals in France
","Major John Reisman is an unconventional US Army officer and he has been given a very unconventional mission. He is to lead a force made up of twelve army convicts and attack a château in France where senior German officers regularly meet. These twelve men haven't been convicted of minor crimes; most of them have been sentenced to hang and the others have a long time in prison in front of them. They are told that they is a good chance that they won't survive but if they perform well they will be offered an amnesty. Before they can proceed with the mission they must be moulded into a unit rather than twelve individuals looking out for themselves. Then they will have to prove themselves to sceptical senior officers. If they fail at any point they will return to face their sentences. Eventually they are ready and the Germans won't know what hit them!This is a classic 'Boys' Own Adventure' type of war film; the story is relatively simple but effective. There is plenty of humour as the team gradually bond; especially when they are getting the better of the officious Colonel Breed and the scenes in France are genuinely exciting and it soon becomes clear that they won't all be returning home. The cast does a fine job; most notably Lee Marvin, who is great as Major Reisman; Charles Bronson, who plays the German-speaking Joseph Wladislaw and Telly Savalas, who is particularly disturbing as Archer Maggott a murderous rapist who believes he is doing God's work. The rest of the cast, which includes some familiar faces are good too. If you are looking for gritty realism this may disappoint but if you want a great bunch of characters, a touch of humour all leading up to an explosive finale you should love it.",9,1,4,9 August 2017
Alien vs. Predator," Better than I expected
","I must admit I'd avoided watching this film for a while expecting it to be terrible, however when it was on television I decided to give it a go. While I don't think it was as good as the original films it was better than I expected.Set on present day Earth a heat signature is spotted deep under the Antarctic ice, satellite images show that it appears to be a pyramid. An expedition is set up by Charles Bishop Weyland to investigate this strange find. When they get there they are surprised to discover a shaft leading from the surface to the pyramid, assuming it must have been made by another team of explorers they head down, little knowing that it was in fact made by a Predator hunting party that lands soon after and wipes out the surface party. About the same time an Alien queen within the pyramid is awakened and starts laying eggs. Shortly after the team divide into two groups they trigger a mechanism which causes parts of the pyramid to move, trapping one group in a room into which Alien eggs are inserted with the inevitable results. The remaining explorers must then battle to survive against the Aliens which the small group of Predators intend to hunt as a rite of passage.Fans of the original films may be disappointed at this much tamer combination of the two, the lower rating means that there is almost no real gore and it is never really frightening. It isn't a terrible story though, the acting isn't bad and the special effects are pretty good so if you haven't seen it and it is on television it is worth watching, I won't be buying the DVD though.",5,0,0,22 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," A bleak but brilliant film
",When hunter Llewelyn Moss comes across the site of a massacre in West Texas he does something that will make life very dangerous for himself and those around him; he picks up a case containing two million dollars. Soon sinister killer Anton Chigurh is looking for him and wherever Llewelyn goes Anton isn't far behind; leaving a trail of bodies as he goes. Also looking for the pair is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell; a law enforcement officer who understandable has difficulty comprehending the violence he encounters.This is a contender for the best film made by the Cohen Brothers; the tension is maintained throughout and there are quite a few surprises. These surprises aren't clichéd twists but things one doesn't expect in films of course listing these surprises would spoil the film for first time viewers. There is a bleak feeling to the film; both because of the casual extreme violence and the sun-baked Texas countryside. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin are great as Sheriff Bell and Llewelyn Moss but it is Javier Bardem who is most memorable; his portrayal of the killer is frighteningly impressive; he isn't a musclebound heavy but still feels almost as unstoppable as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator. It isn't just the three leads who are on top form; Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald loses her native accent and passes as Texan at least to my English ears. As the film reaches its conclusion the viewer will be left wanting to know what happens next for reasons that I won't spoil but left me quite surprised; so much so that I sat through the credits to see if there was a postscript there isn't.Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed previous films by the Cohens; just don't expect any laughs.,10,2,2,24 June 2013
District 9," Aliens in Jo'burg
","In films when a giant spacecraft arrives on Earth the aliens are greeted by friendly humans then to proceed to wage war on humanity; here things are different. When the aliens arrive their ship doesn't appear to be functioning and they are starving. The million or so alien refuges are then forced to live in the eponymous District 9; a squalid Johannesburg township. Here they live for twenty years until it is decided to move them away from the city. The man in charge of the evacuation is Wikus Van de Merwe; an ordinary civil servant, certainly not the sort of character one would expect to take the lead in a science fiction action film. While serving eviction notices he accidentally becomes contaminated by an alien device, he soon gets ill and is horrified when one of his arms becomes like that of the aliens. His superiors don't help him though; they take him to a lab where they plan to vivisect him as his new arm gives him the ability to fire alien weapons something no other human can do. He manages to escape but the only place he can hide is in District 9; here he will have to earn the trust of the aliens as well as avoiding security forces who want to capture him and Nigerian gangsters who want to eat his arm! His struggle will see him fighting his own people alongside an alien is some fairly spectacular and slightly gory action scenes.I really enjoyed this film; it made a nice change to see a film set in modern Africa that wasn't a worthy film about various bad things happening to the people there. It is possible to see the treatment of the aliens as a metaphor for the old apartheid system but it isn't too heavy-handed. I don't know if the actors are well known in South Africa but they were all unknown to me, which had the advantage that I didn't immediately know who the hero of the film, was going to be. Much of the early part of the film was filmed as though it was being filmed by a news-crew giving it a realistic feel even when there were loads of CGI aliens on screen! The actors were good; especially Sharlto Copley who played Van de Merwe; he wasn't your standard action hero but brought plenty of humanity and a degree of vulnerability to the role. If you are a fan of science fiction and haven't seen this yet I highly recommend you give it a go.",9,1,5,10 June 2011
Mamma Mia!," Good cheesy fun
","This jukebox musical featuring the songs of ABBA is set on a small Greek island where twenty year old Sophie wants her father to give her away at her wedding. There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is. She has narrowed it down to three men thanks to a nose through her mother's diaries. She thinks that if she meets the men she will be able to figure out which one is her father so invites all three of them without telling her mother. When they arrive she realises that she has no idea; any one of them could be her father. When her mother learns that they are there she worries that they will spoil the wedding. When the men realise why Sophie invited them they each think they are her father and expect to be the one to walk her down the aisle it will certainly be an interesting wedding.I must admit that this isn't the sort of film I usually watch but I was curious about what it would be like due to its popularity and some positive reviews. The story isn't very deep but that isn't a problem as it is effectively there to provide reasons for the cast to sing many of ABBA's greatest hits and it is the cast singing not just miming to the songs. The cast is clearly having a good time and that sense of fun is infectious; the fact that not all of them are particularly good singers makes the characters feel more real. Amanda Seyfried does a good job as Sophie and Meryl Streep is a delight as her mother. Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth impress as the three potential fathers. The Greek location looks great and adds to the fun of the film; I don't think it would have been half as enjoyable if it wasn't set such a beautiful and sunny location. Overall this was a lot more enjoyable than I expected and anybody who enjoys the songs of ABBA should love it.",8,0,1,24 June 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A thrilling ride
","This, the second of 'The Hobbit' trilogy sees Bilbo, Gandalf and the Dwarfs continuing their quest to the Lonely Mountain although they part company with Gandalf early on. Their journey will take them into the Mirkwood where they must battle giant spiders before being captured by the Wood Elves. Following Bilbo's use of The Ring they escape their captors but soon find themselves battling Orcs again; they are aided by two elves; Tauriel and Legolas and get to the lakeside. From here they are taken to the town of Esgaroth by Bard the ferryman before continuing to the Lonely Mountain where they come face to face with the dragon Smaug. Meanwhile Gandalf goes to Dol Guldur where he learns that an ancient evil has been awakened.This seems to be a 'love it or loathe it' part of the trilogy; largely because it has no real ending; just as the action involving Smaug appears to be reaching its climax the film ends leaving us waiting for the next film to learn what happens. This didn't bother me too much as the film was packed with action and left me wanting to see the finale. No time is wasted in setting up the story and the protagonists go from one perilous situation to the next with barely a moment for them to relax in between. The action is impressive; I especially liked the giant spiders and the fight against Smaug. There was some humour mixed in with the action but not enough to make things too silly. There is also a hint of romance between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili. The cast do a solid job; most notably Martin Freeman in the role of Bilbo Baggins. There are some weaknesses; most notably there isn't the sense of danger that there should be as the protagonists seem to be almost indestructible as they survive one danger after another while the apparently mighty orcs are easily slain of course this does mean it can be enjoyed by younger viewers. Overall this was a thrilling ride that left me keen to see the final film in the trilogy.",8,0,2,13 March 2016
Days of Thunder," Cruise trades his wings for wheels and NASCAR action
","This film sees Tom Cruise playing Cole Trickle, a successful Californian race car driver who wishes to switch to stock-cars. He is an instinctive and very fast driver but he has difficulty switching to the very different cars; constantly pushing them beyond their limits; destroying engines and tyres in the process. He quickly develops a rivalry with current champion Rowdy Burns but gradually improves and starts winning races... then he and Rowdy have a terrible collision that puts them both in hospital. While Cole gradually recovers, and develops a relationship with his attractive doctor, another young driver takes over his car. When he finally back to racing he has a new rival and must also deal with his own nerves.This film is very much 'Top Gun in stock cars' with an almost identical plot... that doesn't matter too much though as it is a successful formula and the impressive editing and camerawork keep the race action exciting. Tom Cruise is solid as the arrogant Trickle and Robert Duvall adds a touch of class as engineer Harry Hogge who optimises his car. Nicole Kidman is likeable as love interest Dr. Claire Lewicki. There are few real surprises but if you want good solid action with no real villains, just rivals, you could do a lot worse. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see it is an exciting and undemanding way to pass the time.",7,2,3,27 August 2018
Toy Story 4," Four films in and 'Toy Story' is still charming
","As this film opens nine years prior to the main action when Woody is still one of Andy's toys; his friend Bo Peep, is being given to another child. After this prologue we return to the present where he is now one of Bonnie, Andy's sister's toys. He finds himself left in the closet while she plays with the other toys. Then, on her first day at school Bonnie makes her own toy out of a spork, this she names Forky. He is her new favourite toy. Forky doesn't think of himself as a toy and only Woody's interventions stop him throwing himself into the trash. Then on a family road trip Forky is lost and Woody determines to find him and return him to Bonnie. In the process he meets new toys and is reunited with an old friend.Each time a new 'Toy Story' film comes out I fear it will be the one that proves unnecessary and is disappointing... one day that may happen but it doesn't with this film. It provides a solid story, good action and some mildly frightening, in a child friendly way, scenes. Some may be disappointed that many of the old favourites amongst the toys have almost negligible roles to play; this is balanced by some great new toys; I particularly liked Forky, even though he was slightly disturbing with his mismatched eyes and desire to throw himself away. Other great additions are Duke Kaboom, a Canadian stunt-bike toy and Gabby Gabby, a doll with a faulty voice box. As before this isn't just about the toy's adventures; it is an emotional story which may bring a tear to the eyes of some viewers; particularly during the final scene. Overall I thought this was a great film which can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",10,2,3,12 March 2020
Batman Begins," Genesis of the Batman
","This, the first part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is as much about how and why billionaire Bruce Wayne became Batman as what he does once he has; in fact he doesn't don the bat suit until an hour into the film. In the prologue we see a young Bruce Wayne fall into a well where he is terrified by the bats he disturbed; creating a life long phobia. The first time we see him as an adult he is in a Himalayan prison; he is released and invited to train to become part of an organisation called the crime fighting organisation; League of Shadows. Upon completing his training he learns that the league's methods are radical in the extreme... they intend to destroy Wayne's home city of Gotham and everything in it because they believe the world needs to be cleansed of its corruption. Gotham is indeed a corrupt city but Wayne is determined that it can be saved. He returns home and uses the resources of Wayne Industries to create his Batman persona.This takes almost to the half way point of the film; in the second half we see him start his fight against those corrupting the city; the first person he goes against is local mobster Carmine Falcone; he may be the city's best known mobster but unbeknownst to him he was working for others; the psychiatrist Dr. Crane used Falcone to smuggle psychotropic drugs into the city; he used these to experiment on patients at the Arkham Asylum in preparation for the attack on the city being planned by the League of Shadows. If Batman is to thwart the League's plans he will have to confront his deepest fears and risk losing everything he has. He has few allies; just a policeman, Sgt. Gordon; his butler Alfred; Assistant DA and childhood friend, Rachel Dawes and demoted company researcher, Lucius Fox.Before watching this put any memories of the camp '60s TV show or the '80s films out of your minds; this is a complete reboot that is in no way connected to them and tells the story from the characters beginning. The first half of the film is less action packed as it deals with how Bruce loses his parents, struggles to come to terms with that loss and is trained by the Henri Ducard of the League of Shadows... this doesn't mean this section was any less interesting; in fact I found this to be an essential as it gave us the necessary insight into Batman's motivations rather than just expecting the viewer to accept that Bruce Wayne likes to fights crime dressed as a giant bat. The second half is packed with plenty of exciting action and it is fun to see some of Batman's famous gadgets; especially the new and imaginatively designed bat mobile. The gadgets aren't overdone though; he doesn't always have just the right piece of highly specialised kit!The cast is full of top quality actors including Christopher Bale as Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer... but it doesn't feel like an 'all-star cast' film where everybody gets a chance to show off; each of the cast plays their part well without overplaying it. This has a far more realistic feel than previous Batman films; the villains are entirely human without over the top mannerisms or camp costumes and because so much time was spent introducing the Bruce Wayne character he is the real character and Batman is just a costume he wears and even that is given a practical justification. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of intelligent action films; even if you don't usually like superhero films this one is worth checking out.",9,1,2,20 August 2012
Twilight," These vampires are different
","Not being anywhere near the target demographic I had no intention of watching this film but when it was on television and there was nothing else of interest on I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I must say that is was better than I'd expected; the story was pretty good, there were some child-friendly scares and a few laughs. 'Twilight' is the story of Isabella a seventeen year-old girl who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to the small town of Forks in Washington State. At here new school she meets a boy by the name of Edward Cullen; he and his family keep apart from the other children but he is drawn to her in the same way that she is drawn to him. He tries to keep away from her and to persuade her to keep away from him but that just seems to make her more interested. Eventually she learns the secret of his family; they are vampires! Unlike other vampires they only feed on animals and accept Bella even though she isn't one of them. They might not be a threat but other vampires are; especially one who has been killing people locally and has decided that Bella will be interesting prey because of another vampire's desire to protect her. Bella flees but is pursued; she is in real danger unless Edward and his family can kill the vampire who wants to kill her.I was surprised that I rather enjoyed this; not enough to rush out and buy it on DVD but I expect I'll watch further instalments when they are on television. Kristen Stewart did a good job as Bella and Robert Pattinson was fine as Edward even if his hair did make him look too much of a pretty-boy to be taken that seriously as a potentially dangerous creature! The story was quite good and the characters were well established by the time of the final confrontation. Many people I've heard talking about this film criticise it for radically changing the vampire mythology; instead of bursting into flames in sunlight the sparkle! This change didn't bother me too much; the only real criticism I have is that it went on a little too long after the 'final' confrontation and it wasn't subtle in setting up the fact that there will be further films although that shouldn't surprise anybody given that it is based on the first of a series of books. I wouldn't recommend that everybody rushes to see this film but if it is on television it is worth watching even if you aren't in the target demographic.",7,1,5,23 August 2011
Wreck-It Ralph," A villain is the hero of this enjoyable Disney animation
","This Disney animation isn't centred on a hero; its protagonist is the eponymous Wreck-It Ralph; the villain of the arcade game Fix-It Felix. While he lives alone in a dump while the other characters live in an apartment block. After thirty years he has had enough. He is told he can live in the apartment block if he wins a medal; the problem is villains don't get medals. When the arcade shuts down for the night the game characters leave their games and hang out together; he bumps into Space Marine from the 'bug hunt' game 'Hero's Duty' and decides to take this character's place and win a medal there. He gets his medal but is immediately attacked by a bug; he gets into an escape pod, with the bug, and ends up in another game; 'Sugar Rush'. Here he meets Vanellope Von Schweetz, a glitchy character who steals his medal so she can use it to enter a race to become one of the game's official racers. Now if he wants his medal back Vanellope will have to win the race so Ralph starts helping her. There are a few problems though; his own game doesn't work without him; the bug he brought to Sugar Rush threatens to breed and destroy the game and if a glitch wins the race it could leave to the game being shut down.At first glance this could be mistaken for 'Toy Story with video game characters' thankfully it takes the concept in interesting new directions. I liked having a 'designated villain' as the films protagonist and the way the characters switch between games was rather fun. Ralph is a solid protagonist, even if he is meant to be a villain it is clear that he is a good person at heart. Vanellope is a cute and fun female lead so there is a character for young boys and young girls to cheer for. The secondary characters are fun too; hard-as-nails Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from Hero's Duty and Fix-It Felix are fun, if unlikely, couple and King Candy makes a good antagonist; especially when we learn the truth about him. There are plenty of references to real video games, some I spotted but I'm sure there were many I didn't recognised as I was never a gamer. The action scenes are impressive with some really good animation; there are also plenty of laughs to be had some might be a little too scatological for some parents to approve of but I suspect those gags would have children laughing the most. The voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life in a way that doesn't sound overly cartoony as one would expect from Disney of course. Overall this is a fun animation that can be enjoyed by all children and probably most adults; especially those who grew up playing classic arcade games.",8,0,0,20 October 2017
Bridesmaids," An amusing, if somewhat course, comedy with a predominantly female cast
","Things aren't going to well for Annie, her business has failed and the man she is seeing only wants one thing and once that has finished he'd rather she left. Then her best friend Lillian invites her to be her maid of honour; this should be a good thing but things quickly get worse. Annie tries to organise things but Lillian's new friend Helen starts to take over proceedings. While this is going on Annie starts a relationship with the police officer who pulled her over. After a string of disasters to looks as if Annie and Lillian's friendship is doomed and Helen takes over the arrangements. At this point everything starts to get worse for Annie; she loses her job, her home and her new relationship appears to be over before it has really begun.This film shows that women can do gross-out humour just as well as men but that doesn't mean that all the humour is like that. There are plenty of laughs to be had; to my mind the best were provided by silliness rather than the more course moments. The story itself is fairly simple and predictable but it does serve to provide humorous situations. Kirsten Wiig carries the film in the role of Annie; she makes the character believable and sympathetic. She is ably supported by Maya Rudolph, Rose Bryne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon Covey and Ellie Kemper as Lillian and the other bridesmaids. Chris O'Dowd is likable in the role of the policeman Annie falls for. One could be excused for thinking this was a 'chick-flick' given the amount of pink on the DVD case but while I'm sure women will enjoy it there is no reason that men won't enjoy it too. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't too easily offended.",8,0,1,29 June 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The first of three long films based on a short book
","As this film opens an elderly Bilbo Baggins explains how the once great Dwarfs were forced out of their mountain kingdom by the dragon Smaug. He begins to talk of a great adventure and we are transported back to shortly before the adventure began when a young Bilbo meets the wizard Gandalf the Grey. He invites Bilbo on an adventure but he declines; the next day thirteen Dwarfs turn up at Bilbo's home believing that they have been invited. They tell him of their quest but he initially refuses; he has no desire to leave home. The next morning he changes his mind and so begins a quest that will see them fighting trolls, orcs and goblins as well as meeting elves, another wizard and in Bilbo's case the somewhat crazed Smeagol who will become a lifelong enemy following the theft of a certain ring.Before watching this the main criticism I'd heard was that breaking the story into three long films was a mistake; having seen it I'm inclined to agree. The story took too long to get started and when it did it got nowhere fast; the party had a succession of battles but there was never the sense of danger that there was in the Lord of the Rings films. Another weakness was the fact that the party was a large group of dwarfs with one hobbit and one wizard rather than the more mixed group in the earlier trilogy; only a couple of them stood out from the group; the rest were very much the same. On the plus side the film looked great with many sweeping shots though action set in a spectacular landscape and the actors did a decent enough job; I particularly enjoyed seeing Andy Serkis' return as Smeagol even though he is doing motion-capture work for a CGI character. Overall I'd say this is worth watching if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy even though it isn't as good as those films hopefully the next instalment will improve matters.",7,36,55,9 April 2013
Non-Stop," Far-fetched but definitely exciting
","Bill Marks is an air marshal on a flight from New York to Heathrow and as is to be expected in this sort of film he has his issues; in this case a drink problem following the death of his daughter some years ago. The flight starts normally enough as he chats to Jen, the woman seated next to him, but then he gets a message on his secure phone stating that a passenger will die every twenty minutes unless he arranges for $150,000,000 is placed in a numbered Swiss bank account. He initially assumes the other air marshal, Jack Hammond, is playing a joke but he assures Bill that he isn't. Shortly afterwards Jack is seen using his phone as he enters the toilet; Bill confronts him again this time Jack attacks him and after the fight Jack is dead. Soon Bill gets another message; the hijacker is still out there and one person is indeed dead. Now Bill knows the threat is very real and must decide who he can trust; there is Nancy, stewardess he knows and Jen who he instinctively trusts. He enlists their help to try to spot who is sending the messages. As time passes, and more people die, the tension rises and he even starts to question whether he can trust these two; then to make matters worse the airline start to believe that he is actually the hijacker!It must be said that the plot is rather far-fetched and there are a few plot-holes that surprisingly didn't bother me while I was watching as the tension was so high. This is largely down to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Bill Marks; he brings an intensity to the role that makes him believable even when what is going on isn't very likely. He is ably supported by Michelle Dockery as Nancy and the always dependable Julianne Moore as Jen. The setting provides us with lots of suspects so the viewer should be kept guessing till the very end. This ending is thrilling even though the hijacker's motive is particularly far-fetched. Before this finale there is a good amount of action, some of it fairly intense. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed Liam Neeson's other action films or who just enjoys the genre in general.",8,0,0,30 March 2017
The Princess Bride," A fun fairy tale for all ages
","The synopsis of this film in the TV guide suggested that this film's target audience would be young girls; but as I'd heard good things about it I decided to give it a go; I'm glad that I did, as it was a lot of fun. The main story is in fact a story within a story; a grandfather, played by Peter 'Columbo' Falk, visits his sick grandson and reads him a tale about a young woman called Buttercup who is destined to marry a prince she does not love after her one true love is killed by the dread Pirate Roberts. Shortly before the wedding she is kidnapped by ruffians who plan to kill her in order to start a war. As they take her they find themselves pursued by a masked man in black a man who claims to be none other than the dread Pirate Roberts! He manages to free the girl and when he removes his mask she is shocked to see who he is. Unfortunately she is soon back in the hands of the dastardly Prince Humperdink. As her wedding day approaches it looks as if nobody will rescue her but this being a fairy tale there is somebody who wants to free her and he won't let a little something like being dead stop him! This film is a lot of fun and will probably amuse children and adults alike although some scenes may disturb younger children. The cast do a good job and it is clear that they were having fun making it; the heroes are suitably heroic and the villains suitably villainous. While some of the scenery and special effects looked less than convincing by today's standards that only adding to the charm and giving it a feel of swashbuckling films made in the sixties. I'd certainly watch this film if you get the chance and you don't have to be young or a girl to think it is great.",8,2,4,27 January 2011
Zulu," Stirring stuff!
","This is one of the great British war movies depicting one of the most famous actions in British military history, albeit with more than a little poetic licence. In 1879 a force of 1200 British soldiers were slaughtered by the Zulu army at Isandlwana, soon after a force of 4000 Zulus headed to the mission at Rorkes Drift which was defended by a mere 100 men. It is this latter engagement which is depicted in this film.This is not a film about heroic white men defeating 'savage natives'; through out the Zulus are depicted as a brave and highly disciplined fighting force and whenever one of the soldiers makes a derogatory comment about the Zulus he is quickly corrected and by the end of the film the soldiers on both sides have a deep respect of the other. The first hour shows the defenders at the mission preparing for the inevitable attack; setting up barricades, making firing holes in the walls of the buildings and putting out the cooking fires. Once the battle begins the action is fairly relentless with Zulu warriors continuing to pour towards the mission despite continuous fire from the defenders.While the action may be tame by the standards of modern war films it still gives a feel of the battle this is helped by the excellent cast which includes Stanley Baker, Michael Caine and Jack Hawkins, it isn't just the stars who do well, the hundreds of Zulu extras made the opposing side totally believable. As well as the fine acting the great score by John Barry must be mentioned; it is impossible to hear it without it making ones hairs stand on end. Filmed on location in Natal the mountains prove in impressive back drop even if it wasn't filmed at the site of the actual battle.",10,8,10,9 September 2010
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A sequel that is as good as the original
","Five years have passed since the events of the first film and the people in the Viking village of Berk now live in peace with dragons. Hiccup has been told by his father that it is time for him to take over as village chief; however he doesn't feel ready. He wants to continue mapping undiscovered parts of the world with the help of his dragon Toothless. On one such flight they find a burnt village; it is a village of dragon catchers who are working for Drago Bludvist who wants them for his dragon army. His father tells him that Drago is a violent warlord who poses an imminent threat; Hiccup believes that he can talk to Drago and persuade him to live in peace. While trying to find Drago he encounters the mysterious 'Dragon Rider' who turns out to be someone surprisingly close to him that everybody thought had died years before. She lives with dragons in their vast, remote nest. Astrid and Hiccup's other friends try to help him find Drago but are captured and soon Drago is attacking the dragon nest with tragic consequences. He then sets off to attack Berk; Hiccup and his friends will have their toughest struggle yet if they are to keep the world safe for both humans and dragons.I enjoyed the original 'How to Train Your Dragon' far more than I expected so was very pleased that this sequel managed to live up to the original. While watching the original probably isn't absolutely essential I think one should try to watch it before this as it introduces the key characters and their situation; this would probably lose a lot of its depth without that prior knowledge. I was not surprised to read that director Dean DeBlois was inspired by 'The Empire Strikes Back' as this film is considerably darker than the original, especially in the middle section where a major character is killed. There are some clichÃ©s but that didn't bother me to much as the story was good. As before the animation is top notch; the many flight sequences are particularly spectacular. As well as action and tragedy there is of course a decent amount of comedy which is funny without being too goofy. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original and look forward to seeing the third film in the trilogy when in eventually gets made.",9,1,1,28 January 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A quirky film with an impressive cast
","The titular The Grand Budapest Hotel was in the fictional central European nation of Zubrowka; it has since been demolished but here we learn how its last owner came to possess this imposing building and why he stayed in the servants' quarters when he visited. Told in flashback, we learn that owner Zero Moustafa, a stateless immigrant, started off as a humble lobby boy working under M. Gustave, the hotel's previous, and greatest, concierge. M. Gustave was particularly popular with the female guests, especially Madame D. When he learns of her death he and Zero go to pay their final respects. Much to his surprise he discovered that a recent change to her will left a valuable painting to him a painting the rest of the family are determined he shall not have. He takes the painting setting in motion a train of events which will see him and Zero pursued across the country, his jailing and subsequent escape as well as romance for Zero before we finally learn how Zero came to be the owner.When I started watching this film I knew little about it apart from the fact that it had won a fair number of awards and was popular with the critics. In the opening scenes I thought it might be trying a little bit too hard to be quirky but once we were back in the past seeing M. Gustave and young Zero's story I was quickly hooked. The story contains wit, excitement and a degree of tragedy. The whole cast, which includes plenty of well-known actors in cameo roles, does a fine job; most notably Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori who play our protagonists M. Gustave and Zero respectively. The action doesn't look realistic but this is clearly deliberate and affective in a way that means we can believe things like the rather unlikely jailbreak. If there is one complaint to be had it is about the strong language; it isn't too excessive but may put off some viewers who would otherwise have enjoyed the film. That is a small quibble though; overall I found this quirky film most enjoyable.",8,3,5,26 February 2015
The Transporter," Good mindless fun!
","Action star Jason Statham is Frank, the eponymous transporter who will deliver anything for a price. He has three simple rules; never change the plan, no names, and don't look in the package. On his latest job he breaks the third rule and discovers that he has a beautiful Chinese woman in the boot of his car. Knowing that he is delivering a person against their will doesn't cause him to abandon the job although he does let her have a drink. When he delivers her he is offered another simpler job; just delivering a case this time. Luckily for Frank he stops off to get some refreshments because as he returns to his car it explodes. Displeased about this he returns to the house he'd dropped the woman at and helps himself to one of the cars there; but not before beating up a load of goons. As he drives away he discovers that the Chinese woman, called Lai, had escaped in the commotion and hidden in the car. The man who wanted him dead wasn't in the house at the time and when he learns what has happened heads off to kill Frank... Frank is hard to kill though and he is soon helping Lai who explains that the man is involved in human trafficking. Soon she has been captured by the man and we learn that her father is also involved with the trafficking. Frank spends the remainder of the film fighting hoards of goons, parachuting onto the back of a moving lorry and dodging bullets while trying to rescue Lai and the trafficked people who are trapped in a container.If you go into this film expecting a gritty exposé on the evils of trafficking you will be disappointed however if you sit back, but your brain in neutral and suspend your disbelief you should have a great time. Jason Statham is great in the role of Frank, playing it dead straight he made the unbelievable scenes believable; even when he drove a car off a bridge and landed on a car transporter and when he fought a room full of goons while covered in oil. Qi Shu was good as Lai although she didn't have too much to do. I liked François Berléand's portrayal of Inspector Tarconi; a policeman who clearly knew that Frank was up to something but never really made an attempt to catch him and even let him go when Frank pointed out that he could get to the bad guys so much faster than the police could. The many fights are all perfectly choreographed and the car chases and spectacular.",8,1,1,18 September 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," An entertaining fourth instalment
","This; the fourth in the Mission Impossible franchise opens with protagonist Ethan Hunt in a Russian prison; he isn't there long though as former tech-guy Benji, now a field agent, helps him escape. Once out he joins Benji and new character Jane Carter and learns their new mission they must break into the Kremlin to steal the launch codes to Russian nuclear missiles before terrorist Kurt Hendricks can get them and use them. Unfortunately they are too late and the team are blamed for an explosion caused by Hendricks. After such an incident the president activates the 'Ghost Protocol'; not just the team but the whole of IMF are disavowed. They are helped out of Moscow by the IMF Secretary and follow Hendricks first to Dubai then to Bombay in an attempt to stop him launching the missiles that could start the Third World War!Each of the films in the series is quite different and this is probably the most comic despite the serious subject matter. That isn't to say there isn't enough action; there is plenty of over-the-top spectacular action including seeing Tom Cruise climbing up the outside of the Burj Khalifa, many fights, chases and shootouts. It is a pity that regular team member Ving Rhames only appeared in a brief cameo but Simon Pegg unsurprisingly provided so good laughs and Paula Patten and Jeremy Renner handled the action well. The story wasn't deep but it served to provide an excuse to visit some spectacular locations and show us some exciting set pieces. Overall this is a fun film with plenty of excitement; there is also little to offend so it can be enjoyed by all but younger children.",8,1,2,14 May 2014
It Follows," A chiller with a sexual twist
","Jay Height is an attractive nineteen year old college student whose life is changed after a casual sexual encounter. Shortly after they have sex the boy chloroforms her. She wakes to find herself tied up and he explains the situation to her. He tells her that a being, who can appears as anybody known or unknown, will start to follow her. This person walks slowly but will won't stop coming for her; if it catches her it will kill her. The only way for her to escape is to pass it on to another person by having sex... however if that person is killed it will start going after her again. Only people being followed or who have been followed cab see it. Jay manages to get her friends to believe her and they try to help her escape but wherever they go it will surely find her.This is a superior chiller. There are surprisingly few shocking moments, most notably the sight of a previous victim in an early scene. Rather than relying on a large body count and gory deaths we get a near constant feeling that something is about to happen. The way the threat is passed from one potential victim to the next; like a game of sexual tag is interesting thanks to the moral dilemmas it raises. The fact that the entity that follows is always referred to as 'It' reinforces the tag similarities even if here the person tagged is followed by It rather than being It. The cast does a fine job; most notably Maika Monroe who is great as Jay. Director David Robert Mitchell does an impressive job keeping the tension high without resorting to jump scares and violent scenes; this is helped by Rich Vreeland's atmospheric score. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans looking for something different.",8,1,2,7 August 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The creation of a new Ape myth
","Having seen the original 'Planet of the Apes' films I was curious to see how the new version would compare. Some differences are immediately apparent, most obviously the apes are no longer people in costumes; instead they are CGI and do look like real apes. Rather than starting with a man arriving on a planet full of talking apes then gradually explaining how that situation arose it starts in a lab using Chimpanzees for medical research and accidentally increasing their intelligence. When one gets violent the project is cancelled and the apes destroyed apart from a baby which is taken home by the scientist who led the project. This baby, now named Caesar, shows signs of much greater than expected intelligence as he ages but ends up in an 'ape sanctuary' after biting a neighbour. Here Caesar is mistreated and eventually revolts; he escapes but rather than hiding returns with the new improved drug the make the other apes intelligent; it doesn't take long before he is leading them in a revolt; first in the sanctuary then through the streets of San Francisco and over the Golden Gate Bridge.This was an interesting retelling of the classic story; creating a new myth about the origins of the 'smart apes'. I think this was an improvement over the way they were created in the original series. The CGI was very good; while one could tell they weren't real apes they were very close to it. While the CGI apes were the stars of the show the human cast did a decent job. Given the subject I was surprised that it was not more violent, this does at least mean it won't frighten older children; I watched it with my nephews, aged ten and thirteen and they both loved it! Having seen this I look forward to the inevitable sequels that will no doubt expend the new Ape mythology.",8,3,6,29 December 2011
Cars," Not Pixar's best but still plenty of fun
","In alternate reality the world is much like ours but there are no people; instead there are sentient vehicles! This film tells the story of Lightning McQueen; an arrogant race car who is challenging to be the first car to will the prestigious Piston Cup in his rookie year. He throws away a clear victory after ignoring the advice of his pit crew and is involved in a three way tie with the current champ and his long-time rival. To decide the winner there will be a three car race in California in a week's time. Wanting to get there first Lightning pushes his support truck to drive through the night despite his exhaustion. A run in with some street racers leaves Lightning on the road with no idea where he is. He leaves the interstate, gets more lost and as he speeds along the old Route 66 is chased by the police; this leads to a crash and his arrest in the town of Radiator Springs. Here is told he must help fix the road before he can leave. As one might expect he is not happy with this but gradually befriends the locals and learns a lot about how to treat others; he also falls for a Porsche and experiences the joys of just driving. Naturally these lessons will help him in the big race but will he win?Having watched and enjoyed most Pixar films I put of watching any of the 'Cars' films as I'd heard they were a little disappointing; having watched the first I can say it turned out better than expected. It opens well enough with some exciting race scenes. There are some problems with such an arrogant protagonist even if most viewers will appreciate that he has to be flawed if we are to get the character development and life-lessons later on. The film picks up once Lightning gets to Radiator Springs and we meet a variety of interesting characters. The most notable of these are Matey, a rusty old breakdown truck; Sally, the love-interest Porsche and Doc Hudson; an old race car who keeps quiet about his past. There are also fun side characters such as the Italian Fiat 500 who is obsessed with Ferraris and a hippy VW camper. The story contains some fun action scenes and some good laughs before the final race which enables Lightning to show everybody what he learnt; both about racing and about both accepting help and helping others himself. Overall I'd say that this certainly isn't among Pixar's best films it is still a lot fun; Pixar has still not disappointed me.",8,0,0,26 November 2017
The Little Mermaid," An animated delight
","This Disney classic, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, tells the story of Ariel. She is a sixteen year old mermaid princess who has always been fascinated with humans and the surface world despite rules forbidding their interaction. One day she swims to a ship and observes the crew. Here she first sees Prince Eric and immediately falls in love. The ship is then wrecked but she saves him; he doesn't see her but when he wakes on a beach he remembers her beautiful voice as she sang to him. Triton, Ariel's father, forbids her from ever going to the surface again but when Ursula, the devious Sea Witch, offers her an opportunity to see Eric again she accepts. There are catches of course; firstly if she doesn't make him fall in love and kiss her within three days she will belong to Ursula and secondly it will cost her voice so she can neither speak nor sing. She is reunited with Eric but getting to love her will be hard; especially as Ursula will use many tricks to prevent it. Along the way she is joined by her friends Flounder, Sebastian the crab and a gull named Scuttle.I found this film to be a real delight; the story may be fairly simple but it provides thrills, laughs, enjoyable songs, a few scary moments and of course romance... all in a film that is suitable for viewers of all ages. The animation is of a high quality with character designs that are quintessential Disney... a pretty princess, a handsome prince, animal sidekicks and a villainess nobody will mistake for one of the good guys! The characters are nicely expressive; even when Ariel can' speak a work it is clear what she is thinking. The story plays out nicely with no scene outstaying its welcome; all leading to an impressive finale. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of animated movies whatever your age... it is a delight.",9,1,1,13 May 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A great introduction to Chinese cinema
","This was my introduction to Chinese martial arts films so when I first saw it I had no idea what to expect, I just knew it had raked in quite a few awards. I really enjoyed it from the start although I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gravity defying fight scenes although they were easy accept once I'd realised such action was just part of the genre.The film opens with Li Mu Bai, a martial arts master played by Chow Yun Fat, giving his sword to Yu Shu Lien the wife of his late brother played by Michelle Yeoh, so that she can take it to Peking and give it to his old friend Sir Te as he wants to retire from fighting. Soon after Governor Yu and his family come to Peking and the sword is stolen by a mysterious stranger who appears to be part of the Governor's retinue. Yu Shu Lien befriends the governor's daughter Jen, played by Zhang Ziyi, who is due to be married but would rather become a fighter like Yu Shu Lien. As the story progresses Li Mu Bai returns and believes his nemesis Jade Fox is involved in the theft of the sword and sets out to find her. Tied in with the action plot there is also a romance involving Jen and a desert bandit called Lo, also known as Dark Cloud.The acting was very good through out, especially Zhang Ziyi's portrayal of Jen who I considered to be the main character despite her not getting top billing, I suppose that is down to her being a less established actress at the time it was made. The cinematography was excellent showing a variety of stunning Chinese scenery varying from a bare desert to a beautiful bamboo forest. As one would expect the fighting scenes are very well choreographed less expected were the moments of humour which I felt added to the film. I would certainly recommend this film; I enjoyed it enough to seek out other examples of the genre.",9,0,0,19 February 2009
Gone Girl," A gripping mystery with plenty of twists
",Before watching this I knew that there was a fairly major twist but had thankfully managed to avoid details and as it is so major I shall endeavour not to spoil it here even though that means not saying much about the second half of the film.On the day of Nick Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary he is talking to his twin sister about his wife Amy and not in a good way. When he gets home there is no sign of Amy and there are signs of a struggle in the house. He calls the police and they search the house; among the things they find is an envelope labelled 'Clue One'. Nick explains that she created a treasure hunt for him on their anniversary; the first clue leads to a second then a third then Nick tells the police that he can't solve the third; he clearly has something to hide. It isn't long before the police suspect he may have murdered Amy and the more we learn about him both through seeing his actions and a series of flashbacks based on Amy's yet to be discovered diary it looks increasingly possible that he did kill her. Then half way through the film there is a twist and most assumptions are turned on their head. From then on we learn more and more about what really happened and things look worse for Nick as both the police and the wider public become more convinced of his guilt.I'm glad that I managed to avoid spoilers as the story kept me gripped to the very end as I wondered how much of what had been revealed to the viewer would become known the police within the film. There is a dark tone throughout the film so I wasn't convinced that it would all work out in the end as one usually is in mysteries. Director David Fincher does a fine job as he keeps us guessing as to what really happened. The cast did a great job; Ben Affleck impresses as Nick; a man who at first appears innocent but clearly has secrets and Rosamund Pike excels as Amy. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. Most of the time the sense of threat is fairly existential; whether evidence will lead to Nick being charged with murder there are some moments where the threat is very immediate and in one occasion things get shockingly violent and very bloody. There are also scenes of a sexual nature and considerable amounts of swearing that some viewers will be put off by. Overall I recommend this to anybody looking for a gripping story with some surprising twists.,10,1,3,14 November 2016
Django Unchained," A violent western set in the Antebellum South
","As this Tarantino western opens Dr King Schultz approaches two man transporting slaves through Texas; he is a bounty hunter and one of the slaves can identify the men he his hunting. That slave is Django. Schultz tells Django that when the men are dead he will be a free man. Once he is freed they start working together collecting bounties before heading to Mississippi where Django's wife is a slave on an infamously brutal plantation. They intend to buy her freedom but must keep their intentions from slave owner Calvin Candie or he is likely to refuse just because he can. Once at the Candyland plantation house slave Stephen proves to be their greatest danger.Anybody who has seen any of Quentin Tarantino's previous films will be unsurprised that his is quite violent at times. The story is well told with likable protagonists and some very unpleasant antagonists. The setting, earlier and further east than most westerns, doesn't flinch from depicting the horrors of slavery and attitudes that mean people expect the highest of manners but think is is perfectly acceptable to order a runaway slave be torn apart by dogs. The cast does a fine job; Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz work together brilliantly as Django and Schultz and Leonardo DiCaprio is great as the racist Candie. Samuel L Jackson also impresses as Stephen; he is possibly the film's most disturbing character, a slave who despises and betrays other black people. Given the subject matter one might not expect much to laugh at but there are a few really funny moments; the best being when a hooded lynch mob start complaining that they can't see properly with their hoods onÂ… it was almost like something one might have expected in 'Blazing Saddles'. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of other Tarantino's films or fans of the genre who aren't put off by the level of violence.",9,0,2,29 November 2017
Get Out," Horror with a racial twist
","As this film opens a young black man, lost in a suburb is attacked and abducted. We then switch to our protagonist Chris, another young black man, who is preparing to meet his white girlfriend, Rose's, parents for the first time. She assures him that they aren't racist but liberal to the point of cliché. Once at their large rural home Chris soon starts to feel uncomfortable; their black maid and gardener seem like characters from before the civil rights era and while outwardly friendly there is something a little off about the family. Rose's mother hypnotises him to stop him smoking but he is convinced that she did something more. A party thrown by the family only makes him more concerned but by the time he realises the real danger it may be too late.I found this to be a really effective horror movie even though it features little obvious threat till the very end. In many ways I was reminded of 'The Wicker Man'; a protagonist goes somewhere of his own free will, finds things somewhat creepy then finally learns a horrifying truth. There were also obvious 'Stepford Wives' vibes with the way the other black characters at the family home and their neighbours behaved. As the film progressed the tension was constantly raising and although it was obvious that something bad was planned for Chris I didn't guess just how bad until he was told what it was. Some levity was provided by Chris's friend Rod, who was convinced that rural white folk wanted black men as their sex slaves! Daniel Kaluuya does a really fine job as Chris; he is rarely off screen and is convincing throughout. The supporting cast; notably Allison Williams as Rose and Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, as her parents are also impressive. Writer director Jordon Peele did a brilliant job; it is hard to believe this was his directorial debut. While it is obvious that there is a racial subtext to the story it doesn't feel like the viewer is being lectured to. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans who don't demand frequent violence.",9,1,4,22 September 2019
Drive," A stylish and violent neo-noir thriller
","Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed stunt driver who earns a bit on the side as a getaway driver; he is efficient and almost unemotional. Having recently moved into a new apartment he bumps into his neighbour Irene and ends up helping her when she has car trouble. They grow close and he learns that her husband, and father of her child, is in prison. When he gets out he says he wants to go straight but he owes a lot of money to people so must do one last job. The driver offers to help and drives him and his associate Blanche to a pawn shop the robbery doesn't go as planned; Irene's husband ends up dead while the driver and Blanche flee with a million dollars of the mob's money. Those who organised the robbery want the money and they want everybody involved dead so the mob will never be able to trace the crime to them. The driver will have to get bloody if he is to save himself, Irene and her son.When I started watching this I didn't really know what to expect; I just knew it was about a getaway driver and had received good reviews. It crossed my mind that it might be a bit like 'The Transporter' series of films It is not. Things start well as we see the Driver avoid the police as he drives a couple of crooks away from their job before finding out about his day job. Once he befriends Irene a very chaste relationship develops. It isn't until her husband gets out of prison and has a run in with the people he owes money to do we get a hint of the violence to come. It isn't that there is a lot of violence; it is the intensity and suddenness of it that really shocks; a woman gets her head blown off with a shotgun, a man gets his head stamped to a bloody mess and another gets a fork in his eye! This isn't the exciting, highly choreographed violence of most action movies; it is nasty and brutal and deliberately so.Ryan Gosling gives a fine performance as the Driver; a character who at times seems like a hero and at others a psychopath. He is able supported by Carey Mulligan, who plays Irene; Christina Hendricks, who plays Blanche; Brian Cranston and Ron Perlman amongst others. Director Nicolas Winding Refn did a great job as he lulls us into a false sense of security with a gentle start then unleashes shocking violence and ever-increasing tension right till the end I was unsure whether or not the Driver would survive. Overall I found this will well worth watching even if the violence was quite shocking.",8,9,14,6 September 2015
Insidious," An effective chiller
","This chiller opens as Josh and Renai Lambert move into their new house with young sons Dalton and Foster, and Cali, their baby daughter. Shortly afterwards Dalton falls in the attic; he doesn't appear badly hurt but the next day he doesn't wake up. He appears to be in a coma but the doctors can't identify the reason. His condition doesn't change and three months later he returns home to be looked after there. Soon afterwards Renai starts hearing noises and then seeing things. Convinced the house is haunted they move to a new house; the occurrences don't stop; in fact they get worse leading to the Lamberts calling in to professionals.When I watched this I expected it to be really scary as it had been recommended by a friend who is into horror films... I didn't find it quite as scary as I hoped but it had effective moments and a good creepy atmosphere. The setup is impressive as it nicely suggests that we are in for a haunted house film before changing tack and giving us the real reason. While this definitely isn't a comedy-horror there are a few good laughs that lighten the tone... just before it darkens again. The cast is solid; Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne impress as the Lamberts and Lin Shaye is equally impressive as expert as Elise Rainier. Overall I'd say if you want gore this will disappoint but if you prefer creepy/menacing horror like 'Poltergeist' or the more recent 'The Babadook' then I'd definitely recommend this.",7,1,1,17 December 2018
The Theory of Everything," Moving biopic about Professor Stephen Hawking
","This biopic tells the story of Professor Stephen Hawking from the time when he starts his doctorate at Cambridge till the publication of his book 'A Brief History of Time'. We see him fall in love with Jane Wilde and start to develop some interesting theories before being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He is told that he will probably live another two years at most but rather than giving up he throws himself into his research into time and the nature of black holes. The two years soon pass but he shows no signs of dying; in fact he is working as hard as ever on his research and starts a family with Jane, who is now his wife. Things get harder still when he has a tracheotomy and loses his ability to speak. Even this doesn't dissuade him from his research, it does however start to put a strain on his relationship with Jane as he becomes close to his nurse Elaine and Jane gets closer to Jonathan, a man she met at church.If anybody is worried that this film will be bogged down with complicated science needn't be concerned as it is far more about Stephen Hawking's relationship with his wife Jane and how they deal with his condition. Eddie Redmayne is outstanding in the role of Stephen Hawking as he depicts him going from an apparently healthy young man to a man confined to a wheelchair who can no longer speak; it isn't just a case of sitting in the chair he captures the mannerisms and posture of the real Professor Hawking it is no surprise that he picked up an Oscar for his work. Given his outstanding performance it would be easy to overlook Felicity Jones' performance as Jane; she may be playing an 'ordinary' person but her performance is far from ordinary. The rest of the cast are also impressive. Overall I found this to be a moving story that was definitely worth watching.",9,0,0,25 February 2016
Bolt," A fun canine adventure
","Bolt was an ordinary dog until owner Penny's father gave him superpowers; after that he and Penny are up against the villainous Dr Calico and his henchmen... of course none of this is true; he is actually part of a popular television series although he doesn't realise that. One day, hoping to make the show more dramatic the creators make an episode with a cliff-hanger ending. Thinking Penny is really endanger Bolt sets off to help her. This doesn't go well; he ends up in a box and is shipped to New York. Once there he believes the Styrofoam in the box was the reason his 'powers' no longer work. He meets Mittens, an alley cat he believes is one of Calico's minions, and together they set off across America so that he can get back to Hollywood and save Penny. Along the way they meet Rhino the hamster, a fan of Bolt who believes Bolt is a real superhero. As the three continue their journey they encounter various obstacles before the exciting finale.When I sat down to watch this I didn't know about the story; all I really knew was that it was a CGI animation from Disney that featured a dog. This meant as I watched the opening I thought Bolt really was going to be a super-dog. Some might have been disappointed when it emerged that it was just a show within the film but I thought that was rather fun and worked perfectly to set up the rest of the film where Bolt learns that he isn't quite as super as he thought. Once in New York the story is almost entirely about Bolt and his new companions Mittens and Rhino. These characters are a lot of fun; especially Mittens, I loved how she was introduced when we see her running a protection racket against the local pigeons. The story isn't exactly deep but it produces some really good set pieces and some emotional moments. There are some mildly scary parts but nothing that should upset children; the sense of danger doesn't go on to long. As one might expect from Disney the animation looks really good and the voice cast, most notably John Travolta, Miley Cyrus and Susie Essman as Bolt, Penny and Mittens, do a really fine job; combined they make really good characters. Overall this might not be Disney's must memorable CGI animations but it is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed by animation fans of almost any age.",8,0,1,23 March 2018
Frozen," A delightful new classic from Disney
","As this Disney animated film opens it is winter in the small kingdom of Arendelle; Princess Anna wakes Elsa, her older sister, so that they can make snowmen and enjoy the snow. They don't have to go outside though as Elsa has a magical power; she can conjure snow and ice from thin air or freeze any object. As they play Elsa accidentally injures her sister, Anna is healed but has all memories of what happened and of Elsa's 'gift' erased. Elsa is cautioned that as he grows her power will become more powerful and more dangerous. Scared of hurting anybody she shuts herself away. Sometime later her parents are lost in a shipwreck and three years after that she comes of age and is due to be crowned Queen. People come from all around to attend the coronation; including the handsome Prince Hans who Anna falls in love with. After the ceremony Anna asks Elsa to give her blessing for her to marry Hans Elsa refuses and as the sisters argue Elsa's power is exposed to everybody. Branded a monster Elsa flees the country; heading to the North Mountain where she creates a castle of ice. The country is thrown into winter and Anna sets out to find her sister leaving Hans to rule. On the way north Anna teams up with Kristoff, an ice supplier, and his reindeer Sven. Their journey won't be easy and the dangers won't be over when they find Elsa.Before watching 'Frozen' I wasn't sure what to expect; I knew it was bound to look great and had some catchy songs; I don't imagine anybody hasn't heard 'Let it Go' umpteen times even if they haven't watched the film yet. I hadn't been watching long before I was hooked; the opening was fun but quickly turned darker than I expected as first Elsa appears to reject Anna, for reasons the viewer knows but Anna doesn't, then their parents die. Just as it looks as if things will brighten up when Elsa is made queen and Anna falls in love things get even darker as Elsa leaves to live an isolated life. It isn't depressing though; Anna and Kristoff's journey north is exciting and some extra lightness is added when they meet Olaf, a living snowman. Without going into too much detail we then get more peril, a potential tragedy and a shocking betrayal before the uplifting finale one expects from a Disney film. As expected the animation was pretty spectacular; the characters were really good; great good guys and some suitably dastardly villains. Overall I'd certainly recommend watching this; it is a delightful film for people of all ages.",10,3,9,25 December 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," Too Many New Characters
","I assume that people reading reviews for the third X-Men film will have seen the previous two, if not stop reading now as it is impossible to review this without giving away the ending to the second film.Those people who enjoyed the first two films will be pleased to know that most of the characters return, including one that we thought had died at the end of X-Men 2. Unfortunately as soon as Jean reappears it is clear that she isn't the woman she once was as she kills Cyclops who was the one mutant who didn't believe she was dead. If this isn't enough to worry about a company has developed a 'cure' for mutants that will instantly remove their powers. Not surprisingly Magneto decides this must be stopped even though it is claimed that it is purely voluntary. When he tries to liberate Mystique from custody he learns that it is not fully voluntary as her guards are armed with weapons that fire darts that contain the cure, unfortunately they used it on Mystique so one of the best characters makes an early exit from the film.For me the main weakness of this film was the introduction of a large number of new mutants, so many in fact that it wasn't really possible to care about them as much as it was in earlier films. That said I was pleased to see Kitty Pryde. now played by the excellent Ellen Page, getting a larger role than before. There was also an over use of special effects; the moving of the Golden Gate Bridge while looking impressive felt like it was being done because such an effect is now possible not because the story needed it. All that said I still enjoyed the film and think it is worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first two instalments even if only to find out how it ends. Talking of the end; don't switch off when the end credits start as there is a short extra scene after them.",7,0,2,17 November 2008
The Lives of Others," A tale of redemption in a totalitarian regime
","I was expecting this film to be a bleak critique of the East German regime, especially the dreaded Stasi, while that is there it is only part of the film, it is also an uplifting story about the redemption of one member of that organisation.Gerd Wiesler is an officer in the Stasi and he clearly believes that his work rooting out those who oppose the state is a just cause and that those he investigates deserve everything they get. A friend and senior officer instructs him to investigate a playwright who had previously been considered loyal to the state. Gerd does this by bugging the writer's apartment and maintaining round the clock surveillance. Initially the writer says nothing to incriminate himself even when in the presence of more radical friends. However when a friend commits suicide he realises something must be done and writes an article which is to be smuggled over the border and printed in a West German magazine. Normally he would have been caught long before he finished but Gerd does not report everything that he hears. The story is complicated by the fact that the writer's girlfriend, an actress, is also involved with a senior party member and is taking illegal medication, this of course is the real reason that Gert has been given the job.Those viewers expecting a spy film with chases, explosions and plenty of action will be disappointed, however people wishing to see a tense thriller that gives us a glimpse at how life can be in totalitarian regimes will be in for a treat and may end up shedding tears of both sadness and joy. The acting was very good, especially on the part of the late Ulrich Mühe who plays the conflicted Stasi officer.These comments were based on watching the film in German with English subtitles.",9,1,3,14 June 2009
Hellboy," A demonic superhero
","In late 1944 a group of Nazis, with the help of Rasputin, the 'Mad Monk' who didn't die as history told us, attempt to open a portal to a demonic realm hoping to unleash various demonic forces. They are stopped by a group of US soldiers guided by Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm. One demon comes through the portal; a young red demon with one outsized hand, horns and a tail. Cutting forward to the present day the demon, dubbed 'Hellboy' has grown up and is working for a US government agency that deals with paranormal threats. We are introduced to this agency as Agent John Myers arrives for his first day working there.It turns out that two of the Nazis survived and are apparently unaged; they resurrect Rasputin before summoning a hellhound known as Sammael. Hellboy manages to defeat the Sammael but there is a complication; every time it is killed two more soon appear! As well as dealing with Rasputin, the Nazis and the Sammaels Hellboy has another problem; he has feelings for a girl named Liz, who can start fires, but can't bring himself to tell her how he feels. To make matters worse she seems to be getting closer to Agent Meyers. Inevitably there will be final confrontation as Rasputin tries to force Hellboy to open the portal and begin the apocalypse.This is certainly different to most superhero moves; not only is Hellboy a demon but apart from being very strong and impervious to fire he doesn't have the usual wide range of superpowers. He is also officially denied and has no human alter ego he is always Hellboy. Director Guillermo del Toro does a great job bringing the story to the screen; not that I was too surprised as he seems to understand how to do monsters and other fantastical creatures. Ron Perlman is great in the role; he gives us a delightfully grumpy yet witty hero. The villains are suitable evil; Nazis are good go-tos when you want a nasty villain and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is particularly menacing thanks to his mask and the fact that he appears to be less than human. If that weren't enough we have Rasputin; a menace from Tsarist Russia and the Sammaels which are impressive CGI creations. As well as Hellboy there are other impressive 'good guys'; Selma Blair is good, if a little underused, as Liz; Rupert Evans did a fine job as Agent Meyers and John Hurt brings a touch of class as the older Prof Broom. Doug Jones was also rather fun as Abe Sapien, an aquatic supernatural creature with some interesting powers. There is a good amount of varied action which features impressive special effects. Overall I enjoyed this more than I expected and would certainly recommend it to fans of the superhero genre especially if you want something a little different.",8,2,2,6 July 2017
Room," A claustrophobic drama
","Five year old Jack lives with his mother, Joy, in Room; as far as he is aware there is no outside; Room is all there is. The fact is Joy was abducted seven years previously, when she was seventeen and has been locked in a shed by a captor she has dubbed 'Old Nick' who is of course Jack's father. One day Joy decides it is time to tell Jack the truth about the world and plot their escape. She comes up with a plan and manages to get Jack out and not long afterwards she is free too this isn't the end of their story though; it is merely the first day of the rest of their lives. Jack must come to terms with the vastness of the world and all the new things he sees and Joy must deal with changes that happened while she was in Room; most notably the fact that her parents split soon after her abduction and her father can't bring himself to even look at Jack.This was a really gripping film that turned out to be quite different to what I'd expected. I had assumed the whole film would be similar to the first half with perhaps a few more escape attempts followed by a happy ending where they get free and we see 'Old Nick' brought to justice. In fact they are free around the half way point and while we are told that Nick has been arrested we don't see him again. Instead the second half of the film is all about coming to terms with what happened; or in the case of Joy's father being unable to do so. The room they are held in gives a feel of claustrophobia to such an extent that the world outside suddenly feels huge to the viewer as well as the characters. Brie Larson gave a fantastic performance as Joy; it isn't surprising that she got an Oscar for it. Likewise young Jacob Tremblay was great as Jack; he really made the viewer believe that his character hadn't seen anything of the outside world before. The escape scenes were particularly tense as for some time we had no idea what was happening to Joy; we just knew that 'Old Nick' knew she had helped Jack escape and she was shill his captive. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different with an emotional intensity.",9,1,4,12 March 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Exciting fantasy sequel
","This film starts off where 'The Fellowship of the Ring' leaves off; Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here.",10,4,8,16 July 2009
The Incredibles," Lives up to its name
","On the face of it this may look like it is very much a film for children that will have little appeal to adults unless they are watching it with their children; this however would be a mistake as it has a good story that adults can enjoy too. Some aspects are clearly aimed at the adult viewer such as obvious references to James Bond, these are done in a way that people who don't see the reference won't get the impression that they are missing something.The film opens fifteen years ago in a world where superheroes routinely fight crime and protect the population... until the population is fed up with paying to repair all the damage they do while fighting crime. Banned from using their powers they are forced to hie their super powers and live regular lives. Back in the present Mr Incredible is working in an insurance office by day and sneaking off with his old friend Frozone to fight crime by night... while his wife Helen, formally Elastigirl believes he is just bowling. After one such outing he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who offers him a chance to use his powers again in service of the government. He thinks he can hide this from his wife but she spots that his costume has been repaired and contacts the designer Edna 'E' Mode who tells her that not only did she repair it but also made him another. Helen goes to see her and while there learns that her husband has been captured; she must go to his rescue, accompanied by their two children who stowed away on her plane... luckily they have powers that will help rescue their father from Syndrome, his former number one fan who has gone somewhat insane and makes up for his own lack of powers with an array of gadgets.Pixar did a great job making this film, making the characters feel believable even though they are animated superheroes. The story was fairly gripping and there was a sense of danger... we were shown that Syndrome had already killed several other 'Supers'. Some parents might not be too keen on the fact that some people die, including a few in an amusing scene about the dangers of wearing a cape, none of these deaths are likely to scare children though. I would certainly recommend this film to anybody wanting to see a well made film with a good story and nothing to offend.",10,2,3,17 January 2010
The Mist," A bleak tale of monsters in the mist
","As this film opens a storm strikes a small Maine town damaging the lakeside property of protagonist David Drayton; an unusual mist is visible over the lake but they don't give it much though. David then drives into town with his son and his neighbour to pick up some supplies. On the way they see several emergency vehicles as well as military vehicles from the local base; again they don't give the matter too much thought. Once there they get their supplies but before they can leave the supermarket a man runs in shouting about something dangerous in the mist. Within minutes the whole area is engulfed in a thick fog and the store shakes as if there was an earthquake. One person goes out but all the people inside hear are screams. David and some others go to work on the generator and when they open the back door a tentacle reaches in and grabs one of them. When the others in the store are told what happened some don't believe it and one woman, Mrs. Carmody, decides what is happening is clearly what was foretold in the Book of Revelation. After some arguing the former group leave and disappear into the mist. Soon more creatures appear; this time giant insects drawn to the lights. Some get in and by the time they have been driven back another person is dead and Mrs. Carmody is more convinced than ever that it is all the work of a vengeful god. People start to turn on each other and it isn't long before Mrs. Carmody and her followers decide that somebody must be sacrificed of course one is never enough. Eventually David and a few others decide to make a break for it but will they be able to get to his car and even if they can is there anywhere left to go to?This film, based on a story by Stephen King, is one of the bleakest I've seen for some time; not because of the creatures that keep picking people off but because of the way it shows people turning on each other as soon as thing get bad even before they have the slightest inkling of just how bad they will get. The people don't come together; instead they form factions and turn on each other. The fact that most of the film takes place within the crowded shop adds a sense of claustrophobia. The creatures are suitably scary; giant insects and similar creatures are somehow more frightening than strange monsters. There is a slight sense of mystery about where they came from but there are plenty of hints that mean it isn't a total surprise when we find out. The film concludes with an ending that viewers will love or hate; I can't imagine too many people being neutral on the matter as it is so incredibly downbeat. The cast does a solid job; Thomas Jane impresses as David and Laurie Holden does a fine job as the woman who helps look after his son. There are also good supporting turns from the likes of Toby Jones and Andre Braugher but it is Marcia Gay Harden who stands out as the religious zealot Mrs. Carmody; a character more disturbing than any of the creatures. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good horror movie and doesn't expect a happy ending.",9,2,5,2 October 2016
I Am Legend," A bleak but enjoyable post-apocalyptic horror
","As the film opens Dr Alice Krippin is being interviewed on television; she explains that she has developed a way of curing cancer using a modified version of the measles virus three years later New York is almost empty of humanity; the miracle cure has turned out to be anything but it has mutated killing most of humanity and the vast majority who haven't been killed have turned into mindless rabid killers, so-called Darkseekers the few who are immune are soon eaten! We see a lone man driving through the empty streets with his dog Sam. He is Col. Robert Neville, a military doctor, and he is trying to survive while trying to find a cure. With no other people the loneliness is clearly getting to him but he hasn't entirely given up on finding other people; each day he broadcasts a message and waits forlornly for somebody to come.This got off to a fun start; I didn't expect Emma Thompson to be the one responsible for the end of human civilisation but as soon as he heard that her character was called Dr Krippin, clearly named after the infamous Dr Crippen, we knew what she was doing would end badly! The way we are introduced to protagonist Robert Neville is effective; the empty streets of New York look great. I liked how we only slowly learn about the Darkseekers; for quite some time we just knew that Neville was alone he carries a rifle but the reason isn't obvious; we do know there are wild animals roaming the streets but presumably they escaped from the zoo. Once we do see the Darkseekers they are pretty scary but not excessively so. Will Smith does a good job; effectively carrying the film alone for most of its run time. He makes us believe in his character even when he is talking to manikins that he has presumably placed in a video store. Things are bleaker than expected with flashbacks gradually revealing his attempts to get his family out of the city only to reveal that they didn't make it. As the story reaches its conclusion tensions rise dramatically and lead to a surprising ending. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of Will Smith or of the zombie genre (even though the Darkseekers aren't technically zombies) I can't say how it compared to other film versions of the story as I've not seen them.",8,0,1,15 December 2015
A Quiet Place," A great concept
","This film opens three months after a world changing event; creatures that will attack anything making an even moderate sound have wiped out most of humanity. We aren't told where they came from or how many other survivors there may be as the story is focused on one family. A husband and wife, their two sons and their daughter, who is deaf. There number is reduced by one in an early scene that demonstrates the dangers of the creatures. A year later they are living in an isolated house, the mother is expecting another child. Through the course of the film the family struggle to survive knowing one mistake could doom them all.I really enjoyed this film; the nature of the threat was original and genuinely scary... one was conscious of every sound one made while watching. I liked the fact that the film didn't explicitly state how the creatures had arrived or what attempts at defeating them had been made... all we need to know is that they are here, they have wiped out civilisation and all services and that this one family is struggling to survive. Like many horror films we don't get a good look at the creatures till quite a way into the film; when we do they are suitably scary. The cast does a fine job; John Krasinski, who also directed as the father; Emily Blunt as the mother; Millicent Simmonds, as the daughter; and Noah Jupe, as the elder son. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to people wanting a good scare and an original story without excess gore or other material that might offend.",8,2,2,15 March 2020
The Bourne Legacy," Decent spin off from a modern classic
",Set at the same time as 'The Bourne Ultimatum' this film follows another agent; Aaron Cross as he struggles to survive when his erstwhile employers try to eliminate everybody involved in the programme. Unlike Bourne he has been treated to improve both his strength and his intelligence; this means that he must keep taking medication if he is to remain the person he has become. To this end he seeks out Dr. Marta Shearing; the doctor who oversaw his examinations. It is lucky for her that he does need her help as the agency was intending to eliminate her too. She doesn't have the medication but knows where it is made: Manila. If they are to survive they will have to get to the Philippines and get the medication before the agency can catch up with them; it won't be easy though.This film is pretty good; there is plenty of solid action from start to finish and a decent story the problem is that while it may have 'Bourne' in the title it doesn't feature the hero of the original trilogy and Aaron Cross isn't as good a protagonist as Bourne was. It also suffers from the fact that you really need to have seen the Bourne films to understand what is going on no time is wasted explaining what things like 'Treadstone' and 'Black Brier' mean. All that said Jeremy Renner does a good enough job as Cross and Rachel Weisz is good as Dr. Shearing. It is clear that the makers are hoping to make more instalments in the franchise as the story doesn't reach a proper conclusion so much so that it might as well have had the words 'too be continued' appearing at the end! I hope they do make at least one more as I for one would like to know how the story ends!,8,4,7,27 February 2013
22 Jump Street," Just like the last one
","This sequel makes no bones about the fact that it is trying to repeat the successful formula of '21 Jump Street' the Jump Street operation has moved to a new superior premises opposite the old one and Schmidt and Jenko are once again undercover in an educational establishment this time they are trying to find who is dealing a new designer drug in a college. Jenko quickly becomes friends with members of the football team, especially quarterback 'Zook'; this leads to our dynamic duo being invited to join a frat house Jenko fits right in but Schmidt realises it's not for him so goes and hangs out with the art student. While the athletic Jenko enjoys a night with the boys Schmidt spends the night in the bed of Maya, a beautiful arts student. Before the case is solved suspects emerge and an innocent man is arrested before Schmidt and Jenko finally face down the real culprits during Spring Break festivities.If you watched '21 Jump Street' and weren't amused then don't bother watching this; however if you enjoyed it then you should enjoy this just as much. The plot is basically the same as the first but the college setting allows for some different gags. Many of the gags are very meta with talk of everything being just the same as before and the sight of an empty lot with a '23 Jump Street' hoarding just waiting for their next HQ. While much of what happens isn't surprising a few unexpected things did happen the best being when we learn who the Maya's father is; possibly the funniest moments in the film resulted from this. The identity of the dealer is also a little bit of a surprise. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a good chemistry as Schmidt and Jenko and Ice Cube is great as their boss. Of the non-recurring characters Amber Stevens West and Wyatt Russell impress as Maya and Zook. Overall I wouldn't say this is the greatest film but if you enjoyed the first and want more silly fun then this is well worth watching.",8,1,2,25 October 2017
Kick-Ass," Chloë Moretz steals the show!
","When I saw the trailers for this I thought it looked pretty cool but everybody knows trailers just show the best bits so I wasn't sure if the film would live up to them... it did and then some! I was laughing within the first minute, the laughs continued throughout the film although they were mainly in the first half. The laughs might have slowed down towards the end but the action was turned up to eleven and unlike a lot of action movies there was a feeling that the heroes were in real danger and could get hurt.Dave is just an ordinary high school kid who dreams of becoming a super hero. Unlike most he decides to make his dreams a reality and buys a super hero costume. He isn't deluded enough to think he has any powers and his first confrontation with a couple of bad guys leaves him in hospital with a knife would and multiple injuries from being run over. When he recovers he doesn't give up and his next confrontation goes somewhat better. This was caught on camera and 'Kick-Ass' becomes an internet sensation. It also gets him another job; the girl he loves but thinks he is gay asks him to deliver a message to a guy who has been hassling her. When he agrees he doesn't know the guy is a drug dealer. Just as it looks as if his superhero days are going to come to a grisly end the dealer and his gang are cut down by Hit-Girl, a purple-wigged eleven year old with a penchant for ultra-violence! It turns out that the dealer worked for crime lord Frank D'Amico and before getting killed took a picture of Kick-Ass; now D'Amico wants Kick-Ass dead! In order to lure him out D'Amico's son becomes 'Red Mist' and takes Kick-Ass to a warehouse to be dealt with, when he gets there it is on fire and everybody is dead so he must use Kick-Ass to find out who is really destroying his operation and then deal with them. The real threat is from Hit-Girl and her father Big Daddy.I can't remember when I had so much fun watching a film; Aaron Johnson is great as Kick-Ass as are Nicolas Cage and Mark Strong as Big Daddy and Frank D'Amico but the real star is young Chloë Moretz who plays Hit-Girl, she steals every scene she is in and manages to make the viewer believe that an eleven year old girl could take out a room full of gangsters with ease. The action scenes, especially those with Hit-Girl and Big Daddy among the most entertaining that I've seen as gangsters are dispatched with a variety of weapons. Just because this film features an eleven year old superhero does not mean it is suitable for children of that age; there is plenty of bloody violence including some where young Hit-Girl takes a severe beating, quite a bit of swearing and one admittedly tame sex scene. If those things don't put you off though I strongly recommend giving the film a go.",10,3,9,4 September 2010
Unknown," Nothing is what it seems in Dr Harris' life
","When Dr Martin Harris and his wife Elizabeth arrive in Berlin things get off to a bad start when his briefcase is left at the airport. They soon get much worse for the doctor; as he returns to collect it his taxi is involved in an accident which leaves him in a coma for four days and when he awakens he has no way of proving who he is another man has taken his place and his wife denies all knowledge of him. Understandably he starts to question his own sanity and sets about tracking his movements to see if he can discover the truth. His only help is Gina; his taxi driver at the time of the accident and Ernst Jürgen; a former member of the Stasi. As his investigation proceeds it appears that he has got caught up in a plot to assassinate a Saudi prince and there are people willing to kill to ensure that he doesn't expose their plans!This film may be more than a little bit silly but I enjoyed it none the less; in fact I enjoyed it much more than I'd thought I would. The action is genuinely exciting and there are plot twists coming think and fast so that we never fully know what is going on until the end. Liam Nielson puts in a good performance as Dr Jones and Diana Kruger is good as Gina although it is Bruno Ganz who really steals the show as Jürgen. The Berlin location is used well; adding to the feeling that Dr Harris is lost in just about every way possible. This might not be as exciting as the Bourne trilogy, despite what the blurb on the DVD box hints, but fans of films like those should rather enjoy this.",7,1,1,2 October 2013
Ghostbusters," Comedy that stands the test of time
","It is hard to believe that Ghost Busters is twenty five years old now, when I watched it for the first time in many years it still felt fresh and very funny, I wouldn't be surprised if it is still being enjoyed in another twenty five years time. I had expected the special effects to look dated after all this time but they hold up well.Our trio of misfit heroes are scientists studying paranormal activity at a university in New York till their department is closed down on the day they actually see a ghost. The decide to set up their own ghost busting business but initially they get no costumers. Eventually Dana, played by Sigourny Weaver, comes seeking their help to deal with a strange entity that has taken up residence in her fridge. Doctor Venkman, Bill Murray, goes to the apartment with her to investigate but when he gets there he sees no sign of anything strange.Their first successful case is when they trap a green ghost that has been terrorising a hotel, this success leads to fame and plenty more work. Venkman meets Dana again and persuades her to go on a date with him, unfortunately when he goes to collect her he finds that she is possessed and is claiming to be the Gate Keeper, at the same time her neighbour is running around looking for her while calling himself the Key Master. When they get together a portal is opened and a strange woman appears who summons Gozer, a demon who takes on a rather unlikely form and terrorises New York.This film is a lot of fun and while it doesn't take itself seriously it doesn't descend into farce either. The acting is good throughout and it has possibly the most memorable theme song of any film. The film really stands the test of time, if you haven't seen it yet give yourself a treat, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",9,0,0,6 April 2009
Gran Torino," Eastwood at his gruff best
","When we first see protagonist Walt Kowalski he is at his wife's funeral looking disapprovingly at his family. They clearly have little in common with the old man and have little room in their lives for him. Back home Walt is alone with his dog feeling like a foreigner in his own neighbourhood; all the other European Americans have left and the Hmong who have moved in seem totally alien to him. Thao, the boy who lives next door is being pressured by his cousin to join his gang and as part of his initiation they want him to steal Walt's prized possession; his 1972 Ford Gran Torino. He tries but Walt chases him off. Later they try to force Thao to go with them; Walt might not like his Hmong neighbours but he won't sit by and watch especially when the confrontation spill onto his lawn. His actions make him a hero to the local community and when Thao comes round to make reparations for his actions the pair gradually bond. Walt also becomes friends with Thao's sister, Sue. He helps Thao find work but the problems with the gang are only going to get worse and, after they brutally assault Sue, Walt realises he must confront them again.There is a scene in 'Dirty Harry' where his new partner is told how he hates everybody equally regardless of their race it seems Walt Kowalski is the same character forty years on. He certainly appears bitter and is offensive to just about everybody: Blacks, Asians, Italians and Irish he uses non- PC language to them all. Over the course of the film it becomes clear that it is mostly just his gruff manner; he is just as insulting to them and expects them to give as good as they get. Clint Eastwood is reliable as a director and an actor and in this film he does a fine job in both roles; the gruff Walt Kowalski is the sort of character it is hard to imagine anybody else playing. The supporting cast do a solid job; most notably Bee Vang, who plays Thao; Ahney Her, who plays Sue; and Christopher Carley who plays Father Janovich, a young priest who seeks to help Walt even if he doesn't want to be helped.Anybody expecting 'Dirty Harry' style action will be somewhat disappointed; there are a few bursts of violence but that isn't want the film is about. It a tale of redemption rather than revenge as Walt tries to save Thao from a life in his cousin's gang and in doing so atone for the act that haunts him; an act that earned him a Silver Star in Korea. As the end approached I feared a cliché finale but that was avoided in a way I never expected but in retrospect was the right end to the story. Overall I really enjoyed this and recommend it; it is a must see for any Clint Eastwood fan.",9,1,5,30 March 2015
Hero," Absolutely Stunning
","Having seen and enjoyed 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'House of the Flying Daggers' I wanted to find another film in the same genre so chose this as it shared the director with the latter film. I'm glad that I did watch this as it is a stunning film in many ways; not only is all of the action is beautifully choreographed but every scene looks stunning due to the way colours are coordinated.The film opens with a nameless assassin arriving at a royal palace to be thanked for killing three other assassins that were a threat to the king who has been conquering neighbouring kingdoms. We then see, in flashback, what may of happened between him and the other assassins. Without trying to give too much away we see the way he dealt with them in more than one way, each time what happens is different as his real motivation becomes clear.As mentioned before this film looks stunning and it has many memorable scenes, in particular where Moon (Ziyi Zhang) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) fight in an Autumnal forest dressed in red robes that match the leaves and a later scene where Nameless (Jet Li) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) fight over a lake.The acting and direction are solid throughout, if you like stylised martial arts films then I'd certainly recommend this one. If you haven't seen a film like this before don't be surprised when characters do impossible things like running through the air.",8,0,0,28 September 2008
Shrek the Third," A somewhat weaker third instalment
","The king is ill so Shrek and Fiona have to take over various royal duties with fairly disastrous results. Then the King dies and it looks as though Shrek is going to be the next king, something he does not want, luckily just before dying the king mentioned another heir; Arthur. Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set off to find Arthur and as their boat sets sail Fiona tells Shrek that she is pregnant. While they are away bringing a reluctant Arthur back to Far, Far Away Prince Charming is rallying various fairy tale villains to help him seize the kingdom. On the way home Shrek and his fellow travellers meet the wizard Merlin who helpfully transports them back home unfortunately swapping the bodies of Donkey and Puss! By now Charming has taken the Kingdom and Fiona and the various fairy tale 'princesses' are imprisoned but not for long.The first two films in the series were a lot of fun but sadly while this is still pretty decent it falls a fair way short of those two films. Trying to add elements of the Legend of King Arthur didn't work as well as they might have done as he was a fairly boring character. Other aspects of the story just don't make sense; most notably the idea that when the king dies Shrek would be the next ruler rather than Princess Fiona. There is also a lack of decent songs; apart from the rather amusing use of the theme from 'Live and Let Die' during the King's funeral none were memorable. There are some good points of course; having Donkey and Puss swap bodies was rather amusing, the king's extended death scene was hilarious (loved the fly) and it is great the see that the damsels were far from in distress as they broke out of the dungeon. Overall a decent enough film but a bit disappointing as a 'Shrek' film.",7,1,2,29 January 2017
The Hurt Locker," Gripping but not quite what I expected
","I suspect my hopes for this film were raised a little too much by the fact that it had recently won the Oscar against apparently strong competition; as I've yet to see the other films I can't comment on whether that win was deserved though. I did enjoy it although it wasn't quite the realistic depiction of life in a bomb disposal team I was expecting. It grabbed me from the first scene where the character I thought was being set up to be star of the film was killed in an explosion. It turned out the main character was going to be his replacement Sergeant William James; a bomb disposal expert who appears to enjoy the danger of his work a little too much. I could believe it when he was depicted as he seemed to relish his work trying to defuse various bombs but later on when he went out of his base alone and dressed in civvies looking for the person responsible for death of a local boy he had befriended seemed unbelievable as did the scene where he and the other two members of his team split up to search the alleyways near a bomb blast rather than waiting for regular infantry to arrive. Ignoring these faults the film does manage to tell an exciting story where there was a sense that anybody could die.Kathryn Bigelow did a great job directing and I'm not surprised that she won many awards for this film, she certainly proves that you don't need to be a man to make a very macho film. The cast of mostly unknown (to me) main characters did a fine job, especially Jeremy Renner who played Sgt. James. There are a few star names to be seen but don't expect them to be on screen for long most of them only appear in one scene. While I did enjoy the film I feel it would have been better if it had stuck to looking at Sgt. James addiction to the danger of his job rather than having him seek out situations which would almost certainly not be tolerated in real life.",8,4,11,21 April 2010
Moulin Rouge!," Camp musical fun from director Baz Luhrmann
","This musical opens in 1900 with Christian, a writer, working on a script based on his own experiences in Paris in the past year. We then move back a year and see his story. He is a young British writer who has moved to Paris to experience the Bohemian lifestyle; particularly that at the titular Moulin Rouge theatre. He starts writing for a group who are preparing a play. When he goes to the Moulin Rouge he is quickly attracted to courtesan Satine. She has been promised to a wealthy duke but following a misunderstanding mistakes Christian for the duke... by the time the truth is revealed she has fallen for Christian. When they are caught together they explain that they were merely rehearsing the play... a story of love that mirrors their situation. The group works to create the play described, all the time trying to keep the duke in the dark. There is another concern Christian is unaware of; Satine is unwell.If you want a feel of late nineteenth century Paris and the music performed there you are likely to be disappointed; the songs are reworkings of modern songs so expect to hear versions of songs from the likes of Queen, Madonna and Bowie. The musical numbers are impressive with huge numbers of extras as well as our central performers. The story may be cliché but it is effective and provides a good reason for the various musical numbers. The cast does a fine job; most obviously Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as Satine and Christian but also the likes of Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh as theatre owner Howard Zidler and The Duke, amongst others. This certainly won't be for everybody but if you like over-the-top camp it is a lot of fun.",9,0,0,10 May 2020
Ex Machina," Intelligent and gripping science fiction
","Caleb Smith, a computer programmer for the company Blue Book, thinks he is lucky when he wins a competition to spend a week with the company's reclusive CEO and founder Nathan Bateman. When he gets to Nathan's remote house he discovers that it is more than just a home; it is also a research facility, even though the only people living there are Nathan and his maid Kyoko. Nathan explains to Caleb that he wants him to administer the Turing Test to an Artificial Intelligence he has created that is to say prove that it is genuinely intelligent not just responding according to programming. The AI, named Ava, is in the form of a robot that has a feminine body and a human face. Caleb soon realises that the design was very deliberate and as Eva starts flirting with him he asks questions of Nathan. During their sessions together Ava engineers a power cut during which she warns Caleb that Nathan is not to be trusted; this leads him to do some investigating and he is a little disturbed with what he finds.This is a superior science fiction thriller; the single location gives a good claustrophobic feel and there is the constant concern that things may not be quite what they seem. The first twist, which I won't spoil, did seem a little obvious but that helped hide some of those that came later. The design of Ava was inventive; on the one hand she was obviously a highly advanced robot but her face and manner were distinctly human; the effects used impress as she looks quite real. The cast does a fine job; most notably Alicia Vikander who is great as Ava, but also Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac who impress as Caleb and Nathan. There are a few disturbing moments as well as some swearing and nudity but if that doesn't bother you I'd strongly recommend this intelligent sci-fi film.",9,0,2,28 August 2016
Back to the Future Part III," Back from the past
","After the much darker part two things lighten up for the concluding part of the story. Here there are plenty of jokes and some nice references to other films, in particular 'A Fist Full of Dollars'.When the film opens Marty is still trapped in 1955 but the letter he received that the end of part two tells him that Doc is alive and well living in 1885. The letter also informs Marty where the DeLorean has been hidden and how, with the help of 1955-Doc he can get it running and return to 1985. However before Marty can do that he learns that Doc died a few days after sending his letter to instead of returning to 1985 he dresses up a rather camp 1950s cowboy costume and goes to 1885. Here he meets his great-great-grandparents who he tells he is called Clint Eastwood. When he head goes into town he ends up making an enemy of the local gunman Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, an ancestor of Biff. This is also the person who had been destined to kill Doc. When Marty saves Doc at the party to celebrate the construction of the new town clock he is challenged to a duel. Now he has two days to either prepare to fight or to get the DeLorean up to 88MPH without any suitable fuel. There is also a subplot involving Doc and the town's new teacher Clara Clayton.While I think this is probably the weakest of the trilogy it is still a pretty good film and it wraps the story up nicely. As well as being fun science fiction it also works as a decent comedy western, especially if you are a fan of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. As in the first two parts Micael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were great in the leading roles.",7,1,1,11 July 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," A weaker sequel
","Set soon after the original 'Twilight' film this one opens with Bella worrying about the fact that she will age while her vampire boyfriend Edward will remain forever young... it soon appears that isn't something she should have been worrying about as he soon announces that he and the rest of Cullen clan are moving away and they will never see each other again. Believing she has been abandoned Bella sinks into a depression until one day she puts herself in a dangerous situation and sees a vision of Edward. In order to keep seeing him she decides to play with danger some more. To do this she acquires to broken motorbikes and sets about repairing them with her friend Jacob. Over time they grow closer until one day he too refuses to see her... it turns out he is a werewolf! To make matters even harder for her the vampire Victoria is after her again. After an event occurs that leads Edward to believe Bella has died he decides that in true 'Romeo and Juliet' fashion he must kill himself too; with Alice Cullen's help Bella must race across the world to show him that she is still alive.I'm not in the target demographic for this series of films but as I'd heard good reviews I thought I'd watch then when they were on television; the first one turned out better than I expected but unfortunately I don't think this one is as good. Once Edward has gone Bella spends the first half of the film just moping about and then gets closer to Jacob who isn't the most interesting of characters; even when we learn he is a werewolf. Talking of the werewolves the CGI did look impressive making them very wolf-like; the problem was the way they transformed from human to werewolf... it happened in a fraction of a second and thus was far less impressive that the slow transformations used in classic werewolf films like 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves'... although I suspect such transformations may have been considered to frightening for a film aimed at younger teens. Thankfully the film improves when we get back to the vampires; it helps the head vampire is played by an actor as good as Michael Sheen, it is a pity we didn't see more of his character, in an even smaller role Dakota Fanning impresses as Jane, a vampire who can inflict pain on people telepathically... hopefully we will see more of their characters in later instalments. Of the main cast Kristen Stewart does a good job as Bella, Robert Pattinson is okay as Edward and the third main actor, Taylor Lautner, seemed to be there so he could appeal to teenaged girls by spending most of his screen time looking fit without his shirt on. I'm sure this is a film for the fans (and there is nothing wrong with that), you certainly need to have watched 'Twilight' first to know what is going on as no time is wasted explaining who everybody is for newcomers.",5,3,3,14 May 2012
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better than the first film
","Having been disappointed with the first Fantastic Four I had fairly low expectations for this sequel, thankfully after a slightly weak start we got a better story where the stakes were higher and the action was more thrilling. While there is still a bit too much bickering between the four it seemed a bit toned down and was done in a more entertaining way. As a result of meeting the Silver Surfer every time Johnny Storm touches one of the other four he swaps powers with them, this leads to him almost preventing the others from rescuing people endangered when the London Eye is knocked off its axle when the surfer creates a mysterious hole in front of it which also drains the Thames. In their quest to stop the Surfer they are joined by Victor Von Doom who has returned after his defeat in the previous film, they don't trust him but with the world threatened they have little choice.This film was much stronger than the previous one; while we don't really learn enough about the Silver Surfer he made a better threat, largely because he wasn't motivated by greed or a quest for power. The best performance came from Andre Braugher who played General Hager, the man who brought in the Four and Doom to stop the Surfer. The returning cast members seemed to do a better job too although it probably helped that by now the characters are established so no time had to be wasted introducing them.",6,0,2,23 April 2010
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," An early epic from Hayao Miyazaki
","Anybody who has enjoyed Miyazaki's later works is sure to enjoy this too. Like all his films there is an excellent story with fun characters and despite being rather old the animation doesn't look dated although some of the music sounds its age.This film is set in the future, a thousand years after a war that destroyed the industrial world and turned much of it into a toxic jungle where the air is poisonous. Many of the remaining people seem to be at war however there is peace in the Valley of the Wind where a young princess named Nausicaä lives. When we are introduced to her she is exploring the toxic jungle collecting plant samples and looking for shells of giant insects that can be used by the villages. The peace of her village is shattered when a plane crashes, on board is a 'giant warrior', a weapon from the original war a thousand years ago, soon the village is over run by soldiers wanting this weapon back so they can get it working again and use it to destroy the Toxic Jungle.As with almost all of Miyazaki's films there are plenty of spectacular flying sequences including aerial battles and Nausicaä flying on her glider. There is a clear environmental message in the film but it doesn't feel over stated to me as it is justified by the plot.This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",9,0,2,13 July 2008
Men in Black II," Jay and Kay are back to save the world again
","Five years on from the events in 'Men in Black' Agent Jay is an experienced agent who is no longer shocked by the assorted aliens that have made the world their home and Agent Kay is working in a post office totally oblivious to his past life. That is about to change though; Serleena, a shapeshifting alien who has taken the appearance of an underwear model, has arrived on Earth looking for Light of Zartha of course if she were to get it would be disastrous for Earth. The only agent who knows anything about the Light of Zartha is Kay so Jay must bring him back to MiB so he can be deneuralised, unfortunately Serleena and her associate head there too and manage to take over the facility; Kay will have to go somewhere else to get his memory back. That done he and Kay set about finding the Light and thwarting Serleena's plans.This sequel isn't as good as the original but it still has plenty of laughs as well as some exciting moments. The plot is essentially the same; an alien arrives on Earth to find an object and Jay and Kay must prevent it from finding it and this causing the destruction of Earth. Having the alien disguise itself as an underwear model was funny and Lara Flynn Boyle was suitably sexy in the role; she did however lack the creepiness of 'The Bug' that featured in the original film. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are as good as before as Kay and Jay and it was rather fun to see their roles somewhat reversed. Rosario Dawson was good but somewhat underused as Jay's love interest, and witness to an alien event. Some of the best laughs weren't provided by human characters but by 'Frank the Pug' and the wormlike aliens. For the most part the special effects are pretty good however at times they definitely show their age. Overall this is fun enough; it might not be as good as the first but I'm sure most people who enjoyed that film will also like this and if you don't it is less than ninety minutes long so you won't waste much time watching it.",7,0,2,10 July 2016
Coco," Another great film from Pixar
","This Pixar animation is centred on Miguel a Mexican boy who dreams of becoming a musician. Unfortunately for him his family has banned all music because his great great grandfather had abandoned his great great grandmother to become a musician... they expect him to become a shoemaker like the rest of his family. On the Day of the Dead he plans to sneak off and take part in a music competition but his grandmother destroys his guitar. Needing a new instrument he breaks into the tomb of his hero, legendary musician Ernesto de la Cruz, to borrow his guitar. As soon as he plays a chord something strange happens... nobody alive can see him but he can interact with his dead relatives who can enter the world of the living that one day. He returns to the Land of the Dead with them. He learns that if he stays past the end of the night he will become one of the dead! His family could return him but add the condition that he must give up on music... he refuses believing that Ernesto is his great great grandfather so could return him without such a condition. HÃ©ctor offers to help in exchange for taking his picture back to the Land of the Living. In what follows Miguel learns more about his family and culture.I found this film to be an absolute delight; the story is charming with excitement and genuinely emotional moments. I loved how it was based on the Day of the Dead; a celebration I'd previously heard of but didn't know about in any detail... I'd thought it sounded rather macabre but thanks to this see that it is really something rather beautiful; a day to remember dead family members. As one would expect the animation is great as were the detailed backgrounds. The central story of a child trying to return from a spirit world strongly reminded me of Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away'; the execution is quite different though so I never felt this was copying that film. One might think that a film about characters who are dead might be a bit creepy for younger viewers but the character designs aren't scary; in fact I think the film could be shown to children wondering about death. There are more songs than most Pixar films but it isn't a musical... characters perform rather than just break into song. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to all film fans.",10,1,1,28 December 2019
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A fun and surreal animation
","From an early age Flint Lockwood has been a keen inventor; unfortunately his inventions haven't proved too useful. He lives in the town of Swallow Falls on a remote Atlantic island and when the world stops buying their sardines; living the locals with nothing else to eat he decides to provide an alternative. He makes a machine that can convert water into any type of food. An accident on the day he tests his machine launches it into the clouds and soon it starts raining hamburgers. That isn't all it can make though; he just has to upload the structure of a food and it will rain from the skies. Soon, thanks to visiting TV weather presenter Sam Sparks the world learns what is happening and the town's mayor sees an opportunity. Inevitably there is a problem though; the food starts to mutate and become bigger and bigger and the town is endangered. If it is to be saved Flint and his new friend Sam will have to find a way to shut the machine off.This animated film was a lot of fun; the premise is delightfully surreal and there are plenty of laughs to be had. Flint is a good protagonist and Sam is fine as the romantic interest; it made a nice change for the leading lady to put on glasses and tie her hair back rather than take them off to become attractive. The character designs are good and fairly distinctive and the voice cast did a good job bringing them to life. The strange weather effects are well designed; I particularly liked the spaghetti tornado. If there is a slight flaw it is that the final effort to turn off the machine seemed to drag on a bit and while most children will probably enjoy it some may be a little disturbed at one point somebody is swallowed by a plucked, headless chicken! Overall I'd recommend this to fans of modern animation; whatever their age.",8,1,1,23 October 2013
Kelly's Heroes," A heist behind enemy lines
","When a German colonel is captured by Kelly, a US soldier, black bars are found in his bag; he claims they are just lead so he could sink the bag in a river but a few scratches reveal them to be gold. After questioning him Kelly learns there are fourteen thousand more bars in a bank in Clermont Kelly decides there and then that he intends to get the gold. He will need help though as Clermont is thirty miles behind the German lines. The rest of his platoon are soon persuaded to join in; they are fed up of risking their lives for Uncle Sam; they want to do something for themselves for a change. They will need support though; this comes in the form of three Sherman tanks under the command of the distinctly odd 'Oddball'. It won't be easy; before they can get their hands on the gold they will have to pass through the front line, pass through thirty miles of enemy territory and finally deal with the German's in the town and their three Tiger tanks.This is a fun film; nicely combining a war movie with a heist movie to give us a really entertaining time. Clint Eastward puts in a solid performance as Kelly and Telly Savalas is equally good as his sergeant 'Big Joe' however it is Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Oddball that is the most memorable; he gives us a great character; a hippy long before there were hippies! The rest of the fairly large main cast are also pretty good. The film contains some great action which is bloodless so there are no disturbing images. That isn't to say that nobody dies; a few good guys and dozens of Germans are gunned down or blown up; the ratio may be more than a bit unlikely but this was never meant to be taken that seriously. As well as action there are plenty of laughs to be had along the way. If you are a fan of any of the main stars this is a must see and I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting a war movie that isn't too serious; the PG rating means it can be enjoyed by all apart from young children.",8,4,5,14 June 2015
Garden State," A delightful slice of life
","Aspiring actor Andrew 'Large' Largeman hasn't been home in nine years but he returns for his mother's funeral. Here he sees his father, who is also his psychiatrist, and it is clear their relationship is frosty. He also meets up with old friends and makes one new friend, Sam. Sam is a girl he got chatting to in a doctor's waiting room. Having left his medication at home he decides not to get more and starts feeling emotions that had been numbed for some time.This isn't the easiest film to categorise; it has plenty of funny moments without forced gags; it has emotional moments and it has romance, even that doesn't develop too quickly. Instead it looks like a glimpse into Andrew's life at a point where things are likely to change. The main characters are interesting without feeling exaggerated. The cast is impressive; Zach Braff, who also wrote and directed, does a fine job as Andrew and Natalie Portman is very likeable as Sam. Overall I'd recommend this to people not requiring action and obvious gags but wanting a gentler, 'real' film.",8,1,1,12 December 2018
Event Horizon," A disturbing sci-fi horror
","The Spaceship 'Event Horizon' disappeared near Neptune while on a classified mission to test a new drive system that could make interstellar travel a possibility; seven years later a broadcast was received and the rescue ship 'Lewis and Clark'. This ship's regular crew has been joined by Dr. Weir; the designer of the 'Event Horizon' and the only person to know the nature of the ship's revolutionary drive system; it uses a singularity to fold space enabling it to pass between two points almost instantly. Strange things start to happen once they arrive; scanners show lifeforms everywhere on the 'Event Horizon' and once aboard the crew start having strange visions of people they once knew; dead people! It would appear that that when the gateway opened for its test flight to Proxima Centauri it went somewhere on the way; a place of pure chaos and evil; for want of a better word Hell itself! By the time the crew realises something is wrong; it isn't a question of whether they whether get away alive it is a question of whether any of them will survive.This sci-fi horror deserves to be better known; there may not be an alien aboard the ship but the strange presence is just as frightening; especially when the crew have visions that involve eyeless loved ones. For a film that isn't that well known it has a surprisingly strong cast of well known actors including Lawrence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee amongst the crew; they all put in solid performances although it is Sam Neill who puts in the most memorable performance as Dr. Weir; a character that becomes more dangerous as time passes; whether he is going insane or becoming possessed by the evil controlling the ship is hard to say. They is a lot of disturbing imagery here; both when we see what happened to the old crew of the 'Event Horizon' and when things start going bad for the rescue team; if you don't like the sight of blood you'd best give this a miss but if you want a genuinely creepy sci-fi horror you could do a lot worse.",8,0,1,13 November 2012
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Utterly Enchanting
","This film is utterly delightful and can be watched over and over without ever getting stale. As one would expect from a film from Tim Burton it is darker than most animation. The sets and character designs for the inhabitants of Halloween Town are suitably macabre without being too scary for children to watch. Almost all of the characters are well intentioned despite being rather strange, the only exceptions are Oogie Boogie and his three side-kicks Lock, Shock and Barrel.The story begins the night after Halloween when Jack Skellington, the organiser of the festivities is feeling down, despite its success as he is fed up of doing the same thing year after year. He leaves town to do for a walk with his ghost of a dog and stumbles across a strange wood where the trees contain doorways to the other holiday towns. He is drawn through the one that leads to Christmas Town and is enchanted by the strange world he has discovered.Once back home he tells everybody what he has seen then sets about understanding what Christmas is all about. After much experimentation he decides that this year the people of Halloween Town will organise Christmas, soon the townspeople are eagerly making presents and Jack has dispatched Lock, Shock and Barrel to go to Christmas Town to kidnap 'Sandy Claws'. The only voice of doubt is Sally, a rag doll who has strong unrequited feelings for Jack. Not surprisingly things don't exactly go according to plan.This is a film I would recommend to everybody, especially fans of animation or musicals, although the songs are aren't as up beat as most musicals I suspect you'll still be humming the tunes to yourself after it is over. While this is a Tim Burton Film one mustn't forget that is was directed by Henry Selick who did a wonderful job with the stop-motion animation, Danny Elfman must also be remembered as he wrote all the music to this excellent film.",10,1,1,22 July 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","Shortly after receiving a six month jail sentence, which he won't start serving for six months, journalist Mikael Blomkvist receives an interesting job offer; Henrik Vanger, an elderly man, wants him to investigate the disappearance, and presumed murder, of his great niece who was last seen when she was sixteen in 1966. He is convinced that the killer must still be alive as somebody is sending him pictures of flowers each birthday just as she did; clearly somebody out there is taunting him. Before hiring him Henrik had Blomkvist checked out by a security company who employed young hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate him; she continues to show an interest in him and follows his investigations by hacking his laptop. She makes an important breakthrough and contacts him; after that they join up and continue an investigation that unearths murders of women going back to the '40s, Nazi sympathisers within Vanger's family and ultimately the realisation that the killings have not stopped and they are in grave danger.That covers the core mystery but almost as important is Lisbeth's back story; we learn early on that she is in the official custody of a state appointed guardian who has the power to have her sent back to a psychiatric unit if she doesn't do what she is supposed to. When given a new guardian he uses this authority to force her into performing sexual favours and ultimately, in a particularly gruelling scene he rapes her. She shows her strength by later turning the tables on him; it isn't for some time though that we learn what her original offence was.Having watched several Scandinavian TV dramas in the last few years I was keen to see this film; I must say I was not disappointed... although I do wish the subtitles had been a little larger! At two and a half hours it isn't a short film but I never found myself looking at the clock as the time flew by. The characters were great; particularly Blomkvist and Lisbeth; actors Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life. The mystery itself was gripping and there were a few edge-of-seat moments when it looked as if one of the investigators might not survive. There are a couple of particularly gruelling scenes of a sexual nature, that earned the film its '18' certificate, which might put off some viewers however if you can get through those there isn't anything else too disturbing. Aside from having great characters and an interesting mystery the film looks great with beautiful Swedish winter scenery. I can't say how good an adaptation of the book this is or how it compares to the more recent English language remake but I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting a thriller that doesn't over rely on nonstop action or special effects.",9,3,4,17 June 2012
Big Hero 6," Superhero fun from Disney
","Hiro Hamada is a fourteen year old robot designer who is entering illegal robot fights rather than continuing his education then his older brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the university he attends. Hiro is immediately impressed and determines that he will go there too. To do this he demonstrates his 'microbots' at the science fair. He wows them and afterwards is approached by shady industrialist Alistair Krei but declines his offer to buy the microbots. As he leaves there is a fire and his brother rushes back in to save his professor, Robert Callaghan an explosion occurs and Tadash and the professor are apparently killed and the microbots destroyed. Hiro goes into a depression but later activates his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax. It then becomes apparent that the microbots weren't destroyed; they have been stolen by a masked man whose motives are unclear. Hiro determines to defeat the man. To that end he updates Baymax and turns Tadashi's friends, who are now his friends, into heroes. Together they uncover the identity and motives of the thief before the final stand-off.If you think Disney animation means songs and princesses then this film will come as quite a surprise. It demonstrates that Disney can make an exciting, action packed film that isn't afraid to get quite dark at times. One might expect a murderous villain but seeing the hero go into a murderous rage was a surprise. The animation looks fantastic with amazing detail. The characters are really good; Hiro is a fine lead but it is Baymax the robot who steals the show; he is cute and funny without being twee. The supporting cast of characters are great to and their 'powers', actually hi-tech gear they have invented, are fairly original. The identity of the villain isn't exactly a surprise but his motivation is quite dark for a Disney film. The film has an ending that may reduce some viewers, children and adults alike, to tears even if we then get a 'happy ending' after. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting exciting, animated, superhero action.",9,1,2,11 December 2017
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not scary enough but okay if you are in the right mood
","I wasn't expected too much from this film but I was expecting a bit more than I got. The one thing that all horror films need is to be scary and this sadly lacked any real scares.The film is set in Raccoon City where the sinister Umbrella organisation has released hoards of Zombies infected with the T-virus, anybody being bitten by them catches the virus, dies within a few hours and becomes a zombie themselves. They also release Alice who has also been infected with the T-virus but for some reason she isn't turned into a zombie but instead gets super-human strength. The other main characters are two cops and a reporter who are among those trapped in the city. After meeting up with Alice the group gets a phone call from a scientist who promises to get them out of the city if they find his daughter and bring her out with them. Along the way they meet another cop who worked for Umbrella till the abandoned him in the city and a civilian who appears to be there for light relief. On top of the regular zombies we see dog-zombies and a creature known as Nemesis that seems to be part of the same experiment as Alice.While the film isn't good it isn't totally with out merit, I thought that Sienna Guillory was pretty good as Valentine, one of the cops and I did chuckle when the when the comedy-civilian crashed his car because he was distracted by a couple of topless zombie-hookers. I wasn't too keen on the ending which just seemed like a set up for the next sequel.As I've not played the game that the film is based on I can't say whether or not the film follows the same plot or if the films characters are good representations of those in the game. I wouldn't recommend buying this film but if it is on TV and you are bored it passes a couple of hours.",5,1,4,19 September 2008
Mulholland Drive," The sort of surreal weirdness that one expects from David Lynch
","As this film opens a car is driving along Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills. It comes to a stop surprising the woman in the back. The men in the front point a gun at her and order her out of the car. It looks as if she is about to be murdered but then a pair of street racers come round the corner and one smashes into the car before the woman gets out. She staggers away and turns up at a house in Hollywood. Meanwhile Betty, an aspiring actress, arrives in Los Angeles and moves into her aunt's apparently empty house and is surprised to find a woman in the shower. It turns out this is the woman who was involved in the incident on Mulholland Drive; she says that she has no recollection of who she is or what exactly happened; she calls herself 'Rita' but only because there is a Rita Hayworth poster in the room. Betty agrees to help her find out who she is and what happened. Meanwhile a film director is being told who he must select as the lead actress in his film; he refuses and it soon becomes apparent that those who want her aren't the sort to take no for an answer.This is very much a David Lynch film; the story starts relatively normally but there is always a sense that something is just slightly off; nothing you can readily identify just that gnawing feeling that things might not be what they seem. As things progress the strangeness increases to a point that I wasn't at all sure what was going on this could easily have made the film a confused mess but instead it had be gripped trying to figure out what happened I suspect if you asked a number of people what the film was really about you'd get a similar number of different theories. The cast does a great job; most notably Naomi Watts who is on great form as Betty and Laura Elena Harring who is also great as 'Rita'; they have an impressive chemistry that makes a romantic scene between then erotic and believable rather than sleazy and forced. The rest of the cast impress to, especially those playing some of the stranger, more Lynchian characters. As well as the disturbing weird stuff there are also some funny moments. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the strange; it won't be for everybody though; I suspect it will divide audiences; some will love it, some will hate it but I doubt many will be indifferent to it.",9,1,2,13 May 2017
Grave of the Fireflies," Heartbreakingly Beautiful
","I'd heard that this film was very sad before I saw it and knew how it ended but that didn't prepare me for just how harrowing this film was.Instead of focusing on the military this war film focuses on two children, Seita a boy in his early teens and Setsuko his four year old sister. The action is not fast paced as we follow the children's lives from the death of their mother in a fire-bombing raid through a stay with an unpleasant aunt and trying to live on their own in an abandoned air raid shelter to their inevitable end. By taking it slowing and showing the mundane aspects of their lives the viewer grows to care about the characters, especially the delightful Setsuko to such an extent that that I was smiling during flash backs showing her playing while simultaneously sobbing at her loss.This is not a film to be watched if one is depressed but it should certainly be seen by as many people as possible at least once, it may show two children in war torn Japan but it could easily be set in any war zone at any time in history.",10,2,3,8 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Can the rebellion survive?
","The Republic has fallen and the First Order are on the ascendance. The latter have caught up with the surviving rebels and managed to track them through hyperspace. There seems to be very little hope; the only tiny chance is if they manage to deactivate the tracking system. To do that Finn and mechanic Rose Tico must rack down a master hacker and then head to the lead First Order ship to deactivate the system. While this is going on Rey has found Luke Skywalker to seek his help... something he seems unwilling to give because of what happened when he tried to train his nephew Kylo Ren, formerly Ben Solo, as a Jedi. Somehow Rey and Kylo seem to be linked leading her to believe that she can bring him back to the light side of the force; it will also bring her to Kylo's master, Snoke.I know a lot of reviewers weren't too keen on this addition to the 'Star Wars' franchise but I really enjoyed it. There is lots of really impressive action and despite being almost two and a half hours long it didn't drag. I liked how it avoided the obvious in many ways; especially concerning the identity of Rey's parents. There are some flaws of course; without giving too many details it is hard to see how Finn and Rey survive when the hundreds of Stormtroopers surrounding them don't. There are a couple of other minor things but nothing the spoil my enjoyment. It was great to see Mark Hamill back for a substantial role as Luke has more than a tiny cameo. It was also great seeing Carrie Fisher as Leia, although it is bittersweet knowing it is her final role. The younger cast impress too; notably Daisy Ridley, as Rey; Adam Driver, as Kylo; John Boyega, as Finn and Kelly Marie Tran, as new character Rose. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the franchise; it delivers the spectacle we have come to expect without just being a rehash of 'Empire Strikes Back'... it will be interesting to see what happens in 'Episode IX'.",9,12,54,9 April 2018
Brave," Disney/Pixar go to the Highlands
","This Disney/Pixar film is set in the Scottish Highlands where Princess Merida doesn't enjoy princessly things; instead she enjoys riding, archery and climbing the local mountains. After one such outing she returns to discover that the leaders of three local clans are to visit so she can choose which of their sons she will marry she isn't given the option of choosing none. After an argument with her mother she rides off and finds herself at a witch's cottage; she asks the witch to change her mother; hoping to find a way of avoiding marriage the spell works but not how she expected; it turns her mother into a bear! If that wasn't bad enough her father is famed as a bear-killer! She tries to return to the witch but she is out; she has left a cryptic message though; Merida will have to solve it quickly if the spell isn't to become permanent.This may be a Disney/Pixar film but it feels more Disney than Pixar not that that is a bad thing. This is largely due to having a lead character who is a feisty princess. The story is fun if fairly basic and has the sort of moral one might expect. The action is impressive and at times genuinely scary although not too scary for young viewers. As one would expect from Pixar the film looks great; Merida's curly red hair looks amazing and moves naturally whatever she is doing. The characters are likable; especially Merida and her amusing father. The cast do a fine job; Kelly Macdonald impresses as Merida although Billy Connolly's performance as her father is probably the most memorable thanks to his distinctive voice and amusing character. Overall a solid film which has a good balance of action and humour; it may not be the masterpiece many Pixar films are but I've yet to see a Pixar film that I didn't enjoy.",7,1,2,30 December 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," A really fun space opera
","One night in 1988 Peter Quinn's mother dies and then he is abducted by aliens... not a great day. Twenty six years later he is roaming the galaxy as a thief known, if only to himself, as Star Lord. He steals a mysterious orb and soon everybody is after him; some because there is a bounty on his head others because there are those who want the orb for the power it holds. The soon crosses paths with bounty hunters Rocket and Groot; a genetically engineered racoon-like being and a walking tree, and Gamora, an attractive green woman who is after the orb. They are all arrested and while in jail form an unlikely partnership; they are joined by a fifth member, Drax, who wants revenge against Ronan, the being who murdered his family. They manage to escape but there troubles are far from over; Ronan wants the orb as it holds the power to destroy those he opposes. Few people they approach can be trusted and much of the time they don't trust each other... it will be a miracle if they can save each other let alone the galaxy!When I saw that this was a Marvel film I initially thought it might be yet another superhero film; it isn't. Instead we get a space opera which is full of action, humour and some fine lead characters. It may not be quite as high camp as 'The Fifth Element' or 'Jupiter Ascending' it is in that ballpark with over-the-top villains and exotic aliens. The plot might not provide too many surprises but it does give exciting scene after exciting scene. The characters are great; I particularly liked Groot; despite his very limited vocabulary. The cast does a fine job; this includes those we see and those who provide the voices for the animated characters. The special effects are top notch; they make the animated characters fit seamlessly into the live action and provide spectacular backdrops to impressive action. The use of music from the '60s and '70s was fun and nicely justified by the fact that Quinn had a tape of his mother's favourite music... of course the idea that he could play it for over twenty years without it being chewed up is perhaps the most unlikely part of the film! Overall I'd say this is a really fun sci-fi romp that can be enjoyed by anybody who enjoys the genre but doesn't take it too seriously.",8,1,2,15 August 2019
The Imitation Game," A fascinating story which will hopefully inspire viewers to learn the truth behind the drama
","As with many films 'inspired by real events' much of what we see in this film has been changed; either to introduce antagonists or to make the film more interesting whether such changes can be justified is a matter for the viewer; I will try to base my comments on what was shown on the screen rather than trying to compare it to real events.The film opens in 1951 when police arrive at the house of Alan Turing to investigate a burglary. There doesn't appear to be anything missing and he just wants the police to leave; something the investigating officer finds a little unusual. We then flash back to the dark days of the Second World War where Turing is applying for a post at the top secret Bletchley Park code breaking centre. His manner puts him at odds with his superior and those he works with. They are struggling to decode German Enigma codes by hand; an impossible task given the complexity of the system. The code key changes every day and there are millions of possible keys. Turing says he will build a machine that will be able to find the key but even when the machine is built they will have to find a way to reduce the number of possible keys. Intertwined with this story we see flashbacks to his time at school and more of the police investigation into Turing after the war; it is speculated that he is being secretive because he might be a spy; in fact he is hiding his homosexuality which was illegal at the time and would remain so until the late sixties.Despite knowing how Alan Turing's story ended this was a gripping film; this is largely down to an excellent cast led by Benedict Cumberbatch's brilliant portrayal of Turing; I'm not surprised that he earned an Oscar nomination for it. He is ably supported by others including Keira Knightley who plays Joan Clarke, a fellow code breaker who Turing proposes to, and Charles Dance who plays his antagonistic boss Commander Denniston. The story is told in a way that doesn't assume the viewer knows anything about Turing so the revelation about his sexuality isn't overstated early on although there are obvious clues as the story progresses. If you are interested in this period of history I'd certainly recommend watching this; just remember it is merely 'inspired by real events' hopefully it will inspire viewers to learn more about this great man and the contribution he and the others at Bletchley Park made during the war.",8,6,8,19 March 2015
Caddyshack," Classic Country Club Comedy
","This classic from 1980 is set an exclusive country club where teenager Danny Noonan is working as a caddy to earn money to pay to go to college. Other key characters are the snobbish Judge Elihu Smails, coarse property developer Al Czervik, zen-like golf pro Ty Webb and Carl Spackler the groundskeeper who is waging war against a gopher! During the course of the film we are treated to comedy antics on the golf course, in the club house and at the local marina before a finale that features an explosive grudge match that goes to the eighteenth hole.While some have this films gags haven't aged too well it doesn't matter too much as they come thick and fast. The jokes are a more than a little crude at times but it is hard not to laugh. The cast includes several comedy stars of the time. Bill Murray is probably the most memorable as the unhinged Spackler, his increasingly extreme attempts to kill a gopher are hilarious; Rodney Dangerfield turns it up to eleven as the truly obnoxious Czervik; Ted Knight is impressive as the bigoted judge and Chevy Chase is solid if less memorable as Ty Webb. The rest of the cast is solid enough. Given when it was made it is no surprise that there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and the special effects certainly show their age. The gopher is so obviously fake it either adds to the comedy or is silly depending on one's opinion... I'm inclined to the latter. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy late '70s/early '80s comedy you need to watch it at least once.",8,1,1,2 October 2019
The Evil Dead," The classic cabin-in-the-woods horror
","When five students; Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, his friend Scotty and Scotty's girlfriend Shelly, go for a weekend away in a remote cabin in the Tennessee woods they anticipate having a good time it soon becomes apparent that they will be getting something very different. Things get slightly creepy before they even get into the cabin and this quickly escalates when they explore the cellar and find an old book and a tape recording made by a previous resident; an archaeologist. It tells how he found the 'Book of the Dead' on a dig in the Middle East and how reading a certain incantation summoned evil spirits; the recording includes the incantation and soon evil forces are making their presence felt. Cheryl hears something and goes into the woods to investigate; here she is grabbed by the trees and raped! She manages to get away but it later becomes apparent that she is possessed by an evil spirit; a spirit that is determined to possess each of the others. Before the night is out they will experience a number of grizzly terrors as they are attacked and more of them become possessed.This low budget horror has become a cult classic; helped by the fact that it was banned here in the UK for many years as one of the so called 'video nasties'. No doubt this also added to its scariness as I was constantly expecting something horrible to happen! There were plenty of good scary moments as well as some fairly gruesome scenes and the infamous 'tree rape' scene is genuinely disturbing even if nothing really offensive is shown. The story is simple, which isn't a bad thing in a short horror film. The effects are distinctly low budget but still effective; frequently the creepiness is provided just by unusual camera angles, lighting and a few strange sounds which keep the viewer on edge. Director Sam Raimi did a great job creating such an atmosphere. The cast does a decent enough job, most notable Bruce Campbell in the role of Ashley. They are perhaps a bit old to be playing 'college kids' but that hardly matters as their age doesn't affect the story. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to horror fans at is a classic of the genre.",8,0,2,15 February 2017
Shrek 2," A sequel that is every bit as good as the original
","As this sequel begins the dashing Prince Charming races to rescue Princess Fiona from the Dragon's Tower and learns she is no longer there; she is on her honeymoon. Meanwhile Fiona and Shrek are just getting home to the swamp. They haven't been back long when they receive an invitation to visit Fiona's parents; the King and Queen of the country of Far, Far away. Shrek thinks it is a bad idea that is bound to end in disaster but Fiona insists and they end up going, along with Donkey. Once they arrive it would appear that Shrek was right; Fiona's father isn't happy with her choice of husband and is soon plotting to get rid of him. He isn't the only person wanting Shrek out of the way; Fairy Godmother is keen to get him out of the picture so Fiona can marry her son; Prince Charming.Sequels that are as good as the original aren't all that common but this is a good example of one that is just as good. Most of the original characters are back again; although this time Fiona spends most of the time as an ogre, which I preferred. There are also plenty of great new characters; most notably Puss in Boots, a feline Zorro voiced by Antonio Banderas; Fairy Godmother, the villain of the film voiced by Jennifer Saunders and Fiona's Parents, voiced by John Cleese and Julie Andrews. There is plenty of action throughout as well as a good number of laughs. There are also lots of references to other films that should be a treat for older viewers without spoiling the enjoyment for youngsters. We also get a good number of well-known songs; the most entertaining being when Fairy Godmother sings 'Holding Out for a Hero' at the ball. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original.",9,0,1,8 January 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Very Stylish Action Film
","It must be said at the start that this film is a triumph of style over substance so if you don't like the style it won't be the film for you. That said I really enjoy watching it, from start to finish it is pretty gripping.As I'm sure most people will know by know, Uma Thurman plays 'The Bride', a former assassin who is left for dead after being shot in the head by Bill, her former boss.The film is not shown in chronological order so when we see her first fight it is actually the second person on her hit-list. We then see in flash back that she has been in a coma for four years and has apparently lost her child. Once she has awakened we are shown a brief history of her first target; the Yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii. This section is animated was made by people who have worked on some of the best known anime films so is understandably quite impressive.Before she can fight O-Ren she must get a new sword from retired sword-smith Hattori Hanzo. Initially he refuses to make it as he had sworn never to make another deadly weapon but as soon as he knows who The Bride is after he not only makes her a new sword but states that it is the best he has ever made.When she finally finds O-Ren she uses her new sword to dispatch a vast number of goons before the climactic fight with O-Ren. Much of the fight sequence is in black and white, I believe this was because the censors might not have likes the screen to be awash with bright red blood. While the scene is obviously violent it is so over the top that it isn't really disturbing.If you want a stylish action film that has plenty of re-watch value then this could be the film for you. The acting is solid and the action is all stunningly choreographed.",9,0,2,26 June 2008
Ip Man," Must see martial arts action
","This film is loosely based on the life of Chinese martial arts master Ip Man during the Japanese occupation. It opens in 1935 in the city of Foshan. The city is famed for its many martial arts schools but Ip Man doesn't operate a school despite being a more proficient fighter than all the other kung fu masters. He lives a comfortable life with his wife and young son but all that changes in 1937 when the Japanese take the city. The martial arts schools close and the various masters find themselves working at a local coal mine. Word of their presence gets back to the Japanese general and he has them fight his men for bags of rice. After the death of a friend Ip Man gets involved and defeats ten Japanese fighters at once; the general wants him to train his men in the Wing Chun form of Kung fu, but he refuses. The only people he trains are Chinese workers who are being attacked by bandits. Ultimately though he will have to face the Japanese general who is an expert fighter himself.Certain liberties may have been taken with the facts but that doesn't matter too much as this is a good story with lots of great action. It opens well with pre-war scenes that introduce Ip Man, his family and various other major characters, notably a policeman who later works for the Japanese as a translator. There is some action in these scenes but most of the action takes place after the Japanese arrival. These later fight scenes are fairly bone crunching and while it is clear that that is some wire assistance nobody flies across the room and the fights feel more real than the beautifully choreographed fights in Wuxia films. That doesn't mean these fights aren't choreographed though; Sammo Hung did a really great job setting up the fights so they feel natural. Donnie Yen is great as Ip Man; a restrained character who avoids violence when he can but is just about unstoppable when forced to fight. The supporting cast are impressive too. The villains are suitable menacing but not too obviously evil; the sadistic Japanese colonel may be bordering on a pantomime villain but the general is more honourable even if he is one of the bad guys. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; it is definitely a must see for martial arts fans.",9,0,0,7 March 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," A film of two halves
","As the film opens a Texas Ranger pops into a liquor store and starts talking about a bank robbery in Abilene. The robbers, Seth and Richard Gecko, are believed to be heading through Texas to the Mexican border he has no idea that they are hiding in the store and he doesn't live to find out. The brother's continue south to a motel near the border. Here they meet the Fuller family; Jacob and his children Kate and Scott, for are taking a holiday in their recreational vehicle. Jacob is a preacher suffering a crisis of faith after the loss of his wife. The Geckos take them hostage and force Jacob to take them to a sleazy bar in northern Mexico.Here they settle down and have a few drinks while waiting for Seth's contact to arrive. While waiting they learn the terrible truth about the bar it is a nest of vampires who prey on their unfortunate clientele! If they are to survive until dawn they will have to recall everything they've heard about vampires and Jacob will have to find his faith again.This is very much a film of two halves; the first a tense hostage situation and the second a full on vampire movie there is nothing in the first half to suggest what is to come. George Clooney does a fine job playing against type as Seth and is ably supported by Quentin Tarantino who plays is disturbingly creepy brother. Harvey Keitel is more understated as Jacob Fuller, Juliette Lewis impresses as his daughter and Ernest Liu is pretty good as his son. Selma Hayek may not be on screen for long but she oozes sexiness in the film's most memorable scene. The style of action changes too; in the first half it is grittily realistic in a fairly mean way then in the second half it is more full on blood and gore done in a more tongue in cheek way; an example being the four stripper-vampires who end up staked on the legs of an upturned table. Overall I'd say that this is very much a cult movie that people will either really enjoy or really dislike thankfully I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend this to fans of the films of Robert Rodriguez or Tarantino.",8,0,1,4 August 2016
Clash of the Titans," Silly but fun; better than I expected
","Before watching this film I'd heard some fairly negative reviews but tried to view it with an open mind and must say it was better than I had expected. The story was pretty silly; I have no idea what the Kraken, a creature of Norse mythology was doing here amongst the gods of Greek Myth for a start! The story follows Perseus, a demigod who was found by a fisherman as a baby. When this stepfather is killed by Hades Perseus agrees to help the king after Hades threatens that he will set the Kraken on the city if his daughter isn't sacrificed. In order to defeat the Kraken Perseus and the soldiers assisting him must consult a group of witches and fight against several enemies including giant scorpions and the snake-haired Medusa who will turn any man who gazes upon her into stone.If you can suspend your disbelief this film is fairly entertaining and as the action is fairly constant that isn't too hard. The special effects were impressive; in some cases if one didn't know better one might think some of the mythical creatures were real at least that was the case when watching on a fairly small television. The acting wasn't bad with Sam Worthington being a decent lead in the role of Perseus the biggest disappointment was with the late Pete Poselthwaite not because he was bad but because his character only lasted for ten minutes I was hoping to see more of this fine actor. I'm not sure that I'd go out of my way to watch this but it is worth watching if it is on television or if somebody lends you the DVD.",6,0,1,7 November 2011
Mission: Impossible II," Quite different to the first film
","Fans of the original Mission Impossible film may be a disappointed in this as there is a dramatic change in style which goes along with switching director from Brian De Palma to Hong Kong action supremo John Woo. Personally I loved this film and found it to be the most enjoyable of the three Mission Impossible films.Here the plot is far less convoluted, we know from the start who the bad guy is and we know what he is trying to do we just have to sit back and watch the action as our hero sets out to stop him. Sean Ambrose is a former member of the Mission Impossible team who has destroyed a plane carrying a scientist who had requested help from the Mission Impossible team, in order to find out why Ethan Hunt must recruit Nyah, Ambrose's beautiful former girl friend, and persuade her to go undercover to discover exactly what he is up to. It turns out that Ambrose is planning to hold a company to ransom using an artificial deadly disease to which he has stolen the cure to. Not that the company were that honourable, they had created the disease in order to create a demand for the cure.The action is impressive from start to finish, as one would expect from a John Woo film it is all perfectly choreographed, sure it isn't exactly believable but it is a lot of fun. Cruise is on form as our hero Ethan Hunt and Dougray Scott was suitably menacing as the villainous Ambrose, I also enjoyed Thandie Newton's performance as Nyah. If you are a fan of action films that don't require too much thought then I strongly recommend this one.",9,3,6,10 July 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," A thriller with no 'baddies'
","The blurb on the DVD cover describes this as 'Bourne meets Inception', so as I enjoyed those films I was keen to see this. While there are similarities I must say I thought this was much lighter fare; that's not to say I didn't enjoy it though. At first it looked as this would be a political thriller; with candidate for the US Senate David Norris faces a surprise defeat. As he tries to compose his thoughts in the gents he is interrupted by a mysterious woman, before he gets chance to learn who she is he has to go. He doesn't expect to see her again but some time later he bumps into her on a New York bus, this time he gets her name (Elise) and number. He doesn't get chance to call her though as things suddenly get very strange for him; he gets to work and finds everybody frozen and strange men capture him and explain that it is their job to make sure that everything that is meant to happen does happen and he was not meant to meet Elise! They take her number but he is determined to find her and one day three years later he does, their problems are only just beginning however as The Adjustment Bureau haven't given up their plans to keep them apart.I really enjoyed this; Matt Damon but in a fine performance as David Norris and Emily Blunt was suitably beguiling as Elise. Other notable performances include Anthony Mackie as the Bureau man responsible for Norris and Terrance Stamp for played one of his superiors. There was enough excitement without having the action swamp the plot and character development. It also made a nice change for there to be no real bad guys in a film like this The Bureau may have been against the protagonist's plans but their motivation was never sinister. I also liked that no attempt was made to explain how things worked; we were told the Bureau men's hats enabled then to use doors to travel across the city but no time was wasted giving reasons; it just had to be accepted. Over all it was a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend it.",8,7,10,29 December 2011
Black Snake Moan," Saving a sinner down South
","I decided to watch this because I enjoyed most films I've seen starring Christina Ricci or Samuel L. Jackson and this had them both. It is a rather unusual film about an blues singer who has recently been dumped by his wife trying to save a girl who he found badly beaten and half naked by the side of the road. He isn't trying to save her physically but spiritually as he learns that she will sleep with just about any boy who wants her and he believes the only place for sex is within a loving marriage. While she is unconscious he goes into town and gets medicine for her and hears what she is like from the boy who's name she mumbled. when she wakes up in a strange man's house she is understandable rather scared and even more so when she sees that he has chained her to a radiator. Over the days that follow she comes to trust him to the point that when he unchains her and takes her to hear him sing in a local bar she makes no attempt to flee. When her boyfriend who has just been medically discharged from the army returns it looks as though things might turn out tragically... I've tried to keep spoilers to a bare minimum so as not to ruin the story.The acting from the two leads was excellent, they managed to make a rather unlikely situation seem believable. The plot did stretch believability a bit; would a preacher really not go straight to the police if he found out somebody had a young woman chained up in his house against her will? The fact that Ricci's character spends half the film wearing only a pair of knickers and a shirt that is little bigger than a bra might sound sleazy but it just serves to show her character's vulnerability. I wouldn't want to buy this film but it is worth watching if it is on television or perhaps renting if you are a fan of the two leading actors.",7,1,2,8 February 2010
Black Hawk Down," A gripping war film based on real events
",In 1993 US Rangers based in the Somali capital Mogadishu launched an operation to capture the dominant warlord it went tragically wrong. This film tells the story of the men sent into hostile territory. When they get to their destination they learn that they aren't just fighting a few ill-disciplined insurgents but hundreds of well-armed enemy fighters. Things go from bad to worse when first one then a second of the Black Hawk helicopters supporting them are brought down by enemy fire. The soldiers head to secure the crash sites and wait for the rescue that could take quite a while.This film was much better than I'd expected; the soldiers were not depicted as excessively gung-ho and even though there were a lot of 'main characters' enough time was spent with each to make us care about what happened to them. After introducing us to the characters and explaining what they are doing in Somalia the action starts and when it does it hardly lets up until the final scene. The action is filmed in an exciting way without being overly frenetic. The ensemble cast does a fine job making us believe in the characters. The film is almost two and a half hours long but it doesn't seem like it as the action is so engrossing. At times it is a bit gruelling as it doesn't shy away from showing us the casualties. It isn't without flaws though; at the very end we are told that during the operation in which nineteen US service personnel lost their lives over a thousand Somalis died yet during the film they are almost entirely depicted in an unsympathetic light at least there are a couple of scenes that depict innocents caught in the crossfire counter this. Overall though I found this film to be gripping and I cared about the characters; I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre or anybody interesting in the events of that time.,9,2,4,11 May 2014
A Bug's Life," A fun insect adventure from Pixar
","Every summer the ants must harvest grain for the coming winter; not just for themselves but for the bullying grasshoppers who demand half the harvest. One of the ants, an inventor named Flik, tries to find ways to make the harvest easier but the other ants aren't impressed; they prefer the old ways. When the grasshoppers come all the ants flee onto their anthill but as Flik adds his contribution to the pile he knocks it over and it is all lost. Hopper, the leader of the grasshoppers tells the ants that they must provide twice the normal amount of grain before the end of summer or they will take all the ants food and let them starve. Flik offers to go into town to get some warrior insects to fight off the grasshoppers when they return; his offer is accepted... not because he is expected to succeed but because it will get him out of the way. The only ant that has any faith in Flik is Princess Dot, but she is just a child. In town Flik meets a group of unsuccessful circus insects and mistakes them for warriors. He returns home a hero, but when is becomes apparent that they aren't warriors the colony appears to be doomed.This isn't one of Pixar's best films but it is still a lot of fun; the story is simple enough for young children to enjoy without being so simple that older viewers will get bored. Most of the character designs are great; I particularly liked the grasshoppers and the various circus insects. The only character design that I though was poor was the bird which is strange as it was probably the creature that looked closest to its real counterpart; perhaps that was the problem... it had no 'character' it was just a dangerous creature whereas everything else was anthropomorphised. The voice cast, which includes Kevin Spacey and a young Hayden Panettiere, do a fine job; I never though they sounded too 'cartoony'. Being rated 'U' there is little to offend here although some parents might find one or two of the gags involving the male ladybird a bit crude and there are some mildly scary moments that could possibly upset younger children.",8,4,4,15 October 2012
Logan," A gritty, more adult Wolverine film
","It is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.Those expecting another 'X-Men' film will certainly get a bit of a shock; this is not an exciting superhero movie suitable for all but young children. Instead it is almost consistently downbeat with some fairly brutal violence as Logan and Laura remove limbs and puncture skulls with their adamantium claws. There are some genuine surprises as bad things happen to characters one would expect to be safe. Hugh Jackman is great in the lead role, showing a different side to Logan; he is no longer young and angry, instead he is old and world-weary. Young Dafne Keen impresses as Laura; an almost feral girl who makes Hit Girl from 'Kick-Ass' look gentle! There are nods to other films; most notably 'Shane', which Laura watches with Xavier and their search for the possibly mythical Eden in North Dakota reminded me of a different Logan's search for Sanctuary in 'Logan's Run'. I'd certainly recommend this to older X-Men fans but would caution against showing it to younger fans as it is very violent and has some pretty depressing moments.",9,4,6,7 May 2018
Hotel Transylvania," A fun animation set in a hotel for monsters who fear humans
","This film opens in 1895 as Dracula is planning to open a luxury hotel where monsters can stay free from the fear that human mobs will burn then, stake them or otherwise harm them... it also means his baby daughter, Mavis, will never have to see a dreaded human. The action then moves forward to the present day and Dracula is about to throw a hundred and eighteenth birthday party for Mavis. She is keen to see more of the world but Dracula has plans to make her change her mind. Then things go wrong... just as the guests arrive a human turns up. He is Jonathan Loughran, a twenty one year old backpacker. Dracula quickly disguises him as a monster so other guests won't think the hotel is unsafe... that is the least of his worries though; Mavis likes him!There were elements of this film I really liked; the central characters; particularly Dracula, Mavis and Johnathan are a lot of fun. Similarly I liked the child-friendly portrayal of classic horror characters; Dracula, Frankenstein (actually the monster not the scientist), the Mummy and the Werewolf... along with their families. There were plenty of laughs to be had; even if some were a little crude for my tastes. The animation was very impressive even when watched on a small television although it is clear that many shots were designed to make use of 3D in the cinema version. The character designs are good and the voice cast do a fine job bringing them to life. Overall I'd say this is a fun film for fans of computer generated animation... it's not up with Disney/Pixar but it passed the time nicely.",7,1,2,8 July 2019
The Dark Knight," Lives up to the hype
","This, the second of director Cristopher Nolan's Batman trilogy opens with a bank robbery; the robbers are all wearing clown masks and when each has finished his part of the job he is killed by one of his colleagues. When only one is left he removes his mask to reveal a disturbing face; he is wearing predominantly white make up with black around his eyes and a disturbing red smile he is The Joker and clearly he is insane. It turns out the money he stole belonged to the mob and they are worried about losing the rest; either to The Joker or to the forces of law and order. Leading the campaign against crime in Gotham is a new white knight; DA Harvey Dent; a man who intends to take down the criminals by using the system rather than hiding behind a mask. Soon Dent, Lt. Gordon and Batman are after The Joker; and he in turn is after them and those they love.I put off watching this for a long time fearing I'd be disappointed; surely no film could live up to the hype this one received It turned out I needn't have worried; this is a fantastic film. The returning cast members perform well but it is the new characters that really stand out. Heath Ledger certainly deserved his Oscar; his Joker is genuinely disturbing, Aaron Eckhart is great too in the roll of Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as his girlfriend, and Bruce Wayne's old friend Rachel. Those wanting action will be pleased as it rarely stops and is spectacular; this doesn't mean there is any sacrifice of good characterisation and plot though. There are some good surprises along the way as well as a degree of tragedy. If you think superhero films are for children you should be aware that there are plenty of disturbing and even brutal moments here which might disturb youngsters I was a little surprised that it got a UK '12' certificate; it is certainly a 'high 12'. Overall I'd say don't worry about the hype just sit back and enjoy an excellent action film that just happens to have a superhero as its main character.",10,2,6,22 October 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," A sci-fi classic
","Opening before humanity evolved from apes we see a group of apes as it clashes with another group; fighting with hands and teeth. Then one day one of the apes finds a strange black monolith; shortly afterwards it learns how to use objects as weapons a new stage in its evolution has begun. Jumping forward to the near future another monolith has been discovered on the Moon. This discovery leads to a mission to Jupiter; its six-strong team consists of Dave Bowman, Frank Poole, three scientists in stasis and HAL, the ship's computer. As they approach Jupiter it appears that HAL has made an error; something unheard of for such a machine; if the mission is to go ahead as planned it looks as if Dave and Frank will have to disconnect HAL; something HAL will not let them do without a struggle! Once that problem is past and the ship approaches Jupiter things get very strange indeed.Love it or loathe it there is no denying that '2001' is one of the most significant science fiction films ever made. It might not feature exciting laser battles or strange alien creatures and its pace is distinctly slow but it is still a must see for fans of the genre. The effects are brilliant; the ships don't look like models and the apes do not look like people in costumes despite the fact that they are. Most films can usually be summed up in a few sentences but it is impossible to really do that here as I'm not one hundred percent certain what it is about despite having watched it a few times perhaps this is why it is such a great film; it leaves the audience to decide on a lot of matters without it seeming like a cop out. The cast of relatively unknown actors does a fine job; most notably Keir Dullea who plays Dave and Douglas Rain who provides the voice of HAL; making it one of Sci-fi's best known characters despite the fact that all we see of it is its glowing red 'eye'. Stanley Kubrick did a fine job bringing this far-reaching story to the screen; if you haven't seen it yet I'd certainly recommend checking it out; especially if you are a science fiction fan.",10,2,8,7 December 2012
Toy Story," A delightful film for children of all ages
","While I don't think 3D computer animation has the charm of well made hand drawn 2D animation this film comes close due to the delightful characters and well thought out story.The story opens on the day of Andy's birthday party and his toys, led by Woody the cowboy are concerned about what presents he might receive, fearing he will get a toy that will supplant them in his affections. Of course he does get a shiny new toy, a Buzz Lightyear action figure. which is Andy's new favourite. Woody is upset about this and plots to get Buzz lost behind a dresser, unfortunately this goes wrong and Buzz is knocked out of the window. Since Andy can't find Buzz he picks up Woody when he is taken to 'Pizza Planet'. Outside Woody is finds Buzz but is soon separated from Andy. The two of them unite to try to get back to Andy but things take turn for the worse when they are 'captured' by Andy's evil neighbour Sid, a horrid child who likes to destroy toys. Things go from bad to worse when Buzz learns that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear as featured on a TV show.Obviously this is a children's film but that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it just as much, it is a great story that just happens to be about toys that come alive. The characters are all well designed and as a viewer I cared about what happened to them. This film is clearly destined to be a classic as it isn't bogged down with pop culture references which would cease to be funny in a few years. Whether you are four, forty or a hundred and four you should find this film to be lots of fun, I thoroughly recommend it.",9,0,0,3 June 2009
Men in Black," Aliens are amongst us
","Contrary to popular belief aliens exist and are living amongst us; most of them are just getting on with their lives but some don't want to obey the rules that is where the Men in Black come in. MiB is an ultra-secret organisation that even governments are unaware of; it is their job to process with all aliens visiting Earth and deal with those that present a danger. One such alien is a Bug that has landed in upstate New York, killed a farmer and is now wearing his skin like an ill-fitting suit. He heads to New York City in search of an item known as 'The Galaxy'. Two MiB agents, veteran K and new recruit J are on his trail. The Bug kills a couple of aliens who look human but raise some questions with coroner Laurel Weaver until K erases her memory! Other aliens are determined to make sure the Bug doesn't get the Galaxy and threaten to destroy the Earth if the MiB don't retrieve it within an hour.This film is a lot of fun; there are lots of interesting aliens; they may disguise themselves as human when going out and about but their natural forms are delightfully strange. At only an hour and a half in length it isn't overly long but neither does it feel rushed. Time is taken introducing all the main characters; J's introduction is particularly entertaining as he starts off as an NYPD cop before getting recruited to the MiB the recruitment test is great. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great as K and J; both funny but in different ways. Linda Fiorentino impresses as Dr Weaver but is a bit underused. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a good bad guy as Edgar, the Bug, he has some great mannerisms even when special effects aren't employed. Given that it has a PG certificate it is a little gross at times; nothing too bad but I suspect if it had been released now it would have been a '12'. Overall this film is a lot of fun; a good blend of laughs, action and a decent story in a sci-fi setting.",8,1,1,2 June 2016
The Graduate," A classic film about two very different relationships
","It is hard to believe that this film is almost forty five years old; obviously some scenes are of that time but the story itself is timeless. A young Dustin Hoffman plays Ben Braddock; a young man who has just graduated and returned home to California. After a party to celebrate his homecoming family friend Mrs. Robinson asks Ben to drive him home; once there she starts flirting with him. He understandably feels very awkward; on the one hand she is an attractive woman; on the other she is considerably older than him, married and a friend of his parents. Nothing happens that night but it isn't long before an affair begins; there is nothing romantic about it though; they barely talk and don't do anything apart from have sex. Things get more awkward when Mr Robinson suggests that Ben should invite his daughter Elaine out... something Mrs Robinson has absolutely forbidden him to do. Eventually he gives in to pressure and takes her out on a deliberately bad date; something unexpected happens though; he falls in love with her. Clearly Benjamin's life is going to get even more complicated now!This film is rightly considered a classic; the scenes between Ben and Mrs Robinson are delightfully awkward in a way that can make the viewer feel mildly uncomfortable in the way that Ben obviously does. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft are great in the roles... it is unusual to see characters involved in an affair having so little chemistry between them... to such a degree that Ben never calls her anything but Mrs Robinson. That can't be said about the relationship between Ben an Elaine, played by the beautiful Katharine Ross; here there is an obvious chemistry and it is obvious that Ben is obsessed by her and is determined to marry her... even when he is sure she can't stand him! While there is much drama in the film there are also some nice unexpected laughs; the final scene in the church is both surprising and very funny! One can't talk about 'The Graduate' without mentioning the excellent music; the film is accompanied by a selection of Simon and Garfunkel songs; including 'Mrs Robinson' which was written for the film.",9,0,0,26 August 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An interesting sci-fi romance with a difference
","Usually when I sit down to watch a Jim Carrey film I end up getting a little irritated by his excessive gurning; thankfully there is none of that here. Carrey plays Joel Barish a man who decides to skip work one day and takes the train to Montauk where he takes a walk on the beach, later he meets Clementine, a girl with bright blue hair who he gets talking to on the way home. He offers to take her home and then something strange happens he goes to see her at the shop she works in and she acts as if she doesn't recognise him and later he is told that she has had all memories of him clinically erased! He goes to the clinic and after learning as much as they are free to tell him decides to have all memories of her erased too. Things then get rather complicated as he relives various moments in an apparently long relationship as they are deleted, during the procedure he realises that he doesn't want to forget her and tries to find a way of protecting at least one memory of her. Meanwhile the people erasing his memories are having their own problems; one of them is trying to seduce Clementine himself and while he is off the other loses Joel so must call in his boss which in tern leads to more secrets being exposed.This is a hard film to describe as much of the action is non-linear and the viewer is deliberately confused about what is happening at any given moment. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are great as Joel and Clementine and other cast members, including Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood do well too. While this is clearly science fiction due to the memory erasing it doesn't look like stereotypical sci-fi; everything looks like things in the present day look; even the memory erasing machine looked like medical machinery rather than some futuristic device one might expect. Even if you aren't a fan of Jim Carrey films this is worth checking out; in fact I suspect it is worth watching more than once as it felt like the sort of film that will make more sense on the second viewing!",8,0,1,10 March 2011
Elysium," Inequality in 2154
","In the year 2154 the Earth has become overpopulated and the vast majority of the population live in squalor while the rich and powerful live on Elysium. Elysium is a space station whose inhabitants live safe lives in a beautiful environment; where every home includes a medical device that can cure all ailments something those on Earth will risk everything to access. Max is an ex-con working in a factory on Earth until an industrial accident leaves him with only five days to live thanks to radiation exposure. The equipment on Elysium could save him in seconds but it doesn't cross the mind of the factory's Elysium based owner to help him.Max must get there illegally and to that end he agrees to help a criminal commit and audacious robbery; they will capture an Elysium citizen and hack his cyber implants to access his vast wealth. To this end Max is given various cyber implants and a robotic exoskeleton. Things don't go according to plan though; their chosen victim has other very important information in his brain; information that will give control of Elysium to whoever uses it. An operative is ordered to capture Max and return him to Elysium so the data can be used in a planned coup. Max's criminal contact has a better idea though; he wants to use the data to make everybody a citizen of Elysium so that nobody will go without the healthcare they need.This is an enjoyable sci-fi action thriller even though there are some flaws and plenty of clichés. The action is exciting and sometimes quite bloody. The cast do a solid enough job with Matt Damon being pretty good as Max, although not as good as he was in the 'Bourne Trilogy', Jodie Foster is suitable cold as the Elysium Defence Secretary who is planning a coup and Sharlto Copley is delightfully over the top as the villainous Kruger does anybody have a stronger South African accent than this man!? The film is clearly trying to make a comment about social inequality but here the inequality it is so great that is seems unbelievable those on Earth all appear to be slum dwellers while those on Elysium live in mansions. Equally the health care inequality makes little sense; why are people on Earth denied access to the healing technology when they are working for companies owned by the people of Elysium?  Surely a healthy workforce is a more efficient workforce. This is a fairly minor quibble though and anybody wanting a good action film is likely to enjoy this it isn't a great film but it is rather fun.",7,0,1,4 November 2015
Taken," Mindless action but entertaining enough
","In this thriller Liam Neilson plays Bryan Mills a former CIA agent who is not too pleased when his seventeen-year-old daughter Kim tells him she wishes to go to Paris with a friend. His ex wife believes he is just being paranoid and eventually he lets her go. When his daughter and her friend get there a friendly local gives them a lift to where they are staying to save on the cab fare; of course he isn't really friendly he is acting as a spotter for a group of Albanians who are kidnapping young travellers to force them into prostitution. While Kim is on the phone to her father the kidnappers strike; there is nothing he can do to stop her being taken but he isn't going to sit at home and do nothing. He flies to Paris and quickly starts tracking down the kidnappers; working his way up the chain killing and torturing the various kidnappers as he goes. The closer he gets to Kim the more dangerous it gets and the more people get killed.This thriller had lots of exciting action and Liam Neilson put in a decent performance as Mills, the viewer does have to put their brain in neutral and suspend disbelief though as he quickly finds the trail of the kidnappers and works his way up the chain without getting badly hurt in the process or getting arrested for all the deaths he causes despite the authorities knowing what he is doing. If you are looking for something deep and meaningful I'd give this a miss but you could do a lot worse if you are just seeking an hour and a half of mindless action.",7,0,0,8 March 2011
This Is Spinal Tap," The original rockumentary mockumentary
","Anybody lucky enough to be around in the early eighties will remember the band 'Spinal Tap' well they would if they actually existed! 'Spinal Tap' is of course the original rockumentary mockumentary following the fictional band as they tour America in an attempt to sell their new album. Things do not go according to plan though; the album cover design has to be changed because their design is deemed sexist, gigs get cancelled and members of the band fall out. Even when they do perform things don't go according to plan; the scenes were the band perform around a tiny model of Stonehenge and the time a member of the band couldn't get out of a pod on stage were laugh out loud funny.This film is a classic of its type with some of the most quotable lines; even people who have never seen it will probably heard the 'turning it up to eleven' speech quoted in some way. While the band were not good they weren't so bad that they weren't believable; in fact a viewer who didn't recognise any of the cast could be forgiven for believing it was a real documentary! This is helped by black and white 'archive' footage of their early days and a filming style that looks like it was following real interviews rather than a more dramatic style. Whether you are a fan of the music of that time or just want a good laugh this film is a must see.",9,1,5,25 June 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Return to Wonderland
","Nineteen year old Alice Kingsleigh has been having the same dream since she was a child; a strange dream featuring a mad hatter, a variety of talking animals and a cat that smiles. On the day of her engagement party she sees a white rabbit wearing a waistcoat and follows it; she falls down the rabbit hole and finds herself in Underland... the place of her dreams. As she meets familiar characters she assumes she is dreaming; perhaps she is but she can't wake herself up and the dangers there do seem real. She learns that they expect her to fulfil a prophecy; to do that she will have to get the Vorpal sword from the palace of the evil Red Queen and slay the fearsome Jabberwocky.I haven't seen previous adaptations of the 'Alice in Wonderland' story but know enough to realise it was originally about a little girl. Tim Burton's idea of making this as a Return to Wonderland didn't bother me and I thought Mia Wasikowska did a decent job in the role. The rest of the cast; both those physically acting and those providing the voices for various CGI creatures was pretty good although at times Johnny Depps performance as the Hatter seemed like a series of disjointed performances; this may have been designed to emphasise the characters 'madness' but I'm not sure that it worked. The story itself was a fairly run of the mill quest but it featured some amusing characters and a succession of entertaining set pieces. The story is obviously aimed at viewers much younger than me but some scenes may be a little shocking for younger children; I was more than a little surprised to see a creature have one of its eyes removed by one of the goodies in a Disney film! Overall I'd say this film has plenty of flaws and is far from a classic but it is still worth watching on television.",7,0,1,7 January 2013
The Mummy Returns," A solid sequel with almost nonstop action
","This sequel opens in ancient Egypt and shows a warrior known as 'The Scorpion King' raise an army and set about conquering the known world. Eventually he is defeated and as he is about to die in the desert he prays to Anubis; he gives him a new army and he takes Egypt but is then taken by Anubis.The action then moves forward to 1932 and explorer Rick O'Connell and his wife Evelyn are searching a site in Egypt; Evelyn had strange visions that led her to the Bracelet of Anubis. They return to London with it and their son Alex puts it on; it locks onto his wrist and shows him a vision of Ahm Shere, in Egypt. Meanwhile a cult has raised Imhotep; hoping that he can defeat the Scorpion King and take command of his army to do that they kidnap Alex and take him to Egypt; along the way Alex is told that he has seven days from the moment he put the bracelet on to get to Ahm Shere or he will die. His parents, along with his uncle Jonathan and Ardeth Bay, set off in pursuit and before the time limit is up they come across a variety of dangers and ultimately must confront the risen Scorpion King.Fans of the first film will almost certainly enjoy this; the plot is fairly ridiculous but that doesn't matter as the action barely stops from start to finish. The action is pretty good for the most part although some of the CGI is certainly showing its age; unfortunately this includes the Scorpion King himself. The central cast are pretty good; Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have a good chemistry as Rick and Evelyn and John Hannah provides some good laughs as Johnathon. Shaun Parkes also provides some funny moments as Izzy, the pilot of a dirigible who has had bad experiences when working with Rick in the past. Overall this is a solid 'Boys' Own' adventure with little material that could offend and thrills that are suitable for older children and adults wanting good silly fun.",7,0,0,19 September 2016
Avatar," Spectacular even though it is flawed
","Having heard the hype about how this was the greatest film ever made followed by the counter hype saying it was over-rated derivative rubbish I wasn't sure that I wanted to see it but when an opportunity arose to watch it on DVD I decided it was time to watch it for myself and make my own mind up. Having seen it I can say that I don't think that it was the greatest film ever made and I certainly thought the main story was fairly derivative, it certainly wasn't rubbish though. Even though the story was fairly predictable I found it enjoyable and thought the characters were fairly interesting although the chief bad guy was hammy in such an over the top way he was funny. The real star of the film though was the planet Pandora; the CGI was done so well that it was possible to suspend disbelief and forget that this was a computer generated world.The message of the film is fairly heavy handed; it is clear from early on that the humans on Pandora are the bad guys who are willing to destroy a pristine world and its native population to acquire a valuable mineral. There were a few surprises to be had though; the humans did far more damage to the natives' world than I'd expected and more than one character I'd expected to survive died. If you are one of the few people who still haven't seen this I'd recommend giving it a go to see what all the fuss was about; it might not be perfect but it is spectacular.",9,3,9,20 February 2011
Toy Story 2," Even better than the first
","Often sequels are just an excuse to bleed a few more dollars out of the viewer my turning a good film into a so-so franchise, this however manages to be that rare thing; a sequel that surpasses the original. Woody, Buzz and all the other toys from the first film are back for a new adventure; when Woody is stolen by a toy store owner who needs an original 'Woody' toy to complete a collection of 'Woody's Roundup' toys Buzz and the others must set off to rescue him. Woody however is conflicted about what he should do, he wants to return home to Andy and the other toys but if he does the other toys from the collection he is part of will be put into storage again.The story is packed with thrills such as the toys causing mayhem as they try to cross a busy road and comedy such as where 'Buzz' and his Nemesis Zurg re-enact the most famous scene from 'The Empire Strikes Back'. This story includes some great new characters such as Jesse the Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Woody's Horse Bullseye. The film even manages a joke about the short supply of Buzz Lightyear toys after the release of the first will which not only doesn't seen too self-referential but adds greatly to the story when Buzz gets replaced by another Buzz Lightyear toy who still believes he can fly and fire lasers. Even though the film is aimed at children the story should appeal to adults just as much and take them back to the innocent days of their childhood when they too found happiness in a box of assorted toys.",10,0,1,18 July 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A fun but not particularly scary horror film
","Protagonist Christine Brown is hoping for an important promotion at work but is told that it will probably go to another, more recent, employee as he is more willing to take the tough decisions. Shortly afterwards and elderly woman comes in asking for her loan to be extended when the bank foreclosed on her mortgage. She takes the woman's case to her boss but he leaves it up to her to decide what to do she decides to take the tough decision and refuses the old woman's request. The woman starts begging and Christine calls for security. She is shaken but assumes it is over; it isn't the woman later attacks her and tells her that she is cursed. Christine decides to see a spiritualist and he tells her that she has indeed been cursed; she will be tormented for three days then she will literally be dragged to Hell!! Over the next three days she is indeed tormented and, along with the spiritualist, she tries to find a way to get out of the curse.The DVD box announced that this is 'The scariest movie of the decade' it isn't. In fact it isn't particularly scary at all. There are the expected jump-scares and some creepy moments but nothing really scary. That isn't to say it isn't worth watching the unpleasant things that happen are at least quite funny in a mildly disgusting way. We have a fly continuing to buzz after she swallows it, a high pressure nose bleed and a possessed goat to give just three examples. Director Sam Raimi does a good job and I liked the fact that the majority of the effects appeared to be physical rather than CGI. Alison Lohman does a solid enough job in the lead role; making us believe that her character believes in the strange things that are happening to her. The only real weak point of the film is the ending; it is just a little too cliché. Over all I'd say this is a decent film for people want a horror film that isn't particularly disturbing but is quite fun.",7,5,8,5 November 2015
The Artist," A delightful tribute to the era of silent cinema
","In 1929 George Valentin one of the most celebrated actors of his day; his films plays to cinemas packed with adoring fans. One day, as he is talking to the press, an unknown dancer kisses him on the cheek and the photo makes the front cover; everybody wants to know who she is. In a few short years they will know; she is Peppy Miller and she is on her way from being a dancer trying to get into films to being the leading lady of the time. Meanwhile George, the man who got her her break is on the way out; the talkies are coming in and he doesn't want anything to do with them. He invests much of his own money in a film that proves to be a flop then the stock market crash wipes out the rest of his money; forced to sell everything he hits rock bottom as Peppy is riding high in public popularity; she hasn't forgotten him though and is determined to help him get back into the movies.This tribute to the era of silent cinema is an utter delight. The idea of making a black and white (almost) silent film in this day and age seems unlikely; a gimmick at best it works though and apart from when a well-known actor appears on screen it is easy to forget this is actually a modern film! Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo put in fine performances as George and Peppy even if they are somewhat upstaged by Uggie who plays 'The Dog'; one of the screen's most delightful canine characters! Silent films aren't really silent of course; they are accompanied by music and this one is no different; the music made the film 'real'; capturing the emotions of the scenes as well as setting in the right time period. The story is fairly simple but that is part of the charm. Overall it is a feel-good movie but that doesn't mean there aren't sad moments; as things get worse and worse for George it is sad even though we can guess that somehow things will be better by the time the credits roll. Overall I thought this was an utter delight and recommend it to anybody looking for something very different from the usual fare which contains nothing which might cause offence.",10,1,7,28 August 2014
There's Something About Mary," A crude but amusing romantic comedy
","Sixteen year old Ted can't believe his luck when the beautiful Mary invited him to the school prom but things go disastrously when he gets caught in his zipper and ends up in an ambulance rather than going to the prom! Sixteen years later he is still obsessed with Mary even though he hasn't seen her since that dreadful night. His friend Dom says he knows private investigator who can find her; Ted hires the man, Healy, and he soon reports that she is now living in Miami, has four kids by three fathers and looks like a whale only one of these details is true; she is in Miami but she is still beautiful and childless so beautiful in fact that sleazy Healy sets about wooing her. Having eaves-dropped her conversations he presents himself as the perfect man for her. There are problems for Healy though, a friend of Mary sees that he is a fraud and Ted decides that he'd like to see Mary again whatever she looks like.This is probably not the rom-com to buy your mother for Christmas unless she enjoys jokes about blokes getting their genitals caught is their zips, a woman accidentally using semen as hair gel or dogs being drugged and nearly dying. If that sort of crudeness offends then it is best to avoid this but if not there should be enough laughs to be had. The story itself is standard rom-com fare; boy loves girl but she is in love with the wrong guy it is just that the laughs along the way are often in poor taste but some of those poor taste moments are the films funniest; although dog-lovers may disagree. Ben Stiller does a decent enough job as nice-guy Ted, even if he looked ridiculous when playing him aged sixteen. Cameron Diaz shines as the eponymous Mary but it is Matt Dillon who steals the show as Healy making the sleazy character almost likable due to the shear outrageousness of his actions. Overall if you are looking for some lowbrow humour you could do a lot worse than watch this.",7,0,0,3 December 2014
Mission: Impossible," Who is the mole?
","I had seen the odd episode of the television series as a child but it was long enough ago that by the time I came to watch the film I'd forgotten so much about it that I could view this as a totally new product; which is probably for the best. It was clear from early on that this was going to be a star packed adventure as the team included Tom Cruise; Kristen Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez and Jon Voight at least it seemed that way until the first mission we see leaves most of the team dead and their target free with the 'NOC List'; a list giving the names and code names of every CIA asset in Eastern Europe! Cruise plays the team's leader, Ethan Hunt, and after that debacle the CIA believes he is the mole they already suspected somebody and as the sole survivor it must be him or must it? As part of their mole hunt they had placed a fake list so anybody who uses it will get caught. Soon it becomes clear that there was a second survivor; Claire Phelps. After some distrust he eventually decides that she isn't the mole and sets about finding who wanted the list so he can bait them with the real list and expose the mole.This is an exciting thriller with plenty of twists and turns before the end. The surprises started early when characters played by well known actors were killed off and continued right until the end when we learn which previously trusted characters are in fact bad. Tom Cruise puts in a solid performance as Hunt; it is of little surprise that he continued to play the role in an ever increasing franchise. The rest of the cast support him convincingly as Hunt and his new team work to catch the mole. There are plenty of exciting moments; the best being when they sneak into the CIA headquarters in Langley to steal the real file if you think too much about the scene it does seem somewhat ridiculous but it is so well handled it doesn't matter besides this is Mission Impossible after all! Things continue well until the very end then things get unfortunately silly as Hunt chases the bad guy on the roof of a speeding train as it heads towards the channel tunnel then enters the tunnel with a helicopter attached to it by a cable there is impossible and there is unbelievable; sadly this was the latter. That said this is just one scene and while it detracted from a previously good film it didn't spoil it for me. Fans of Cruise or of slightly far fetched thrillers should certainly enjoy this.",8,2,3,12 July 2012
La La Land," A delightful modern musical
",Mia Dolan is an aspiring actress working at a coffee shop at Warner Studios and Sebastian Wilder is a jazz pianist reduced to playing familiar Christmas tunes in a restaurant inevitably they are going to meet. Actually they meet three times before they finally get together. It first it appears that they won't get along; their earlier meetings were fairly confrontational and then she tells him that she hates his beloved jazz. Not surprisingly though they form a relationship but things aren't perfect; they each encourage the other but when one of them compromises on their dream and finds success that takes them away while the other struggles with their own dream.I'd heard great things about this film and while it wasn't quite as amazing as some reviews suggested it was still a delight to watch. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are impressive as our two protagonists; the rest of the cast are solid enough but it is the two leads who dominate. The songs are decent enough but didn't feel too memorable; of course this may be because I've only watched the film once. The story does occasionally go in directions I didn't expect. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a feel-good musical that harks back to the classic era for the genre rather than relying on familiar songs.,8,2,5,31 July 2017
Super 8," A nostalgic monster movie for (almost) all the family
","Having heard positive reviews of this film I was keen to see it and wasn't disappointed; its 1979 setting and young cast brought to mind films like 'Stand By Me' and 'ET: The Extraterrestrial'. The protagonists are a group of school children who are making a movie for an upcoming competition and one of their locations is a nearby railway station. When a train approaches they start filming thinking that having a real train in their movie will make it look more professional; what they did not expect was for that train to crash. There is something odd about the crash though; the area is littered with small grey objects and was caused by one of their teachers parking his pick-up on the tracks; miraculously he survived and warned then that they must never speak of what they saw or their lives will be in danger. It soon becomes apparent that something dangerous was on the train and the Air Force is determined to keep that quiet. Since this is the '70s they can't look at what they filmed immediately but have to wait three days for the film to be developed so don't find out just what was on the train for some time! In the days that follow the crash they must determine just hat they are up against and find out why the military want it covered up.While this film was written and directed by J. J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg there were no well known people among the cast; that isn't to say they did a poor job though; in fact the opposite is true; I often find an unknown actor more convincing as I just see them as the character they are portraying rather than as an actor I know from various other performances. That said I'm sure they won't remain unknown; in particular Elle Fanning who was great as Alice. As one would expect from a twelve certificate film it isn't too scary but there are a few frights; I suspect most parents will be more concerned by the swearing than by the scariness. The actual violence is fairly minimal with the camera cutting away before we see anything too bad. The special effects look good; especially the spectacular train crash, which is even more dramatic than a real crash would have been! I watched it with several family members including my ten year old nephew and he thought it was great!",9,0,1,6 April 2012
The Last Samurai," Tom Cruise becomes a samurai warrior
","By 1876 Captain Nathan Algren, a decorated hero of the American Civil War, has become an alcoholic; haunted by the atrocities to took part in against the Native Americans. He is making a living helping to sell rifles until he is offered a position helping to train the Japanese army who are trying to put down a rebellion by the few remaining samurai. These warriors cling to the old ways and fight with traditional weapons but can't admit that their time is over. Algren quickly sees that the Japanese conscripts he is training aren't ready to fight but they are ordered into battle anyway. He joins then and after they are routed he is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is nursed back to health and over the course of the winter he goes to respect Katsumoto, his samurais and their way of life; so much to that he lays down his guns and takes up the samurai sword to fight with them even though he knows that ultimately they cannot win.This might not be an historically accurate film but it is still gripping. The action scenes are very impressive and feel real as men with swords go up against men with guns. Tom Cruise is on top form as Capt. Algren and Ken Watanabe excels as Katsumoto; an honourable man who continues his fight even though he is fully aware that it isn't a fight he can win. The growing friendship between these two characters is a joy to watch. The rest of the cast were good too; I especially liked Timothy Spall's appearance as an English translator/photographer and Billy Connolly's cameo as Algren's friend Sgt Gant. The New Zealand scenery, filling in for Japan, looks stunning without detracting from the story we are watching. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the stars or those wanting a gripping war film with some great action scenes and a fine plot.",8,1,3,8 May 2016
Up," Another great animation from Pixar
","Young Carl Fredricksen's hero is Charles Muntz an explorer who has been disgraced after it is suggested that one of his great finds is actually a fake. Carl refuses to believe this though. Soon after learning of Muntz' disgrace he meets Ellie; a girl who is equally obsessed with the idea of exploration; they vow that one day they will go to Paradise Falls in South America together. The years pass and they get married; money is put aside for the trip but one thing after another means they never do. Eventually Ellie dies leaving Carl all alone in the house they had shared all their adult lives. Developers want to buy his house so they can build there but he has other ideas. One day he decides he is leaving... and he is taking his house with him!He uses thousands of helium balloons to float the house into the sky; then he realises he is not alone; Russell, a Scout who wants to get his 'helping the elderly' badge. When the balloon finally descends they find themselves in South America; not just that but within walking distance of Paradise Falls. Carl wants to take the house there before all the helium leaks out of the balloons. They try to get there but meet several distractions along the way including a giant bird, a talking dog and the man Carl once considered his hero. One thing is for sure; Carl will finally get the adventure he dreamt of!I haven't seen every Pixar film but I've been impressed with every one I've seen so far and 'Up' is no exception. The opening is beautiful as well as being tear-inducing... more so for older viewers I suspect. When Carl and Russell go on their adventure the story becomes more child-friendly with plenty of laughs provided by Kevin the bird and Dug the dog. There are just the right number of scares provided by the obsessed Muntz and his pack of talking dogs. I know this was released in 3D in the cinemas but when I saw it on TV I wasn't constantly thinking 'that scene was put in just to show off the 3D'. The characters were really good; I especially liked how the elderly Carl never forgot his late wife... she was not just a motivation to travel then never mentioned again. Russell made a good sidekick and Kevin and Dug were pretty funny... older viewers might find them a little silly but we must remember this is really a film for all ages and I'm sure children will love these characters. If you've enjoyed other Pixar film you are sure to love this it is great.",9,0,1,5 January 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Stylised ultra-violence in a near future dystopia
","Protagonist Alex DeLarge leads a small gang of thugs; his droogs. Together they like nothing more than an evening of ultra-violence and rape, being somewhat more cultured Alex also loves the music of Ludwig Van (Beethoven); especially his Ninth Symphony. When his droogs get above themselves he quickly and violently puts them in their place or so he thinks. Later on after a particularly brutal attack they knock him out and leave him for the police. He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison but after two years hears of a revolutionary treatment that will cure him of his antisocial tendencies and enable him to be released quickly. The treatment, a form of aversion therapy works perfectly; he feels violently sick whenever confronted by violence or sexual urges as well as accidentally robbing him of the ability to enjoy his beloved Ninth Symphony. Once out he tries to get on with his life but those he once wronged aren't so forgiving.Like most films from director Stanley Kubrick this is worth watching although it isn't for the fainthearted; the violence may be highly stylised but it is still brutal and disturbing. The first half of the film introduce us to the world of Alex and his Droogs; a world of casual violence where they take what they want without concern for others. One might think that this would mean his 'treatment' would be less disturbing but seeing him with his eyes held open as he is forced to watch violent and sexual films is just as gruelling. Malcolm McDowell is the obvious star of the film; his Alex is scarcely off screen and also provides the film's narration; he does a great job in the role. This narration is important to setting the tone of the film; the 'Nadsat' slang he uses giving it an otherworldly feel we may understand what he is saying but many of the words are unfamiliar. The choice of music also adds to the menace; synth versions of classical music and most memorably Alex singing 'Singin' in the Rain' when raping a woman. I don't think this is Kubrick's best work, much of it is deliberately hard to enjoy, but it is still a classic with the power to disturb over forty years after its release.",9,1,5,3 April 2014
Rio," An Animated Avian Adventure
","As this animated film opens several birds, including a young Spix's macaw are captured in the rain forest outside Rio de Janeiro and taken to America. The young macaw's crate falls off the van in the snow blanketed town of Moose Lake in Minnesota. Here he is found and cared for by Linda, who calls him Blu. Fifteen years pass then Túlio Monteiro, an ornithologist from Rio turns up asking for Linda's help... Spix's macaws are critically endangered and he needs Blu to go to Rio and breed with Jewel, the last known female. The three of them fly there but Jewel and Blu don't initially hit it off... she is certainly unimpressed that he can't fly. This is the least of their problems though; they are stolen, and chained together by thieving bird smugglers and Nigel, their evil sulphur-crested cockatoo. They manage to escape but their adventure is far from over. Meanwhile Linda and Túlio learn of their disappearance and start searching for them; as do the smugglers.This film is quite different from the stories one gets from Disney/Pixar; it is brasher in style and a little cheeky at times. This isn't a criticism though; it provides plenty of good laughs, child-friendly thrills and a touch of romance... in other words something for everybody. The main characters are good; I liked how Blu and Jewel's relationship gradually develops and Linda and Túlio work together to find the birds without their relationship becoming obviously romantic. I was less amused by Pedro and Nico, to cliché comedy sidekicks who were more irritating than entertaining... of course they may appeal more to younger viewers who are the real target audience. The character designs were impressive and the animation was top notch. I loved the scenes were we fly through the jungle and soar above Rio; they were clearly designed to show case the film's 3D on the big screen but still work on a small TV screen. The voice cast, which includes Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg as Jewel and Blu, does a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say that this is well worth a watch if you enjoy animation or are just looking for something that can be enjoyed by all the family.",8,0,0,14 October 2019
Where Eagles Dare," Great 'Boy's Own' adventure
","When an American general is captured by the Germans and taken to an Alpine castle a small team is sent to free him before he can be forced to give the Germans plans for the opening of a second front. This is a British operation led by Major Smith; it includes five other British soldiers and American Lt Schaffer. All of them are fluent German speakers; something that is essential as they will be infiltrate the castle in German uniforms.Once they parachute into Germany things start to go wrong; one of the group is found dead; Smith announces that he broke his neck but it is clear that he knows the man was killed. Smith's behaviour quickly show that there are parts of the operation that other members of the team are being kept in the dark about as he sneaks off to meet a woman, Mary Ellison, who is later instructed to go to the castle as a member of staff. Shortly afterwards another member of the team is killed then the others are captured; Smith and Schaffer manage to escape and carry on the operation alone. Once in the castle there are a lot of revelations; traitors are exposed and the true reason for the mission revealed once that is done they just have to get out of the castle than make their way to a nearby airfield while hundreds of Germans try to stop them.If you are looking for a gritty, realistic war film then this is likely to disappoint you but if you are looking for a 'Boy's Own' adventure full of daring-do, lots of action where heroes seldom miss, bad guys are unlikely to inflict more than a flesh wound and there are so many twists that at one point or another most of the team have suspicion pointed at them then this might be the film for you. There is lots of exciting action; this includes shooting, explosions and even a fight on top of a cable car. Richard Burton does a fine job as Smith, especially in the scene the truth is revealed. He is ably supported by Clint Eastwood as Schaffer and Mary Ure as Mary Ellison; the rest of the cast is pretty solid too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for an exciting wartime adventure.",9,2,5,12 March 2017
The Fly," Classic Cronenberg body horror
","When scientist Seth Brundle tells journalist Veronica Quaife that he is working on a project that will change the world she thinks he must be exaggerating but when she sees it she realises he has invented something amazing; a device that will teleport an object from one teleportation pod to another. There is a catch though; it only works on inanimate objects. After more experimentation he manages to successfully teleport a baboon. He agrees to wait for tests before teleporting himself but then changes his mind. Unfortunately when he teleports he isn't alone in his pod; there is a common house fly in with him and when he emerges there is no sign of the fly. He soon notices that he is far more dynamic. He assumes that he has somehow improved but then he starts to change more; he grows course hairs, his nails fall out and it soon becomes apparent that he has been genetically spliced with the fly; Seth Brundle is no more; he is now Brundlefly.This is a rather different horror film as rather than seeing characters die due to the actions of some horrific creature it is about the horrible things that are happening to somebody as he becomes the creature. That isn't to say that there is nothing unpleasant happening to other people there are a couple of particularly unpleasant things that happen. The special effects are impressive; especially the way Brundle gradually transforms into Brundlefly. Jeff Goldblum does a fine job as Brundle managing to play him in a subtly different way either side of his transformation without being too obvious. He is ably supported by Geena Davis who does a great job as Veronica as she come to terms with what is happening to Brundle and feels pressured to teleport herself. John Getz also puts in an entertaining performance as Veronica's sleazy boss. Given that it is now over thirty years old it feels remarkably fresh; apart from Brundle's computer one feels it could have been made much more recently of course if that had been the case we'd have got CGI rather than the great physical effects. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans; just don't expect a large body count and do expect some fairly disgusting effects!",9,1,2,29 March 2017
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray has a bad day over and over again
","Pittsburgh Weatherman Phil Connors is not overjoyed when he is once again sent to observe the Groundhog Day festivities in the town of Punxsutawney. He goes there the day before with his producer, Rita, and cameraman Larry then heads to the bed and breakfast he is staying at. He wakes at 6am and heads to the site of the ceremony where Phil, the groundhog, is due to predict whether or not winter is over. After a half-hearted report they have something to eat before setting off home only to be forced back by a blizzard that Phil and said was certain to miss the area. Unable to continue he returns to the B&B. The next morning he gets a sense of deja vu it would appear that it is Groundhog Day again. This doesn't just happen once; for Phil Groundhog day keeps repeating although nobody else is aware of this. He soon realises that this means he can do anything he likes without consequences if he goes to jail or even dies he will still wake up at 6am on Groundhog Day. Eventually he decides to use the repeating day to better himself as he tries to woo Rita.On the face of it this is just a rom-com with a twist but thanks to Bill Murray's performance as Phil it is so much more; few actors can do cynical as well as he does. He does a fantastic job portraying Phil's reaction to what is happening; confusion, reckless elation, frustration, depression and finally acceptance and even happiness. At first it is a little hard to like his character as he uses the repeating days to learn more about Rita with the sole intention of getting her into bed that night but gradually he improves and becomes a better person a bit cliché perhaps but it was enjoyable to watch. He gets solid support from Andie MacDowell as Rita and Chris Elliott as Larry, the rest of the cast were pretty good too. There is little here to offend although some might not want younger viewers seeing his suicide attempts; particularly when he drops a toaster into his bath with no lasting consequence. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody wanting a good comedy.",9,1,3,13 September 2016
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's bloody introduction
","Set in the aftermath of a heist that went horribly wrong the surviving gangsters head to the meet-up point in a warehouse. The first two to arrive are 'Mr White' and the seriously injured 'Mr Orange'. Shortly afterwards they are joined by 'Mr Pink' who is convinced that everything went wrong because somebody must have informed the police in advance. He is also far from impressed by 'Mr Blonde's' behaviour during the robbery as he shot several people. Mr Blonde is the next to arrive; along with a policeman he has taken hostage. As we wait for Joe Cabot, the man behind the heist, to arrive the tension rises as they try to find out who told the police. Inevitably they start to turn on each other and eventually guns are drawn.While all this is going on we get a series of flashbacks giving us details of how things got to how they are now. This includes seeing the aftermath of the robbery as they have a shootout with the police and Mr Orange gets shot. We also learn why they have colour coded names.This film certainly won't be for everybody; the violence is brutal and bloody rather than stylised. One scene, where the police officer has his ear cut off, has gone down as one of cinema's most violent moments even though the actual event happens off camera. There is also a lot of swearing and characters use racist epitaphs. If all that doesn't but you off this is a great film; it is tense from start to finish and contains some great dialogue. Before this it was rare for anybody in films to talk about anything unrelated to the plot but here we see the characters having irrelevant conversations that make the characters more real. Tarantino gives the film a great look by having the gangsters dress identically in black suits and ties while a seventies soundtrack plays in the background; this music is cleverly justified by having the local radio station having a 'Sounds of the Seventies' week. The cast are all on top form; Michael Madsen is particularly memorable as the sadistic 'Mr Blonde'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoys heist movies just don't expect a jolly caper.",9,0,2,29 September 2016
How to Train Your Dragon," An exciting and amusing animation
",Hiccup; Is a young Viking living on the island of Berk; he dreams of fighting dragons like the other Vikings; unfortunately he isn't muscular or talented in that field much to his father's disappointment. One day during a dragon attack he tries to join in with a home made device. He claims to have hit a dreaded night-fury dragon but nobody believes him why would they; nobody has ever killed or even clearly seen a night-fury. The next day he goes out and finds the downed night-fury; he intended to kill it but when he can't as the dragon doesn't appear to be dangerous. He dubs the creature Toothless and gradually befriends it. When he attends dragon fighting school he uses the skills he has learnt dealing with Toothless to come top of the class. While showing Toothless to classmate Astrid they go on a flight that takes them to the dragons' nest where a huge dragon resides. When Hiccup's father learns this he takes Toothless captive and uses him to find the nest unfortunately he has bitten off more than he can chew and he will have to rely on Hiccup and his class to save the day using Hiccup's new dragon-friendly techniques.Dreamworks' animations have a reputation for being over-filled with pop culture references and jokes that are aimed squarely at the older viewer; thankfully that isn't the case here; there are one or two moments that could have been nods to other films but nothing that requires the viewer to have a knowledge of other films to enjoy this. The story is enjoyably and the characters are a lot of fun. The animation looked good and in the action scenes it was quite spectacular as Hiccup and Toothless swoop through sea stacks and when the huge dragon appears to set the sky ablaze. Some of the action may be a little scary for younger children but I'm sure older children will really enjoy this and plenty of adults will too.,9,0,0,7 January 2013
Total Recall," Arnie has an adventure on Mars
","In the year 2084 protagonist Douglas Quaid is apparently an ordinary construction worker but he has recurring dreams about events on Mars involving a woman who is not his wife. He has no idea why he has the dreams; he has never stepped foot on Mars and has not met the woman or so he thinks. One day he decides to visit 'Rekall'; a company that implants the memories of a perfect holiday. Naturally he selects a holiday on Mars during which he will have a fantasy adventure as a secret agent. As the procedure starts something goes wrong and he starts ranting about having really been to Mars and how his life is in danger. He flees and is chased by people determined to kill him. He gets home and learns that his wife isn't the person he thought she was apparently his whole life up to this point is a false memory. Managing to evade his captors he heads to Mars to discover the truth. Here he meets the woman from his dreams, gets involved in a rebellion against the tyrannical authorities and learns of a plot to hide the discovery of alien technology but is it real or has something gone horribly wrong at Rekall?This sci-fi classic is a lot of fun. As one would expect from a film that is an adaption of a story from the pen of Philip K. Dick there are plenty of twists and questions about the identity of our protagonist. Equally expected, given that it is directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a fair amount of bloody violence when I first saw it in the cinema I thought it was possibly the most violent film I'd seen! The story could easily have become confusing as the viewer wonders whether what is real but thankfully it manages to avoid confusion; what we are shown always appears to be real even if we later learn that not everybody is quite who they appear to be; an example of this is Quaid's 'wife'; at first it appears they have been happily married for years than it emerges she met him six months ago. The film looks great with impressive special effects and locations that have a futuristic feel. The cast is impressive; Arnold Schwarzenegger is in great form as Quaid and Rachel Ticotin is solid as his 'dream girl' Melina. A film like this needs good bad guys; Michael Ironside is great as Richter, the man hunting Quaid and Sharon Stone is suitably ambiguous as Quaid's 'wife'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoys solid action and a good story if you are a fan of Arnie it is a must see.",8,6,9,22 December 2016
Limitless," Giving it 100%
","Life isn't going well for writer Eddie Morra; he hasn't written a single word of his new book, he is a total slob and unsurprisingly his girlfriend has just dumped him. Then he bumps into his ex-brother in law who gives him a pill, called NZT, which promises to enable him to use one hundred present of his brain's capability. He says he has no intention of taking it but inevitably he does and suddenly everything is crystal clear; that evening he sits down and writes several chapters of his book. In the morning he realises he must get more of the pills; he returns to see his ex-brother in law and agrees to run a simple errand for him; when he returns the man is dead and the apartment has been ransacked they killers didn't find the NZT but Eddie does. Taking the pills he soon finishes his book and gets back with his girlfriend. That isn't all though; his ability enables him to play the markets with money borrowed from a Russian gangster. Making a rapid fortune he starts to attract attention; not all of it welcome. Other people want the pills and will kill to get them and he learns that just stopping taking them isn't an option as other users are dead or dying now the supply is over.This is a pretty solid thriller; the pill and its effects are obviously science fiction but it isn't really a sci-fi thriller. Bradley Cooper does a good job as Eddie; it is very much his film; everybody else is very much in a supporting role. Most notably of the supporting cast it Robert DeNiro is great as Carl Van Loon, the financier Eddie gets involved with. Abbie Cornish is fine as his girlfriend although her character doesn't get as much screen time as one might expect. The way the film opens leads us to believe Eddie will meet a sticky end on the pavement below his apartment but that doesn't decrease the tension in scenes set elsewhere. For the most part there is nothing disturbing but one fight does include some wince inducing moments! The effect used to show the effect of the drug is very effective. There are some flaws of course; he took an awfully long time to start trying to establish a new supply of NZT given how smart it made him and was shockingly negligent about dealing with those who were after him still the drama would have suffered if he was too successful. Overall I really enjoyed this; I vaguely recall it getting fairly average revues when it came out but so that proved a nice surprise.",8,1,2,18 December 2014
Rocky," A classic underdog story
","Rocky Balboa is a Philadelphia boxer whose career in the ring appears to be going nowhere. Apollo Creed is the heavyweight champion of world who is due to face his next challenger in a fight in Philadelphia but with a matter of weeks to go the challenger is forced to pull out. Not wanting to abandon the bout Creed decides to give a local boy a shot at the title... that local boy is Rocky. At this point Rocky is working as muscle for a local loan shark and trying to get his friend Paulie's sister, Adrian, to go out with him. He doesn't think he has any real chance in the fight but trains hard in the hope that when the day of the fight comes he can at least last the fifteen rounds.'Rocky' is always going to be considered one of the great boxing movies but it is so much more than that. It is a character study of a man whose life was never going to go anywhere till he gets that once in a lifetime chance. He grabs that chance and despite his doubts he sees it through to the end. Just as important as his boxing is the way his relationship with Adrian develops; it feels natural and avoids many of the expected clichÃ©s. His other relationships are also believable as the characters feel real rather than the usual Hollywood types. Sylvester Stallone does an impressive job in the title role but impresses even more for writing the story and getting the film we see made. The rest of the cast is solid; most notably Talia Shire, who is a delight as Adrian; Carl Weathers, who plays Apollo; Burt Young, as Paulie; and Burgess Meredith as trainer/manager Mickey. While the fight scenes are only a small part of the film they are pretty well choreographed even if it is occasionally obvious that punches aren't really connecting... they are close enough. Overall I'd recommend this to all film fans even if you don't like boxing; it is about characters not the sport.",9,0,0,29 November 2019
Sicario," A tense look at the drugs war on America's southern border
","Kate Macer is an FBI agent who is part of an anti-kidnap squad but after taking part in a raid that leads to the discovery of dozens of bodies, victims of a drug cartel, she finds herself seconded to a specialist task force that is targeting the cartel. This task force is led Matt Graver, a CIA operative and includes Alejandro Gillick, a Mexican former prosecutor with shadowy motives, and several members of Special Forces. She quickly starts to wonder what she has got herself into. On her first day they cross into Mexico to extradite a senior cartel member; an operation that ends with a shootout on a highway just north of the border. This man gives information that leads to the location of a cartel tunnel under the border as well as cartel bank accounts. The real plan then becomes clear; the hope is that by creating such chaos for the cartels will recall their senior man in the US and he can be tracked to the cartel's leader.This is a tense thriller that had me gripped from start to finish; it is not a feel-good film though. Apart from Agent Macer and her FBI partner there are no really good characters; Graver and Gillick are morally questionable as it emerges that Macer is only really there to rubber stamp operations that would otherwise be illegal. This doesn't mean we can't sympathise with them as we see the brutality of the cartels the sight of numerous bodies hidden in the walls of a house and hanging from a bridge in Juárez is quite disturbing. The action is restricted to a few brief moments but when it happens it is sudden, intense and feels real. The cast to a great job; Emily Blunt is a convincing lead as Kate Macer and Josh Brolin impresses as Graver however it is Benicio del Toro who stands out as Gillick, a character who's loyalty is far from obvious. Director Denis Villeneuve does a fine job making it all feel very real. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who wants a really tense thriller without a blank and white morality.",9,0,0,31 May 2017
Departures," I laughed, I cried, I loved it
","When the orchestra cellist Daigo Kobayashi is in is disbanded he moves back to his home town of Sakata to live in the house he inherited off his late mother. Needed a job he sees a rather cryptic advertisement in the paper offering a job dealing with 'departures' he assumes it must be something to do with travel but it was a misprint; he will be dealing with the departed! He hasn't even seen a dead body before but gets the job; he will be the assistant to a man who performs the ritual preparation of the dead body. Unlike in the west where the body is prepared behind closed doors this preparation that involves cleaning and dressing the deceased is done in front of the family. He feels unable to tell his wife that he is working with the dead and when she finds out she has difficulty handling it and returns to Tokyo hoping he will resign. He realises that he is doing an important job though and continues. I won't spoil the rest of the film but will say that by the end I was smiling and crying at the same time.I recorded this film when it was on television and finally got around to watching it; given the subject matter I though I'd have to be in the right mood to watch it. I was surprised just how much I enjoyed it; the rituals may have been alien to me but it was handled in a way that both taught me something new about Japanese culture and provided a very moving story. Daigo and his boss Ikuei Sasaki show the utmost respect for the deceased and their relatives unlike one pair of undertakers we see later in the film. Masahiro Motoki and Tsutomu Yamazaki did great jobs bringing real humanity to the roles of Daigo and Ikuei, Ryôko Hirosue also put in a fine performance as Daigo's wife Mika. Don't be put off by the subject matter; give this film a go if you want something gentle but genuinely moving.",9,0,0,5 March 2012
Pretty Woman," Once upon a time in LA a wealthy businessman asked a prostitute for directions
","For Edward Lewis business is everything; he makes a fortune buying struggling businesses and then selling their component parts for far more than he paid, Vivian Ward is a prostitute who plies her trade on Hollywood Boulevard neither of them expected their lives to change when he stopped to ask the way to his hotel in Beverly Hills. He isn't looking for company but she offers to show him the way there for $20; they get chatting and he asks her to spend the night. That would have been the end of their relationship but Edward's lawyer tells him he should bring a date to a dinner meeting with a businessman whose company Edward is trying to buy. He hires Vivian for the week; to make her look the part he tells her to get the right clothes and after some problems with snobbish sales assistants the two of them spend some serious money at another store. Over the course of the week they inevitably grow feelings for each other but that isn't all; Vivian seems to be softening Edward's business attitudes too.This is very much a wish fulfilment story; Vivian is a latter day Cinderella and Edward is her Prince Charming the story isn't never likely but that doesn't stop it being a lot of fun. Early on it looks as if the story might be dark as Vivian walks past a location where the police are dealing with a dead prostitute but after that things are much lighter; even characters who try to be threatening aren't that menacing; the only real exception to that is Edward's lawyer who, upon learning of Vivian's profession, thinks he can have her too. Richard Gere does an impressive job as Edward and Julia Roberts is delightful as Vivian even if she is far more believable in the fine attire Edward bought her than the street clothes she is wearing when they meet. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Most of the characters are likable and those that aren't get what is coming to them and the ending is pretty much what most viewers would expect cliché perhaps but still enjoyable. Overall I'd recommend this if you want some light-hearted if unlikely romance.",8,0,1,11 December 2016
The Descent," Watch this in the dark
","I probably wouldn't have bought this but when I saw it in the bargain section I recalled it getting a good review on the radio. I'm glad I did get it as it was thoroughly entertaining throughout.In the introductory scene we see the group of women white water rafting in Scotland, then as one of them going home with her husband and child they have a head on collision which leaves her in hospital and her family dead.The next time we see them they are meeting up in America for a caving expedition under the Appalachian mountains. After a night in the cabin where we get to know the characters a bit they head into the caves and we are plunged in to a claustrophobic underworld. Soon after arriving they are cut off from the way they entered by a rockfall and they learn that the one who organised the trip decided to go into an unexplored cave system rather than the one in the guide book. As they go deeper into the caves the tension continues to mount. After going for some time they realise they aren't alone but the caves are inhabited by fierce humanoid creatures which rather reminded me of the subterranean Morlocks from H. G. Well's 'Time Machine'; creatures that were once human but have long since adapted to a life underground. It is then a fight for survival against the crawlers and in some cases against each other.To full appreciate this film one really has to watch it in the dark and preferably alone. I was scared as soon as things went wrong in the caves, long before we learnt that they weren't alone, that feeling didn't go away till the end credits were rolling. There is a fair bit of gore but I don't think it was over done nor was it sadistic. Over all I think this film is just the thing to watch if you want a good scare, just don't watch this if you plan to go caving any time soon.",9,1,3,10 July 2008
Some Like It Hot," Still fresh after almost sixty years
","Opening in 1929 in Chicago musicians Joe and Jerry witness a mob assassination, committed by Spats Colombo, so have to go on the run. There are jobs with a band that is heading to Miami... there is just one catch; they are all girls. By the time the train is ready to head south Joe and Jerry have become Josephine and Daphne. On the journey they get to know the other girls and as Joe talks to singer Sugar and learns how she hopes to meet a bespectacled millionaire with a yacht rather than the usual succession on no-good saxophone players (Joe plays the Sax). Once in Miami sets about becoming just that man while a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III, is attracted to Jerry's 'Daphne'! If that weren't enough Spats is in in town for a mob conference.This film may be in black and white and almost sixty years old but don't let that put you off; it is still fresh and very funny. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great as 'Josephine' and 'Daphne'; they may not be the most beautiful of women but they do at least look feminine enough that one can believe they would be mistaken for women. Marilyn Monroe is on top form as Sugar; particularly in the scenes were she is wooed by Joe's 'Shell Oil Jnr' persona. The laughs come thick and fast combining elements of farce and slapstick. One might worry that 'fifties morality' would be a problem but the attitudes are far more modern than one might expect. Overall I'd definitely say this film is a must see.",10,2,2,29 November 2018
Inside Man," A rather unusual bank robbery
","As the film opens we see a man in what appears to be a cell; explains to us that his name is Dalton Russell and he has just executed the perfect bank robbery. Immediately questions are raised; most importantly being; if it was the perfect robbery why is he in a cell? The action then jumps back to the start of the robbery; a small group of robbers all identically dressed with masks and hoods enter the bank and disable the cameras, chain the doors, toss a few smoke grenades and take the employees and customers hostage. A passing cop notices the smoke and starts to call in that he suspects as robbery is taking place; before he can finish the call an armed man emerges and tells him hostages will start dying if the police attempt to enter the bank. Back inside the robbers confiscate all phones and keys before ordering everybody to undress and change into clothes identical to the ones they are wearing. Inevitably the police turn up in force and set up a command centre; although he is not the senior officer Detective Keith Frazier takes charge as he is the hostage negotiator. He waits for their demands and eventually they receive the cliché demand of buses to the airport and a fuelled jet... a little disappointing perhaps but may be the robbers just want to buy time to do what they really want to do. While Det. Frazer tries to figure out what they really want the bank's owner and founder, Arthur Case, brings in a specialist, Madeleine White, to ensure that whatever happens neither the robbers nor the authorities learn the contents of one safety deposit box inside the vault... the box the robbers when straight to.Before watching this all I knew about the film was that it was a heist film with 'more twists than a Chubby Checker record'; but as nearly everything has to have a twist these days I thought it would be a typical heist film. Thankfully it was far more interesting than that; I was grabbed in the opening scenes and was constantly wondering just how it would end. While some twists weren't shocking the final, most important one was. The acting from all the leads; Denzel Washington, as Frazer; Clive Owen, as Russell; Jodie Foster, as White and Christopher Plummer as Case put in top notch performances and were able supported by the likes of Willem Defoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The scenes in the bank were not surprisingly the most interesting; seeing how the robbers not only kept the hostages confused but even managed to convince enough of the hostages that they were fellow hostages for it to be impossible for them to be identified when everybody eventually left the building. Director Spike Lee did a fine job keeping the story going and introduced the various twists in ways that didn't seem forced even in the rather amusing situation where detectives discover just who they are listening to on their bugs. If you want a good solid crime thriller with genuinely surprising twists this is well worth checking out.",9,1,2,20 June 2012
Pulp Fiction," A slice of LA gangster life
","This film from Quentin Tarantino tells the intertwining stories of a couple of gangsters, their boss's wife, Mia, and a boxer who is meant to throw a fight. There is little in the way of plot; we just observe their lives for a few days. The two gangsters are Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield and they work for Marsellus Wallace; early on Vincent and Jules discuss an incident where Marsellus threw another man out of a fourth floor window for allegedly giving his wife a foot massage something that makes Vincent nervous as Marsellus has asked him to take Mia out for the night while he is out of town. The evening goes well until they get back to Mia's house and she overdoses on Vincent's heroin while he is in the bathroom. The second story follows Butch the boxer who rather than throwing a fight for Marsellus beats his opponent to death. He knows he has to get out of town but first he must return home to retrieve his watch that has been in the family for generation. This puts him in a dangerous place when he bumps into Marsellus. Finally we see events that took place earlier after Vincent accidentally shoots somebody in a car and he and Jules have to get some help from 'The Wolf'.As I said earlier this isn't about plot; that isn't to say nothing happens though quite the opposite. There is a decent amount of action; some of it sudden and shocking as well as great characters. It is these characters that the film is really about. The cast does a fine job; most notably John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson who are on top form as Vincent and Jules; Uma Thurman is also impressive as Mia Wallace as is Ving Rhames as her husband. Bruce Willis does a fine job as Butch and Harvey Keitel puts in a memorable performance as 'The Wolf'. The non-linear way the story is told isn't confusing; I rather liked how the opening and ending scenes were concerned with the same event and chronologically took place in the middle of the story. Quentin Tarantino's dialogue is realistic but cool; I liked how the characters talked about mundane things; it made them feel far more real than if they had only talked about things relevant to the plot as characters in most films do. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; it is gripping, full of great characters and dialogue and contains many unforgettable scenes it does however contain material that will offend many people; most notably a lot of swearing and liberal use of 'The N-Word' as well as some shocking moments.",9,1,4,16 August 2016
Jack Reacher," A gripping thriller
","When a sniper kills five apparently random people the police quickly arrest ex-army sniper James Barr; the evidence against him seems conclusive however we know he did not do it! During his interview he says nothing but eventually writes 'Get Jack Reacher'. The authorities have no idea how to find the former army investigator but he soon finds them and initially he is convinced of Barr's guilt he has done it before in Iraq but got away with it. Reacher isn't keen to get involved but is eventually agrees help Barr's attorney, Helen Rodin, examine the evidence. Things soon convince him that Barr didn't do it; the evidence is just too good, Barr was never that good a shot and most importantly somebody is trying to block his investigation. The more he investigates the more convinced he becomes that somebody in authority is involved possibly the District Attorney who just happens to be Helen's father.Having not read any of the 'Jack Reacher' books I can't say how close the film character is to the book character but judging solely by the film I found him to be a good protagonist; Tom Cruise did a fine job in the role. He is ably supported by Rosamund Pike as Helen; it was refreshing that their characters' relationship was purely professional and never looked like it might become a cliché romance. There is a good amount of action and a few twists along the way. Surprisingly, given that we see the killer in the opening scene, there is also a sense of mystery why did he do it? Why was Barr so perfectly framed? Who in authority is helping them? The action is nicely varied; we get fights, shootouts and a car chase and the story is interesting. The bad guys are suitably menacing; especially Werner Herzog's 'The Zec' in one scene he tells a failed underling that he will spare his life if he bites off the fingers of his left hand! There are some lighter moments; most notably a laugh out loud moment where too incompetent assailants attack Reacher in a bathroom. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody after a solid thriller with a good plot and obviously to fans of Tom Cruise.",9,0,1,27 July 2016
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A comedy of violent errors
","Friends Eddy, Tom, Soap, and Bacon are four small time crooks who have cobbled together £100,000 to enter a high stakes card game which they think will be easy; they don't realise it is rigged so afterwards they are left owing 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale half a million pounds and they only have a week to get it. By coincidence they live next door to some far more serious gangsters and over hear their plan to take money and cannabis off a bunch of ex-public school dope growers the boys decide to take the proceeds from these thieves. To do that the need guns so buy a couple of antique shotguns from a contact who got them from a couple of Scousers who'd committed a burglary for Hatchet Harry not knowing the guns were the real target of their job. When the jobs start happening things get bloody fast and the body count rapidly climbs.This, director Guy Richie's film debut, impressively intertwines several plot strands with a large cast of varied underworld types without getting confusing. There are plenty of exciting moments, a lot of violence and a good number of laughs. Sometimes all happening at once such as when a group of hardened criminals armed with shotguns and a Bren gun are pinned down by three posh boys armed with an air rifle! The film looks good with its slight sepia tint and the way it never needs to visit 'tourist London'. The dialogue is sharp and witty, although some may be confused by the slang at times! The characters are solid; all the main characters may be criminals but many of them are still likable, especially the four protagonists. Jason Statham, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng impress as Bacon, Soap, Eddy and Tom and the rest of the cast are solid too; the most notable of these is probably ex-footballer Vinnie Jones who proves that he can act rather than just being an example of novelty casting. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a mixture of violence and wit.",9,1,1,7 December 2017
Les Misérables," An impressive musical
","Based on the successful West End musical this film tells the story of Jean Valjean. In 1815 he is released from prison after serving nineteen years for the theft of a loaf of bread and trying to escape. As he is released prison guard Javert tells him that he will be on parole for the rest of his life and must always carry papers that list his crimes. Once out he tries to steal from a bishop but is caught... surprisingly the bishop gives him a second chance, telling the arresting officers that he'd given Valjean the stolen item. Given a second chance he destroys his papers and makes a new life.Eight years later he has become mayor of a town, where he runs a factory employing many people. Then one day a new police chief arrives; none other than Javert. Javert soon suspects him as the man who broke parole all those years before. While this is going on Fantine, a woman working in the factory, is fired by the foreman. She is forced into a life of prostitution to support her daughter, Cosette. Things go from bad to worse for her; she has a run-in with the law but is helped by Valjean; then, as she lies dying he promises to look after Cosette. Javert is now hard on his trail so he flees once more taking Cosette to Paris.Another nine years pass, Cosette has grown up and revolution is in the air. One revolutionary falls in love with Cosette and Valjean is concerned that he will lose her. Then Javert turns up again; still determined to arrest Valjean.I must state that I have neither seen the stage version nor read the book so can't say how this compares; however I can say that I enjoyed the film. The story is solid and while there is much tragedy there is also some humour, much of it provided by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen who are great as the dishonest couple who initially looked after Cosette then keep turning up like a couple of bad pennies. Hugh Jackman really impresses as protagonist Jean Valjean and Russell Crowe is equally solid as Javert... I'd heard his singing wasn't good but it sounded fine to me. The rest of the cast was solid; most notably Anne Hathaway, who picked up an Oscar for her portrayal of the doomed Fantine and Amanda Seyfried and Isabelle Allen who play the older and younger Cosette. The songs are good with some really stirring numbers. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; even if you aren't a fan of musicals the story is solid enough to make it worth watching.",9,2,5,2 January 2019
In Time," Time is money
","This sci-fi thriller is set in a future where people have been genetically engineered to stop aging when they reach the age of twenty five. After that they have one year left on a clock which displays how much time they have left. They can earn more time but everything they need to buy costs time. This means that the rich can live forever if they avoid danger but the poor don't live long at all. It is also frighteningly easy to steal time some any ghetto-dweller with more than a few days on their clock is likely to be robbed.The story starts with a wealthy man, with over a century left, going into a bar in a poor area and buying everybody a drink. Local man Will Salas warns him that he is likely to attract the wrong sort of attention and have all his remaining time stolen. It turns out that was his plan; not everybody wants to live forever. The two escape together and later on, as Will sleeps, he gives him almost all of his time before heading off to die. Will wakes but as he when he goes to share some of his luck with his mother he is too late; her clock runs out just before they meet. He determines to overthrow the system so uses his new found time to head to the rich area. Here he gains much more time in a poker game. The authorities have noticed his sudden increase in wealth, and suspect he must have stolen it, so the 'Time Keepers' are sent to arrest him. He manages to escape, taking Sylvia Weis, the daughter of one of the wealthiest men, with him. With the Time Keepers in pursuit they flee to the ghetto where most of their time is soon stolen. They must find a way to gain more before Will, with his new accessory, can set about destabilising the system. There are unexpected consequences though; as he gives time away thefts rise and not everybody can deal with their newfound wealth.This is an unusual thing; a dystopian sci-fi that is more thrilling that depressing. That isn't to say that the central premise isn't quite dark. The idea of time literally being money is quite dark; the poor are literally living day to day; if they don't get more they will die. Also they aren't depicted as the 'noble poor'; they are desperate and many will resort to theft or can't deal with unexpected wealth. Of course the rich come across as worse as they live potentially endless but boring lives at the expense of the poor. In this setting we get an exciting thriller; Justin Timberlake does a solid job as Will Salas and Amanda Seyfried is fun as Sylvia; the rich girl who joins his cause faster than you can say 'Patty Hearst'; they have a good chemistry. Cillian Murphy also impresses as the Time Keeper leading the operation to catch Salas. There is a fair amount of impressive action and there is plenty of tension as we can literally see peoples' final seconds ticking away. Overall I enjoyed this far more than I expected and would definitely recommend it to fans of the genre.",8,1,2,4 July 2017
Three Colors: Blue," Three Colours: Blue
","This, the first part of a thematically linked trilogy of films inspired by the French flag and its motto 'Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity', is centred on Julie. In the opening scene she loses her husband and daughter in a car crash. After leaving hospital she decides to make a break from her old life; she moves into a new apartment and disposes of most of her possessions, including her composer husband's unfinished masterpiece. She tries to avoid making connections but inevitable she gets involved with new people and reconnects with people from her past who search for her.Director Krzysztof Kieslowski does a fine job bringing this story about how one woman deals with loss to the screen. It isn't about visible grief but the numbness that leads Julie to try to isolate herself and move away from her old life. The blue motif is used to fine effect throughout the film; whether it is the pool Julie swims in or the blue ornament in her flat, one of the few things she kept from her old life. Juliette Binoche, who is rarely off screen, does a brilliant job in the lead role; making the viewer believe in Julie's situation. The story plays out well with as it depicts Julie's gradual coming to terms with what happens. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy 'art house cinema' then this is definitely one to watch.",9,1,1,25 April 2019
The Happening," A great set-up sadly wasted
","Something strange is happening in the city of New York; suddenly people I Central Park started acting strangely then a woman suddenly kills herself with a large hairpin. It isn't long before people across the city are killing themselves; workers jump from a tall building, a policeman shoots himself then others pick up his sidearm and do the same. It is assumed that it must be some strange terrorist attack and an evacuation is ordered. The film follows three people caught up in the event; science teacher Elliot Moore, his wife Alma and Jess, the young daughter of one of Elliot's friends. They manage to get a train heading to Philadelphia but it stops in a small town when what happened in New York starts happening in Philadelphia. Soon reports come suggesting that there have been outbreaks of suicides in smaller and smaller communities. Somebody suggests that far from being a terrorist attack it is actually caused by a chemical being deliberately released by plants!The opening scenes of this film led me to believe that perhaps the negative reports I'd heard were a little unfair; the outbreak of mass suicide was a little disturbing and very bizarre unfortunately what followed didn't live up to this opening. It felt like M. Night Shyamalan was trying to make a film like 'The Birds' with trees as the threat unfortunately rustling trees aren't as scary as the sight of large birds attacking people. Some of the later suicides were more comic than disturbing; a woman shows everybody a video clip her mother forwarded depicting a man feeding himself to the lions in a zoo; after they rip off one arm he offers them the other I was half expecting him to carry on like the Black Knight in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'! Later another man lies down in front of his lawnmower. Stars Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel do a decent enough job but they have both been better in other films. The ending is fairly sudden and a bit of a let-down. Overall I'd say this isn't a terrible film but one can't help feeling it could have been so much better; it is worth watching once if only for the unintended laughs.",5,1,1,4 October 2015
Castle in the Sky," Another great film from Miyazaki
","This is the first film to be made by Japan's Studio Ghibli and as one would expect from that studio it is an excellent film. The animation is of a very high standard and Joe Hisaishi's music fits the movie very well.The film follows the adventures of Sheeta and Pazu as they search for the titular Laputa. In the opening scenes airborne pirates attack an airship that a young girl (Sheeta) is travelling on as a prisoner of Muska, who appears to be an agent of the government. During the confusion Sheeta manages to escape but while fleeing slips and falls from the airship. As she falls the crystal on her pendant starts to glow and instead of plummeting to her death she slowly drifts to earth where she is caught be a Pazu, a boy about her age.The two of them soon end up on the run from both the pirates and the military. When captured by Muska Pazu is let go and told to forget about Sheeta but can't. When he gets home and finds the pirates already there he joins forces with them as they want Sheeta as she can help them find Laputa, which they believe to be full of treasure. Meanwhile Sheeta says a spell which she was taught as a child and her pendent glows and points a beam of light towards Laputa. It also awakens a giant robot, which had fallen from the sky some time before, it proceeds to escape from the castle basement in which it is stored and help free Sheeta. She is then reunited with Pazu and the pirates and they race against Muska to get to Laputa.That is just a brief summary, I don't wish to say how it ends. The film is exciting though out and should be ideal both for children and who want an exciting story that is well told without excessive violence. Some scenes may be a little frightening for younger children but for the most part it is just exciting. As with most of Hayao Miyazaki's films there are plenty of thrilling flying sequences as well as a chase involving a train and a car on an elevated railway line.The only parts I wasn't so keen on were a couple of scenes that seemed somewhat cartoony such as when two characters flexed their muscles and burst of of their shirts in a way that reminded me of 'The Incredible Hulk', that said I'm sure it would amuse younger viewers so I can't really hold it against the film. I think it says something about the quality of the animation and the story that such a detail would stand out, after all it is an animated film.I watched the film in Japanese with English subtitles so can't comment on the quality of the English dub.",9,2,2,3 May 2008
The Shape of Water," A cold war fairy tale
","It is the early sixties and protagonist Elisa Esposito works as a cleaner in a secret government facility in Baltimore. We learn that as a baby she was found by a river bank with wounds to her neck that rendered her a lifelong mute, she can hear but speaks using sign language. One day a Colonel Strickland turns up at the facility with a creature he caught in the Amazon. It is humanoid but aquatic and apparently the native population believed it to be a god. It is believed that study of this creature could give America a lead in the ongoing space race. Strickland treats it cruelly and after it turns on him Eliza and her friend Zelda are told to clean the lab. After that she gradually befriends the creature. Then it is decided that the creature should be dissected... she decides to save it. In a subplot it emerges that one of the scientists is actually a Soviet spy; with orders to discover what he can but more importantly to prevent the Americans learning anything.Those familiar with writer/director Guillermo del Toro's work, particularly 'Pan's Labyrinth' won't be surprised that this film is, at heart, a fairy tale. Like most fairy tales it is also a morality tale. Those from groups considered lesser; the disabled, Eliza; Blacks, Zelda; and homosexuals, Eliza's friend Giles are looked down on... and this ignored and unsuspected. Similarly all-American Col Strickland is clearly the villain of the piece; he may not look it but he is the real monster not the aquatic creature he captured. The story blends genres with elements from classic creature-features, spy thrillers and love stories seamlessly blended; we even get a fantasy song and dance number. The cast is great; most notably Sally Hawkins who gives a stellar performance as Eliza. Doug Jones also stands out even though he was hidden under creature make up and doesn't speak; it is all in the way he moves. The way the story is shot was great; we get a stylised version of the sixties where most things seem to be an unpleasant shade of green. There are some scenes that be bother some viewers with violence, nudity and some sex although none of these are too strong. Overall I'd say that while this won't be for everybody fans of del Toro should definitely give it a go.",9,2,7,2 September 2019
The Untouchables," A fine gangster movie
","Set in prohibition era Chicago where gangster Al Capone lives the highlife with apparent impunity a new lawman, Treasury Agent Elliot Ness is brought in to clean up. He quickly learns that most of the local police can't be trusted so builds up his own small team. These include veteran beat cop Jimmy Malone, sharpshooting rookie George Stone and Oscar Wallace, a Treasury Department accountant who believes Capone can be brought down by examining his lack of tax payments. They quickly make progress, intercepting illicit alcohol and more importantly arresting somebody with information that could bring Capone down... this puts them in the sights of Capone's gunmen.This fictionalised version of how Elliot Ness brought down Al Capone is a lot of fun with great characters and some fairly gritty action. This action includes a young girl killed by a bomb and Capone killing somebody with a baseball bat as well as numerous shootings. The cast does a fine job with Kevin Costner putting in a relatively low-key performance as Ness which contrasts nicely Robert DeNiro's bombastic Capone. There are also notable performances from Sean Connery who is fun as Irish cop Malone despite his obviously Scottish accent. The story moves at a good pace and even though most viewers will know how it must end there are some shocks along the way. If you are a fan of the gangster genre this is definitely one to watch.",9,2,4,10 November 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Great action but a slightly confusing plot
",At the end of 'The Matrix' it looked as if Neo had done what needed to be done and saved the world; however the film was very successful so a sequel became inevitable. Set six months after the first film Neo is troubled by repeated dreams about Trinity dying and we learn that Morpheus is not the leader of the resistance but just part of it and those above him don't have the faith in the prophecies that he does. When the machines are detected heading towards Zion all ships are ordered to defend the city; Morpheus however argues that he must return to the Matrix with Neo as only he can save Zion. To do that he must find the Source of the Matrix... of course to do that he will have to find a succession of people and the three of them will have to confront more enemies than they have ever fought before.When I first watched this I was somewhat confused and disappointed but thankfully I gave it another go and enjoyed it far more. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in any film even if some of them do go on a little too long. The scenes within the Matrix are the most interesting as we learn more about its nature and that of some of the characters within it; unfortunately what happened in Zion was a bit of a disappointment; Morpheus's speech was a bit overblown and the dance scene seemed out of place when everybody was meant to be preparing for the final battle. The end comes quite suddenly and closes with the words 'To be concluded' so make sure you have 'The Matrix Revolutions' handy if you want to know how the story ends!,8,0,2,22 March 2012
Zombieland," A solid zom-com
","The Zombie Apocalypse has struck and a nerdy college student in Texas just wants to get home to Columbus, Ohio to see if his family survived. He soon meets up with a fellow survivor who firmly states 'no names' so they refer to each other by their home towns; Columbus and Tallahassee. They haven't been together to long when they meet sisters, 'Wichita' and 'Little Rock'... who relieve them of their transport and weapons! However they are soon reunited and end up heading to California together; constantly on the lookout for zombies.Horror comedy is a difficult balance to get right but I think this film pulls it off nicely. There are both gory moments and solid laughs right from the start as Columbus explains his main rules for survival; these flash up on the screen whenever they are applied. Once the situation and rules are explained the characters are introduced in a way that provides more laughs. The cast are solid; Jesse Eisenberg as the slightly nerdy Columbus; Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee and Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as the sisters who were grifting before the zombies took over. As well as individual funny scenes there is a good running joke about Tallahassee's search for a Twinkie bar and a great surprise cameo. If there is a weakness it is that we go quite a while between zombie encounters in the middle section of the film... at least there are plenty for the finale. Of course there are plot holes but if they'd just stocked up on food and driven to the middle of nowhere rather than heading to a major population centre it would have been a pretty boring film! Overall I'd recommend this for fans of zombie comedy; it may not be as funny as 'Shaun of the Dead' or as gory as 'Dead Snow' but it is still well worth watching.",8,0,2,9 December 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," A timeless classic
","This classic film opens with the voices of various people praying for George Bailey; it is clear that their prayers will be answered when voices in the heavens discuss how to help him. Angel Clarence will be assigned to save George but first Clarence, and the audience, must see how George came to be considering suicide. As a child George Bailey dreamt of getting out of the small town of Bedford Falls; he wanted to see the world, get an education then make his mark on the world. It wasn't to be though; he constantly sacrifices his dreams to help others. This leaves him stuck in the town running the savings and loan company that his father ran. It isn't a job he wanted but he does it anyway giving loans to people nobody else will help. This makes him popular with everybody apart from the miserly Mr. Potter who doesn't like to see the people who were paying him to rent slums buying their own houses. The years pass and George gets married and has children; he isn't rich but he is content; then one day Potter gets the opportunity to ruin George; thinking the only way he can help his family is to kill himself for the insurance we get to the point the film started. As he hits the depth of despair Clarence appears in his life and showed him just what the town would have been like if George had never been born; a miserably place full of bitter people lorded over by the odious Potter. When George returns he understands what good friends he has.I'd obviously heard of this film a long time ago but had somehow never seen it until today. I knew the film was considered a classic and think James Stewart was a fine actor so I had to watch it when it was on television. Now that I have seen it I ban see why it is held in such high regard. I was a little put off by the opening but once we started seeing George's life from the time he saved his brother's life when he was twelve till the very end I was engrossed. Stewart did a great job as George; the man destined to miss out on his dream each time it looked as though it would come true... even the moment he was about to go away on his honeymoon was ruined meaning he couldn't go. It isn't all disappointment though; there are many joyful scenes as George helps various people and falls in love and then marries Mary Hatch. By the end it is likely that the viewer will have shed tears of both sorrow and joy. If you haven't seen it yet watch it the next chance you get and if you have seen it I'm sure you don't need anybody else to tell you how good it is!",10,1,4,10 February 2013
Enemy at the Gates," Snipers in Stalingrad
","I didn't know much about this film before I watched it other than it was about two snipers playing cat and mouse during the Battle of Stalingrad. While that is correct as a very basic summary it doesn't do justice to the excellent film set in a part of the war rarely featured in movies that tend to concentrate on engagements involving Commonwealth or US forces.The film follows Vassili Zaitsev, a young soldier played by Jude Law, as he goes to Stalingrad and it thrown into battle without even a rifle, he is just told to take one from his comrades when they are killed. After the battle he hides in a fountain where he meets political officer Danilov. Danilov wants to shoot the Germans who are in a nearby ruined building but can't do it so gives the rifle to Vassili who dispatches five of them without them returning a single shot. The political officer sees that Vassili can be used as a propaganda tool, both to inspire other Soviets and to demoralise the Germans. As he kills more and more senior Germans he does indeed become a hero and the Germans send their top sniper to Stalingrad to kill him. What follows is a cat and mouse game where each tries to lure the other into a trap so that they can kill them.In the background to this action there is a love story between Vassili and a female soldier called Tania, the situation is complicated by the fact that Danilov also fancies her and as she can speak German he gets her transferred to his department.The story is well told and exciting with great performance from Jude Law, Ed Harris (German sniper Erwin König), Rachel Weisz (Tania) and Joseph Fiennes (Danilov). While the love story wasn't strictly necessary it didn't distract from the main story and was well executed. While it only tells one small story amongst one of the largest battles of the Second World War it is still a film that most fans of war films will enjoy.",8,1,3,19 January 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A rom-com with automatic weapons!
",John and Jane Smith have been married for five or six years and there marriage is going through a bit of a rough patch the events that follow will either bring them back together or kill them! Each of them thinks the other has an ordinary job but in fact they each work as assassins for rival organisations; when they get sent after the same target there is bound to be trouble. They end up shooting at each other and the target gets away; believing they could be identified each is given forty eight hours to kill the other. At this point they don't realise who the rival assassin was but when they find out they quickly stop trusting each other and start trying to shoot each other! After shooting up the house they realise that they genuinely love each other; the problem is now both their organisations are using all their resources to eliminate Mr and Mrs Smith!.While this isn't a classic film it is rather fun in a very silly way. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do well in the leading roles even though they have both been better in other films. The story is of course preposterous but if you can suspend your disbelief and but your brain in neutral it is worth watching. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and the action is fairly intense without any gore or real unpleasantness the final shoot out manages to be action packed and hilarious at the same time! Over all I'd say this is definitely worth watching if it is on television or if the DVD is in the bargain bin.,7,2,3,13 December 2012
The Departed," An impressive remake of the Hong Kong film trilogy 'Infernal Affairs'
","Set in Boston this film follows two men who go deep undercover; a rookie Massachusetts State Trooper, Billy Costigan, who is placed within Francis 'Frank' Costello's Irish mob and Colin Sullivan, a member of Costello's organisation who entered the State Police so he could feed information back to Costello. Neither man knows the other's identity but they both know that there are moles and that they could be exposed at any time. As time passes Costello gets more and more paranoid about the identity of the mole in his organisation.The basic plot of this film isn't that complicated but the story is still gripping. There is a constant threat that Costigan could be exposed and killed which keeps the tension high. This is emphasised by the fact that we are shown what happens to anybody who crosses Costigan. The cast is full of well-known stars but doesn't feel like a typical 'all-star' production; we get good solid characters. Most notable amongst the cast are Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon who play Costigan and Sullivan respectively. There is also an impressive performance as Costello as well as fine performances from the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga and Alec Baldwin. As one would expect from a Martin Scorsese gangster film there is a fair amount of violence but it isn't gratuitous, not is it dwelt on excessively. The only real weak spot of the story was the romance between Sullivan and police psychiatrist Dr. Madolyn Madden who goes on to have an affair with Costigan; a little unlikely given that the latter was her patient. Overall though I thought this was an impressive film; fans of gangster and police films should enjoy it.",9,1,3,6 July 2016
Die Hard," Nothing says Christmas like a skyscraper full of terrorists!
","When New York detective John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife who works for a large Japanese company he is expecting a fairly quiet time he certainly doesn't expect the party celebrating the opening of the company's brand new skyscraper to be gate-crashed by a dozen or more heavily armed terrorists lead by a German called Hans Gruber! Luckily when they strike he is away from the party in his wife's office so he is able to lead a one man fight back. Once he has managed to kill one of the terrorists he can use his radio to try to contact the local police although they don't seem to believe him until a body comes crashing through the windscreen of Sgt. Al Powell's squad car! He becomes McClane's contact as the situation intensifies as first the LAPD then the FBI attempt to deal with Hans and his gang. It is soon clear that Hans has anticipated the responses of everybody except McClane so it is up to him to thwart their plans.The eighties were a decade packed with great action movies; a decade where action meant fights, bullets and plenty of explosions all accompanied by a few witty one-liners rather than excessive CGI and this is one of the best examples of an '80s action film. Bruce Willis was on top form as John McClane and Alan Rickman was delightfully over the top as Hans Gruber, Reginald VelJohnson also does a decent job as Sgt. Powell. As well as the almost non-stop action there some laughs to be had although they never feel forced. If you like '80s action films then you really need to watch this and if you've seen it already; watch it again!",10,2,4,12 December 2011
Psycho," An unforgettable masterpiece
","Marion Crane works for an estate agent in Phoenix; one Friday afternoon a client pays $40,000 in cash for a property and her boss ask to take it for the bank as he doesn't want it in the office over the weekend. Rather than going to the bank she sets off to California. It is a long journey and after spending one night in her car, after she is woken by a suspicious police officer she buys a new car. Then, as it starts to rain, she leaves the main road and stops at a remote motel for the night. The motel is run by Norman Bates who tells her that he lives in the neighbouring house with his aged mother. He appears to be friendly as he offers to make her something for supper. She hears his mother expressing her disapproval of him being alone with a young woman before she has her supper in the office. The then returns to her room and prepares for bed. Now things get creepy; Norman takes a picture off the wall and uses a spy hole to observe Marion as she gets undressed. Then as she takes a shower somebody enters her room and brutally murders her. Soon people are starting to wonder what happened to her and the $40,000. Her boss has sent a private detective to find her and her sister goes to see her boyfriend, who has no idea where she is. The detective checks a string of motels before finding that she stayed at the Bates motel. As the story progresses we learn more about Norman and his mother all leading to one of cinema's most shocking conclusions.This film is rightly considered a classic; I would love to have watched it without knowing about what happened. For the first half of the film follows Marion Crane, setting her up as the protagonist; everybody else we see, including Norman Bates, appears to be very much secondary characters so anybody lucky enough not to know the film's first famous twist should be genuinely surprised. Until her death it looks as though the film would centre on whether she would be caught or whether she would see the error of her ways and return the money. After the infamous 'shower scene' the tone changes dramatically as we learn just what is going on at the Bates Motel and ultimately discover Norman's shocking secret. Janet Leigh does a fine job as the good girl who has made a bad choice but it is Anthony Perkins who stands out with his nuanced performance as Norman Bates; at times charming at others chilling. Hitchcock's direction is superb; he manages to show brutal murder without actually showing and of the actual brutality; just a raised knife, Marion screaming and blood going down the plug hole blood that isn't even red as the film is black and white. Obviously this isn't suitable for younger viewers but I'd say it is a must see for all older film fans.",10,0,1,2 February 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Over long CGI-fest
","To be fair I must point out that this film was my introduction to the world of Transformers; I've not seen the first film nor the original TV series. Since this is a sequel it can be forgiven for not spending too much time introducing the characters or explaining the back story of why the two groups of robots are at war, even so it was not difficult to figure out who was good and who was bad and what they were trying to achieve. If the idea of watching CGI robots beating the living daylights out of each other while Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox try to prevent the bad robots achieve their evil aim then you might enjoy this. Unfortunately the story never really grabbed me and I found my self thinking 'is it nearly over?' when there was in fact another hour to go and while the action was pretty much non stop the fact that is was CGI made it feel unreal. I may have missed something but I was also rather confused by the films geography; one minute they are in the Smithsonian in Washington the next they are in an aircraft storage facility, another time they are in Petra in Jordan then after a bit of running about they are in Egypt, it was as though Michael Bay just wanted to destroy some well known Middle Eastern landmarks and assumed viewers would think they were within walking distance of each other.It is hard to comment on the quality of the actors as all they had to do was run around avoiding the bad CGI Robots. The good robots were somewhat annoying, some of them were given characteristics which were presumably meant to be funny but just made me hope they'd end up scrap metal. It is clear that Michael Bay's expertise is in action set pieces and not in characterisation or comedy although the fact that his films rake in vast amounts of money suggest there must be lots of fans for this type of thing; I'm not one of them though.",3,3,23,22 February 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," The gripping story of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden
","The name Osama Bin Laden didn't mean anything to most people before two hijacked aircraft brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center on the Eleventh of September 2001; soon afterwards everybody knew his name and he was the most wanted man in the world: this is the story of how he was tracked down and ultimately killed.We are introduced to protagonist Maya Lambert as she attends the brutal interrogation of a prisoner at a secret site in Pakistan. He doesn't talk during these sessions but is later tricked into giving the nom de guerre of the man working as a courier for Bin Laden. This name is corroborated by other sources and then the hunt is on to find out the man's true name and ultimately locate him. He is eventually found in a secure house in Pakistan. Surveillance indicates there are two other men there; one who never goes out, never talks to anybody who doesn't live in the house and never shows his face where it could be seen Maya is convinced that this third man is Bin Laden. Months pass before the raid is given the go-ahead and there can't be many people who don't know how it ended.While most people will know how this story began and how it ends it is interesting to learn what happened in between. Director Kathryn Bigelow brings a no-nonsense approach to the film which actually serve to keep the tension high more than once moments of sudden dramatic action occur without and cues that something is going to happen. It also means that the film shows things in a surprisingly neutral manner; I suspect some people will see the opening scenes as showing people 'doing what had to be done' and others will see it as showing the evil of torture. At two and a half hours the film isn't rushed but at no time did I find myself growing bored. The whole cast put in a solid performance but it is Jessica Chastain, as Maya, who really stands out. Overall I found this to be a gripping thriller and certainly recommend watching it at least once.",8,0,3,5 August 2014
War of the Worlds," An Interesting Adaptation of a Classic Novel
","I was unsure about what to expect of this film as I'd heard some fairly mixed reviews but I needn't have worried as I found it interesting and fairly tense for a twelve certificate film. Obviously there have been changes from the book; the aliens no longer come from Mars and the action has moved from the suburbs of London to the North East of the United States. I was pleased however to find that the ending was pretty much the same as the book with the invaders being killed by a disease rather than by human action even if it did seem a case of deus ex machina.I liked the fact that Tom Cruise's characters wasn't a hero who took the invading aliens single handed and saved the day but instead did what most people would do when confronted with danger; he grabbed his family and ran, hoping to be reunited with his ex-wife who had gone to Boston shortly before the aliens arrived. As well as the aliens they have to contend with other people trying to flee.The special effects were impressive, especially the alien weapon that disintegrated people but left their clothing intact, the tripods also looked pretty cool. I didn't have any problems with the acting although I wasn't too keen on the son's character, he seemed somewhat gung-ho for somebody his age.",7,1,3,31 July 2008
Love Actually," Many intertwining love stories in post millennium London
","This romantic comedy follows several interconnected couples in the five weeks running up to Christmas; each is very different and not all are romantic love. We have the newly elected prime minister finding love with a member of his staff; his sister whose marriage could be in danger when another woman catches the eye of her husband; a widower whose young son has fallen in love with a girl in his class; a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid despite the fact that they can't understand each other; a single man who believes that if he goes to America women will throw themselves at him; a couple of porn actors; a man who loves his best friend's new wife and a few others besides.Over the course of the film we move between the characters, dipping in and out of their lives as their relationships develop or don't. Don't expect realism; this is after all a comedy not a study of real relationships or situations. It is however a lot of fun and will probably leave most viewers grinning from ear to ear thanks to the feel-good stories; even if they seem to include every cliché possible! The cast includes a wide array of British acting talent including rom-com regulars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. They all put in fine performances although some inevitably stand out; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were great as a couple whose marriage might be about to go through a rough patch and Bill Nighy was hilarious as the aging rocker who has recorded a Christmas single; he knows it is awful and is happy to tell everybody. There is some swearing and nudity but if that doesn't offend you this is an enjoyable film just the thing to watch on Christmas if you've had enough of 'Die Hard'!",8,1,3,8 November 2014
30 Days of Night," Vampires with a difference
","As Barrow, the most northerly city in Alaska, prepares for the heart of midwinter when the sun won't rise for thirty days something strange is going on. Somebody has stolen and destroyed all the cell phones, killed the sled dogs and sabotaged the only helicopter. Then a stranger turns up and is arrested; he tells his captors that none of them will survive what is coming! Soon after the attacks start; most of the townspeople are lost but a handful, including the sheriff and his estranged wife survive. They don't know if other groups survived but they do know that if they are found they will almost certainly be killed.It isn't often that a film brings something new to the vampire genre but this does; these aren't the gothic counts seducing their victims or characters with grand plans; they are more like feral beasts giving into wild urges. In many ways this is more like a zombie film as they control the town, feeding on anybody who they catch. Similarly their appearance is scary; most of them have a permanent 'beard of blood' from where they have feasted on their victims. The isolated setting gives a claustrophobic atmosphere; the characters know they can't leave town as the frozen wilderness would kill them as surely as the vampires. As one would expect there are plenty of deaths, both human and vampire, these are varied and occasionally amusing in a dark way... they are also disturbing at times. The cast is solid with Josh Hartnett and Melissa George doing decent jobs as the sheriff and his wife; however Danny Huston impresses most as Marlow, the head vampire. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to this who prefer gory vampires to sparkly ones!",9,4,5,2 April 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A classic war film
","In Japanese prisoner of war camp in Burma a camp a newly arrived group of British prisoners are told that they are to construct a bridge over the River Kwai. Their CO, Lt Col Nicholson, informs the camp commandant, Colonel Saito, that as per the Geneva Convention he and his officers will not work. Saito orders the officers placed in a punishment cell while Nicholson is put in an iron 'hot box'. While they are being punished the man work on the bridge but progress is very slow. There is also an escape attempt by American prisoner Commander Shears and two British prisoners; the latter are shot and killed and it looks as though Shears is dead too after being shot at and falling into the river. As the progress of the bridge falls further and further behind schedule Saito talks to Nicholson; the latter tells him that his men would do a better job if led by their own officers soon he has effectively taken over the project; moving the bridge to a better location, coming up with a better design and the moral of the men is improving but in the process is he guilty of helping the enemy.Shears survives the fall into the river, and with the help of local villagers recovers and is eventually rescued and taken to a hospital in Ceylon. Here he is recruited, somewhat against his will, by Major Warden who is planning to lead a small group into the jungle to destroy the bridge.This film is rightly considered a classic; its cast doing a great job telling an interesting story. Alec Guinness is on top form as Col Nicholson as he gradually changes from an officer who bravely stands up to his captors to somebody who could be considered to be aiding the enemy; his motives are the moral and wellbeing of his men but as completion of the bridge nears he is clearly proud of the work they have done. William Holden impresses as Shears, a character who provides some of the films few lighter moments. Jack Hawkins is also on good form as Major Warden.This can be considered a film of two halves; the first concerning what is going on in the camp with Nicolson risking all to stand up to the Japanese and the second which largely follows the planning and execution of the raid against the bridge with occasional returns to the camp where we see Nicholson accidentally slipping into collaboration. There are of course some problems; most notably the character of Nicholson; it is unlikely that a senior British officer would have behaved the way he did the officer he is loosely based on certainly didn't. This isn't an action packed film but it is certainly tense and never boring. What action there is, is impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic film I'd also recommend reading a little about the actual events which inspired this work of fiction.",9,1,4,22 March 2017
Man on Fire," Better on second viewing
","When I first watched this film it left a nasty taste in my mouth however I gave it a second chance and found myself enjoying it far more than the first time. The acting can't really be faulted, especially that of Denzel Washington John Creasy as the alcoholic, suicidal ex-CIA officer and Dakota Fanning as Pita, the young girl he is employed to protect.Some people might think the opening hour is too slow however I thought it was the strongest part of the film as it shows the burgeoning friendship between Creasy and Pita so by the time she is kidnapped the viewer will care about her character and understand why Creasy is taking it so personally. While the first hour is all about setting up the story and character development the remainder of the film is almost non-stop action as Creasy works his way through everybody involved in Pita's abduction and the corrupt police officers who ambushed the ransom drop.Some of scenes where Creasy tortures those involved for information about those higher up the organisation are fairly gruelling and I can understand some viewers feeling uncomfortable seeing such methods employed by a character we were supposed to identify with. Unfortunately the film is edited in a fairly jarring way with rather too much frantic camera movements, subtitles to words spoken in English and cuts every second or two in action scenes.",7,1,1,2 August 2009
Edge of Tomorrow," Live, Die, Repeat
","Major William Cage works as a press officer; he has never seen combat and has no expectation of seeing any then he finds himself on the front line in a war against alien invaders known as 'Mimics'. It turns into a massacre and he is one of the many casualties. He doesn't stay dead though! Instead it is as if time resets to the moment where he first met the combat unit the day before the attack. He has no idea why this happened and finds himself doomed to repeat the day over and over again. He always dies but each time things go slightly differently as he learns from his experiences. Eventually he meets somebody else who was like him Sergeant Rita Vrataski; she explains that he became able to reset time after getting the blood of a specific type of Mimic, called an Alpha, on him she also warns that he must never get a blood transfusion or he will lose the ability as she did. She also advises against telling anybody as he is likely to end up being certified insane or worse. Together they train and plan a mission that will, if all goes well, lead to the defeat of the Mimics once and for all.I started watching this film knowing nothing about it; I even thought 'Live, Die, Repeat' was the title not the tag line! Early on I thought it was going to be yet another loud film with nonstop action but little in the way of character; thankfully that proved wrong. As the events start repeating there is an enjoyable wit about how it is handled. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Major Cage; a character who starts of as a coward hardly a typical Cruise roll. He is able supported by Emily Blunt as the tough Sgt Vrataski. The plot can be summarised as 'Starship Troopers' meets 'Groundhog Day' but it was done in an original way that kept me interested from start to finish. The action sequences are well handled and exciting to watch. Overall if you are a fan of Tom Cruise or enjoy science fiction then this is well worth watching.",8,0,2,29 October 2014
Whiplash," Blood, sweat and jazz
","Protagonist Andrew Neiman is a student at New York's prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. He plays the drums and dreams of being one of the great jazz drummers. The next step to greatness is getting into conductor Terence Fletcher's studio band; Fletcher invites him to attend but when Neiman has difficulty with the tempo of 'Whiplash', Fletcher tears into him at one point he even hurls a chair at him! It is clear that Fletcher expects perfection and will bully and cajole his students to get it. Neiman refuses to back down and practises till his hands bleed will this be enough to impress Fletcher though? Every student knows that they are replaceable as despite his reputation everybody wants to be in Fletcher's band.Before watching this film I'd seen a few clips and thought I probably wouldn't enjoy it as Fletcher appeared to be such an overbearing character who wants to watch somebody being bullied for an hour and a half? Thankfully when I watched it I realised it was far more than that; Fletcher be one of the most intense teachers depicted on film but thanks to J. K. Simmons's brilliant performance he isn't unlikable his methods may be questionable but it is clear that he wants to help his students discover their inner greatness even if only a few will have what it takes. Miles Teller is also great as the equally intense Neiman the student who will do what it takes to be the number one drummer even playing minutes after a car crash that leaves him battered and bloody! The intensity of the music matched that of the situation. The rest of the cast are impressive enough but it is these two that the viewers will remember. Overall I'd highly recommend this although it is an intense experience and won't be for everybody.",10,1,3,20 December 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excess on '80 Wall Street
","This film tells the story of Jordan Belfort and how he made the fortune that funded his life of excess. After a brief prologue where he explains that he made millions and consumed vast quantities of various drugs we return to his first day on Wall Street; he is on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder but he knows he wants to get to the top... then a market crash puts him out of work. Instead of working at a prestigious Wall Street firm he ends up pushing penny stocks, basically junk, to people who can't really afford the losses they will surely face. It is profitable though and he quickly realises he can make a real fortune selling junk to rich people. He teams up with similarly minded people and creates a 'respectable' firm; soon he is dubbed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and everybody wants to work for him. He gets a new wife, a large yacht and does even more drugs... his main problem is how to secure his money so that the authorities can't get it when they finally catch up with him... and he knows they will one day if he isn't careful.This film is all about excess; it could take a prurient view but instead it revels in it... Jordon Belford and his friends may be drug-taking womanisers were few if any morals but for three hours they are good company. Belford is a charismatic central character; at times he reminded me of Charles Foster Kane, from 'Citizen Kane' at other times he was more like Tony Montana from 'Scarface' without the violence. As fast as he rises it is clear that he will ultimately fall. Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as Belford; I can only suspect that the amorality of the character stopped him getting major awards. The supporting cast is solid too; most notably Margot Robbie who is great as Naomi, Belford's second wife; and Jonah Hill as Donnie, his closest associate. It must be stated that this film isn't for the easily offended; there is prodigious swearing, lots of drug taking, a fair amount of sex and nudity and a small amount of violence... if you aren't offended by that it is a lot of fun. Given that I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting an entertaining romp of a movie.",9,0,3,16 December 2018
The Last King of Scotland," A great performance from Forest Whitaker as one of Africa's most infamous dictators
","Having recently qualified as a doctor Nicholas Garrigan wants a bit of adventure in his life so heads out to work at a hospital in a remote part of Uganda. He arrives there as everybody is celebrating the overthrow of the dictator Milton Obote by the country's new saviour Idi Amin. When Amin visits the village Garrigan is working in the young doctor goes to see him and is impressed by his charismatic rhetoric; soon afterwards he gets to impress the president when he helps after a minor car accident. He is soon invited to Kampala and is offered the post of the president's personal physician; it is the sort of offer he can't refuse. At first he enjoys life in the capital but soon he realises that Amin's regime is a threat to the country and himself but now it might be too late to get out.This film impressively shows the brutality and madness of the all too real Idi Amin through the eyes of the fictional young doctor; James McAvoy puts in a fine performance as the latter but it is Forest Whitaker who dominates the film with his tour de force performance as one of Africa's most infamous dictators; charismatic, dangerous and quite mad in the way that comes from having total power and fearing that others want to take it from you. If you knew nothing of Uganda's history the opening scenes might make this feel like a feel good film; with our idealistic young doctor going to Africa and meeting the friendly president for saved his nation things soon turn dark though as Amin's paranoia leads his regime to violence and those who oppose him start to disappear. The film doesn't shy away from showing some of that violence and some of it is shocking and wince inducing. This means it isn't really suitable for younger viewers but older viewers looking for a serious drama should find it well worth watching.",9,0,1,24 July 2014
Scream 2," A horror sequel that lives up to the original
","Two years have passed since the events in 'Scream' and a film, titled 'Stab', which recounts those events has been released. Two people are murdered at a screening in the town of Windsor... perhaps it is no coincidence that Sidney Prescott, the young woman at the centre of the first film is now attending Windsor College. Inevitably the media, including Gale Weathers, descend on the town and Sidney finds herself the centre of attention again. Also arriving in Windsor are Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley and Cotton Weary, a man who'd spent a year in jail after Sidney's accusation that he'd killed her mother. Once again a killer wearing the distinctive 'Ghostface' mask starts killing people close to Sidney. As the death toll mounts the finger of suspicion points at various people; including Cotton and Sydney's new boyfriend.In the first 'Scream' film much was made of the killers following genre rules. This is followed up with discussions of rules for sequels and arguments over whether a sequel can ever match the original... I think this one might even if it inevitably lacks the original's shocking opening. Instead we get the most self-referential opening I can think of with characters watching a shot-for-shot remake of the original, with different cast obviously... this turned out to be a great hook as it reminded the viewer of that film and them propelled them into the sequel. As one would expect there are plenty of fairly gruesome deaths and lots of tension. The central cast are solid; most notably Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox who are great as Sidney and Gale. The identity of the killer isn't too obvious; I'll admit I was convinced it was somebody who turned out to be innocent. Overall I'd say that if you enjoyed the original you should check this out as it is as good and has plenty to add to the story; if you've yet to watch the original you should definitely watch it first.",8,1,2,6 July 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Gothic romance
","The prologue tells us how Dracula came to become a fiendish creature; having gone to fight against the invading Turks he secures an unexpected victory; however escaping Turks have told his beloved wife Elisabeta that he died so she took her own life. His clergy say that she is damned for her actions so he renounces his faith. Four hundred years later young lawyer Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to finalise Dracula's land purchases in London of course nobody realises that he is so old! Dracula sees a photograph of Harker's fiancée, Mina, and notices that she looks just like his Elisabeta. He keeps Harker in Transylvania with his 'brides' while he heads to London. Once there he bites Mina's friend Lucy before befriending Mina. Lucy soon gets ill and her friend and doctor summons his mentor, the great Dr Abraham Van Helsing. Harker manages to escape and summons Mina to Ronania, where they are married, they then return to England but Mina is still in great danger. Ultimately in a bid to save her they all head to Dracula's home where they must battle for her soul.This is an interesting telling of the Dracula story; as one would expect there are plenty of gory moments and some horrific moments however at its heart it is a romance as Dracula seduces Mina. This manages to be quite erotic at times without slipping over to being sleazy. Gary Oldman dominates proceedings as Dracula and Winona Ryder impresses as Mina. There are also notable performances from Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing and Richard E. Grant as Dr Seward. Then there is Keanu Reeves's performance as Harker, usually I enjoy his performances but here he doesn't feel right; most notably his accent is pretty terrible. The special effects are really good not because they are modern CGI but because they are deliberately old fashioned; this adds to the film's atmosphere. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a horror film that isn't just about the horror.",8,0,1,15 June 2017
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A return to form
","After a bomb explodes in New York a phone call from a man calling himself Simon has some rather unusual demands involving Lt. John MacClane. MacClane, who is currently suspended and working hard to become an alcoholic, must first walk through Harlem wearing only his underwear and a sandwich-board stating that he hates black people. This would probably have got him killed if he wasn't saved by local electrician Zeus Carver. Thanks to his intervention Zeus finds himself drawn into Simon's twisted game as he bounces MacClane and Zeus around the city with a string of riddles if they aren't fast enough a bomb will detonate. One bomb does go off in the subway outside the Federal Reserve. The FBI inform the MacClane that they believe that Simon is the brother of Hans Gruber; the man he killed in the original film. The police have little time to deal with the situation there as Simon's next calls states that there is a bomb in one of New York's schools. It is shortly after this that MacClane realises that, just like Hans, Simon is planning a massive robbery; everything else is a distraction. Unfortunately he realises too late and Simon is driving away with several truckloads of gold bars taken from the Reserve MacClane and Zeus will have to think fast if they are to stop him.While not as good as the original 'Die Hard' this is a step up from the second film in the series. Bruce Willis continues to impress as MacClane and Samuel L. Jackson is a welcome addition as Zeus; a character who seems convinced that anything a white person says must be racist but can't see the bigotry of that belief. Jeremy Irons is a fine villain even if Simon isn't as interesting a villain as his brother was of course that is because anybody who saw the first film is likely to realise the terrorism is just a cover for his real motive. All the racing around New York was rather exciting. Once MacClane has figured out what Simon has done he becomes the hunter and the excitement increases as he confronts various underlings before finally facing Simon. Some of the special effects show their age and some of the humour is a little weak at times but neither spoil this enjoyable thrill-ride. Overall a really good film which fans of the first two are sure to enjoy.",Null,0,0,19 July 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," A fun look at Hollywood's 'Golden Age'
","This film gives us a look at one day in the lives of those working for a Hollywood studio in the 1950s. Mostly it focuses on fixer Eddie Mannix who links various stories involving various film stars. Most prominent amongst these are the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock, the lead in a new Biblical epic, by communists; western star Hobie Doyle being asked to appear in a classy drama which demands skills he doesn't have and actress DeeAnna Moran who is pregnant but not married. During the course of the film we also see scenes from the films the characters are making; these include a song and dance routine, a spectacular display of synchronised swimming and a comical western scene.This film from the Cohen Brothers is part homage, part tongue-in-cheek jab at Hollywood's golden age when studios churned out westerns, made spectacular musicals and the biggest films were epics set in biblical times. The studios micromanage their stars to ensure their public images are squeaky clean and even serious failings are covered up. This is all done in a way that provides plenty of laughs; I loved Alden Ehrenreich's cowboy as he struggles in a new role as a far more sophisticated character and George Clooney's leading man, in full Roman uniform, as he is kidnapped by communists. There are some fun little twists as we learn more about the characters. The cast are clearly having fun; thankfully in a way that is fun for the audience too. The story is fairly light but that doesn't matter as it is more about the fun moments than a deep plot. Overall fans of the Cohens' lighter fare should enjoy this.",8,1,1,3 September 2018
American Gangster," An impressive crime drama inspired by real life events
","In the 1960s Frank Lucas worked as a driver 'Bumpy' Johnson; when Bumpy dies Frank takes over his New York drugs empire. It is a time when heroin is expensive and low grade but Frank decides to do something about that he cuts out the various middlemen and buys directly from a producer in South East Asia and uses contacts in the US Military to fly the drugs from war-torn Vietnam to the States. Soon his high grade, low price 'Blue Magic' heroin his the streets of New York and nearby New Jersey. Meanwhile Richie Roberts, a cop who has lost the trust of his corrupt colleagues after handing in a million dollars of drug money he found rather than stealing it, is asked to head a new anti-drug task force. At first Frank isn't even on their radar; he is African American and everybody 'knows' the drugs trade is run by the Mafia. As the years pass Frank comes to dominate the local drugs trade and inevitable finds himself in the sights of Richie, who wants to arrest him, and corrupt cops, who want a slice of the action.This is a really solid crime drama in a similar vein to films like 'The French Connection'. The film impressively captures the feel of the late '60s and early '70s. There is no question that Frank is a villain but even though we see that he is a murderer and has no moral problems with ruining more lives with heroin he is likable. Denzel Washington really impresses in the roll. Russell Crowe contrasts nicely as Richie Roberts, an honest cop who is determined to get his man even if that means making enemies. The rest of the cast, which includes plenty of fine actors, does a fine job too. At two and a half hours the film certainly isn't short but I was never bored. I liked how the passing of time was marked by the progress of the Vietnam War; something which also plays a key role in Frank's drug supply. Overall this is an impressive crime thriller that is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the genre.",8,1,3,28 October 2017
Jaws," Spielberg's original blockbuster
","On the fictional New England resort island of Amity tourism is the main industry and each summer the beaches are backed with people hoping to swim in its beautiful waters the last thing the authorities want is news that a shark has killed somebody. When I girl disappears at sea it is first assumed she just drowned but when her body is found the Island's new Police Chief, Martin Brody, wants to close the beaches but the mayor is determined to keep them open and pressures the local doctor to certify that she was killed by a boat a second death, just off a crowded beach, causes a major panic and the mother of the victim offers a three thousand dollar reward to whoever catches the shark. This attracts everybody with a boat but doesn't impress local fisherman Quint, who demands $10,000, or shark expert Matt Hooper, who Brody invited to the island. After further deaths Brody, Quint and Hooper set of in Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt down the great white shark that has been terrorising the island. Once they find the shark it becomes clear that catching it will not be easy.This iconic film has certainly stood the test of time and is as gripping as ever. The story is relatively simple without any real twists and that is one of its strengths. It is very much a film of two halves; the first land based as Brody tries to get the town authorities to take the shark seriously and the second out at sea as Brody, Quint and Hooper hunt down the shark. These three, brilliantly played by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss respectively, are great characters and the scenes between then on the boat are a delight; sometimes tense, sometimes funny and, when Quint tells the story of what happened when the USS Indianapolis was sunk positively chilling. The shark effects are pretty impressive, only in the final scenes does in took a bit rubbery; of course it helps that we aren't shown too much of the shark early on. The music, by John Williams, is great not just the famous 'shark theme' but also the other music. There are plenty of scary moments throughout the film; some at least as frightening as horror films largely because of its familiar setting and the fact that even though shark attacks are rare we all know that they do occasionally happen. Overall this is a great film that can be enjoyed by most people if you don't mind a few scares. It is a must see for anybody who enjoys classic movies.",10,16,21,29 August 2016
Dark Shadows," An eighteenth century vampire in 1972
","The Collins family moved to Maine in the 1750s and prospered until Barnabas Collins spurns the advances of Angelique Bouchard a witch who curses him and his family. She causes the death of Barnabas's parents then causes his true love Josette DuPres to throw herself off a cliff. Barnabas tries to end his own life but the curse causes him to become a vampire. The townspeople place him in a coffin and bury him. Almost two centuries later, in 1972, construction workers dig him up and he returns home. He finds that the curse is still affecting the remaining members of his family who have fallen on hard times. He is determined to help them return to their rightful place in society but Angelique is still around and she is still determined to make Barnabas suffer.When I watched this film I'd not even heard of the original TV show so didn't have too much idea what to expect beyond what it said on the DVD's case. I think having no preconceived ideas may have helped as I rather enjoyed it. Johnny Depp does a fine job as Barnabas; he isn't too scary for younger viewers even when killing various people. These deaths aren't dwelt on and are filmed in a way that makes them almost comic. The rest of the cast are pretty good too; notably Eva Green who plays Angelique, a character that is both seductive as well as unpleasant; Helena Bonham Carter is delightfully over the top as the family psychiatrist; Michelle Pfeiffer does a good job as family matriarch Elizabeth and Chloë Grace Moretz impresses as her teenage daughter Carolyn. Bella Heathcote also impresses as Victoria Winters, the apparently normal young woman who serves to introduce us to the family by moving in as the new governess although it is clear that she isn't quite what she seems. The idea of a strange family living in an imposing mansion will inevitably remind many viewers of 'The Addams Family' but this bunch are distinctly more dysfunctional. The '70s setting provided a good excuse for a retro soundtrack and even a cameo from singer Alice Cooper which was all rather fun. Overall I rather enjoyed this even if the final confrontation was a bit too much of a cliché. While it isn't a must see film I'd recommend it to fans of director Tim Burton or of any of the main cast.",7,0,0,27 April 2016
Hancock," A superhero with a difference
","John Hancock isn't like other people; he is immortal, has super strength and cannot die he is a superhero. He isn't like other superheroes either; he has no super villain arch nemesis and thanks to the damage he causes every time he catches a bad guy or saves somebody in danger he isn't even popular. One day he saves the life of less than successful PR man Ray Embrey and Ray decides that he could help Hancock by providing some good PR. To this end Hancock stops refusing to accept responsibility for his actions and goes to jail. Here he waits for the inevitable call from the authorities asking for help; the crime rises and eventually he is called to foil a bank robbery. After a celebratory dinner with Ray and his wife Mary we learn more about our protagonist, including the fact that he isn't the only one of his kind and like most other superheroes he has a weakness one he doesn't know about.This is a decent enough film; Will Smith puts in a fine performance as Hancock; possibly the scrungiest superhero to date at least until he cleans up his act and Jason Bateman is likable as Ray. I liked the fact that Hancock was dealing with ordinary low grade criminals rather than super villains and criminal masterminds and the fact that he was unpopular was fun too; even if the idea of Superheroes being too much trouble because of the damage they cause was done previously in 'The Incredibles'. The humour is a little crude but it was impossible not to laugh when he followed through on a threat to shove one cons head up another's backside! Most of the fun was to be had in the first half; the big reveal concerning the second superhero seems a coincidence too far and the ending was too twee. Overall though this was an entertaining way to pass an hour and a half and it is fun despite its flaws.",7,0,1,6 November 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," An action packed conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy
","After the events portrayed in 'The Desolation of Smaug' the dwarfs, under Thorin Oakenshield, have taken control of the mine under the Lonely Mountain and searching for the 'Arkenstone', not knowing that Bilbo Baggins has already found it. Meanwhile the dragon Smaug has attacked and destroyed Lake Town before being slain by Bard the Bowman. After this Bard becomes the leader of the survivors as they head to the Lonely Mountain expecting the dwarfs to help them. Thorin, affected by Dragon sickness, refuses and barricades the entrance. Soon a force of Elves turns up hoping to retrieve their own treasure from the mountain; they ally with the human forces and prepare to attack. Just as they are about to strike a large army of dwarfs arrives to help those in the mountain. That is the least of their worries; Orcish forces are also attacking and soon men, dwarfs and elves are fighting side by side.This is a solid enough conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy which goes some way to link this trilogy to the 'Lord of the Rings'. The story is pretty simple and there are few real surprises just lots and lots of action. This action is pretty good for the most part although occasionally the CGI is a little obvious. The characters are mostly 'more of the same' with familiar characters battling the evil orcs. Alfrid Lickspittle, a character who lives up to his name, was a fun addition as the cowardly sidekick to the late ruler of Lake Town although why Bard trusted him for most of the film is a mystery as he shows his true colours at every possible opportunity. The cast does a solid job bringing the characters to life and the various CGI creatures look believable. Overall this film provided plenty of action although I'm not sure it was really necessary to turn a short book like The Hobbit into three films with lots of new material.",7,0,1,23 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end of the beginning
","Of the three prequels this is probably the best although it does suffer from George's addiction to CGI special effects, it seems that because it is possible to have hundreds of ships in a battle he has to have hundreds even though it just looks cluttered. It also suffers some what because we know what has to happen as this is a link between the prequels and Star Wars; Obi-Wan and Yoda have to survive and Anakin has to become Darth Vader, this of course is unavoidable.The story itself is exciting enough featuring plenty of light sabre fights, the realisation that Chancellor Palpatine is in fact the Sith lord Darth Sidious and the clone army turning on the Jedi and killing most of them.The film starts with Obi Wan and Anakin having to rescue the chancellor from the evil Count Dooku and his droid henchman General Grievous. Once Anakin has beaten and disarmed Dooku the chancellor tells him to kill him as he is too dangerous, this Anakin does after some hesitation. As a 'reward' for this the chancellor asks Anakin to be his representative on the council, he accepts the offer but is offended when the council refuse to make him a Jedi Master. While this is going on he is troubled by dreams about Padmé dying in child birth thus he becomes drawn to the chancellor when he tell him that it is possible to use the dark side of the force to prevent death. He isn't totally taken in though as when Palpatine makes it clear that he is a Sith lord he reports back to Jedi Master Mace Windu who goes to confront the Chancellor. Anakin interrupts them when it appears that Palpatine has been defeated and Windu is going to kill him, Anakin protects the chancellor who is in fact far from defeated, he kills Windu and Anakin realises he has made a mistake, strangely at this point it only takes a few words from Palpatine to get Anakin to switch allegiances and help Palpatine slaughter the Jedi so he can over through the republic and create his empire.The new emperor dispatches Anakin, now the Sith lord Darth Vader, to volcanic planet of Mustafar to kill his previous allies. Padmé follows him when she hears from Obi Wan what he has done, she confronts him and begs him to stop what he is doing so they can live a quiet life together, he however refuses saying he will overthrow the emperor so the two of them can rule the galaxy together. She is horrified at this and when Obi Wan appears from her ship, which he had stowed away on, Vader thinks Padmé has betrayed him and uses the force to choke her. This leads to the climactic battle between Vader and Obi-Wan which is inter-cut with a simultaneous battle between Yoda and the emperor. It isn't giving too much away to say that Vader ends up badly maimed and burn and the emperor beats Yoda who manages to escape. The film ends with the birth of Luke and Leah and the 'rebirth' of Anakin as the black-helmeted Darth Vader we know from the original films.If you watched the first to prequels I'm sure you'll enjoy this too although some scenes may be a bit frightening for younger viewers. As with the other prequels the dialogue was pretty hammy so even quality actors like Ewan McGregor can't make it sound good. The way many of the battles took place at the same time as others and we kept switching between them was frustrating, instead of increasing the excitement it seemed to reduce it. Ian McDiarmid comes off best as he clearly knows he is playing a pantomime villain and acts accordingly, an option not really available to those playing the heroes of the story. Like the other prequels I think it would have been better if George had just written the basic story then got somebody else to write the screenplay with better dialogue and somebody else to direct who was more interested in actors than 'cool' CGI.",7,6,9,5 October 2008

Three years later he is approached again; intelligence has discovered a plot to assassinate the president using a highly skilled sniper; it will be Swagger's job to figure out how and where it will be done so the shooter can be caught and his backers identified the problem is the people he is working for are setting him up to take the blame. Swagger manages to get away from the scene but is badly injured. He is now the most wanted man in America and he is determined to find out who framed him and why. The only people on his side appear to be Sarah Fenn, the wife of his former partner, and Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent.This movie gets off to a fine start with its effective prologue before getting into the main story. Then after an efficient set up the action starts and seldom lets up for too long. Mark Wahlberg carries the film in the role of Swagger; he is believable in the role. Swagger is a great lead character as he isn't too invulnerable; he gets shot and has to deal with the consequences. Michael Peña also impresses as Memphis; playing him in a way that isn't stereotypical for this genre. Danny Glover is solid enough as the chief bad guy Colonel Isaac Johnson and Kate Mara is good in the role of Sarah. The action is exciting; mostly it involves shootings, not surprising given the film's title, but there are also explosions and some fights. While there is inevitably some blood the gore isn't excessive. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the action genre and those who enjoy a good conspiracy.",8,0,1,4 August 2016
The Lion King," A Disney classic
","In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for all but the youngest children and adults alike.",10,2,2,8 August 2019
Inception," Dreams within dreams
","Often when one is told that a film is amazing it is a disappointment even if it is a decent film; that isn't the case here though; for me this film really did live up to the hype! Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, a man who goes into other people's dreams to steal their secrets. One day a man approaches him with a far more difficult proposition; he wants an idea planted in the mind of a business rival; an idea the man must think was his own. Cobb is initially less than keen to do the job but the man has promise that he can arrange for him to get home to his children; something he can't currently do because he is suspected of killing his wife. To do the job he must assemble a team and take his target into a dream designed my new recruit Ariadne. This is no ordinary dream though; it requires the team to enter a dream within a dream within a dream! It is complicated further by the facts that his dead wife haunts Cobb and that if any of them die in the dream they will be trapped in a limbo.Director Christopher Nolan ably demonstrates that a big blockbuster film doesn't need to be in 3D these days nor does it need to be devoid of complicated ideas to succeed. DiCaprio did a fine job as Cobb and it was nice to see the excellent Ellen Page playing somebody who wasn't still a schoolgirl! While this film was about ideas that doesn't mean it wasn't full of spectacular special effects; while many of them were clearly computer generated they looked real enough to enable the viewer to suspend their disbelief in a way that often isn't possible. The idea of dreams within dreams could have been very confusing but each dream was very different so the viewer doesn't forget which layer of the dream is which once the action begins. If you have being putting off watching this film because you have been put off by the hype don't worry and watch it now; it is great.",10,2,18,15 April 2011
Murder on the Orient Express," An enjoyable murder mystery with a famous twist
","Following a prologue, where Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, exposes a thief in Jerusalem, our protagonist heads to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express, bound for London. After dinner he is approached by a man who claims to be an antiques dealer who feels in danger after selling dodgy goods to the wrong people. Poirot declines the request for help. The following night the train is derailed by an avalanche; when the compartments are checked the man is found dead... with multiple stab wounds. Poirot is soon investigating; the problem isn't a shortage of clues but an excess... each pointing to a different suspect. Before the case is solved he will uncover truths about the dead man and how various people on board are connected to him.I was surprised to see just how unpopular this film appears to be as I really enjoyed it; perhaps that was because it was quite a while since I'd seen any other Poirot mystery so could accept Kenneth Branagh, and his ridiculous moustache, in the role. Despite knowing who did it before watching the story was fun to watch. The case provides plenty of clues to keep our protagonist, and the viewer, guessing. Even if you know how it ends seeing how that conclusion is reached is entertaining. The all-star cast does a fine job bringing their somewhat over-the-top characters to life. The opening scenes are somewhat superfluous for anybody familiar with Poirot but serves as a nice demonstration of how quick thinking he is for viewers new to the character. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable film but acknowledge that may be a minority opinion.",8,1,2,20 September 2018
Defiance," The story of a band of Jews surviving the Nazis in the forests of Eastern Europe
","Set during the German occupation of Eastern Poland/Belorussia this film tells the story of a group of Jews who evaded the Nazis and local collaborators and survived in the vast birch forests. From here they would emerge to find food and attack the Nazis. The group forms when the Bielski brothers' father is killed; they decide to head into the forest rather than await the same fate. A small group of fellow survivors follow them but that number keeps rising. Initially they are poorly armed but with each raid against the enemy they become better and better armed.As time passes tensions rise within the group; Tuvia Bielski believes they must stay in the forest looking after all of the survivors but his brother Zus believes that those who can fight should attack the Germans whenever possible rather than just when it is absolutely necessary. Eventually Zus and those who think like him leave to fight with Soviet forces. This isn't the end of the troubles; Tuvia must also deal with those who disagree with his edict that everybody gets equal rations no matter what their contribution to the society. Inevitably they are eventually found and must run again, taking everybody with them.I must admit that before watching this film I had not heard about the events depicted; even if the 'true events' depicted in the film were somewhat modified to make a more exciting story it does at least make one aware that over a thousand Jews survived in the forests. The film tells the story at a steady pace and includes plenty of action that keeps things interesting. It isn't like a conventional war film though; time is spent showing how the people survive, not just concentrating on the fighters; it is very much about the community in the forest. The cast does a solid job; most notably Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber who play Tuvia and Zus those in minor roles are almost as important though as collectively they make the society believable rather than just a collection of characters. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film; it might not be as true as it claims but it at least inspired me to read a little about event I knew nothing of before.",8,0,1,1 August 2016
Lord of War," An interesting satire on the arms trade
","I wasn't too sure what to expect from this film, going into it I just knew it was about an arms dealer so could have been an action flick or a pious movie about how evil the trade is. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't either; yes there was action and there was a message to the film although that wasn't overplayed.Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian who has left the Soviet Union and is living in New York. He decides that he can make a decent living selling guns with his brother. The business quickly grows but after an arms shipment is paid for in cocaine his brother becomes addicted and has to be dropped from the business. Yuri has his own addiction; to a model who he manages to seduce and later marry although he never tells her where his money is coming from. Business gets much better for Yuri when the Soviet Union collapses and he uses family connection in the Ukraine to steal a vast arsenal of weaponry which he sells to dubious regimes in West Africa. His best costumer is the president of Liberia played by the excellent Eamonn Walker. While Yuri is climbing up the ladder of leading arms dealers he is pursued by dogged Interpol agent Jack Valentine played by Ethan Hawke.For a film about the arms trade there are a surprising number of laugh out loud moments, especially in the earlier parts of the film. Later things get more serious and there are some disturbing scenes, although these aren't too gruesome.",8,0,1,31 May 2009
Sherlock Holmes," An action packed and funny take on the Sherlock Holmes story
","Having recently enjoyed the BBC series 'Sherlock' I thought it was a good time to watch this film adaptation; it is safe to say they are very different! Here Sherlock is a man of action just as much as he is an intellectual. Set in the traditional Victorian era the film opens with Sherlock and his friend Doctor Watson capturing Lord Blackwood, the killer of five women; given his crime it is no surprise that he is hanged; indeed his death is certified by WatsonÂ… this makes it all the more intriguing when he is reported to have risen from the grave! In the adventure that follows Holmes and Watson must figure out what Blackwood's ultimate aim is and then prevent him from achieving it in order to save the country. The situation is made even more confused by the arrival of Irene Adler, an old acquaintance of Holmes who is now in the employment of the man destined to become Holmes greatest foe.This film took things far less seriously than the television series but that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining; in fact it was a romp from start to finish. The action was impressive with Holmes and Watson getting in numerous scrapes and narrowly surviving an explosion and death at the hands of an enormous Frenchman! Robert Downey Jr. puts in a fine performance as Holmes, Jude Law is equally good as Watson and Mark Strong is suitably menacing as the evil Lord Blackwood. It is nice to see director Guy Richie moving away from his regular gangster films as he has brought something new to Holmes and made a film that is exciting, amusing and suitably for adults and all but the youngest children.",8,1,1,23 January 2012
WALL·E," Another classic from Pixar
","Having enjoyed Pixar's 'Incredibles' and 'Toy Story' trilogy I was keen to see 'Wall-E' when it was on television. The reviews I'd heard suggested that I'd be in for a treat and they weren't wrong; Pixar may make films that are aimed at a younger audience but adults are unlikely to feel childish if they watch them; this is especially true of 'Wall-E'. Set in a distant future where the Earth has been abandoned by humanity because pollution and the build up of garbage has made the planet uninhabitable one small robot toils to tidy up the mess left behind; that robot is Wall-E. Throughout his days he crushes the rubbish into cubes then stacks them in towers that have come to dwarf the city's long abandoned skyscrapers. When he finds items he likes such as an old Rubik's Cube or a small weed he takes it back to his 'home' to store. His existence is changed one day when a spaceship arrives and drops off a shiny new robot who we later learn is called EVE; the two of them become friends and everything goes well for them until he shows her the plant, then she takes it, puts it inside her and shuts down. It appears that her mission was to search for plant life then wait to be retrieved. When this happens she is taken away on the space ship, not wanting to be without her Wall-E clings on and is taken back to the Axiom; the ship where what is left of humanity lives. The people aren't like people now though; they are all over-weight which is hardly surprising as they don't seem to get out of their hover chairs and are waited on by a variety of robots. Once here Wall-E and EVE's adventures are just beginning as they must avoid the security systems and deliver the plant to the scanner which the ships autopilot is determined to stop them doing as it had been informed that Earth would never be suitable for resettlement.As always with Pixar films the animation was just about flawless, I was surprised however that it was not 100% animated; the various adverts and messages recorded at the time of Earth's abandonment featured live action actors, this was an inspired move as it only served to emphasise how much humanity had changed when we saw the fat CGI people later on. The minimal use of dialogue was a brave idea that worked for me, one would have though that having no dialogue spoken by a main character in the opening twenty minutes and not a huge amount afterwards would lead to a boring film but it was in fact engrossing. The character designs were good; the beaten up look of Wall-E, which reminded me of 'Number Five' from 'Short Circuit' contrasted beautifully with the clean modern EVE. While there were a few nods to other films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey the viewer is unlikely to feel they are missing something if they don't get the reference; as Pixar don't feel it necessary to fill their films with lots of pop culture references I can see this and their other films being watched for decades to come in the way old Disney films can still entertain today's children.",10,1,2,2 January 2011
Finding Dory," A forgetful fish searches for her family
","Those who have seen 'Finding Nemo' will remember Dory the Blue Tang with short term memory problems but just in case you haven't watched it or have forgotten, the opening of 'Finding Dory' shows us Dory as a child with her parents; she gets separated from them and starts asking other fish for help but as she can't remember where they were or what they are called she doesn't find them. Eventually she forgets all about them and her search. She then bumps into Marlin, a scene that features near the start of 'Finding Nemo' as well.A year passes and suddenly Dory realises that she must have a family and determines to find then. Various things lead to her remember that she was from 'The Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California'. With the help of the sea turtles she, along with Marlin and Nemo head to California. Dory gets tangled in some plastic and pulled from the water by a worker from the local Marine Life Institute. Here she meets Hank the octopus who offers to help her find her parents; she also gets help from a short-sighted whale shark who knew Dory when she was little and a beluga whale who thinks his sonar is broken. While Dory is looking for her parents Marlin and Nemo are trying to find Dory with the help of a pair of sea lions, a slightly batty loon and some cute sea otters.In many ways this film is a rerun of the first with fish looking for each other across the width of the Pacific thankfully they are plenty of differences too. Dory makes a charming lead; it is certainly interesting to have a lead character with a mental health issue as protagonist in something that isn't an 'issue film', especially one aimed at younger viewers. Dory's memory issues are dealt with in a way that manages to show that she copes in her own ways and isn't overly played for laughs. The new characters are pretty good; I particularly liked Hank the grumpy octopus and Destiny the myopic whale shark. There are plenty of child-friendly perilous moments and some good laughs as well as one or two melancholy moments; these don't last long enough to make things depressing though. As one would expect from a Pixar film the animation is of a very high quality and the voice cast do a great job; especially Ellen DeGeneres who brings a real emotional depth to the role of Dory. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Pixar, especially those who enjoyed 'Finding Nemo'.",9,1,2,5 May 2017
Arrival," Intelligent science fiction
","In the opening scenes we see protagonist Louise Banks raising and ultimately losing a daughter. We then see her lecturing in linguistics in a university; her class seems poorly attended but it soon emerges that there is a good reason for that... news is breaking of the arrival of twelve alien space ships. They are hovering at various points around the world just above the Earth's surface. Louise is approached by Colonel G.T. Weber of the US Military to help them try to communicate with the craft above Montana. Here she is teamed up with scientist Ian Donnelly. Upon entering the ship they meet two seven limbed aliens, dubbed 'heptopods'. It immediately becomes clear that their method of communication is unlike any human language. Gradually a basic vocabulary is developed; then a potentially worrying message is received... it may be an offer, or a threat or just a misunderstanding. Some countries take it as a threat and prepare to attack the crafts above their countries. If peace is to be maintained Louise and Ian will have to decipher the aliens' final message.If you are hoping for the sort of sci-fi that delivers lots of fasts moving action and sexy, almost human, aliens then you are in for a disappointment. If however you want an intelligent, ideas led story then you should watch this. Most science fiction conveniently avoids the problems of communication with ideas such as 'universal translators', 'translator microbes' of a fish you stick in your ear but this film is all about establishing communications. As such it moves at a fairly slow pace with much of the action set in drab rooms... this doesn't mean it was boring though; I was thoroughly engrossed and the twists, which I won't spoil, surprised me without being too convenient or irritating. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner impress as Louise and Ian and Forest Whitaker is solid in the role of Col. Weber. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. I feared that the ending might not live up to what went before but thankfully it did. Overall a great film that fans of more cerebral sci-fi need to watch... that's not meant as an insult to action packed space operas like 'Star Wars' or the high camp of 'Flash Gordon'; I love those as well!",10,2,3,2 October 2019
The Terminal," Tom Hanks is trapped in the departure lounge of JFK Airport
","Viktor Navorski is a citizen of a fictional Eastern European country who is making his way through New York's JFK when news breaks of a coup in his homeland and more importantly for him the cancellation of all of the countries passports. This leaves Victor in a strange limbo; he can't now enter the United States nor can he be sent home as it is too dangerous. He is left to live in the international departure terminal; a situation at frustrates Frank Dixon, the man in charge of the terminal. Frank would prefer it if Victor just left; then he would be somebody else's problem. As time passes Victor doesn't just survive in the terminal; he thrives. He makes friends with some of the workers, learns English and even gets a well-paid construction job after finishing a job that had been left overnight. He also befriends Amelia, a stewardess who passes through the airport every couple of weeks, and the possibility of romance arises.If you are looking for a film that captures what it would be like to arrive in a country only to discover that your homeland was in turmoil and you were now stateless then this really isn't it; that is just an excuse to force our protagonist to live in the airport this is very much a comedy not gritty realism. The comedy is gentle and pretty funny; this is of course helped by Tom Hank's performance as Victor; he does a great job making his situation believable and his character likable rather than irritating. He is ably supported by Stanley Tucci as Dixon and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Amelia; I liked the fact that certain expected clichés in the relationship between her and Victor were avoided. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. While this isn't one of Hanks' or Spielberg's best known film it is a lot of fun and well worth watching if you are looking for a gentle film with some good laughs and characters you can care about.",Null,2,2,23 September 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," A classic
","In 1947 Andy Dufresne is jailed for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison where he tells his fellow inmates he is innocent but as fellow inmate 'Red' says; everybody in Shawshank is innocent. Red has already served ten years and is the guy to see if you want something smuggled into the prison. Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too much that won't stop Andy though.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison; there are scenes of brutality but also scenes of joy such as watching the prisoners enjoy the simple pleasure of having a cold beer of a scorching day it is details like this that make the film special. There is also the joy of seeing that Andy will not break and his greatest triumph coming just as it looks as if he has finally reached breaking point. The cast does a great job; Tim Robbins is great as Andy and the always reliable Morgan Freeman is on top form as Red; theirs is one of the great portrayals of a screen friendship. It isn't just the likable characters who are well acted though; Bob Gunton is subtly unpleasant as the hypocritical Warden; quoting scripture one minute profiteering, and much worse, the next; Clancy Brown is also great as the truly unpleasant Captain Hadley; the senior guard who brutalises the inmates. After the suffering inside the finale chapter where we see Andy's escape and revenge makes this a feel-good movie despite what we've seen before. This is definitely a must see film.",10,1,2,23 April 2015
The Cannonball Run," An hilarious all-star race across America
","The plot to this film is as simple as it gets; a group of people are planning to race across the United States paying no respect to the 55MPH speed limit enforced at the time. The first half of the film introduces us to the various racers. The protagonists are J. J. McClure and Victor Prinzim who are having a little trouble deciding what sort of vehicle is best for such a race; they eventually reason that an Ambulance will be best as it is less likely to be stopped for speeding of course they will also need a doctor and a patient to be convincing. There are also a couple of Chinese drivers in a high-tech Subaru; two men in a Ferrari, who are disguised as priests; two beautiful women in a Lamborghini and a Englishman who claims to be a spy and calls himself Roger Moore and played by Roger Moore. There are quite a few other secondary racers too; each fairly distinctive. Once the race is underway they must deal with zealous cops, fellow racers, a motorcycle gang and an environmental campaigner who objects to the motorcar in general and to the speed merchants taking part in the race in particular.There have been plenty of films about groups of people racing across America but this is probably the best known thanks to its all-star cast. There are lots of laughs to be had throughout the film; provided by a cast that is clearly having a blast. The cast, which does a solid job, includes such well known people as Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Jackie Chan, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. amongst others. The humour is, for the most part, suitable for viewers of all ages although some elements of the film are definitely not politically correct; most notably the Lamborghini Girls who show an impressive amount of cleavage to persuade male policemen to let them off! For me the highlight was Jack Elam's strange doctor; just looking at him was enough to make me laugh! There are a few plot holes but that doesn't matter as this is all about delivering laughs ultimately we don't even care who wins the race even. Not all of the gags work but enough do to make this comedy worth watching.",8,0,1,5 November 2015
Rango," A delightful animated western
","Rango is a pet chameleon who finds himself lost in the searing heat of the Mojave Desert. Seeking water he heads to the town if Dirt, meeting an iguana named Beans on the way. Once there he is confronted by the locals and makes up some rather tall tales that lead them to believe he is a stone cold killer of a gunslinger. A lucky shot when he is confronts the hawk that was terrorising the town persuades them that what he said must be true. The mayor makes Rango the new sheriff and soon he is hunting down bank robbers who have stolen the town's limited water reserve. His posse catch the suspects but they claim to be innocent; Rango starts to suspect somebody else is behind the disappearance of the water.This animated western was a lot of fun with plenty of laughs to be had as well as a fun story. Most of the jokes can be enjoyed by all viewers but some are clearly aimed at older viewers some may think these aren't suitable for younger viewers but I suspect most of these jokes would go over the heads of youngsters. There is plenty of action, including some which may be a little scary for very young viewers namely any scene featuring 'Rattlesnake Jake'. The CGI animation is impressive and the voice cast do a fine job bringing their characters to life; most notably Johnny Depp and Isla Blair as Rango and Beans respectively. Overall I'd recommend this to all but the youngest of children, and especially anybody who enjoys westerns.",8,0,0,8 July 2016
Platoon," Oliver Stone's view of the Vietnam War
","This film follows Chris Taylor from the moment he arrives in Vietnam until he leaves. He was a college student, so didn't have to fight, but he thought it was wrong that it was the poor kids being forced to serve so he enlisted it isn't long before he questions that decision. Nobody wants to know the new guys and they are seen not to matter. As time passes he becomes accepted in the group but at the same time it becomes clear that there are deep divisions within the platoon with those half behind Sgt Barnes, the brutal but effective platoon leader, and half behind the more sympathetic Sgt Elias; these tensions deepen when Elias reports Barnes for a war crime committed in a Vietnamese village; Taylor will have to choose his side if he is to survive the conflict between the two sergeants as well as numerous fights with the North Vietnamese Army.Writer/director Oliver Stone isn't trying to explain the war; he is trying to show us the war from the point of view of ordinary infantry soldiers the generals may be fighting for an overall cause but these poor grunts are just trying to survive their year in Vietnam. He brilliantly captures the fear and confusion of war in the jungle where one moment soldiers are worrying about insect bites and the next they are in a fire fight. These fights aren't shown as exciting; they are confused and bloody and when people are hit they are shown to suffer rather than dying silently. The film doesn't shy away from showing the dark side of war as we see soldiers murdering Vietnamese civilians. The division within the platoon seems like a metaphor for the divided opinions of people about the war at the time. The cast does a great job; Charlie Sheen puts in his best performance as Taylor; our guide to the life of US soldiers in that war. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe also excel as Sgts Barnes and Elias; the former is particularly frightening as a character who is almost evil incarnate at times yet at others seems like the man who is keeping his platoon alive. The rest of the cast, which includes several people who went onto bigger roles, do a fine job making all the varied characters believable. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody interesting in films about war; just don't expect gung-ho excitement; this is gut-wrenching and very tense and if you enjoyed this check out the less well known 'Hamburger Hill'.",9,3,4,28 September 2015
Scream," Wes Craven's knowing slasher movie
","As this film opens a teenager played by Drew Barrymore is alone at her home when the phone rings; at first it looks like a wrong number but the caller keeps calling and starts to threaten her. He starts asking her questions about well-known horror movies before we see the masked killer murdering her. The next day everybody at her school is talking about the murder; the film concentrates on Sidney Prescott, a girl whose mother was murdered a year previously; her boyfriend Billy Loomis; and their friends Tatum Riley and Stu Macher. It isn't long before the killer starts targeting Sidney; early suspicion falls on Billy but another attack while he is in police custody leads to his release. The friends talk about the events as though they are the plot to a horror movie like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' and somewhat inevitably the ongoing murders follow the 'rules' established by such films.By the time 'Scream' was released in 1996 it seemed that the slasher genre had long past its peak but this brought it back into vogue this time with a more knowing slant. The opening was a great hook; Drew Barrymore was well enough known for the viewer to assume that she was going to be playing the protagonist of course by now there can be few viewers don't know what happens to her; even so the opening is impressively scary. The way the film plays with the genre is a lot of fun as it turns clichés into 'rules'. There are plenty of possible suspects for the person behind the creepy mask including Sidney's friends and even her father who is meant to be away on business but can't be contacted; the eventually revelation includes a twist that I won't spoil. Throughout the film there are plenty of scares and a good sense of threat; there are also plenty of gruesome deaths. The cast is pretty good; especially Neve Campbell, as Sidney; Courteney Cox, as tabloid TV journalist Gal Weathers, and David Arquette, as out of his depth Deputy Dewey Riley. Overall this is a fine film if you are looking for plenty of scares, some decent laughs and plenty on knowing references to earlier horror films.",8,0,0,8 November 2016
Prometheus," Enjoyable if slightly messy 'Alien' prequel
","This much anticipated 'Alien' prequel opens with a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall and drinking something; he then collapses and breaks down into his component DNA. Flashing forward a group of archaeologists led by Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway on the Isle of Skye discover an ancient cave painting depicting people worshipping a giant who in turn is pointing to what their believe to be an alien solar system; an image that has been replicated in ancient art around the world. Shaw and Holloway believe these images indicated the location of a planet where a group of aliens they call 'Engineers' live and they believe these Engineers created all life on Earth. A few years later they take part in a mission to the indicated system and find a huge apparently artificial structure.Inevitably things soon start to go wrong; the team trigger a holographic recording that leads them to an alien skeleton that has been decapitated by a closing door. David, the robot in the team, opens the door and they find hundreds of strange cylinders. Soon things start to go badly for the team as two members encounter strange creatures which attack and contaminate them, David deliberately infects Holloway with a liquid found in the cylinders and Shaw finds herself pregnant with something far from human. If that wasn't bad enough they discover a direct threat to Earth that will require extreme measures to prevent.After hearing some fairly negative comments about this film I was a little wary about watching it as I really enjoyed the original 'Alien' films. Now I've seen it I can see why some people didn't like it but I thought it was pretty good; perhaps having low expectations helped. The first thing to say is that it isn't really an 'Alien' film; it is merely set in that universe. The treats were scary at times although nowhere near as frightening as 'Alien' with the possible exception of the scene were Shaw uses a medical device to remove her 'baby'.The cast features a number of fine performances; most notable is Noomi Rapace who played Elizabeth Shaw; a protagonist who is quite different from the iconic Ellen Ripley; she is a more vulnerable character and it is by no means certain that she will survive. Michael Fassbender is great as David; nicely modelling the character on Peter O'Toole's T.E Lawrence. Other notable performances come from Idris Elba and Charlize Theron. One rather strange casting choice was having Guy Pierce playing a very old Peter Weyland in heavy makeup; I can only assume there were plans to show the character at a younger age at some point.The special effects looked really good although at times I thought they were overused; holographic recordings and controls looked good but at times it felt the creators were showing off what they could do rather than do what was needed. The lead characters were interesting but there were a few too many minor characters who didn't serve much purpose other than to be killed off unfortunately before one could start caring about them. The plot was solid for the most part although it got overly convoluted at times; especially when we learn the real reason Weyland bankrolled the mission. The conclusion nicely tied in with the original 'Alien' film while also setting thing up for a sequel which could go off in an entirely different direction.",8,4,11,9 January 2014
Halloween," A scary classic
","I must say that this isn't the type film of film I watch very often but when it was on television on Halloween I just had to watch it; after all it is a classic of the genre. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the film but I was frightened by it and if a horror film scares the viewer it is doing its job. I was impressed that it managed to be scary without showing vast amounts of gore, in fact I don't recall seeing much blood at all.The film starts off showing us events many years before when a young boy murders his older sister on the night of Halloween. We then move the the present where the boy, Michael Myers, is still incarcerated in a facility for the criminally insane. He is due to have a parole hearing but his doctor, played by Donald Pleasence, is determined that he must never be released. Just as the doctor arrives at the facility Myers escapes and heads back to his former home town. He goes to his old house were he sees Laurie Strode, played by a young Jamie Lee Curtis, as she drops of the key for her estate agent father. He then starts following her around and she occasionally glimpses him but as soon as she looks away he has vanished. On Halloween night when she is babysitting he comes after her and her friends.There is not a huge death toll, in fact after the prologue we have to wait a long time till any one else is killed. This isn't boring though as there is a constant feeling that something bad could happen at any moment, it is this that makes the film so frightening. The creepiness is increased by not showing the face of the adult Myers for most of the film; we either see him from the neck down or wearing a creepy Halloween mask.The scariness is heightened by the use of creepy music and camera work that gives is Myers's view in several scenes, this shaky-cam work was done years before it became de rigour in just about every film. While the minor parts are fairly forgettable Jamie Lee Curtis does a decent job and screams well and Donald Pleasence is great as the doctor.",8,0,5,1 November 2009
Despicable Me," Good silly fun
","When a new, unknown villain, steals the Great Pyramid of Giza other villains feel somewhat inadequate. One such villain is Gru, he has a plan to steal the Moon! Before he can do that he will have to steal a new shrink ray. He manages to get the ray but it is promptly stolen from him by young villain Vector. He tries to get it back but has no luck; then he sees three orphan girls get into his house while selling cookies. He swiftly hatches a plan; he will adopt the girls then infiltrate Vector's lair by getting them to deliver 'robot cookies'. Of course he has no idea how to deal with children but as he does things with them grows to care about them and must ultimately choose between the girls and the moon.This film is lots of fun and not just because of the little yellow Minions that proved so popular they would later get a spin-off movie. The minions are lots of fun in a way that should amuse children and adults alike. Gru is a good protagonist and his character develops nicely throughout the film; early on we see him tormenting a crying child but by the end he is reading a story, which he has written himself, to the three girls. Gru's schemes are suitably over the top and both he and rival Vector have suitably villainous lairs. The three young girls were cute in a way that was fun rather than annoying. The animation looks really good and while there were moments that were probably designed to show off the 3D in the cinema they didn't seem too obvious when watching on television. The voice cast did a good job bringing their characters to life. Some of the jokes are a little bit crude but not excessively so; for example in one scene a minion photocopies his backside. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animated film, both young and old alike.",8,0,0,11 March 2017
Back to the Future Part II," Back to the past... via the future
","At the end of Back to the Future we were told that the story was to be continued, in 1989 that continuation hit the screens. This time things would get much darker as Marty and the Doc travel to the future and do things that have serious repercussions in the present so they have to go back to the past to set things right... it sounds confusing but makes sense when you watch it.The film starts just before the end of the previous film so we see Marty, the Doc and Jennifer take off for the future, this time however we see that Biff has witnessed their departure. Once in the future Marty must intervene to prevent his son from getting involved with a robbery being planned by Biff's grandson. Things might have gone well if that was all that he did however he has an idea to make a bit of money on his return by taking a book of future sports results back with him. Doc tells him to destroy the book but he leaves it it the DeLorean. Having overheard this conversation Biff steals the car while they are picking up Jennifer and returns it before they notice it had gone.When they return home to 1985 everything has changed, the town of more like a war zone, somebody else is living in Marty's house and Biff is a millionaire living in a casino with Marty's mother. Marty confronts him and finds out that Biff had been given the future sports book by somebody claiming to be a relative back in 1955, using the results inside he had amassed a fortune. The only way to set things right is to go back to 1955 once more and retrieve the book before Biff can use it.I enjoyed the darker tone of this film although some of the special effects in the future scenes looked a bit ropey by today's standards they didn't detract too much. The film is full of references to the original, in the future we have a hover-board chase around the town square similar to the skateboard chase in the original and when he is back in 1955 we see several scenes from the original film but from a different angle often with both versions of Marty in the same frame. Michael J, Fox and Christopher Lloyd were great once more in the leading roles and Thomas F. Wilson did a good job as Biff and his grandson Griff. If you enjoyed the first film I'm sure you will love this one too.",8,0,0,11 July 2009
Carrie," High school horror
","Carrie White, daughter of a religious fanatic mother, is a shy and awkward teenager. When her first period takes place as she showers after gym class she is terrified as her mother had never taught her about such things; the other girls in her class torment her. As her teacher tries to comfort her a lightbulb bursts... Carrie's latent power of telekinesis has been awakened. The girls in her class are punished for their actions; after which one of then determines, with the help of her boyfriend, to humiliate Carrie further to get revenge. Another suggests to her boyfriend that he should invite Carrie to the prom to make up for what they did. Back at home Carrie's mother is unsympathetic and tells her that her period is a sign that she was having sinful thoughts. As she grows to understand her new powers she gains the confidence to stand up to her mother and accepts the invitation to the prom... needless to say the night does not end well.This is rather unusual amongst horror films in that the person who has supernatural powers and ultimately uses them to kill people isn't the villain of the story but its victim. The villains are Carrie's classmates and her mother; the first group are just very unpleasant, for the most part, but her mother is truly disturbing with her absolute faith. The film doesn't rush to get to the horror; instead it gradually raises the tension; clearly signposting the fact that something will happen at the prom. Not all of the characters are black and white; until it becomes obvious I wasn't sure if the boy who invited Carrie to the prom was being genuinely nice or part of the scheme to humiliate her. When the violence starts it is perhaps a little too comic but that could be due to effects that while not bad don't feel quite real. The cast does a solid job; especially Sissy Spacek in the title role and Piper Laurie as her mother. Overall I'd say that this is a classic of the genre so a must see for horror fans.",8,2,2,15 July 2018
Blow," The rise and fall of a drug smuggler
","This film tells the story of George Jung; a man who at one point was responsible for importing a large portion of the cocaine used in the United States. He grew up in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the son of a plumber who went bankrupt when he was ten... George is determined to be more successful. In 1968 he moves to California with a friend and quickly sees the popularity of marijuana as a business opportunity. At first he is moving relatively small quantities but soon he is flying large quantities in from Mexico and selling it on both coasts. Inevitably he gets arrested but time in jail only serves to introduce him to a Colombian with contacts to Pablo Escobar; the infamous head of the Medellin cartel. With his old dope dealing contacts he is soon raking in millions smuggling cocaine. During this time he gets married and has a daughter... the good times can't go on forever though.In some ways this film reminded me of the 2005 film 'Lord of War' in that its protagonist was deeply involved in a criminal business but was still sympathetic. This may have been helped by the fact that most of the people he dealt with came across as being worse. Set over several decades the film does a good job of capturing the various eras and attitudes. Johnny Depp does an impressive job portraying the highs and lows of George's life; this is aided by make-up that makes him look different ages without it actually looking like he is made up. The rest of the cast does a solid job; this includes Franka Potente as his girlfriend in California; Penélope Cruz as his Colombian wife and Jordi Molla as his Colombian cellmate Diego Delgado. The story has its amusing moments as well as moments of tension that make it an enjoyable watch. It doesn't show the effects of the product George is importing on anybody other than George which could be seen as a bit of a moral problem but of course showing that would make it less enjoyable to watch. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of dramas set in the world of morally ambiguous characters.",8,0,0,28 February 2019
The Iron Giant," An animated delight
","Set in 1957 when the Cold War was at its height and the Soviets shortly after the Soviets had put Sputnik into orbit people are understandably somewhat paranoid. When a giant robot falls from the sky the only witness is believed to be imagining things at first but young Hogarth Hughes believes him and goes out to investigate; he finds the huge robot devouring the metal at an electricity substation. While he is watching the robot is electrocuted and but he saves it by turning off the power. The robot appears friendly and starts to follow him home; unfortunately he causes a train crash and soon afterwards Government Agent Kent Mansley arrives and sets about searching for the robot; his only clue leads him to the Hughes household where he soon suspects Hogarth knows far more than he is letting on. Hogarth manages to hide the giant in the local scrap yard, which is run by Dean McCoppin; a friendly beatnik who uses the scrap to make his 'art'. Eventually it emerges that while the robot is friendly it has formidable defensive capabilities that could make it extremely dangerous if attacked... which is just what happens when Mansley gets the army in.This film is a real delight; it has a slightly retro look and nicely captures the Cold War paranoia and childhood innocence. The animation looked great; the characters didn't look 'cartoony' and the scenery looked great. The story is a solid sci-fi drama that, while aimed at children, can be enjoyed by older viewers. The voice actors, who include some big names, do a fine job bringing the characters to life. The story itself had plenty of exciting moments as well as a few laughs. There are also a few poignant moments that deal with death and may cause a tear or two to be shed... and not just by younger viewers! Overall I'd say this is a fine film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",9,2,4,28 January 2013
Taken 2," A decent enough sequel that sees Liam Neeson targeted for revenge
","After the events of the first film, where protagonist Bryan Mills rescued his daughter from Albanians in Paris, the relatives of the criminals he killed are determined to get their revenge. To that end they chase and catch Byran and his ex-wife Lenore as they holiday in Istanbul. They also intend to take his daughter but he manages to call her and warn her. He gets free and using a secret phone he manages to guide her to his location so she can bring him a gun. Then he must get her to safety, return for his wife and make sure those seeking revenge can never threaten his family again.This film is basically more of the same so if you enjoyed the first film you'll probably enjoy this. As before it requires one to suspend ones disbelief more than a little as Bryan once again dispatches numerous Albanian thugs. This time we also have to believe that his daughter can get in on the action as she first gets a gun to him then drives him through the backstreets of Istanbul at speed while the kidnappers are in hot pursuit. Once the action starts it is fairly non-stop and exciting with lots of fighting and shooting. Inevitably there are a fair few clichés just once when a bad guy is given the opportunity to walk away rather than try to kill the hero will he make the sensible choice?! Liam Neeson continues to impress in the lead role and the rest of the cast are good enough. Overall this isn't a must see but it passes the time nicely if you are a fan of the genre.",6,0,0,22 January 2017
The Woman in Black," A genuinely creepy chiller
","When widower Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer still coming to terms with the loss of his wife, is sent to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased woman he has no idea what he is letting himself in for. None of the villagers seem welcoming and it is clear they just want him to turn round and return to London. Not put off he goes out to Eel Marsh House to sort out the woman's papers but while there he sees a mysterious woman dressed in black. He goes to report this to the police and while he is doing so three children enter the police station; one of them has ingested poison.It appears that a lot of children have come to grief there; the widow's son died in the marsh and the son of Sam Daily; the only person locally who welcomed Kipps unlike the villages he doesn't believe the story that a child will die after each time somebody sees the mysterious woman in black. When another child dies Kipps starts to believe and worries as his son is due to join him in the village and it is too late to cancel the trip. If he is to have any chance of saving his son he must return to Eel Marsh House again and try to bring peace to the woman in black.Given this film's twelve certificate I was surprised at just how chilling it was it certainly gave me goose bumps! There are some jump scares but mostly the film relies on an almost constantly creepy atmosphere to keep the viewer on edge. Lead actor, Daniel Radcliffe, demonstrates that he is more than just 'Harry Potter' as he does a fine job as Kipps; a character who is rarely off screen. He is ably supported by the likes of Ciarán Hinds, Ciarán Hinds and Roger Allam although the last of these only appears briefly. There is very little gore although the one scene were a young girl coughs up blood and dies is somewhat disturbing to say the least! There are quite a few other scenes that could disturb viewers and given its theme of a vengeful spirit who kills children it is probably not a good film to show to younger viewers. Overall whether you think a film like this is any good depends on whether or not it manages to scare you it certainly scared me more than many horror films that I've seen.",9,2,4,5 March 2014
Shrek," A romantic fairy tale with a difference
","Set in a world of fairy tales where fairy tale creatures find themselves persecuted by the unpleasant Lord Farquaad there is a big green ogre named Shrek. Shrek lives alone in his swamp; which is just how he likes it so he is less than happy when all the fairy tale characters turn up saying they are there because of Lord Farquaad. Shrek goes to see him, along with Donkey, a talking Donkey who Shrek finds annoying. Once there Farquaad tells him that he can have his swamp back if he goes on a quest; to rescue the Princess Fiona from a tower which is protected by a fire breathing dragon. She is waiting to be rescued by her 'true love' so is rather surprised to find herself rescued by an ogre. As they head back Shrek develops feelings for Fiona and it emerges that Princess Fiona is subject to a witch's curse; when the sun sets she is a very different person.This animated fairy tale has become a modern classic thanks to the way it plays with traditional tropes and incorporates elements of many classic into its story. All too often a beautiful damsel in distress is rescued by her handsome Prince Charming and if for some reason he is less then handsome her kiss will free him of that curse and make him perfect not here though. Shrek is an ogre and he is staying an ogre and Princess Fiona well you'll have to watch the film. There are lots of laughs from start to finish and a good but not overstated message about the nature of true beauty. The animation is top notch with great character designs. These characters are voiced by familiar actors; most notably Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and John Lithgow and they do a fine job bringing their animated characters to life. The humour is likely to appeal to all ages; a few gags might be a little crude but these are likely to go over the heads of younger viewers. Overall I'd say this is a great film that can be enjoyed by everybody.",9,1,2,30 December 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," Talk to a serial killer to catch a serial killer
","A serial killer, dubbed Buffalo Bill, has been murdering and skinning young women and the FBI are getting nowhere. Jack Crawford, the agent leading the investigation, decides to try something different; he sends trainee agent Clarice Starling to talk to incarcerated serial killer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector hoping that he might provide some insight; it won't be easy though; Lector likes to play mind games with people and he is soon trying to get young Clarice to reveal some personal secrets. Soon another body is discovered then Buffalo Bill kidnaps another victim; this time the daughter of a US Senator; with the clock ticking before he kills her the FBI offer Lector a deal; unfortunately the doctor in charge of the facility housing Lector tells him the deal isn't realÂ… he then arranges another deal and Lector is transferred to Tennessee. Here Clarice sees him one last time and, after revealing details of a childhood trauma, is put on the trail of Bill and into a potentially deadly situation.This is an impressive thriller that is still effective after a quarter of a century and numerous spoofs of some of its most famous scenes. While the story is ostensibly about the hunt for Buffalo Bill it is as much about the growing relationship between Clarice and Lector as he gets her to open up about herself; something she has been warned about doing but does to gain his trust. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both impressive in these roles. The rest of the cast, most notably Scott Glenn as Crawford and Anthony Heald as Dr Chilton are pretty good too. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes those that there are are particularly brutal. As the story approaches its conclusion the tension rises until the conclusion that remains very tense even after several viewings of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those wanting a solid thriller; just be warned it isn't for the faint-hearted.",9,1,3,18 September 2016
Vanilla Sky," What is reality?
","Before starting to review this film I must say that I have not yet seen the Spanish film on which it is based so can't say whether it does justice to the source material or not. This is one of those films one has to watch more than once to understand as things we learn at the end of the film effect how one views the events earlier on. Often it is impossible to tell if what we are watching is real, a dream or a delusion.Tom Cruise plays David Aames a yuppie who has inherited his father's publishing empire. He is sleeping with Julie but there is no real relationship in his mind they are just friends who occasionally spend the night together she however believes it means far more than that. At his birthday party David meets Sofia, a beautiful Spanish woman played by Penélope Cruz, he spends some time with her but nothing physical happens. When he sets off for work Julie is there and asks him to get into her car, she then starts raving about how he must love her then crashes her car off a bridge.Things then start to be fairly strange, one minute David is well and talking to Sofia the next he is seriously disfigured from the accident talking to doctors about how they can help him, at this point all the can offer is a rubber mask which gives him an appearance that is almost like a statue; fairly realistic yet cold and emotionless. He is later told that there is a radical new treatment that will repair his face, he has this and when the mask is removed he is back to his old good looking self. He starts to have nightmares though, sometimes he imagines the disfigurement has returned, other times he thinks that Sofia is in fact Julie. He even believes that he has killed her but isn't certain which one of them. He is taken into custody and his world gets more and more insane, eventually he is taken to a company which specialises in cryogenicly freezing people immediately after they die, here he learns an alarming truth.Tom Cruise did a great job as David, it is rare to see a good looking major star playing a character which for much of the film is disfigured unless it is the sort of serious film that is angling for awards. Penélope Cruz was also good as Sofia. I'd certainly recommend this to people who like to watch something different and don't mind not understanding everything they see as they see it.",8,1,2,15 July 2009
X-Men: First Class," A fine origins story
","This prequel shows us the origins of the X-Men. It opens in the same place as the original film as Erik Lensherr, a young boy in a Nazi concentration camp, is separated from his mother and somehow bends the metal gates with his mind. This is witnessed by scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt who decides to research the boy's powers. Across the Atlantic another meeting is taking place; young telepath Charles Xavier finds a shapeshifter, named Raven, stealing food from his kitchen; rather than alerting anybody he is happy to meet somebody else with powers and befriends her.The action then moves forward to 1962 and Erik is searching for Schmidt while Xavier is receiving his doctorate in Oxford. Schmidt, now calling himself Sebastian Shaw, is trying to engineer a war between the United States and the Soviet Union with the help of three mutants. One of his meetings is witnessed by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert; her report about mutants is disregarded and she sets about finding an expert in the field Xavier. Once on board he sets about finding and recruiting other mutants, including Erik, to stop Shaw. It emerges that Shaw is also a mutant who believes that non-mutant humans must be eliminated. Once Xavier has found a group of young mutants he sets about helping them get the best of their abilities will it be enough to stop Shaw and prevent a nuclear war?I must admit when I started watching this I wasn't expecting anything special as prequels often fail to live up to the original films; largely because we know that main characters must survive thankfully I was wrong. While we knew certain characters would survive that didn't weaken the story; there were plenty we didn't know about and what we learn about the early lives of familiar characters is interesting. The cast does a great job with Michael Fassbender being particularly effective as Erik the troubled man destined to become Magneto, James McAvoy does a fine job as Xavier and Jennifer Lawrence delightfully portrays Raven as she comes to terms with her differences and becomes Mystique. The story is exciting and nicely incorporates real life events, namely the Cuban missile crisis. The special effects are top notch making the impossible look believable. Overall a fine origins story that fans of the original and people new to the franchise can enjoy.",8,2,3,23 September 2015
The Wolverine," The Wolverine goes to Japan
","This 'X-Men' film concentrates solely on the Wolverine; there are other mutants but not those who featured in the previous films (excluding the late Jean Grey who appears in dream sequences). It opens in a prisoner of war camp just outside Nagasaki in 1945 when Logan saves the life of a Japanese officer, Ichiro Yashida, who had freed allied prisoners just before the bomb was dropped. In the present Logan is living in the Yukon wilderness where he is tracked down by Yukio, a fellow mutant with the power to foretell others' deaths, she has been hired by Yashida to take Logan to Tokyo so he can thank him before he dies. Once in Japan he learns that Yashida has other ideas; he intends to take Logan's immortality for himself! Before he can do anything he dies and at his funeral members of the Yakuza attempt to kidnap his granddaughter Mariko. Logan and Mariko go on the run, chased by a variety of thugs. He doesn't realise that Yashida's doctor, the mutant 'Viper', has done something to him; he no longer heals how he did before. This means that for the first time Logan is in real danger. Before the film is over he will have to discover who wants Mariko and why as well as confront many more foes.Those expecting lots different mutants with varied superpowers may be disappointed by this; however those who want a solid story and plenty of action should enjoy it. Hugh Jackman is great in the role of Wolverine and the Japanese setting provides a great excuse for him to use his claws against enemies who wield blades of their own. That isn't the only action though; he also has to deal with being gun toting Yakuza and ninjas who put so many arrows in him he could have changed his name to 'The Porcupine'! Some of the action, such as the fight on the roof of a speeding bullet train, is a bit over the top but that suits the genre. Jackman is ably supported by Tao Okamoto, as Mariko; Rila Fukushima, as Yukio; and Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays the Viper. The Viper, a mutant who produces a variety of deadly poisons is a pretty good villain. The film's main weakness is the final battle when Logan must fight a giant robot Samurai; it is exciting enough but doesn't fit in that well with the action that has gone before. The Japanese setting adds to the film with a good variety of locations including the vibrancy of modern Tokyo and the beauty of the coastal landscape one could almost think the Japanese Tourist Board suggested the locations! Overall I'd recommend this for those looking for plenty of action without the unpleasantness that would have earned a less child-friendly rating.",8,7,11,8 August 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," A fine conclusions to Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' trilogy
","Eight years after the events portrayed in 'The Dark Knight' Gotham is a peaceful city but the Batman is still wanted for the killing of Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. Then one day cat burglar Selina Kyle breaks into Wayne mansion and as well as stealing his mother's pearls she takes a copy of Bruce's fingerprints. She gives these to an accomplice of masked criminal, Bane, an expelled member of the League of Shadows. Bane then launches an attack on the Stock Exchange where he uses Bruce's fingerprints to authorise the transfer of all of his wealth thus bankrupting him. He manages to find Bane but is defeated and left, severely injured in an apparently inescapable prison. It is only then that we learn Bane's ultimate plan; he seizes the core from a nuclear fusion reactor that Wayne Enterprises had developed and, after setting off explosives that cut Gotham off from the rest of the county, announces that he will detonate the device and kill everybody if anybody tries to leave. And so begins his reign of terror. The months pass and Bruce struggles back to health and manages to escape and return to Gotham; he is now up against the clock as it emerges that the bomb is unstable and will soon detonate whether triggered or not.This film provides a fine conclusion to this trilogy. Bane is a suitable bad villain for this finale and his schemes were the most dastardly yet. He is definitely a human villain not a cartoonish super-villain. He has a good back story although, thanks to a late twist, some of what we are lead to believe isn't quite true. Then there is the fact that this is more a Bruce Wayne film than a Batman film; first he must overcome the death Rachel Dawes which kept him a recluse for eight years then after he finally becomes Batman again and is beaten by Bane he must heal physically and mentally before he can escape. We also have new characters Selina Kyle, an ambiguous thief who may ultimately prove to be a hero or a villain and policeman John Blake who rises from a young uniformed officer to help lead the fightback while Batman was not there. The cast does a fine job; notably returning cast members Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. New cast members also impress; Tom Hardy is imposing as Bale; one can believe that he could beat Batman in a fight, Anne Hathaway is likable as Selina and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good as Blake; the closest thing to an ordinary everyman of the film's main characters. There is plenty of spectacular action from an attention grabbing opening scene, through a series of chases and fights to an explosive conclusion. The end nicely wraps up the trilogy while still leaving things open for us to imagine what might happen next. Overall I'm sure fans of the series will enjoy this; I'd certainly recommend the first two films first though.",9,0,1,18 March 2017
The Croods," A fun prehistoric animation
","The Croods are a prehistoric family who live in a cave. Grug, the father, teaches his family that the new and unfamiliar is to be feared... along with just about everything else. His daughter Eep is curious though. One night she sneaks out of the cave and meets a boy she hasn't seen before. He is Guy and he tells her how there is going to be a cataclysm and if they are too survive they must head to the distant mountains. When Grug learns of this he just wants to retreat to the cave; however events force them to follow guy. As they journey they travel through new landscapes, meet new dangers and learn not to be afraid of everything.This animation from Dreamworks is a lot of fun. The world it is set in is full of interesting and beautifully rendered creatures and features impressive 3D animation. The story is simple and the threats aren't too scary so it can be enjoyed by all ages. Similarly the gags are aimed at everybody rather than having references that only adults will understand. The characters are fun, have a good interpersonal dynamic and well designed. The cast, which includes Nick Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds do a fine job bringing them to life. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animation, whatever their ages.",8,0,0,8 April 2019
Iron Man," A solid introduction to the Iron man character
",At first glance Tony Stark isn't the sort of person you'd expect to become a superhero; he is a genius who has made his fortune inventing and selling state of the art weapons systems. At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.,8,2,6,4 May 2011
Mother!," Completely bonkers in a way one is likely to love or hate but unlikely to feel indifferent to
","This strange horror film is centred on a young woman; she is married to an older man. He is a poet and she works to repair their home, which was previously damaged by a fire. The house is remote but one day a man turns up claiming to have mistaken it for a guest house. The poet invites him to stay the night against his wife's wishes. The next day the man's wife arrives, she almost immediately starts asking our protagonist awkward questions and makes her feel uncomfortable; still the poet won't make them leave. Things only get worse when the guests' two sons arrive; they fight and one is accidentally fatally injured... the nightmare is just beginning.I suspect this is one of those films that viewers are likely to really love or really hate but are very unlikely to consider 'merely okay'. The sense of unease is gradually introduced but quickly escalates to an early act of violence. Then things relax and appears to bet better before turning to a nightmare. There are plenty of scenes that are likely to disturb the viewer; especially towards the end. The young wife, played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence, is rarely off screen is clearly uncomfortably and that feeling is likely to be shared by the viewer. The story may be a biblical allegory; something that isn't immediately obvious but grows increasingly apparent but you don't need to be religious to get it. As mentioned before Lawrence is great; she is supported by Javier Bardem who is equally fine in the more ambiguous role of her husband; a character who enjoys the adulation of his fans to the point that he neglects his wife. The rest of the cast are sold too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes their horror more than a little bit weird.",9,6,10,30 October 2019

","When I first watched Blade Runner I wasn't impressed finding it overly dark and to be honest a bit boring, for some reason I decided to give it a second go and had a Damascene conversion realising that far from being boring this film was a sci-fi masterpiece. From the opening moments with haunting music by Vangelis playing as we a dark and sinister vision of a future Los Angeles till its ending which I won't spoil here the story is beautifully presented with great pre-CGI special effects.As I'm sure everybody knows there are several versions of the film, my comments are based on the original UK release. This is a prime example of neo-noir cinema with its consistently dark setting, lots of smoking and Harrison Ford's world-weary voice over. Ford plays Deckard, a Blade Runner who's job is to hunt down artificial people known as replicants who used as off world slave labour but aren't permitted on Earth. A group of them have returned and are trying to find their creator. Initially we don't know why they have returned but soon learn that they were built to last only four years and as their time is running out they seek a way to fix themselves.In his pursuit of them he is sent to see the head of the Tyrell corporation, who had designed the replicants. Here Deckard is introduced to Tyrell's assistant Rachael who unbeknownst to her is also a replicant who has been implanted with false memories. When she learns what she is she seeks Deckard again to discover what he knows.When the film starts we know that Deckard is clearly the hero of the film and the replicants, lead by Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer are the villains but as the film progresses that idea becomes less certain. After all all they want is a life that isn't artificially shortened.The acting from Ford and Sean Young, as Rachael is very good but it is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as the enigmatic Batty, his finally speech is one of the great film speeches. I'd recommend this to all fans of science fiction, especially for people who like them set in a dystopian future. If you've watched it before and weren't impressed try it again, perhaps watching one of the alternate versions.",10,6,12,18 October 2009
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey becomes God
","Bruce Nolan is a news reporter working for a TV station in Buffalo, New York. He isn't satisfied with his life though; he is fed up of getting the more lightweight stories to report on while his rival Evan gets the more serious stories. When Bruce learns that Evan has been promoted to a job he wanted just before he presents a live report he finally snaps. This cost him his job and soon it seems as if everything is going wrong for him; the only thing good in his life is his girlfriend Grace although he somewhat takes her for granted. As more and more things go wrong he starts to blame God for all his woes... then one day he receives a strange message offering him a job. He goes to see what it is about and finds himself face to face with God! God proceeds to give Bruce his powers and tells him to do his job for a while. At first everything is great as he uses the powers to his own advantage but there are consequences; when he tries to help others by answering their prayers things get even worse... Bruce learns that being God isn't easy.If you are a fan of Jim Carrey then I expect you'll enjoy this as he is on fine form as Bruce. His gurning style may be too much for some people but for the most part he is funny rather than annoying. The story is entertaining and despite the subject matter I don't think it will offend too many people... it is never stated that God is the god of any one faith and his depiction is respectful; the fact that he is played by an on form Morgan Freeman helps of course. There are plenty of very funny moments; the best being a slightly crude scene involving a gang member and a monkey. The supporting cast is solid; most notably Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell as girlfriend Grace and rival Evan. The film's conclusion is hardly surprising but that isn't a problem; we can enjoy the journey even though we know the destination. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh; especially if you are a fan of Jim Carrey.",7,0,0,4 June 2018
Monsters University," A fun prequel
","As this prequel to 'Monsters Inc.' opens Mike Wazowski, a small green monster with one giant eye, is still at elementary school; he is small and is ignored by the other monster-kids. After a school trip to Monsters Inc. he is determined to become a 'scarer'; one of the monsters who harvest scream energy by entering the human world and scaring children. To do this he studies hard to get into Monsters University. Here he crosses paths with James P. 'Sully' Sullivan, a big monster from a long line of scarers the immediately don't get along. Their animosity escalates and it isn't long before they annoy the dean and are kicked off the scarer's course. Mike can only think of one way to resolve this; he will enter the 'Scare Games' this requires him to join a fraternity and be part of a team of six. He joins Oozma Kappa, the 'loser' house and even then they need one more person Sully. With his team sorted he has a bet with the dean; if Oozma Kappa wins they can join the scarer class but if they fail to come first he will be expelled. They progress surprisingly well but ultimately they will have to face the scare simulator and even though Mike knows all the theory about scaring children he just isn't naturally scary.This is a fun prequel to 'Monsters Inc.'; if you haven't already watched that I'd recommend watching this one first so you don't know how it will ultimately end up. Even if you have seen the original film it doesn't spoil this too much I'm sure most people will guess how it ends; it is a matter of how our protagonists get to that ending. The story contains lots of fun elements and entertaining characters. The protagonists develop nicely as the film progresses; this is especially true of Sully as he progresses from being a lazy and fairly arrogant character to a likable one who has learnt many lessons during the film; not all of them in the classroom. The 'Scare Games' are rather fun and provide plenty of laughs as well as some surprises as the way Oozma Kappa progresses isn't entirely obvious the 'library test' is the most obvious example. There are some obvious morals to the film; most obviously that those who cheat are punished but that redemption can be found though hard work. As one would expect from Pixar the animation and character designs are great. The voice cast, which includes many well-known actors, does a fine job of bringing the animated monsters to life as real characters. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of other Pixar fans, young and old alike, even though it isn't quite as good as the original to my mind",8,0,0,21 May 2017
Casino Royale," Craig is great as Bond
","After a few disappointing films it looked like the the Bond franchise may have died after the unremarkable 'Die Another Day', thankfully somebody had the bright idea of taking Bond back to his roots and rebooting the series with a story based on the first of Ian Flemming's novels. Gone are the stream of one liners, excessive gadgets and thankfully there is no obvious CGI either. We still have lots of action and it looks real and there is a sense that Bond isn't invincible, it looks like he is really suffering. Some may feel that seeing a naked Bond being tortured in a particularly gruelling scene doesn't belong in a Bond film however this scene is taken from the book.After an opening where we see Bond earn his Double O status and the opening song we see the main bad guy, Le Chiffre, take delivery of a large sum of money from an African warlord, he invests in a way that in order to make money a promising aircraft manufacturers shares must tumble rather. Bond meanwhile is on the trail of a bomber in Madagascar while he is low level a message stored on his phone leads Bond to the Bahamas where he discovers a plot to destroy a prototype aircraft in Miami. Not surprisingly Bond foils this in spectacular fashion which leaves Le Chiffre desperately short of cash. He attempts to get it back in a high stakes poker game at the titular Casino Royale. Bond of course is sent in to clear him out in an attempt to force Le Chiffre to come over to MI6 and disclose his connections. For this mission Bond is joined by Vesper Lynd from the Treasury who is initially unimpressed with Bond. Once the game starts it becomes apparent that Le Chiffre is both a good player and somebody willing to take desperate measures to make sure he wins.Daniel Craig makes a fantastic impression in his first outing as Bond in one of the best Bond films in decades, he is ably supported by Eva Green who plays Vesper and Mads Mikkelsen who plays Le Chiffre. I wouldn't normally comment on opening credits but Bond is different; gone are the scantily clad ladies in silhouette being replaced by stylised men in dinner jackets and images of cards and roulette wheels, accompanied by a good song I liked the new style. While I was disappointed by the next film in the series this shows that Craig has what it takes to play Bond and I'm sure his later outings in the role will be worth watching.",9,3,6,16 January 2010
Toy Story 3," A fantastic children's film that adults can enjoy just as much!
","When I heard that there was going to be a sequel to the first Toy Story I assumed it was going to be a straight to video film designed to separate parents from their money but as I'd not seen the first film, thinking I was too old for it I wasn't that bothered. When I finally saw those two films I realised I was wrong on both counts; they were great films suitable for all ages and the second managed to surpass the first in my opinion. Given how great they were I was keen to see the final film of the trilogy too. This time I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed; once again we had an exciting story filled with great characters that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.As the time between the films passed Andy, the toys' owner, has aged and now aged seventeen he is getting ready to leave home for college and must decide whether he wants to take his possessions with him, store them in the attic or throw them away. He decides he can't be separated from Woody but the other toys are to be kept in the attic. Unfortunately his mother sees that he has put them in a bin bag so puts then to be thrown away. Woody rescues them but they believe they are unwanted so jump at the opportunity to be donated to a day-care centre where they believe they will be happy as they are played with all day long. Unfortunately they are allocated to a room full of wild children who keep damaging their toys and when they try to move to a different room Lotso, the cuddly toy, who decides which to goes where insists that the new toys get sacrificed to the younger children so he and his friends can have an easy life. Once again the toys must figure out a way to escape and get home; although they have no idea what they will do when they get there as Andy will still be going to college.The story may be about toys but they are all fine characters who most viewers will have grown to care about over the course of the series; Woody and Buzz will always be the stars but cowgirl Jessie is almost as important and even minor characters like the strange green alien toys are a lot of fun. Lotso makes a great villain; I liked how he seems too nice and cuddly at first but was in fact bitter and twisted. The voice actors did a fine job; they all gave character to the toys without the viewer thinking 'that is so-and-so talking'. As one would expect from Pixar the animation was some of the best that I've seen and the story was full of thrills, laughs, a few genuinely scary moments and a bitter sweet ending that may induce tears from some viewers. If you have children I'd certainly recommend this unless they are very young and even if you don't it is more entertaining than most films for solely for adults.",10,1,1,29 December 2010
Signs," A crisis of faith and an alien invasion
",Protagonist Graham Hess is a former priest who lost is faith after the death of his wife; he lives in rural Pennsylvania with his brother Merrill and children Morgan and Bo. Strange things start to happen straight away; overnight a series of giant crop circles appear in his corn field and his dog suddenly becomes violent. At first he assumes the crop circles were the work of local youths but soon the TV reports that similar patterns are appearing all over the planet. It isn't long before everybody becomes certain that they are a precursor to the appearance of aliens; the question is will they be friendly or will they have sinister intentions.While this isn't writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's best film it is still entertaining. Early on there is a good sense of mystery as we wonder what is the cause of the strange events and even when the TV reports that aliens are definitely behind them it is possible to wonder how reliable these reports will be at least to anybody looking out for Shyamalan's inevitable twist. There are plenty of other things to wonder about; why does the young girl Bo leave glasses of water around the house and do Graham's wife's enigmatic last words have any real meaning to mention just a couple. While the film isn't really scary there are plenty of tense moments as well as some pretty funny ones. The cast does a decent job and it was nice to have child characters that weren't overly precocious. Some people will have a problem with the ending but I think if it is possible to accept a plot involving invading aliens it shouldn't be impossible to accept a resolution with a religious dimension. It was interesting to see an alien invasion film from the perspective of a small family group that decides to batten down the hatches at home rather than following those involved in fighting the aliens or a family caught up in a mass exodus fleeing the aliens; this gives the film a more intimate feel as for the most part it concentrates on just four characters. Overall I'd recommend this to any fans of Shyamalan's other films.,7,3,6,16 November 2015
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Intrigue, romance and war in this historical sequel
","The previous film, just called 'Elizabeth', showed the early years of Elizabeth I's reign; now she is an established monarch but her problems are not over. There advisers want her to clamp down on English Catholics as they believe they are plotting against her in an attempt to put her cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots, on the throne. The Spanish are looking for an excuse to invade and pressure is being put on her to marry and produce an heir. Explorer Walter Raleigh, just back from claiming an area of the New World, which he has named Virginia in her honour, catches her eye and they become friends. He is also attracted to her attendant Bess Throckmorton. As various plots play out the Spanish launch a giant armada to invade England; the odds are in the Spanish fleet's favour but a small English force prepares to meet it.If you insist on historical accuracy you are likely to be disappointed but if you are happy with a film that provides romance, plotting and a fiery naval battle then this is a lot of fun. The story moves at a good pace and has interesting central characters. Cate Blanchett impresses in the title role; the rest of the cast are solid too; notably Clive Owen and Abbie Cornish as Raleigh and Bess Throckmorton respectively. The settings mostly look great... even if the iconic Eilean Donan Castle; a coastal castle in Scotland sees an odd standing for the inland Fotheringay Castle in Northamptonshire! The battle scenes only take up a small part of the film but were thrilling even though the result is known. Overall I enjoyed this far more than I expected and would recommend it to fans of films with historical settings who aren't too worried about historical accuracy.",8,0,0,31 May 2019
Beowulf," A modern version of an ancient tale
","Although Beowulf is one of the oldest stories I'd never seen an attempt to film it before. The story seemed basic enough: monster called Grendel attacks a country, a hero slays the monster and becomes its mother's enemy then slays her. It turned out there was more to the film version than that though; for a start who is Grendel's father and is the hero Beowulf telling the whole truth about his monster slaying exploits? This film version of the story was fairly exciting and the CGI used seemed far more real than that used in many films I've seen even when it involved fantastic creatures. It was nice to see such a flawed hero as the star; I was expecting Beowulf to be the sort of hero that defeated his foes and told the truth but it was clear that he was prone to exaggeration from the start and was never modest about his claimed feats. Early on it looked as if Unferth was going to be an antagonist who would more than likely betray the hero but as it turned out this character merely exposed Beowulf's lies which was a nice twist that avoided the usual clichés. The actors did a good job although because of the use of motion capture CGI not all of them look like themselves which was a little disconcerting at first especially as other characters look very like their actors.While purists may be upset with the changes to the story people looking for an action adventure should have little to complain about. While it is full of action there is little gore and no offensive language so it is suitable for younger teens as well as adults.",7,0,1,5 December 2010
Speed," Fast moving thriller
","As the film opens thirteen people board a lift in a Los Angeles skyscraper; moments later a bomb cuts the cable and it drops; the emergency brakes hold it in position but the people are trapped thirty storeys up. A disaster hasn't been averted; that was just to get everybody's attention; the bomber wants three million dollars or he will set off a second bomb removing the breaks! Some films might spend the next hour and a half working out how to save them but here this is just a taster of the bomber's behaviour. Cops Jack Traven and Harry Temple manage to free the hostages and after a confrontation in the basement it looks as if the bomber has blown himself to bits that is until he strikes again some time later. He blows up a bus and says he will blow up a second one. The second bus has been wired so that as soon as it hits 50MPH the bomb is activated and when it decelerates below 50MPH it will explode. He clearly wants to play with Jack as he tells him where the bus is and what number it is. Jack manages to get on board and the situation soon gets worse; an accidental shooting leaves the driver severely injured so passenger, Annie Porter must take the wheel. If they are to survive she will have to keep the bus above 50MPH even when the road is full of traffic or at one point non-existent necessitating a jump! As they drive along trying to find a solution Harry manages to identify the bomber; it may be a bit late for that information to be useful though.This is a solid action movie where the tension is kept high almost from start to finish and as the bus keeps on going no matter what obstacles it meets there isn't time to look for plot holes or worry that it would be very unlikely that they could maintain that speed while doing the things it does. Keanu Reaves does a pretty good job as Jack Traven and Sandra Bullock is likable as always. Dennis Hopper puts in his trademark insane performance as bomber Howard Payne; over the top maybe but fun to watch. There isn't a huge amount of violent action but what there is is fairly intense; in the opening scene somebody is stabbed in the head, later one somebody is shot with a submachinegun and Payne is ultimately decapitated! Any fan of the action genre is likely to enjoy this and it doesn't lose any of the excitement on repeat viewings.",9,1,2,15 November 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard 4.0
","When the FBI Cyber Crimes Division is hacked its director orders the arrest of a large number of hackers; New York detective John McClane is ordered to pick up one, Matt Farrell, and drive him to Washington DC. The action starts almost as soon as McClane gets to Farrell's flat somebody wants Farrell dead. They manage to get away and drive the Washington but that isn't the end of the problems; the people who hacked the FBI have now hacked the nation's transport systems and it is clear they have further plans. Farrell claims that these actions are part of a 'fire sale'; a scheme to attack all aspects of the country's infrastructure prior to deleting all financial records an action that would inevitably cause chaos. McClane and Farrell set off to hunt down the cyber-terrorists before they can fully execute their plan a plan that is complicated when the terrorists capture McClane's daughter.I had heard this film referred to as 'Die Hard Four point Less' which is rather cruel as it is actually a solid action movie; I suspect it would have had a better reception if it hadn't been part of the 'Die Hard' franchise it works as a stand-alone film. The action starts early and is fairly relentless until a couple of minutes before end. There are numerous shootouts, car crashes, a helicopter crash, an F-35 attacking a lorry and destroying a highway bridge before crashing and even a fight in a car which is dangling in a lift shaft! Of course it isn't very believable but there isn't time to worry about such details as there is so much going on. Bruce Willis still has what it takes to be believable as McClane and Maggie Q impresses as one of the terrorists; it is just a pity she is killed of half way through leaving Timothy Olyphant as the main villain; he isn't bad but isn't memorable in the way Alan Rickman was in the first film. Overall I'd say this wasn't a classic but it was a good solid 'brain in neutral' action movie which I enjoyed more than I expected.",8,3,4,17 February 2016
X2: X-Men United," An Excellent Sequel
","I enjoyed the original X-Men film so looked forward to seeing the second in the series, I was not disappointed. All of the mutants who survived the first film are back in this one along with a few new ones, most notably Nightcrawler, played by Alan Cumming who we first see as he enters the White House and appears to make an attempt on the presidents life.This attack is used as an excuse to raid Professor Xavier's school by General Stryker (Brian Cox). Simultaneously he captures the Professor and Cyclops while they are visiting Magneto in his plastic prison and Storm and Jean are attempting to find the mutant who attacked the president. Luckily Stryker's team don't manage to capture all of the people at the school, several including Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman and Pyro escape. These four head to Boston to meet up with Storm and Jean, before meeting them however they end up in a confrontation with the police that could make matters worse for the mutants. While all this has being going on Magneto has escaped from prison with the help of his shape-shifting sidekick Mystique.Given the threat posed to mutant kind by Stryker the remaining X-Men form an unlikely alliance with Magneto so they can free the Professor before he is tricked into doing Stryker's dirty work for him.As with the previous film the acting, direction and special effects are very good, if anything the characters are better, I found Nightcrawler to be more interesting than the two mutants that were killed off in the first film and Brian Cox was impressive as General Stryker. If you haven't seen the original film I'd advise you watch it first as it introduces most of the characters and explains what skills they each have.",8,1,2,16 November 2008
Lucy," Lucy accesses her full potential
","Lucy is a twenty something American living in the city of Taipei whose life is suddenly changed when her ex-boyfriend forces her to deliver a package for him. She gives the package to the sinister Mr. Jang, a Korean gangster, and it immediately becomes obvious that she is in a very dangerous situation. The package contains four packages of new drug CPH4 which Mr. Jang has sown into the bodies of four people, including Lucy, and tells them that if they fail to deliver it to their home countries their families will be targeted. Shortly afterwards Lucy is attacked and her bag burst releasing a huge dose of the drug into her body. These scenes are intercut with scenes of lecturer Professor Norman as he tells students in Paris that human beings only use ten percent of their mental capacity before hypothesising about what would happen if one could access more as the drug starts to take effect Lucy starts to find out first hand. Using her rapidly increasing abilities she escapes her captors and forces a taxi driver to take her to a hospital where she forces doctors to remove what is left of the package. She then researches the brain's capabilities and learns of Prof. Norman's work; she contacts him and tells him that she will see him in twelve hours; she also alerts the French police and tells them about the other three couriers. By the time she arrives in Paris the other couriers are all in police custody but whatever she plans to do won't be easy as Mr. Jang and his heavily armed goons are also there and they want their product back.Whether or not you can enjoy this science fiction thriller is largely dependent on whether you can ignore the fiction of the science. If you can this is rather bonkers fun. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as she portrays Lucy's transformation from a fairly average young woman into a god-like being and Min-sik Choi, best known as the octopus-eating protagonist in 'OldBoy' is suitably menacing as Mr. Jang. As one might expect Morgan Freeman does a fine job as Prof Norman; the sort of role he has virtually made his own. The premise is very similar to the 2011 film 'Limitless' but the execution is quite different; Lucy doesn't just become far more intelligent; she also gains telepathic then telekinetic powers before ultimately gaining power of time and matter. Much of the action is fairly gritty but there was also the stylish action one would expect from a film by director Luc Besson. Overall I suspect this will be a polarising film; I really liked it but can see why others would hate it.",8,1,5,24 September 2015
The Sixth Sense," A classic chiller
","Dr Malcolm Crowe is a happily married, successful child psychologist, of course he isn't entirely successful and one of those children he couldn't help changes his life for ever when he breaks into Dr Crowe's house and shoots him before committing suicide. Some time later Dr Crowe has another young patient; a troubled boy named Cole; a boy with a secret. Cole reminds Crowe of the patient he failed; this time he is determined to succeed. At first he doesn't know what is troubling Cole; he suspects abuse but he has a loving mother and there are no other obvious suspects and there is definitely something strange about the boy; he knows things he should not know mostly things involving people who died in unpleasant circumstances. That is Cole's secret; he sees dead people! Will Dr Crowe or anybody else be able to help him cope with his situation?I doubt many people have managed to avoid this films main twist however just in case somebody has I won't spoil it here. The story is well told with details being drip fed to the viewer rather than everything being explained at once; indeed the 'I see dead people' revelation doesn't come until the film has almost reached the half way point. Bruce Willis is on top form as Dr Crowe but it is young Haley Joel Osment who dominates the film as Cole; a character who is gentle, somewhat troubled and at times more than a little creepy. The support cast, which includes Toni Collette as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams, who plays Dr Crowe's wife put in solid performances in their smaller roles. While this isn't a horror film there are some chilling moments but none too disturbing. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan did a great job in what is probably still his best film it is certainly the best of the ones I've seen. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; even if you've seen it before or know the twist it is worth watching as there new things to be spotted when you know certain facts.",9,0,1,22 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The search for Skywalker
","Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away.Dameron is captured buy the sinister Kylo Ren but is helped to escape by defecting storm trooper FN-2187, soon renamed Finn. Their flight doesn't get them far though; they crash and it looks as though Dameron is dead. Meanwhile BB-8 is found by a scavenger named Rey; she shortly meets with Finn and, thinking he is in the resistance they manage to escape in a familiar ship.Their journey to the resistance base will bring them into contact with some familiar characters and into many life of death situations. We also learn why Luke has disappeared and the connection between Kylo Ren and the central trio from the original 'Star Wars' films.Anybody who has seen the original 'Star Wars' film will find the plot of this film very similar; this may be a problem for some viewers but I found myself really enjoying this and think it was probably the best film in the series since 'The Empire Strikes Back' it is helped by the lack of things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks! The new characters were pretty impressive, in particular Rey and Finn. Their characters developed nicely through the film; this was particularly true of Rey as she starts to discover her strength in using The Force; thankfully the writers didn't rush to explain why she was so strong; no doubt we'll learn in later films. It was great to see many original characters even though Luke's appearance can best be described as a cameo or even a teaser as to what is to come in episode eight. While the overall story doesn't feature any major twists there is one very surprising moment for those who have managed to avoid spoilers. The cast does a solid job; newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were great as Rey and Finn and of the original cast members Harrison Ford stands out as he has the most prominent role. The film features plenty of exciting action as some humorous moments which thankfully don't feel too forced. Overall I really enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to fans of the original films.",10,6,35,18 April 2016
Cinderella," A classic animation from Disney that is still charming after almost seventy years
","This classic animation from Disney is based on one of the best known fairy tales. It tells the story of Cinderella; the daughter of wealthy landowner whose life is turned upside down. First her mother dies then her father marries a woman with two daughters of her own. Shortly afterwards her father dies and her step mother shows her true colours. Cinderella is now treated like a servant at the beck and call of her step family. Her only friends are the local animals; in particular the mice who live in the chateau. The king of the country wants his only son to marry so arranges a ball to which every eligible young woman in the kingdom is invited. Her step mother tells her she can go but places impossible conditions... she doesn't count on the help of Cinderella's fairy godmother though.This film is a delightful retelling of the classic fairy-tale... unsurprisingly it omits the gory details in some versions of the story. While the ball and search for the girl who the glass slipper fits are the most remembered elements they account for a relatively small part of the film. More time is spent introducing with the mice, in particular Jaq and Gus, as they try to get past Lucifer, the cat, first to get food and later to help Cinderella. These scenes are funny in a way familiar to any fan of 'Tom and Jerry' if not quite as manic. While the early part of the film provides the laughs things get more exciting towards the end as Cinderella first tries to get to the ball then as it look as though her stepmother will prevent her trying on the glass slipper which will identify the woman the prince fell in love with. The characters are good, most notably the fun mice and the genuinely mean spirited stepmother. Cinderella herself is a good lead but as the 'nice girl' she is perhaps a little less interesting. As one would expect the animation and character designs are really good and the film features some charming songs. Overall a charming film will that entertain young and old alike; a must see for fans of classic animation.",9,0,0,30 May 2019
RED," A fun action film that shows Bruce Willis still has what it takes!
","Bruce Willis was a great action hero twenty years ago but does he still have what it takes? On the strength of 'Red' I'd say he does. This isn't the most cerebral film but if you want to relax and watch a decent action movie you could do a lot worse. Willis plays retired CIA agent Frank Moses who one day discovers that somebody is trying to kill him. He realises that they will go after anybody he is close to so when e goes on the run he takes Sarah with him; she is rather surprised to say the least as she had only ever spoken to him on the phone as she chatted to him when he called about his pension claims! As Frank tries to discover just who is trying to kill them he makes contact with several other retired agents and puts a team together. His search for the truth will lead him into many explosive situations, deep into the CIA and ultimately to one of the most senior people in America.Willis still has what it takes to lead an action film and Mary-Louise Parker was good as Sarah. The actors playing the other retired agents; Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Brian Cox and most surprisingly Dame Helen Mirran were great and were clearly having a lot of fun playing gun-toting OAPs! The film itself had plenty of excitement even if one or two of the special effects were rather obvious CGI, with its tongue firmly in its cheek this film was a lot more fun than I expected as it isn't too gory and the language isn't too bad can be enjoyed by older children as well as adults... I watched it with my twelve year old nephew and he enjoyed it at least as much as I did.",8,1,4,10 April 2011
Flight," The pilot may have saved the plane but he was drunk!
","This film opens in a hotel room where a man is seen drinking and taking cocaine the next time we see him he is boarding a plane he is pilot Whip Whitaker. He takes off through extreme weather and manages to find calmer air before continuing towards the destination. Just as the plane is due to descend something goes drastically wrong leaving it is a steep descent and not responding to the controls. It looks like they are doomed until Whitaker attempts a daring manoeuvre; he inverts the plane to bring it under control before landing in a field. Miraculously only six people were killed and it looks as if he will be hailed as a hero until a routine blood analysis shows he was far too drunk to drive let alone fly a plane. The pilot's union provides a lawyer who believes he can save Whitaker's reputation but it won't be easy as he won't stop drinking. While in hospital he befriends a woman who survived a drug overdose and she tries to help him but he doesn't seem to want help.Rather unusually the most spectacular scenes take place at the start of the film; the scenes on the plane as it first passed through extreme turbulence then later on when it crashed were pretty impressive and looked pretty real. After that exciting opening things get a bit bleak; Whitaker isn't the most likable protagonist but Denzel Washington, on top form, makes us believe in his character and constantly will him not to drink even though he inevitably does. He is ably supported by Kelly Reilly, who plays drug addict Nicole and by John Goodman who brings some humour to the situation as Whitaker's drug supplier. Overall I'd say this film is well worth watching; just don't expect it to be action all the way!",8,2,6,10 July 2013
Rear Window," Was anybody murdered?
","This Hitchcock classic isn't so much a whodunit but a 'did he do anything?'. James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, Jeff to his friends, a photographer used to working in the world's trouble spots; now however he is stuck at home in New York one hot summer with a broken leg and nothing to do but look out of the window. Through this window he watches the activities of his neighbours; there is the woman who exercises in her underwear, an apparently lonely woman, a man who lives with his nagging wife, a musician and a couple who are sleeping on the fire escape in an attempt to keep cool. The only company Jeff has is his nurse Stella and his beautiful girl friend Lisa. Even when they are visiting he can't stop watching the neighbours though. One night he sees something odd; the man with the nagging wife, who we later learn is called Lars Thorwald comes and goes several times with a suitcase and in the morning there is no sign of his wife. Jeff is convinced that he must have murdered her; his friend Lt. Doyle is less than convinced though... several witnesses corroborate Thorwald's story that his wife went away by train. He tells Lisa and she is initially sceptical but when he tells her how he has seen Thorwald examining jewellery in his wife's favourite handbag she believes him... after all what woman would go on a trip and not take her favourite handbag or jewellery? They continue to investigate; if they are wrong they will look silly but if they are correct they could be in a lot of danger!This film is rightly considered a classic; the camera seldom leaves Jeff's room; when we see things happening outside we only see what Jeff sees from his window. This means we don't know whether Thorwald killed his wife of not until the very end; the evidence we see earlier is merely circumstantial and contradicted by what Lt. Doyle hears when he investigates. James Stewart does a great job as Jeff; he is rarely off camera and as the character has a broken leg he can't even stand up yet he still gives a dynamic performance. He is ably supported by Grace Kelly, who plays Lisa and Thelma Rita who plays Stella. Hitchcock's did a great job directing; the way he showed the view from Jeff's window helps put the viewer in Jeff's position; this was particularly effective when he watched on impotently as Lisa searched Thorwald's apartment when he returned and caught her. This is definitely one to watch; a mystery with a twist and no content that is likely to offend anybody.",10,0,3,30 August 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy
","After a brief prologue showing us how Sméagol came to get the ring and how he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts where The Two Towers left off; Sméagol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard.When Pippin looks into the palantír, a sort of dark crystal ball, he sees the city of Minas Tirith under attack, unfortunately he himself is seen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle.I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Sauron's reign once and for all.This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked in the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware that this was in the book. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job bringing such an epic story to the screen, he was of course assisted by a fantastic cast who really brought the characters to life.",10,16,23,19 July 2009
Munich," The price of vengeance
","In the aftermath of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 Avner, a Mossad agent is given a mission: he is to go to Europe and, with four other men, hunt down the eleven people he has been told organised the atrocity. Israel might not have the death penalty but it has been decided that these men must die; a message must be sent to the terrorists that if they attack Israel they can expect no mercy. As the team learns the whereabouts of their targets they travel all over Europe. It is not an easy job; killing does not come naturally to them but they do it for their country. As time passes they begin to wonder whether or not it is worth it; each person they kill is quickly replaced and also leads to further attacks against Israelis. Over time they themselves become targets; which leads to paranoia; could their contact be betraying them or have they crossed swords with another security service? This Paranoia ultimately leads to Anver starts to wonder whether the people on his list had anything to do with Munich at all perhaps Mossad was just using Munich as an excuse to eliminate some enemies.Before watching this I half expected it to be a revenge thriller but it was more than that; rather than getting satisfaction from the killings Avner and most of the team start to question what they are doing and it begins to take an emotional toll. When they set out they believed they were the good guys but as time passes they start to wonder whether they are all that different from their targets. This doesn't feel like an action film either; there is no exciting music to accompany the action and what they do is shown as being frightening not exciting. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story interesting without glorifying the actions and Eric Bana does a great job portraying Avmer as an increasingly tormented man. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a solid drama but don't expect it to be like an action movie where you can cheer for a hero who knows he is doing the right thing.",8,2,3,23 May 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A classic '80s horror
","Something strange is happening to four teenage friends; Nancy Thompson, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. Each of them have had the same nightmare about a man with a burnt face and knives on the fingers of one hand. Not wanting to be alone they spend the night at Tina's house. That night she has another nightmare she doesn't wake up. As the strange man attacks her in her dreams her boyfriend Rod witnesses her starting to bleed as though slashed by invisible knives! He is soon arrested for the murder by Nancy's father, the local police lieutenant. Nancy is sure that he wasn't to blame. She is terrified of going to sleep as she is sure she will be attacked. She does however agree to sleep under supervision at a 'dream lab'; something strange happens and as she is awakened from a nightmare she finds that she has the man's hat in her hands. The name inside suggests it belongs to Freddie Krueger; something her mother say is impossible as she was one of the people who killed Krueger, a child murderer, many years before. She hatches a plan to pull Krueger out of her dream she will need her boyfriend Glen to stay awake though.This is an effective low budget horror film that is rightly considered a classic of the genre. The idea of somebody killing people in their dreams is a great concept as sleeping, and thus dreaming, is one thing we all do. There are plenty of good scares and some particularly gory moments. Freddie Krueger is a great horror monster although when we learn about his backstory it seems a little far-fetched as we are meant to believe that none of the kids have heard about somebody who had killed twenty children in their area even if that took place before they were born. The special effects are a little dated but still pretty decent. The cast isn't the best in the world but they are okay; a young Johnny Depp certainly doesn't hint at his later A-list status. Overall I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre as it had quite an influence on future horror films; not just the numerous sequels.",8,1,2,24 May 2017
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey is on top form in this satire on reality television
","Truman Burbank thinks he is an ordinary person doing an ordinary job in a fairly ordinary town... he does not realise that he is the star of a reality show. He has lived in the town of Seahaven all of his life; never suspecting that cameras are watching his every move and that everybody else, including his wife, mother and his friends are merely cast members and that the town itself is under a giant dome. Strange things occasionally happen but excuses are quickly made; for example a falling spotlight is explained away as something that fell from a plane. From an early age Truman has been conditioned so that he won't try to leave the town; the drowning of his father gave him a terror of the sea and any time he thinks about leaving an obstacle appears. Eventually he starts to realise that something is wrong and decides that he must leave to prove that he isn't paranoid.'The Truman Show' is a fine satire of reality television made when the genre was just starting. The idea that Truman might live for thirty years before he realises something isn't right with his world might seem unlikely at first but one has to remember that this reality is all that he has ever known. Jim Carrey can be a bit annoying at times but here he is on top form and gives one of his best performances as the eponymous Truman; he manages to be funny without being silly and makes the viewer sympathise with Truman. Ed Harris is also impressive as Christof, the creator of the show who has directed Truman's entire life and is determined that the show must go on. The reality of Truman's world is fun with lots of digs at modern media; characters talk as though they are in commercial which of course they are and a travel agent's shop is decorated with posters guaranteed to put you off flying! There are also touching moments such as Truman falling for an extra who is quickly taken 'off to Fiji' by her 'father'. Not only do we see what is happening to Truman; we are shown the fans of the show who are obsessed with his life which emphasises just how public Truman's life is. Overall I strongly recommend this; the concepts may be quite dark but it is presented in such a way that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",8,1,1,17 September 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A gripping second instalment
","After the events of the first Hunger Games film Katniss and Peeta have returned home to District Twelve but as victors they have an obligation to go on a tour; visiting the other districts before heading to the capital. As they travel Katniss notices a feeling of rebellion amongst the people; President Snow has noticed it too and he sees Katniss as the person who gave people the belief that they could stand up to the Capital thanks to her behaviour in the games. He decides that she must die but first he must stop the people loving her to avoid making her a martyr. To this end Plutarch Heavensbee, the man now running the games, proposes a special Hunger Games to celebrate its seventy fifth year this time the competitors will all be previous winners. As Katniss is the only female winner from District 12 she is guaranteed to compete again. Once again Peeta ends up fighting alongside her and once in the game they make allies to defend against the more dangerous competitors but they know alliances can't last and there are other dangers that could kill them just as easily as the other competitors.Having enjoyed the previous film I was wondering how they would build on that story without being repetitive. No time is wasted explaining what went before so one definitely needs to watch the first film before watching this. We are quickly reminded of the hardships of living in the districts and of the brutality of the authority in the capital. Once the game starts the tension inevitably rises and even though one can guess Katniss will survive one can't help fearing for her safety and that of her friends. The ending is also quite different; her method of survival is different and obviously sets things up for the next instalment of the story with a twist that I didn't see coming. Jennifer Lawrence continues to do a fine job as Katniss and while the characters of the other competitors aren't as well developed that doesn't mean they are boring; in fact they have to remain a bit of a mystery if we aren't to know if they can be trusted. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is nicely threatening as Plutarch Heavensbee; even more so that Donald Sutherland's President Snow. Like 'The Empire Strikes Back'; another famous second instalment, this concludes with things not looking good; the Capital is crushing any perceived threat and Katniss has been separated from Peeta fans will certainly be left keen to watch the next film: Mockingjay Pt 1.",9,1,13,18 February 2015
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Totally awesome dude!
","'Ted' Theodore Logan and Bill S. Preston are two high school students in San Dimas, California and they are about to flunk history... all they know is that Napoleon was a 'short dead dude' and Joan of Arc was 'Noah's wife'! This shouldn't be a problem for anybody but them but as future society is destined to be based on their music it is essential that they pass their history presentation with an A+ grade... if they don't Ted will go to military school, the band won't form and the future is doomed! To ensure they succeed Rufus returns from the distant future with a time machine so they can learn about history by visiting it. This is a good idea but Bill and Ted come up with a better one; why not bring back real historical figures to give their presentation for them! They come up with the idea after accidentally bringing Napoleon back to the present; they then embark on an excellent adventure that will see them bringing back Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Beethoven, Socrates and Joan of Arc amongst others. While travelling they will have run-ins with some dangerous characters and when they return the historical figures will have a lot of fun visiting the mall before giving a presentation nobody will forget!This '80s comedy may be pretty dumb but it is a lot of fun. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are just right as unlikely heroes Bill and Ted. The way they jump around through history does make it fairly episodic; a few minutes here, a few minutes there... in fact things are best when the action is in the present; Napoleon at the water park was funny and there were some genuinely laugh out loud moments when the various historical figures go to the mall... what Genghis Khan did in the sports shop was hilarious. The rest of the cast do well enough with their roles although they are playing amusing caricatures rather than real characters with the exception of George Carlin's character Rufus. The special effects are pretty ropey even by the standards of the day but that just adds to the films low budget charm. If you want a good laugh with little to offend then you could do a lot worse than this.",8,0,0,7 November 2012
The Matrix," A cyberpunk classic
","Like many people I was fairly awestruck by the special effects when I first saw this film but was unsure how I would feel watching the film again several years after I last saw it; after all special effects are advancing all the time and this is over ten years old... I needn't have worried; I enjoyed it just as much as I did first time.The story begins with computer hacker Neo receiving strange message telling him somebody was about to knock on his door and that he should 'follow the white rabbit'; his door is knocked and his friends invite him to come out with him; he is about to refuse when he sees a white rabbit tattooed on one of their shoulders so goes with them. While out he meets another hacker, a woman called Trinity, who tells him that the legendary hacker Morpheus wants to meet with him. The next day at work he receives a call telling him the authorities want to take him into custody and he must follow precise instructions if he wishes to escape; he fails to do this and is arrested. During the interview with Agent Smith a strange bug is implanted and in a nightmarish manner his mouth becomes fused closed! The next thing he knows he is waking up in his apartment assuming it was just a strange nightmare but it soon becomes apparent that is was real. Taken to Morpheus by Trinity he learns that the world is not as it seems; he isn't in 1999 but 2199 and none of his life so far has been real; his body is plugged into a giant machine and he is experiencing something called The Matrix.Once woken he finds himself in a dead mechanical world with Morpheus, Trinity and a few other free people; they mention the last human city; Zion, but we never see it. Now he is free he must prepare to return to The Matrix which means learning the skills he will need to survive and gaining an understanding of what The Matrix really is. Once inside they will have to avoid Agents, parts of the program that will hunt them down as well as assuring that they stay hidden in the real world; if they die in either place their life is over.This is a must see for all science fiction and action fans; it has a fine story and spectacular action sequences; many of them reminiscent of those in Chinese Wuxia films with characters running up walls and doing impossible leaps... of course within The Matrix nothing is impossible if you believe you can do it. Keanu Reaves might not have the greatest acting range but he is just right for the role of Neo, a man understandably a little confused at finding everything he had experienced so far was unreal. Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith bringing a sense of menace to the role. Other main actors Carrie Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne also perform well. Writer/directors the Wachowski brothers did a great job; the film is incredibly stylish without lacking substance. I can't imagine many people haven't watched this but if you are one of those I strongly recommend checking it out.",10,1,3,28 February 2012
Looper," An enjoyable sci-fi thriller
","In the year 2044 Joe is a Looper that is an assassin sent from the future to kill victims from the future. The reason for loopers is it is hard to get away with murder in 2074 but nobody will miss somebody who is killed before they even exist! The victims are sent back tied and hooded; all Joe has to do is pull the trigger the moment they appear then collect his payment in silver. It isn't a difficult job but there is a catch; one day the payment will be in gold and that victim will be his older self. This doesn't bother the loopers too much; it means they can retire knowing that they will have another thirty years to enjoy their earnings. When Joe's older self arrives he isn't hooded and manages to escape; this is not good for Joe as his employers will harm him to get the older man. He learns there is a reason 'Old Joe' didn't accept his fate; he believes he can change the future and save his wife by killing the person responsible while he is still a child. If all that isn't confusing enough, as well as time travel, some of the population now have telekinetic powers.Just thinking about time travel and the paradoxes it would cause inevitably leads to confusion but thankfully this film isn't too confusing if you can suspend your disbelief just accept that for the purposes of the film time travel is possible and follows the rules set out by the creator every time travel film seems to have slightly different rules! The biggest surprise of the film is the fact that the protagonist is not a good person; he is a killer who has no problem with his job, he isn't even bothered about killing his future self. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a solid job as Young Joe and Bruce Willis is equally good as his old Joe. Young Pierce Gagnon, who plays Old Joe's target manages to be surprisingly menacing for a child; a nice change from the usual precocious child character. There is plenty of action throughout the film and it is well handled and exciting. Overall a solid sci-fi thriller that fans of either genre can enjoy.",8,0,2,10 November 2014
Life," Solid 'monster in space' movie
","Set aboard the International Space Station a team of scientists are preparing to analyse soil samples that a probe has brought back from Mars. A single cell is found in the sample; tiny but enough to prove that there is life of non-terrestrial origin. It gradually begins to grow and appears to react to stimuli. The news is greeted with excitement on Earth and the lifeform is quickly dubbed 'Calvin'. Inevitably it isn't long before things go wrong. After an accident in the lab it gets out of its quarantine container and attacks the crew. They struggle to keep it in the lab but it manages to get out and as it feeds it grows. They have to contemplate the fact that their mission is now to stop it getting to Earth rather than merely saving themselves.Given that this features a deadly alien creature and is set aboard the ISS it is hardly surprising that it is described as 'Alien' meets 'Gravity'; that is a little unfair though. I didn't think it was as good as those films but it didn't feel like a rip-off to me. Even if the central idea wasn't the most original it was effective. Once Calvin is on the loose the tension rises quickly and there are some fairly disturbing moments. The location provides a great sense of claustrophobia and unlike most space based films there is no artificial gravity. There are some questionable moments but occasionally these are required to advance the plot... there wouldn't have been much of a story if they didn't make the mistakes that led to Calvin's escape. The cast, including some big names does a fine job; most notably Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Hiroyuki Sanada. The special effects are pretty impressive; both the realistic space shots and the creature design. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of sci-fi horror; it may not be the best in the genre but it is very far from the worst I've seen.",8,3,6,3 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long time ago in a decade without CGI...
","When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first 'block-buster' film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him.",9,5,6,6 October 2008
Deadpool," Crude and violent but also a lot of fun
","This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.",9,8,15,15 May 2017
Cloud Atlas," Six stories set in different eras yet somehow linked
","This is a hard film to summarise in a paragraph as it consists of six ostensibly unconnected stories that take place in six different time periods and locations. A lawyer in the south pacific who attempts to help an escaped slave who has stowed away on a ship in the nineteenth century. A young man who has gone to Scotland in the 1930s to help a composer write again and to compose his own work. A reporter in 1970s San Francisco who finds herself in danger when she uncovers a plot by oil companies to stop alternate power sources. A man whose brother has him put in a secure facility in present day Scotland. A cloned slave, known as a fabricant, is taken from where she is kept by a man hoping to overthrow current system and becomes a symbol of that revolution in 2144. Finally in the far future a tribesman Pacific island is haunted by a vision of a demonic character and helps a woman from an advanced civilisation get to the summit of a 'forbidden' mountain. These six stories are told in an overlapping manner; a scene from one then from another; sometimes it is just a moment in one story other times we stay with one story for quite a while.When I started watching this I thought it might just be long and confusing with the cast playing multiple characters in the various stories; sometimes these characters are of a different race or gender. Thankfully once the stories had got going I was gripped; the way we constantly switch from one story to another meant no story got boring; nor did it create the confusion it might have done. As the stories progress it becomes apparent that there are connections between then sometimes thematic sometimes involving the same characters or the effects of their works and lives. The cast does a great job playing the multiple roles; sometimes I didn't recognise actors under heavy makeup until the credits showed who played whom. The way it is spread over many centuries means at times it is a costume drama, other times in is futuristic sci-fi and others it is post-apocalyptic sci-fi. There are thrilling moments, tragic moments and even some very funny moments. This certainly won't be for everybody but I'd recommend giving it a go; I certainly enjoyed it far more than I expected.",9,9,12,28 December 2016
300," An enjoyable action film
","As this retelling of the story of the Battle of Thermopylae opens Dilios, a survivor of the battle, narrates as we learn how his leader Leonidas grew up learning to be a fighter before growing up to become the King of Sparta. We then learn how King Xerxes of the Persians sends a messenger to Sparta demanding that they acknowledge his supremacy Leonidas responds by kicking the messenger down the well! He knows that if he is to prevent the destruction of Sparta he will have to face Xerxes superior forces; the oracles forbid going to war at that time but he takes a force of three hundred warriors to a pass known as the 'Hot Gates'; here a small force will be able to hold off a superior attacker. Soon battle is raging as wave after wave of Xerxes' forces attack Leonidas' small band of Spartans. Back in Sparta Gorgo, Leonidas' wife tries to rally support to send the rest of the army.If you are after historical accuracy this may not be the film to watch; however it might inspire viewers to learn more about the events which can't be bad. If you want action this film has lots of it; much of it is fairly bloody but it isn't too disturbing thanks to the stylised way in which it is presented. The action is exciting and fairly non-stop once the battle has begun. The use of CGI is effective and not too obvious. The cast do a decent enough job with the material; although most of them just have to shout a lot and fight even more. On the downside the Spartans, who we are meant to support, come across as a bunch of proto-fascists; this is especially true in the opening scenes where we see young Leonidas taken from his mother and brutally forced to becoming a warrior whose greatest honour would be to die for Sparta. Overall I enjoyed this more than I expected and would recommend it to somebody after a film with lots of action.",7,1,4,6 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Enjoyable over the top spy action
","The Kingsmen are a well-funded, well equipped secret service organisation not under the control of any government. When one of their agents, 'Lancelot', is killed in the line of duty each of the others must nominate one person to compete for the position. Harry Hart, code name Galahad, nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin; the son of an agent who died saving Galahad. It soon becomes apparent that most of the other candidates see him as a council estate oik but as the training progresses and others drop out it becomes clear that he might just have what it takes to become a Kingsman. While this is happening the Kingsmen work to uncover what Lancelot was doing when he was killed; signs point to American billionaire Richmond Valentine who it turns out has a rather drastic plan to solve the problem of over population.This is clearly trying to be like James Bond turned up to eleven; in some ways it works; in others it doesn't. Colin Firth does a fine job as the suave Galahad; a character that felt like a cross between James Bond and John Steed but more violent. Taron Egerton does a solid job as Eggsy, Sophie Cookson was good as his friend Roxy and Mark Strong is good as tech-specialist 'Merlin'. As the villain Samuel L. Jackson was rather fun although he was overshadowed by Sofia Boutella who made a great henchwoman; the way she used the swords built into her characters prosthetic legs was certainly memorable. The action was fairly over-the-top in a rather fun way; it is violent though in an early scene a man is sliced in half vertically; if that doesn't bother you the rest should be okay. Strangely the ending which features many exploding heads eschews gore in favour of a firework like effect that felt a bit too cartoony for my taste. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it skilfully manages to walk the fine line between a 'proper' spy movie and a parody it isn't for the too easily offended though.",8,1,5,15 February 2017
Ran," King Lear in Feudal Japan
","This film, Akira Kurosawa's version of 'King Lear' set in feudal Japan, tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his three sons Taro, Jiro and Saburo. The elderly lord gathers his family and talks about how he started off in a small castle but gradually defeated all his rivals and now controls the entire area from the largest caste. He finishes by saying that he had decided to retire; he states that Taro, his eldest son, is to inherit the absolute leadership and Jiro and Saburo will inherit the second and third castles respectively and must support Taro. Saburo, the youngest son, suggests that his father must be mad to stand down arguing it will only be a matter of time before Taro and Jiro turn on him. This leads to Saburo's banishment but it isn't long before his words start to be proved right; first Taro makes his father's position at the First Castle untenable then Jiro refuses his men access to the Second Castle forcing him to head to another castle. Here Taro and Jiro's forces attack; Taro is killed and Jiro takes his place as dominant warlord; Hidetora escapes with his fool but Jiro still wants him dead anybody familiar with Shakespearian tragedies will know that there won't be a happy ending for any major character.As with his previous adaptions of Shakespeare plays director Akira Kurosawa does a brilliant job transferring the stories to Feudal Japan their themes fit the era perfectly. It explores the idea of revenge as Lady Kaede, Taro's wife whose family was killed and lands taken by Hidetora, seeks to destroy the family from within. Likewise it shows the thirst for power as Taro then Jiro try to destroy their elderly father despite the fact that he has handed over all the real power. The battle scenes have an epic feel; especially when Hidetora is the sole survivor as the castle burns and arrows fly past him. Hidetora's subsequent descent into inevitable madness is shown as he travels through various places he destroyed on his rise to power. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; you don't have to be a fan of Shakespeare or familiar with Kurosawa's other films to enjoy this.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",9,0,2,27 May 2016
Cube," Caught in a strange maze
","This Canadian horror movie opens with a man in a strange room; before we can learn anything about him he is literally sliced and diced in a wire trap. We then get introduced our potential protagonists; Quinten, Leven, Worth, Holloway and Rennes; most of them awaken in a similar room and they are soon joined by Rennes; he has obviously been there longer and explains what he knows to them and us. They are in what appears to be a giant maze made of interconnecting rooms, some of which are booby-trapped. He believes he has found a way to detect the traps; throwing a boot into the room sets of the sensors that trigger the traps. Unfortunately for him not all the sensors are the same and he is soon killed leaving the others to figure out a way to identify the trapped rooms. Leven believes that they are indicated by the code numbers on the entrance hatches to each room; of course it isn't quite as obvious as it first appears. As they travel through the rooms, tempers fray and they learn more about each other and the structure they are caught in; one of them designed the outer casing, for reasons he didn't know, so they know it is a cube. They also meet another person, the autistic Kazan. As tensions rise it becomes clear that it isn't only the traps they have to worry about; one of them will do anything to make sure they get out, including murder.The strength of this film is that we know so little about why these people have been placed in this strange maze and nothing about why it was built in the first place. It becomes apparent that each of them has skills that could prove useful; but why them and not someone with similar skills isn't answered. It is this that makes the set up creepy; if we knew who built the cube or why it wouldn't be as effective; all we need to know is that somebody had it built and now these people are caught in it. The cast of less well-known actors does a solid enough job portraying the varied reactions of their characters to the situation they are in. The use of different colours for the rooms nicely creates the idea that they really are in a huge maze of room rather than filming in a single room where the colours could be changed. The opening scene brilliantly grabs our attention and tells us just how dangerous the place is and the tension is maintained nicely almost until the end; then things get a bit too melodramatic as it becomes clear that one of them is very dangerous we even get the cliché of the bad guy, who we thought had been lost or killed, appearing again at the last moment to attack the survivors just as they are about to escape rather than getting out of the cube with them. Overall an enjoyable and creative horror film let down by the ending.",7,0,1,29 June 2015
Tarzan," Action, excitement and romance in Disney's version of Tarzan
","As this Disney classic opens a couple and their young baby are shipwrecked on the African coast. Nearby in the jungle a mother gorilla loses her baby to a leopard. Shortly afterwards she hears the human baby crying; when she gets to him it appears that his parents have been killed by the leopard. She decides to adopt him, and names him Tarzan. Against the will of Kerchak, the leader of the gorilla family, he is raised to adulthood. During this time he befriends young gorilla Terk and a baby elephant named Tantor. He grows up believing that he is a gorilla but one day gunfire is heard; he investigates and meets the first people he has seen since he was a baby; an explorer, his daughter Jane, and a hunter. After an incident with a troop of baboons he rescues Jane and is more than a little fascinated by her! Soon he will have to decide whether his future lies in the jungle with the gorillas or back with mankind. He will also have to confront the threat posed by greedy men who seek to profit by capturing his gorilla family.This film is a lot of fun; if you want action, a sense of danger and a touch of romance then you should be most satisfied. The scenes where Tarzan and Jane are chased through the jungle are genuinely thrilling thanks to high quality, very kinetic animation that leaves the viewer feeling as though they are swinging through the jungle with our protagonists. Similarly there is a surprising level of threat for a UK-U rated film... there is a gripping opening scene where baby Tarzan is rescued from the leopard, the aforementioned baboon chase and a gripping finale. Given the rating it is all bloodless of course. The romance between Tarzan and Jane is tender and rather fun. The animation is of a high quality throughout with 2D characters fitting into a more 3D world. The voice cast which includes plenty of familiar names did a fine job bringing their characters to life. The songs, from Phil Collins are pretty good and fit in with the action rather than feeling like musical interludes between exciting scenes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this for fans of Disney or of animated family friendly action.",9,2,2,4 December 2019
Easy A," Emma Stone shines in this fine teen comedy
","Olive is an ordinary Californian high school girl whose life is thrown into disarray after one little lie; wanting to get out of going camping with her best friend she claims to have a date with a college boy. Afterwards her friend wants all the juicy details; Olive says nothing happened but isn't believed. Getting bored of denying it she finally admits that she slept with the non-existent boy. That might have been the end of it but her confession was overheard by the school's resident bible-basher and soon everybody knows of her sinful ways. At first she rather enjoys the attention and even plays on it by letting people believe she also had sex with a boy who everybody thought was gay. Soon every boy who wants everybody to think he has been with a girl is paying her for the privilege of saying they'd slept with her. Inevitably things quickly get out of hand but by then getting anybody to believe the truth will be almost impossible especially when so many have benefited from the lies.In many ways this feels like a classic '80s high school movie, which is of course deliberate; at one point our protagonist tells us how she wishes her life was like those portrayed in various films of that era. The story is enjoyable with plenty of laughs from start to finish. The way it is linking to the classic book 'The Scarlet Letter' which Olive's class just happen to be studying is well handled and fun as well as giving Olive an excuse to wear some interesting clothes complete with a large red 'A'. Emma Stone carries the film in the role of Olive; there is barely a moment when she isn't on screen. She does a great job keeping the situation believable and making her character the most sympathetic even though it was her 'little lies' that caused her problems. The rest of the cast is solid too; most notably Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play Olive's somewhat embarrassing, hippyish parents. The conclusion ending, where Olive finds actual romance, may be a little cliché but even this is handled well with a very deliberate nod to 'The Breakfast Club'. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected and would definitely recommend it to anybody wanting a modern take on the classic teen movie.",8,0,0,20 March 2016
Apollo 13," A gripping real-life story of a near disaster in space
","On the 21st of July 1969 man first walked on the moon; that was the Apollo 11 mission, a few months later NASA is preparing for the third mission to the moon; Apollo 13. That mission is to be flown by Apollo 8 veteran Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise, who were originally due to fly the Apollo 14 mission. They train for the flight then, a matter of days before the launch, Mattingly is grounded because he may have the measles. He is replaced by standby astronaut Jack Swigert. This isn't the last of their problems by a long way. There is a problem with a rocket shortly after launch but that doesn't threaten the mission. Three days later when all appears to be going well Mission Control orders Swigert to stir the oxygen tanks; something goes wrong and there is an explosion. It soon becomes clear that they will not be landing on the moon; success will just be getting back to Earth. Everything from now on is far from routine as the crew, and those on the ground must solve problems that had never been envisaged.Given that this film is based on real events and I knew how it ultimately ended it is surprisingly gripping. The depiction of the events in space are particularly good; we get a real feel of what the crew are going through as conditions in their cramped living quarters deteriorates. Even those who know how the story ends are likely to learn new details such as the way everybody on the ground worked to find solutions to the various unforeseen problems and Mattingly tries out various ideas on a simulator. The biggest revelation for me was the fact that until things went wrong the American public seemed so indifferent to the mission so much so that the crew's broadcast from space wasn't aired by the TV networks. The cast does a fine job; Tom Hanks is great as Lovell and is ably supported by Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as crewmates Haise and Swigert. Those 'on the ground' impress to; most notably Ed Harris as mission controller Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as Mattingly. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody interested in the Apollo 13 story or gripping tales of men struggling to overcome adversity in general.",9,1,2,21 July 2017
Fast Five," Fast & Furious 5
","After Brian and Mia help Dom Toretto escape from a prison transport the three of them flee to Rio de Janeiro where they meet Dom's old friend Vince. He has a job for them; steal some fast cars that are being transported by trainÂ… what none of them know is that the cars have been seized by the US DEA and the person wanting them stolen is local drug lord Hernan Reyes. It becomes apparent that they are only really after one of the cars. Dom and his friends take that car and discover why it is so important; the chip in the car's GPS system includes data that gives the location of all the locations where Reyes stores his ill earned money. Dom decides that they will steal the lot but before they do that they will have to assemble a team of specialists. He and Brian will also have to avoid capture by agent Luke Hobbs and his team who believe Dom and Brian were responsible for the deaths of DEA agents on the train.This is a fine fifth instalment in this apparently endless franchise. This one is less about cars than the previous films although they obviously play a key role. Instead we get more conventional action with fighting, shootouts and finally an impressive heist. The action is nicely spread throughout the film and is suitably varied. It all leads to a spectacular, if somewhat unlikely, chase where Dom, Brian and the team race away from countless corrupt Rio cops and Reyes' men while dragging a massive vault through Rio leaving a trail of destruction as they go. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have developed a great chemistry over course of the series and are on top form here. Dwayne Johnson is a welcome addition to the cast as Hobbs as is Elsa Pataky as Brazilian police officer Elena Neves; hopefully both will return in future instalments; the ending suggests that they probably will. The Rio setting is used well without overdoing the 'Tourist Board' shots. As well as great action there are some good laughs; the black guy claiming to be a while guy with a 'great tan' was hysterical as the line was so well delivered. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody who loves over-the-top action but don't want anything too unpleasant.",8,0,0,13 February 2017
Fantastic Four," Less than Fantastic: watch 'The Incredibles' instead.
","Not having read the comics this is based on I can't say how well the story compares or if the actors portraying the characters were similar enough their comic counterparts. The first part of the film showed us how the four heroes and their adversary gained their superpowers, it does this reasonably well unfortunately it doesn't give us any real insight in to their characters.Of the five main characters only Michael Chiklis's 'The Thing' inspired any interest perhaps because he was the only actor who didn't look like he was hired for his good looks. The other characters were fairly forgettable; Ioan Gruffudd's Mr Fantastic didn't live up to his name, I was far more impressed with him on TV's 'Hornblower' series than here, Jessica Alba who has been good in other things seemed to be there solely to appeal adolescent male viewers but it takes more than looking good in her undies to make the character interesting, Chris Evan's character the Human Torch was just annoying, he acted more like a twelve year old attention seeker than an astronaut and finally Julian McMahon's Doom is never going to be remembered as one of the great, or even good, super villains.The four heroes of the film seems to spend more time arguing with each other than doing anything interesting which seemed more annoying than entertaining and when they do something it is hardly world saving; just saving a few people after an accident which was caused by one of the four anyway, likewise Doom doesn't do anything world threatening, he merely kills a banker then goes after the four heroes.I'd only recommend this if you have to see all super hero films or want something that isn't too scary for the children... although if I was picking a super hero film for youngsters I'd pick 'The Incredibles' as that had far better characters who seemed much more human even though it isn't live action.",4,0,2,22 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Best 'Twilight' film so far
","As this, the third instalment of the 'Twilight Saga' gets underway a vampire is at large in the city of Seattle; it transpires that he isn't hunting though; he is creating new vampires to form an army. Meanwhile back in the town of Forks vampire Edward Cullen is proposing to his girlfriend Bella Swan; she isn't in a rush to marry but does want him to make her a vampire; something he doesn't wish to do. Things are complicated somewhat by the fact that her friend, the werewolf Jacob, is deeply in love with her and believes that she could love him too despite her protestations to the contrary. When the Cullen clan learns that there is an army being raised in Seattle that intends to come after them and Bella they prepare for battle; a battle that if they hope to win they will have to get help from their natural enemies the werewolves! When the battle comes they learn that there is an old enemy behind the new army; an enemy who wants Edward to suffer.After the somewhat disappointing 'New Moon' things get a lot better here; there is a good sense of atmosphere and the young vampires make a good enemy; as does the person behind them. The love triangle took up a bit more time than I would have preferred but given that it is meant to be a romance I can hardly complain. The special effects were decent but at times felt a little too obvious; especially as the werewolves transformed from human to CGI wolves in a fraction of a second. The cast do a good enough job although I wish Taylor Lautner, who played Jacob, had kept his shirt on a bit more seeing him like that reminded me that I'm not in the target demographic for this film! Overall I'd say fans of the series will almost certainly love this and those who dislike 'Twilight' won't although why anybody that hated it would still be watching by part three is a mystery unless they are being forced to watch by their teenage daughters.",8,1,7,22 February 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," A thrilling, action packed sequel
","Opening four days after the first film ended we see retired hitman John Wick retrieving his car... inevitably this includes a fair amount of violence. Following this prologue he returns home and is approached by Santino D'Antonio, a senior Mafioso who wants John to do a job for him... go to Rome and kill his sister so he can take the top position in their organisation. John declines despite having given the man his marker. Soon it becomes clear he has no choice. The job isn't going to be easy as his target is well protected and Santino doesn't want any loose ends... Wick is considered a loose end.The first film may have had more emotional depth but that doesn't mean this is inferior. It is action packed from start to finish. There are only brief lulls in the action as the job is explained and Wick gets the equipment he needs for the job. Even these quieter scenes are fun as Wick and his arms supplier talk about firearms as if he were discussing what to eat with a waiter at an upmarket restaurant. The action scenes are full-on with numerous bad guys being shot, stabbed and even dispatched with a pencil. It is delightfully over the top at times; I loved how just about every other person in New York appeared to be a hitman keen to get the seven million dollar reward for killing Wick. Keanu Reeves does a fine, no-nonsense, job as Wick and the rest cast are solid even if their roles are much smaller. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of full on action.",8,1,4,5 January 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," A vampire tragedy
","This film opens in modern day San Francisco as Louis, a man claiming to be a vampire, starts to tell his story to a journalist. His story begins in New Orleans in 1791; Louis is a wealthy plantation owner but he can't get over the loss of his wife and child a year previously. He deliberately puts himself in dangerous situations but rather than getting himself killed he meets the vampire Lestat. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire but he seems no happier and can't bring himself to feed on people; instead he survives by drinking the blood of rodents; something that disgusts Lestat. Eventually he feeds on the housemaid before heading to a plague infected area of New Orleans. Here he bites the young Claudia, Lestat then turns her into a vampire. Louis treats her like a daughter but as the years pass she has difficulties accepting the fact that she will always be a child and eventually takes her revenge on Lestat for turning her into a vampire. Louis and Claudia then travel to the Old World looking for other vampires; what they find isn't what they hoped for.Vampire films usually centre on those seeking to destroy them of their potential victims so it is interesting to see the story told from the point of view of a vampire. Brad Pitt does a fine job as the emotionally tormented Louis and Tom Cruise is impressive as he plays against type as Lestat. Young Kirsten Dunst is great as Claudia; beautifully portraying the girl who is doomed to never grow up. The story is told in an interesting way and the old New Orleans setting provided plenty of atmosphere. As one would expect from a vampire film there is some bloody violence although less than one might expect. The action is important but not as important as the characters and looking at the question of what it means to be a vampire. Overall this is an impressive film that fans of the vampire genre are likely to enjoy.",8,4,4,2 August 2016
Jackie Brown," Tarantino's third film
","Gun dealer Ordell Robbie has half a million dollars; the problem is that the money is in Mexico and he needs it moved to Los Angeles. To this end stewardess Jackie Brown is bringing it in $50,000 at a time; all is going well until she is arrested with the money and a small quantity of cocaine. Ordell goes to bail bondsman Max Cherry and gets her out of jail if he is to use her to get the rest of the money out of Mexico the police will have to let Jackie return to work. To persuade them she tells them that she will help them get Ordell is she playing them, Ordell or both?.This, Quentin Tarantino's third film, feels different to his others despite the familiar themes; this is probably because it is based on a book by Elmore Leonard rather than being an original story. This is not a problem though; it is the sort of film Tarantino's fans should enjoy but also one that can be enjoyed by those who are less keen on his other works. The story manages to be tense and at times shocking but it also has moments of humour. The cast does a fine job; Pam Greer is great as the eponymous Jackie Brown and Samuel Jackson is equally good as Ordell; a character who is more likable than one might expect given that he is a murderer and a gun smuggler. They are ably supported by a cast that includes Robert De Nero, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton and Robert Forster. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching; assuming you aren't put off by the amount of swearing.",9,5,6,13 May 2016
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Very silly but lots of fun!
",This film where the Monty Python team take multiple roles to bring the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to the screen is as hilarious as one would expect; it is packed with quotable lines and memorable scenes once watched nobody will forget the Black Knight who won't let a mere flesh wound stop him fighting! The Knights who say Ni or the killer rabbit! The brave knights will encounter these threats and many more as they undertake a god-given quest to find the Holy Grail.The Monty Python team do a great job here; how they managed to avoid laughing in every scene they shot I don't know; as the knights 'ride' across the land no actual horses of course they just bang two coconut halves together! There are some fight scenes that might disturb the squeamish but the blood spurts are almost cartoonish so shouldn't bother most viewers; I watched it with my twelve year old nephew and he just laughed! If you haven't watched this yet you really should to find out what all the fuss is about and if you have seen it watch it again as it stands repeat viewings although I'm sure most people who have seen it will know that already.,9,1,2,11 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the six
","Like most children who loved Star wars when it was first released I looked forward to the next big screen instalment of the saga. I was not disappointed. The action started almost immediately and keeps up throughout the film till the climactic light sabre battle. We are also introduced to the new interesting characters Yoda, Lando and the Emperor himself.As the film begins the rebels are on the run, hiding on the barren ice planet of Hoth and the empire is dispatching droids to search the galaxy for them. One lands not far from Luke and he sets off to investigate but before he can get far he is attacked by a yeti-like creature which drags him off to an ice cave. Luke manages to escape but it is too late for him to get back to the base and it looks like he might freeze to death. Luckily for him Han is out searching for him and eventually finds him just after he has a vision of his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi who tells him to seek a Jedi master called Yoda on the planet Dagobah. Once back at the base the soon learn that the Empire has discovered where they are and start to evacuate. While this is occurring they must hold off an attack by imperial walkers which are attempting to destroy the shield protecting the base. Eventually the base falls but not before our heroes can escape.At this point the action splits, Luke and R2 fly to Dagobah and Han, Chewie, Princess Leah and C3PO flee in the Millennium Falcon. When Luke arrives on Dagobah he discovers the planet is one huge swamp into which his X-wing sinks. He and R2 soon find a strange creature who says that he can take them to Yoda, of course it turns out that he is Yoda, after some persuasion he begins to train Luke. Meanwhile back on the Falcon things aren't going according to plan; when ambushed by imperial star destroyers they discover that the hyper-drive isn't working so must hide in a dangerous asteroid field. Flying into cave on one of the larger asteroids the attacked by strange creatures that feed on the ships power cables, when they go outside to remove them they discover that the cave itself isn't what they thought it to be so must flee once more into the path of the imperial forces. Being a crafty pilot Han manages to escape from them but is pursued by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.Needing repairs they head to Cloud City in the nearby Bespin system. Here they are met by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian who offers to help them. Unfortunately for them Darth Vader got there sooner and made a deal with Lando. Meanwhile Luke has a vision that his friends are in danger and ends his training early to go and help, despite Yoda's warning that he is at risk from the dark side of the force and could make things worse. When he gets there he confronts Vader who tells him something that goes against everything he thought to be true... in the very unlikely event that you don't know already I'll avoid spoiling it.Like the original film this is full of excellent special effects but isn't swamped with excessive CGI like the more recent prequels. The acting and direction are both pretty good. Being the middle act of the original trilogy it is much darker in tone than the first film and the ending can hardly be called happy. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody regardless of their age, it is one of the few sequels to improve on the first film of its series.",10,1,3,7 October 2008
Minions," Good silly fun
","This standalone film follows the Minions, who were first seen in 'Despicable Me'. We see how they have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, always trying to find the most evil beings to serve and then accidentally kill! Eventually they can find nobody to serve and as the centuries pass they fall into a depression. One day Minion Kevin decides to do something about it; he, along with sidekicks Stuart and Bob set off to find a new evil master to serve. They find themselves in New York in 1968; there they hear that Villain-con is taking place in Orlando. They make their way there and find themselves working for top villain Scarlet Overkill. She has plans to take over England; the first stage is to get the Minions to steal the crown not surprisingly things don't go quite as Scarlet hoped and then the Minions are in her sights.The little yellow minions were one of the highlights of the' Despicable Me' films so it isn't a surprise that they got their own film. The main story isn't particularly original but that isn't too much of a problem as it is just an excuse to put the minions in a variety of amusing situations where all their attempts to help their new mistress lead her to think they are actually working against her. Most of these set pieces are pretty funny in a way that should amuse children of all ages and adults who enjoy slapstick silliness. The '60s setting provides a good excuse to incorporate music of the era; sometimes sung in the minions' gibberish! The story ends nicely in a way that links into 'Despicable Me'. The animation is impressive with good character designs and detailed backgrounds. Overall I'd say this was a lot of fun and would recommend it even if it isn't quite up to the quality of 'Despicable Me' it is very silly but it is also a lot of fun.",8,0,0,3 December 2017
Aladdin," A fun Disney adventure with plenty of laughs and solid songs
","This classic Disney film is centred on the eponymous Aladdin, a street urchin in the city of Agrabah. Here he survives by stealing food, along with his monkey, Abu. His life is about to change because of two people from the palace. One is Jafar, the scheming Royal Vizier, who needs a 'diamond in the rough' to retrieve a magical lamp from the 'Cave of Wonders'. The other is Princess Jasmine who must marry in three days but hasn't found a suitable princely suitor. Fed up with the restrictive life in the palace she dresses in peasant clothes and goes into the city, where she meets Aladdin. Events lead to him being captured and forced to enter the Cave of Wonders; here he finds the lamp and releases the genie inside... it offers him three wishes. There are a few catches so Aladdin must use the wishes wisely... he must also avoid Jafar who wants the genie's power.I really enjoyed this Disney animation. The story provides a fine mix of thrills, romance, comedy and solid songs. Aladdin himself is a likeable male lead and Jasmine is a good female lead. Jafar is a great villain, menacing without being too scary for younger viewers. However it is the genie, voiced by the Robin Williams on great form, who steals the show whenever he is on screen. As one would expect the animation is of a high quality; with 2D characters impressively immersed in 3D scenes. The songs are so good you'll likely find yourself humming them afterwards. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of quality animation.",9,1,1,16 December 2019
Incredibles 2," Perhaps not as incredible as the original but still great
","Following on from events of the first film the authorities still believe the damage caused by supers is more expensive than the cost of the original crimes. Wealthy businessman Winston Deaver wants to bring back the superheroes so, along with his sister Evelyn, an inventor, proposes to have Elastigirl be recorded fighting crime. She is selected as she causes the least collateral damage. She is soon successful in preventing a disaster and identifies a new villain... the 'Screen Slaver'. This individual is able to hypnotise anybody looking at a controlled TV screen. Meanwhile Mr Incredible is babysitting the children; something that becomes difficult as baby Jack-Jack's powers start to emerge; if that weren't enough daughter Violet is having boy problems. Ultimately the family will have to work together again if they are to defeat the Screen Slaver and save the reputations of those with super powers.I really enjoyed the original film so was a little nervous that this might prove a disappointment... while I don't think it is quite as good as the first I still think it is a great film. I liked how it followed on from the events of the original before leading into the new story. While the ultimate identity of the Screen Slaver probably won't surprise too many viewers that isn't really a problem... I'm sure younger viewers will enjoy identifying the villain before our protagonists. Having Mr Incredible and Elastigirl separate for much of the film worked effectively; she got to showcase her abilities in exciting chases and fights while he provided more comic moments as he struggles to cope with the children's various needs. More laughs are provided by Jack-Jack; especially as he battles a racoon that was raiding their rubbish bin. Later on there is a good sense of danger but nothing too scary for younger viewers. As one would expect from Pixar the animation is spectacular, especially during the action scenes. The voice cast does a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to all fans of animation looking for a great family film.",9,2,2,27 December 2019
Sin City," A Live Action Comic
","Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power.",9,3,4,13 May 2008
Saboteur," A gripping wartime thriller
","This wartime thriller begins in an aircraft factory in Los Angeles where worker Barry Kane is wrongly accused of starting a fire that caused severe damage to the plant and killed his closest friend. He believes the real killer is a man called Fry, and what we've seen certainly suggests that is the case. Knowing that there is no way he can prove his innocence in Los Angeles he sets off to find Fry; his only clue to his whereabouts a postcard he saw briefly when he bumped into Fry. This clue leads him to the ranch of Charles Tobin; he denies all knowledge of anybody called Fry but in a fortunate case of happenstance Tobin's young granddaughter takes some papers out of his jacket and Kane sees that one that confirms that he does know Fry; it mentions a place called Soda City. Tobin calls the police and Fry is arrested but soon manages to escape despite being in handcuffs. He makes his way to the house of a blind man who surprisingly believes his story and asks his niece Pat to take him to the blacksmiths to cut his cuffs off. She is less trusting and decides to take him to the police; he overpowers here though and eventually gets to Soda City with her in tow. Here they are separated when members of Fry's organisation turn up; Kane bluffs that he is the saboteur after all a they take him on to New York where there next act of sabotage is due to take place. Pat makes her way to the police but they are also working for Tobin and his group. Kane and Pat are reunited in New York where they learn that the saboteurs are part of a fascist group that includes some of the city's most noted citizens. They may now know where the attack is due to take place but before they can do anything about it they will have to escape from their captors! This was a solid thriller despite not featuring a well known cast; in fact not casting a star in the role of Kane probably helped as it gave him the feel of an ordinary man caught up in events rather than that of a hero. There are a series of exciting moments from the opening fire till a dramatic final confrontation on the outside of the statue of liberty; a scene that would foreshadow the more famous scene on Mount Rushmore in 'North by Northwest'. This is a particularly tense scene that is sure to unnerve acrophobes! Being made at the height of the war it isn't surprising that there is some propaganda to be found here; there is a clear message that just because somebody is a pillar of the community it doesn't mean they can't be a danger; thankfully this isn't too heavy handed and doesn't feel particularly forced. This might not be one of Hitchcock's best known films but is certainly well worth watching.",8,0,1,27 June 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," A solid horror from Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard
","Like so many horror films this features a group of good-looking young people going to a remote location together where bad things will inevitably happen; in this case the titular cabin in the woods. There is something different about the location though; they think they are all alone but the viewer knows that they have been selected, prepared and their every move is being watched and manipulated by a team of people whose motives are initially unknown. Once at the cabin they settle in and as they sit around the door to a cellar blows open. They explore and find a variety of strange artefacts. These include a dairy that one of the girls starts to read; it was written over a hundred years ago by a girl who was abused by her sadistic family. As she reads a section in Latin the ground outside opens up and this family rises from their graves with the intention of killing the unwitting young people. Things soon get nasty as they are picked off one by one as they try to get away.This film deconstructs the horror genre as 'Scream' did many years before; it was done in an entirely different way though. If it was just red-neck zombie killers killing college students in the woods it would have been less interesting but knowing that somebody is behind it all made it more interesting as we don't initially know why they are doing it which adds a degree of mystery. There are some good twists along the way as well as plenty of scares although nothing too scary. While it is only rated '15', in the UK, it is pretty gory at times the ending is incredibly bloody! I liked how the film played with clichés of the genre; notably the order in which people die and the fact that one of them might be allowed to survive. There are plenty of nods to other films but it doesn't really matter if you haven't seen those films. The cast does a fine job making us believe in their characters as they deal with their unlikely but deadly situation. Overall an enjoyable horror film with scares and humour that has plenty of interesting twists.",8,3,6,6 December 2016
Spectre," All the thrills one hopes for in a Bond Film
","As this, the forth of the Daniel Craig era Bond films opens we find Bond in Mexico City on the Day of the Dead. The camera tracks a man in a skeleton costume as he, and the woman he is with, walk through the crowd and into a hotel; the man removes his mask to reveal that he is in fact Bond. He excuses himself and goes for a rooftop walk. He then watches two men talking in the building opposite before opening fire moments later the building explodes! The target, Marco Sciarra, escapes with Bond in pursuit; he catches up with him just as he scrambles aboard a helicopter and a fight to the death ensues over the crowded Zocolo Square.After the credits Bond is back in London where M reprimands him for his unofficial operation in Mexico before telling him that their department is to be amalgamated into MI5 under the leadership of a man Bond insists on calling 'C'. C believes that the OO section is obsolete; the future of intelligence will involve intercepting communications and drones to this end he intends to create 'Nine Eyes' a group of nine nations that will share all such data. Bond is told to stay in London but inevitable doesn't. We learn that the previous M had sent a posthumous message to Bond telling him to kill Sciarra then go to his funeral. Here, in Rome, he meets the dead man's wife and learns that he was part of a secret criminal organisation.Over the course of his investigation he learns that this organisation is known as SPECTRE and it has somehow been behind the events in the previous three films. He also learns that more than one person he assumed was dead is in fact alive; including the head of SPECTRE Franz Oberhauser; somebody he knew as a child but now calls himself Ernst Stavro Blofeld! As with all Bond films there is a Bond Girl and this one is Madeleine Swann, the daughter of SPECTRE member Mr. White who is being targeted for assassination by the group.At two and a half hours in length this is one of the longer Bond films but at no time did I find myself wondering how much longer it would be going on. The viewer is immediately gripped in the opening scene, which appears to be one long tracking shot. We then get an explosion, chase and finally a fight in a helicopter all before the opening credits! From then on we get a number of great set-pieces including car chases, Bond rescuing Madeleine from would-be abductors as he chases their cars in a plane and numerous fights and shootouts. While the action is great there is also a solid story that nicely links back to the previous three films and (re) introduces the most famous of Bond villains in a way that gives him some back story. The cast does a fine job; Daniel Craig is on top form as Bond, a role he has made his own; while we instinctively know he will prevail there are moments where he makes us believe his character is in real and imminent danger. Christoph Waltz is suitable villainous as Blofeld, Andrew Scott is delightfully unpleasant as C and Léa Seydoux makes a fine Bond Girl as Madeleine Swann. Talking of Bond Girls it was nice to see Monica Bellucci as Sciarra's widow showing that you don't have to be young to be sexy. Dave Bautista was also rather fun as the thuggish assassin Mr. Hinx; his stature and lack of time for small talk reminded me of the character Jaws from the Roger Moore era but without the campness he even got a brilliant send-off that was clearly a nod to the film 'Jaws'!Amid the action there are some scenes that may disturb some viewers; including an eye-gouging and Bond being tortured. This is balanced by plenty of humour though; most notably Bond's car that doesn't have all the weaponry loaded as he expected. There has been talk of this being Craig's last Bond film, while I hope that is not the case, the conclusion would make a fitting conclusion to his time as Bond. Overall a really fine entry to the Bond series; up there with the best.",10,29,64,27 October 2015
Joy," A top-notch cast make the story of a woman who invented a new mop gripping
","This film tells the story of Joy Mangano, When she was younger she was top of her class at school but now she is a single mother of two whose mother, grandmother and ex-husband live share her house. Then one day, after cutting her hand wringing a mop that she'd used after a glass of wine was dropped she came up with a revolutionary idea... a super-absorbent mop that features a wringing mechanism and washable head. With the help of her father's wealthy new girlfriend she deals with a possibly patent conflict and goes into production. At first she can't get anybody to buy the product but following an appearance on the QVC shopping channel orders flood in. This isn't the great success she hoped for though; she must fund the production and then makers of a key part raise their prices... things are about to get tough for Joy.I must be honest; if I'd just read a synopsis of the film without knowing who was in it I'd have rejected it as a subject for an afternoon made-for-TV movie... perhaps in other hands it would have been but a top notch cast and director David O. Russell make it surprisingly gripping. Jennifer Lawrence goes a great job as the eponymous Joy; making her character an ordinary person viewers can empathise with. There is fine support from Robert De Niro, Isabella Rossellini, Virginia Madsen and Bradley Cooper. The story is told at a good pace and concentrates on Joy's struggles at home and to get her mop sold without added any unnecessary hints at romance. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; especially if you are a fan of Jennifer Lawrence's work.",9,0,1,28 May 2019
Moon," A great first film
","I had heard good things about this film before I sat down to watch it but thankfully I hadn't heard about the ending so was constantly wondering what was happening. Set in a mining base on the far side of the Moon Sam is the sole operative and he is coming to the end of his three-year contract; unfortunately for him he is involved in an accident while outside the base. He then wakes up back in the infirmary and is told by Gerty; the base robot, that he was injured and mustn't venture outside until he has fully recovered; he disobeys this order and goes out and finds his crashed vehicle with himself still in side! Something strange is clearly happening although it takes some time to establish just what that something is. The two Sams now have a limited time to discover just what is happening before the 'rescue' team arrive.Duncan Jones has made an excellent debut film with a fine performance from Sam Worthington as the two Sams; apart from him the only other major role was Kevin Spacey who provided the voice of Gerty. As the film progressed I was reminded of '2001: A Space Odyssey' due to the potentially sinister computer, 'Solaris' as there was a possibility that things weren't quite real and even of 'Outland' as the clock ominously counted down to the arrival of the so called 'rescue team'. While I was strongly reminded of these films I didn't feel like this was in any way a rip off as the story here differed in significant ways which I won't mention as that could spoil a first time viewer's enjoyment. If you are a fan of serious science fiction without needing space battles, laser blasters and giant robots then I'm sure you will love this film.",9,1,8,20 April 2011
True Romance," A blood splattered romance
","When Clarence Worley goes out on his birthday to watch a martial arts triple feature he doesn't expect it to be a life changing evening but it is. Here he bumps into Alabama, a beautiful young blonde, and they immediately hit it off; one thing leads to another and she stays the night. It turns out that their meeting wasn't chance, she was a call girl hired by his boss; he isn't upset though; in fact he falls in love with her and she falls for him; so much so they are married the next day. Clarence goes to collect her stuff but after a confrontation with her now ex-pimp he kills the man and picks up the wrong case. Instead of a case of clothes the newlyweds find themselves with half a million dollars' worth of uncut cocaine. Clarence has no idea how to sell it but a friend of a friend might have an idea so the two of them set off for LA; not knowing that the coke actually belonged to the Mafia and they want it back.This action film brings together director Tony Scott and writer Quentin Tarantino; which leads to slick violent action and some snappy banter. The story isn't full of twists and turns but that isn't a bad thing; the only real question is 'will Clarence and Alabama get away with it or not?' and that is what it is all about. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette do a fine job in the lead roles and they are ably supported by some well-known actors in the secondary roles; these include Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper and Christopher Walken they may not be on the screen for long but they put in memorable performances. If you like films with plenty of action and laughs that come naturally rather than from forced situations you should love this just don't buy the DVD for your granny who likes nice romances!",9,1,2,16 June 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," A modern fairy tale
","I'd heard plenty of good reviews of this film before watching it and obviously knew it had raked in the Oscars but that often isn't a great indicator of a great film, in this case however I think it deserved all of the critical acclaim.Dev Patel plays Jamal Malik, a young man who grew up in the slums of Bombay and is one question away from winning the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'. It seems to those running the show, and to the police that he must have cheated after all it isn't very likely that an uneducated boy from the slums could get further than anybody else had done in the programme. What follows is a series of fantastical episodes each showing how an event in his life had taught him the answers to the questions.Throughout most of the escapades Jamal is accompanied by his brother Salim who later gets involved with gangsters in the now renamed Mumbai. They are also joined by a young slum-girl called Latika who is loved by Jamal; each time they get separated he does all he can to find her again, even after several years of separation.The acting is pretty good, especially from the three young children in the earliest flashbacks who were thoroughly enchanting. While it is sold as a feel-good film there is an awful lot feel-bad before things turn out as they do, of course this makes the feel-good feel all the better. I really enjoyed this film and would certainly recommend it to any adult wanting to see something different.",10,1,5,3 August 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Completely bonkers non-stop action!
","In a post-apocalyptic world ex-cop Max is captured by a group known as the 'War Boys' who work for the tyrant Immortan Joe. Taken to their Citadel he finds himself used as a blood supply for Nux; a sick War Boy. When one of Joe's senior lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa, frees his 'wives' and drives into the desert in her war-rig the War Boys give chase accompanied by Max who is chained to one of their vehicles. After an initial confrontation Max frees himself and joins forces with Furiosa. Together with Joe's wives they head east hoping to find the Green Place. It won't be easy as Joe and all of his War Boys as well as their allies are in pursuit; he is determined to get his wives back and punish Furiosa for her treachery.If you are looking for something deep and meaningful this isn't the movie for you however if you want non-stop adrenalin-pumping mindless action then prepare to have a great time. Little time is wasted on exposition before we are thrown into the action which barely lets up till the film is over. The plot is fairly basic but that doesn't matter. The film looks great; I was immediately stunned by the burnt orange desert landscape in which the action takes place. That action is thrilling as it constantly looks as though things go badly for our protagonists. Tom Hardy does a fine job as Max but it is Charlize Theron who dominates the film as Furiosa; her character is more interesting than Max as it is her motivations that drive the narrative; Max is a victim of circumstance who finds himself along for the ride. As one might expect there is a good variety of strange vehicles and even stranger characters. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for insane non-stop action; it is certainly a welcome addition to the Mad Max series of films.",9,2,8,24 January 2016
The Breakfast Club," Possibly the best high school film ever made
","During the 1980s there were plenty of films set in US high schools; John Hughes made the best of these and 'The Breakfast Club' is a contender for the best of his films. The film takes place on a Saturday when five pupils have to spend their day in detention; they are 'brain' Brian, 'athlete' Andrew, 'basket case' Allison, 'princess' Claire and 'criminal' John. While there they are told they must write an essay about who they are and even though they are meant to sit in silence they get to know each other as the day progresses. At first they think they have nothing in common but after arguments, discussions and confrontations they discover that they aren't that different. While they are getting to know each other the teacher who is supervising them end up in the basement discussing how children have, or haven't changed over the years.The actors do a great job; with Ally Sheedy as Allison, Molly Ringwald as Claire, Emilio Estevez as Andrew, Judd Nelson as Bender, Anthony Michael Hall as Brian and Paul Gleason as disenchanted teacher Mr. Vernon. Set entirely in school there is little action; the strength of the film relies almost entirely on great dialogue excellently delivered it doesn't hurt that there is a great '80s soundtrack either! Considered a comedy there are plenty of laughs to be had but there are also several poignant scenes that are almost tear-jerking in the run up the a great feel good ending. If you have yet to see this film I strongly recommend it; it is a classic of its period and genre; a real must see.",10,7,9,17 June 2011
Contact," What would we do if contacted by an extra-terrestrial intelligence?
","From a young age Eleanor Arroway was fascinated by science and questioned whether we are alone in the universe; as an adult she is probing the depths of the universe hoping to find a sign that there is intelligent life out there. It isn't popular work and a lot of people would be happy to see her 'frivolous' project ended. She manages to get independent funding from the somewhat eccentric S. R. Hadden but even then it looks as if the project will get cancelled as permission to use a government owned facility is withdrawn. Then she discovers a signal coming from Vega, 24 light years away, it consists of a series of prime numbers and rather disturbingly footage of the opening of the 1936 Olympics in BerlinÂ… thankfully it turns out that this was the earliest TV signal of enough power to be received. Mixed in with the signal are a series of documents which when decoded give the schematics to a machine that it is speculated may transport a single person to Vega. By now politics is well into play as well as religion as some believe the project is an affront to their faith. As the project nears its conclusion the question of who should be Earth's representative must be answered and many object to Arroway being selected because of her lack of religious belief.Movies about aliens contacting us usually turn into alien invasions or at the very least as much about the aliens as humanity; this is different as it is almost entirely about what humanities reaction would be. That reaction is believably varied; in such circumstances it is likely that some would be optimistic and others fearful. As the story progresses there is some slightly unnecessary drama but that does at least serve to put Arroway in the 'pilot's seat' for the ultimate ride. Jodie Foster goes a great job as Arroway and the rest of the cast, which includes plenty of familiar faces, is impressive too. The special effects are pretty impressive; this includes both the sci-fi elements and the way archive footage of President Clinton was used to make it look as though he was talking about the issues in the film. Overall I rather enjoyed this and would recommend it to fans of 'hard' sci-fi.",8,0,1,20 November 2016
Donnie Darko," A different type of Science fiction.
","I'd heard that this film was 'different' so when I saw the DVD on offer a while back I thought I'd give it a chance. It certainly was different and in a good way, I was gripped from start to finish due to the combination of an interesting story, great acting and direction and a well chosen sound track.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager who has a vision of somebody, called Frank, in a strange rabbit costume who tells him that the world will end in twenty eight days. The next morning he wakes up to find himself on the local golf course, this is rather lucky for him as during the night an engine that fell off a plane crashed through the roof of his house and destroyed his bedroom. The accident is rather mysterious in that no plane has crashed or lost an engine, in fact the serial number of the engine matches one that is still attached to an aircraft. When he returns to school he soon befriends new girl Gretchen Ross he also floods the school one night at Frank's behest. As the twenty eight days pass more and more strange things happen and Donnie gets more and more interested in the possibility of time travel. I won't say more about the plot as I wouldn't want to spoil it too much.Some people think this isn't science fiction presumable because it doesn't feature high-tech gadgets, space travel, robots or other sci-fi standards, I think it is though as things happen which couldn't happen in normal life; such as the engine falling from the sky yet still being attached to a plane and other things which are revealed towards the end of the film.While it is Jake Gyllenhaal who carries the film mention must also be made of the other excellent cast members, including Jena Malone as Gretchen, Drew Barrymore as his English teacher, Mary McDonnell as his mother and Patrick Swayze as Jim Cunningham a rather creepy maker of inspirational films who lives locally. Richard Kelly does a great job of directing the story which he also wrote.This review is based on the original cinema version of the film, I can't compare it to the director's cut as I've not seen that.",10,4,8,27 January 2009
Pocahontas," Decent Disney animation
","This Disney animation follows English seaman Captain John Smith as he travels to Virginia to help establish a colony that will be led by Governor Ratcliffe; a fairly vile character who believes that they will find gold and he will become rich. When they get there they find no gold but as Smith explores he meets Pocahontas, the local chief's daughter. Before they met she had had a dream that she believes means her life will take an unexpected path; Smith is certainly unexpected. The two of them immediately become close but after a brief clash both the Indians and the settlers are preparing for war! If bloody conflict is to be avoided Smith and Pocahontas will have to show their respective people that they don't need to be enemies.As one would expect from Disney the animation looks really good; I particularly likes the prelude to the possible battle towards the end. There are also plenty of songs; they aren't bad but I couldn't help feeling that they held up the action a little too much at times. As well as the human characters who provide the drama there are also three animals who provide the comedy relief; these are a raccoon and a hummingbird that are friends of Pocahontas and a dog that belongs to Ratcliffe I initially feared that these creatures would be irritating but actually they were pretty funny and I suspect they will be firm favourites with younger viewers. The story is hardly complex but one can't really expect it to be in a story aimed at children; given that I was surprised when one character was killed; it was necessary for the story though and there was no blood shown so it is unlikely to disturb even the most timid of children. The voice actors did fine jobs; giving the characters proper voices rather than annoying cartoony ones. The story does deviate significantly from the story of the real Pocahontas but that doesn't stop it being a fun film with some action, a decent number of laughs and several songs.",Null,1,2,24 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," More of the same
","I had heard that this was better than the disappointing second Transformers film but to be honest I couldn't see much of a difference; the locations and one or two actors may have changed but to all intents and purposes this was just another two and a half hours of robots fighting and stuff exploding. Once again Shia LeBeouf must fight alongside the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons, this time they are after Sentinel Prime an Autobot disabled when his ship crashed into the moon. It turns out it is all a plot to rebuild their home world using humanity as slave labour.At two and a half hours this film is far too long; the action does look great with robots transforming, fighting and blowing things up; the problem was the best action isn't exciting if one doesn't care about the characters. The central character is fairly annoying; whining about how his deeds in previous films went largely unrecognised, getting jealous about his new girlfriend's boss and getting upset when government officials didn't welcome him with open arms when the Decepticons started to cause trouble again. The film's attempts at humour did nothing for me although I must admit my ten year old nephew thought they were funny! Over all I wouldn't recommend this unless you are a fan of the franchise; no doubt if you liked the previous films you'll like this too.",3,1,4,29 December 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indy faces the Nazis once more in a race for the Holy Grail
","After a brief prologue in which a young Indiana Jones tries to retrieve an artefact from a profiteering archaeologist we get on to the main story. Walter Donovan, a wealthy collector of antiquities, approaches Indy saying that he has a lead to the location of the Holy Grail, the cup Christ drank from at the last supper which some believe have the power to grant immortality to those who drink from it. Indy is initially reluctant but then he is told that another archaeologist Donovan employed has gone missing Indy's father. The first lead takes him to Venice where he meets Dr Elsa Schneider, an Austrian archaeologist. Together they find further clues that, when combined with information that Indy's father had written in his dairy, will show the Grail's location. The adventure is far from over though; before they get to the site Indy will have to rescue his father from his Nazi captors, escape in a zeppelin. Later he must fight Nazis on top of a tank and eventually navigate a series of traps, which have killed numerous people already before reaching that room that contains the Grail even now there is a final test.After the darker feel of 'Temple of Doom' this returns to the lighter tone of the original 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' this is both a strength and a weakness. On the plus side there are lots of thrilling moments that are exciting rather than scary and the Nazis always make great villains; on the down side it feels too similar to 'Raiders' with the search for another biblical artefact while going up against Nazis. Things open well; I liked how this one section managed to explain so much about Indy; most notably his whip and iconic hat. The main story contains lots of great set pieces as well as some good unforced comedy moments. The cast does a fine job; Harrison Ford is on great form as protagonist Indiana Jones and Sean Connery is a welcome addition as Indy's father. Other fine performances came from Denholm Elliott as a somewhat bumbling friend of the Joneses who gets caught up in their adventure; Julian Glover who is an effective villain. Overall I heartily recommend this for anybody looking for a fine family friendly adventure that should thrill, rather than scare, viewers of all ages except perhaps younger children.",9,0,1,22 May 2017
Back to the Future," Great sci-fi adventure for all the family
","One would have thought that a film made almost twenty five years ago about somebody travelling back in time thirty years would have dated terribly but it seems just as fresh now as when I first saw in on betamax all those years ago. I'm sure people will be enjoying it for decades to come.Michael J. Fox will almost certainly be best remembered for his role as Marty McFly, the eighties teenager who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a converted DeLorean. While much of the humour is derived from the differences between the two eras that isn't over done and it doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Not only must Marty enlist the help of his friend Dr. Brown to get him back to 1985 he must get his parents to fall in love all over again because he accidentally stopped their first meeting. This problem seems to be greater than time travel as his father is the school wimp who is constantly being harassed by the school bully Biff Tannen and his mother has fallen for him.The supporting cast do a great job too, especially Christopher Lloyd is the archetypal mad scientist Dr Brown and Lea Thompson as Marty's mother who is rather prudish in the eighties but clearly knew how to have a good time when she was a teenager.. much to Marty's surprise. In a time before everything was done with CGI the effects are great and not overused. I'd recommend this film, along with its two sequels to anybody with a sense of humour.",9,1,1,11 July 2009
Goodfellas," One of the great mob movies
","This film tells the story of Irish/Italian mobster Henry Hill; from the early days when he worked for mobsters as a teenager in the 1950s, through the sixties and seventies to his arrest in the eighties. We see the ease with which he slips into this world; the rewards and dangers it brings. During this time he works with fellow mobsters James Conway and the psychotic Tommy DeVito; he also marries Karen. While Henry isn't a killer he isn't unaware of the violent side of their business.This is often described as the greatest mob movie; I can't say that but only because there are other very well-known mob movies that I have yet to see. The story is gripping from start to finish; there are moments of humour which frequently turn to extreme danger in the blink of an eye; this is usually due to Tommy's hair-trigger temper. The violence is usually sudden and bloody; as a character points out they don't waste time talking before they waste somebody. The cast is brilliant; Joe Pesci stands out as Tommy, it is hardly surprising that he picked up an Oscar. Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro are great as Henry and James; also particularly notable are Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill and Paul Sorvino as 'Paulie' Cicero, the mobster Henry works for. Overall I'd say that this film is a must see for fans of the genre.",10,1,2,5 August 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," A roller-coaster thriller
","It didn't take long to realise that this film would be quite different from the opening scenes Maria was shot and killed, this was a major shock as Franka Potente had second billing on the cast list. While that was happening in Goa a CIA meet with an informant in Berlin is interrupted by an assassin who leaves evidence at the scene which suggests that Bourne was the killer.He returns to Europe in an attempt to discover why the CIA are trying to kill him, in the process he learns that Operation Treadstone has been terminated and that he was a suspect in a recent murder in Berlin. When he gets to Berlin he ends up playing cat and mouse with the CIA who are looking for him although this being Bourne one can never be sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.This is one of the most action packed films I've seen and the way it is filmed makes one feel part of the action rather than a mere observer. I thought Paul Greengrass's direction was top notch although people who dislike shaky camera-work would probably hate it. The acting is great, especially from Matt Damon in the title role and the always excellent Brian Cox is great as a somewhat suspect senior CIA officer. The action includes several fights, a chase through Berlin and a car chase though Moscow where Bourne has gone on a personal mission that I won't spoil here.",9,3,4,6 December 2008
The Great Gatsby," Baz Luhrmann's take on a classic American novel
","Set in the early '20s, the story is related to us by narrator Nick Carraway. He tells us of his time in New York where everybody he met was somewhat rotten, with one exception; Jay Gatsby. Carroway, an aspiring writer, is working in New York's financial industry and living in Long Island. His neighbour is the mysterious Gatsby; a man who throws lavish parties where none of the many guests are actually invited and few have actually met him; they do however have lots of stories about him; he is related to the Kaiser, he is a spy, he has even killed a man it is all speculation of course but it part of the myth that is Gatsby. Carraway is unusual; he gets an invitation there is a reason for this Gatsby was involved with his cousin Daisy five years previously and everything he has done since returning from the war has been to be reunited with her the problem is she is married to the wealthy Tom Buchanan. Now he wants Carraway to reunite them something that can only result in tragedy.Having neither read the book nor seen previous film versions I had few preconceptions about the story and some of those I did have were proved wrong! The way the story is told quickly had me gripped; the way we are drip-fed rumours about Gatsby made me wonder just what he would be like long before he appeared on screen. When he does appear it gradually becomes apparent that the man and the myth are quite different. The film delightfully captures the flamboyant feel of the era despite using modern music; it also captures the decadence where the wealthy flout the prohibition laws and party hard not too surprising given that is it directed by Baz Luhrmann. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job as the eponymous Gatsby; nicely capturing the flamboyant side of him as well as the shyness when he meets his beloved Daisy once more. Carey Mulligan is great as Daisy; the character who will ultimately prove to be Gatsby's undoing. Tobey Maguire is also good putting in an understated performance as Carraway; a man out of his element who narrates the story to us. Joel Edgerton puts in a powerful performance as the thoroughly unpleasant Tom Buchanan. Overall this film is well worth watching.",9,1,3,23 April 2015
The Birds," Creating terror from common birds
","Opening in a San Francisco pet shop, specialising in birds, we are introduced to protagonists Melanie Daniels, a wealthy socialite, and Mitch Brenner, a lawyer. It appears that he has mistaken her for the shop assistant and inquires about buying a pair of love birds for his young sister's birthday. It turns out he is playing a practical joke but she decides to play one back; using contacts she tracks him to the town of Bodega Bay where she hires a boat and surreptitiously delivers a pair love birds to his house. On the crossing back to town she is attacked by a gull; a strange occurrence but nothing it is more than a reason for Mitch to help her. Invited to dinner they become closer and it looks like this is more a rom-com than anything else; then things gets scary; a man is found dead in his house; apparently a victim of birds attacking. Some argue that this is ridiculous but soon more and more attacks take place and the whole town is in danger.This Hitchcock classic could be mistaken for a gentle romantic comedy if it weren't for the opening shot of vast numbers of birds flying past. These early scenes are fun with little to hint at what is to come. When the bird attacks begin in earnest it is quite disturbing as we see familiar species gradually building in number; most notably crows and gulls; birds than can seem menacing at the best of times! It is this that makes it so frightening. The shots of the bird attacks feature effects that while good for the time appear a little dated now however they do capture the terror of the attacks; especially in the scene where the school children are attacked. We see a major character die which leads us to believe nobody is truly safe; indeed the ending hints that the danger is far from over. The cast do a decent enough job although it isn't the best cast Hitchcock has used and some of the minor characters are somewhat weak. Overall though this isn't Hitchcock's best work it is well worth watching and if you are a fan of Hitchcock one really should see it.",8,1,2,15 January 2015
Princess Mononoke," A brilliant animation
","I'd heard good things about this film before seeing it and was not disappointed. The animation and story are excellent as one would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki film. Be warned however that this film isn't as gentle as his other films, we see several people having their heads and limbs removed although this is not shown in graphic close-up.I liked the fact that the conflict between the villagers and the forest creatures wasn't depicted as a clear cut case of good versus bad and like most of Miyazaki's films it has strong female characters that are neither damsels in distress nor trying to marry their Prince Charming like many western animated heroines.The film opens with a possessed giant boar thundering out of the forest and attacking a village. The boar is slain by Prince Ashitake but not before it wounds him. He is told that the found is part of a curse that will ultimately kill him if he doesn't leave his village and seek out the Deer God in forests far to the west.When he gets there he finds the forest creatures in conflict with the inhabitants of a village who are clearing areas of forest to find ore for their iron works. It turns out that Lady Eboshi, the leader of the village, had fired the shot that had caused the boar to be cursed. She is not a typical film villain though as she is very protective of her village and employs former prostitutes and lepers who wouldn't be treated so well elsewhere.Fighting against her is San (Princess Mononoke) a girl that has been raised by the Wolf goddess Moro in the forest and despises humans, and various forest creatures. When she attacks the iron works in a plan to kill Lady Eboshi, Ashitake intervenes to stop them killing each other. As he is taking San out of the village he is seriously wounded but she takes him to the deer god who cures this wound but not the curse.As well as these protagonist there is Jigo who has been employed my the emperor to bring back the head of the deer god as he believe it will give him the power over life and death.I can't comment on the quality of the English dubbing as I've only watched the subtitled version so far.",10,1,3,5 May 2008
Jurassic Park," Still great after almost a quarter of a century
","After a worker is killed in an accident at the dinosaur theme park 'Jurassic Park' owner John Hammond calls in experts Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler as well as mathematician Ian Malcolm to visit it the park and clear it to open to the public. 'Jurassic Park' is no ordinary theme park; it is on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica and it contains real dinosaurs! It is explained how these have been created by extracting dinosaur DNA from blood in mosquitoes preserved in amber. The first ones the visitors see are harmless herbivores but they are told that the park also contains some of the most famous carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor; something that both excites and concerns the scientists. After an introduction the visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, and the company lawyer take part in a tour of the park. As they travel things go wrong for two reasons; a tropical storm is heading for the island and, more importantly, a corrupt company employee as set up a computer program that will turn off various security systems including the electric fences that protect the guests so he can attempt to steal dinosaur DNA sell it to a competitor. Once things do go wrong those on the tour find themselves fleeing for their lives following a T Rex attack on their vehicles while those at the park headquarters try to find a way to get the systems working again. Inevitably not everybody will get out alive.Like most people who watched this in the cinema when it was new I was amazed by the special effects that brought long extinct creatures back to life; watching it again over twenty years later and they still look fantastic. If one didn't know that dinosaurs died out millions of years ago you could be excused for thinking you were watching real animals. While these were the films big selling point it would have been for nothing if we didn't also have a good story acted by a fine cast luckily we have both. The action isn't rushed; a significant amount of time is spent introducing all the main characters and explaining the characteristics of the various dinosaurs. This means that by the time everything goes wrong we care about the protagonists and know which characters to look forward to seeing die! There aren't a huge number of deaths and those there are aren't overly gruesome; the goriest moment is the brief sight of a severed arm. Despite its UK-PG rating it is surprisingly intense at times and has plenty of genuinely scary moments. The cast do an impressive job; Sam Neill and Laura Dern impress as the two leads and there are also fine performances from Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeff Goldblum and Bob Peck. Child characters are often annoying but Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are pretty good as Tim and Lex; especially the latter who is a great screamer! Overall I'd defiantly recommend this to anybody wanting a genuinely exciting film that is suitable for most ages.",10,12,14,28 June 2017
Beetlejuice," Dead funny
","When Adam and Barbara Maitland crash their car into the river they don't know how they got back home at first; then they realise they did not survive the crash! Being dead is rather confusing even when you have the handbook. They soon figure out they can't leave the house and that doesn't seem too bad until the house is sold to the Deetz family. The Maitlands take an instant disliking to Delia Deetz in particular as she sets about deciding what alterations she must have done to make the house habitable. They attempt to scare her and her husband but they can't see them. The only person who can see them is their daughter Lydia Deetz. She tells her parents about the ghosts but obviously they don't believe her... until they put on a show during the middle of a dinner party; far from scaring them off though they think having a haunted house might be an opportunity! The Maitlands seek help, first from their afterlife case worker Juno then from Bio-Exorcist Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetle Juice). He seems more of a danger to them than the Deetz family though!This film is a lot of fun in the slightly dark way one would expect from a Tom Burton film. Michael Keaton puts in a delightfully over the top performance in the title role; having seen this I'm surprised that Burton didn't cast him as The Joker in his 'Batman' film! Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are good as the Maitlands although playing ordinary people (how just happen to be dead) they get less opportunities to show what they can do. Winona Ryder is great as Lydia; one of her earliest roles and probably the one that got her noticed by the film going public. Other notable performances come from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffery Jones as Delia and Charles Deetz and Glenn Shadix who plays Delia's strange decorator/guru Otho. The film is full of great special effects; no CGI here; just great make-up, stop go animation and puppetry. Burton's regular collaborator Danny Elfman's music fits the film perfectly. The film is definitely a comedy but there are some scary moments and a little bit of swearing that means it might not be suitable for younger children... the film may be rated '15' here in the UK but I suspect if it gets re-certificated one day it will be lowered to '12' given that it is much tamer than many '12' rated films.",9,2,3,13 September 2012
Valkyrie," A gripping account of a plot to rid wartime Germany of Hitler and the Nazis
","This film tells the story of a group of German officers who have come to the conclusion that the real threat to Germany is its Chancellor; Adolf Hitler. They come up with an audacious plot that, if it succeeds, will not only kill Hitler but also ensure that the levers of power are wrested from the National Socialist party. Key to the plan is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg; he is brought in after a previous failed attempted then comes up with a plan that will use the Reich's own security forces to take control when he accuses the SS of being behind the assassination. To do this he must get Hitler himself to sign the orders modifying Operation Valkyrie; an established plan to deal with an attempted coup. He must then get a bomb close to the Hitler before getting away to initiate the actions in Berlin.Given that all but the worst educated viewers will know that Hitler was not assassinated in 1944 this film is surprisingly tense one can't help wanting the plotters to succeed even though this is based on the facts not wish fulfilment. The cast does an impressive job; especially Tom Cruise in the central role as Colonel von Stauffenberg. He is ably supported by a cast of familiar faces including the likes of Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Kenneth Branagh. Thankfully the cast didn't put on German accents ever since the TV series 'Ello Ello' it has been hard to take actors talking in English with a put on foreign accent seriously! The story is told at a good pace and at no point did I feel it was dragging. Overall I'd certainly recommend this although people expecting lots of action may be a little disappointed; this is more about plotting than action but that doesn't stop it being tense as the protagonists could be exposed at any time.",9,0,1,24 April 2016
The Simpsons Movie," Good film version of a great series
","I stopped watching 'The Simpsons' series many years ago; admittedly that was mostly due to constant repeats So when I came to watch this I'd forgotten just how funny the show can be. I don't usually laugh out loud when watching a film on my own but I did several times during this one.The pollution in Lake Springfield has got so bad that people have finally listened to Lisa and taken measures to prevent people dumping anything there... of course somebody ignores the new rules and that somebody is Homer Simpson; he dumps a huge silo of pig manure into the water which makes the pollution so bad that the Federal government decides to take action, and the action the take is to enclose the town in a huge glass dome. With the angry mob closing in on them they managed to find a way to get out of the dome and flee to Alaska while civilisation in Springfield collapses to such an extent that the government decides to just blow up the whole town and everybody in it. Marge doesn't like the sound of that so insists the family return to save their home town although homer is less keen.While the main story isn't the best imaginable it serves to provide many opportunities for laugh out loud moments, highlights included Bart's naked skateboarding, Homer and his pet pig and his encounter with an Inuit shaman. For a series well known for having celebrity guest stars it managed to keep these to a minimum which I think was wise, too many animations these days are packed with famous actors who aren't necessarily great voice actors whereas The Simpsons uses people who are proper voice actors.",9,1,1,7 February 2010
Alien: Covenant," A good but not great addition to the Alien story
","Ten years after the events in 'Prometheus' a colony ship, the 'Covenant', is taking settlers to their new home. It is seven years short of its destination when a freak event damages the ship and forces the early awakening of the ship's crew. During the repairs a signal, of clearly human origin, is received from an uncharted planet. Scans show that it is at least as habitable as their intended destination but much closer; the crew decide to investigate. A team goes down to the planet while others remain on the Covenant. Once there they find signs that it was once cultivated but no signs of any animal life. As they look for the signal two of the crew are infected with strange spores... a new alien nightmare is about to begin! As xenomorphs hatch the landing craft is destroyed; the remaining crew only survive because they are rescued by a stranger who turns out to be David, the Prometheus's android. They are not safe though.I know opinions are much divided on this film; the critic on the radio said it was the worst film on television this week while the reviewer in the newspaper picked it as the 'film of the week'... even if I wasn't a fan of the franchise that would have made me curious. While I wouldn't go to either extreme I certainly lean more towards the latter view. In many ways the story mirrors the original film with its story of space travellers being awakened earlier than expected before a transmission lures them into danger... thankfully there were also plenty of changes to keep things interesting... as well as the required amount of scariness. The story gives an interesting account of xenomorph development, although sadly certain established facts are contradicted; most notably the way these ones hatch so much faster than those in 'Alien'. The cast does a solid job; most notably Michael Fassbender in the dual roles of David and Walter, the Covenant's android; a later model. Katherine Waterston impresses as Daniels, effectively the lead human character. As one would expect the special effects are top notch. There are some weak points; the crew makes some silly choices and I doubt anybody watching won't have spotted the final twist a mile off. Overall though I thought this was a solid addition to the franchise; good but not great.",8,3,8,12 January 2020
All the President's Men," The story of two journalists who brought down a president
","This film tells to story of Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's investigation into a break in at the Democratic Party's headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington DC. From the start something looks wrong; four men have been arrested but it looks as if they were hired for the job; a cheque links one of the men with a member of the campaign to re-elect President Richard Nixon. No other papers are particularly interested in the story but The Post sticks with it and the two reporters doggedly follow the trail of clues that lead all the way to the White House and those closest to the president.This is one of the stories that most people will know about how it started, with the Watergate break-in, and who it ended, with the resignation of President Richard Nixon, but might not know too much about the details of the investigation that brought him down. There is no action as such and a relatively low sense of danger for most of the film but it is still gripping. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman do really great work as Woodward and Bernstein and the rest of the cast are also impressive. While it was made over forty years ago and depicts an investigation in a pre-internet era it doesn't feel dated. The way the story is filmed feels very real and this feeling of reality is increased by the use of actual news footage of certain events. Overall this is definitely a film to watch if you are interested in US politics, enjoy stories about investigative journalism or just want to watch a good film.",10,2,3,26 August 2018
The Wizard of Oz," A Timeless Classic
","It is hard to believe that this film is almost seventy years old, yes some of the special effects look rather dated now but not that dated. There are many films that people say everybody should see at least once in their life and in many cases those films are good but not that important, this film I genuinely think everybody should see though, preferably when they are still fairly young; although it is still a delight to watch as an adult.I'm sure most people will know the plot even if they haven't seen the film but just in case anybody doesn't I'll give a brief description. Dorothy is a girl living on a farm in Kansas with her aunt and uncle. When a mean spirited neighbour threatens to have her dog Toto put to sleep she runs away from home and meets a travelling magician who persuades her to return home. Unfortunately before she can get home a tornado is seen approaching and everybody there has taken shelter in a storm basement. She goes into the house and when the tornado hits she is knocked out.She awakens to find the house in the air and through the window she sees many strange things, including the mean neighbour on her bicycle who turns into a witch on a broomstick. When the house crashes to the ground and she goes outside the film switches from sepia tinged black and white to spectacular colour. As she looks around the strange land she has arrived in she is met by Glinda, the Witch of the North. She introduces Dorothy to the Munchkins, the little people who inhabit that part of Oz. The Munchkins treat Dorothy as a heroine as her house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West is not happy though, especially when her sister's ruby slippers magically appear on Dorothy's feet. Dorothy is told that if she want to return home to Kansas she must follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City where the eponymous Wizard of Oz lives.As she walks along the road she meets three strange characters; a scarecrow who wants a brain, a tin man who wants a heart and a cowardly lion who wishes to be brave. As strange as these characters are each of them is vaguely familiar to Dorothy. They journey is made harder by the witch who is determined to get the slippers off Dorothy. They eventually reach the city but once there the Wizard is not as welcoming as they'd hoped and demands that they must go away and no return till they have the Witch of the West's broom stick, this obviously isn't an easy task. Just in case anybody has yet to see this I won't spoil the ending.Judy Garland is perfect as young Dorothy and the rest of the cast a pretty good too. There are plenty of songs some of which are now classics which you'll find yourself singing in your head after you've finished watching the film. The film is a treat for all the family although very young viewers might find some parts a little scary.",9,4,5,2 March 2009
The Martian," Stranded on Mars
","Set in the not too distant future the Ares III mission to Mars has to abort there 31 Sol (Martian day) mission on Sol 18 when a storm hits their base and threatens to topple the rocket that will take them back to the Hermes, the craft that will take them back to Earth. As they run through the storm a piece of debris hits mission botanist Mark Watney. His colleagues try to find him but as his suit's telemetry suggests he is dead they are forced to leave without him. It soon emerges that he is not dead unfortunately he calculates that there won't be enough food left for him to survive till the next mission to Mars. Back on Earth everybody thinks he is dead until a satellite photograph shows that the Ares III site has changed so somebody must be there! Still at this point there is no way to contact him. Mark manages to grow potatoes for food and sets about retrieving a transmitter from a previous mission. With contact finally made they start discuss how he might be rescued. Time will be close and there will be setbacks.Fans of 'Hard Sci-Fi' should really enjoy this; the idea of manned mission to Mars might seem many years away the technology we see doesn't seem unrealistic and the story seemed plausible so much so that the film this most reminded me of was 'Apollo 13' which was of course based on a real life near disaster in space. The opening set up is effective and wastes little time in stranding Mark on Mars then we get down to the business of him trying to figure out how to survive. He encounters many problems which are resolved logically. Similarly the events on earth appear plausible as first those in charge want to avoid a PR disaster then work to rescue him when it becomes apparent that he is alive. The cast does a fine job. Matt Damen excels as Mark Watney managing to be entertaining even when the only talking he does for much of the time is direct to camera as he records a video diary. The rest of the cast, which includes many familiar faces also impresses. The Jordanian locations used look suitably barren to act as a substitute for Mars. While things are serious for the most part there are some good laughs as well; many provided by the fact that the only music Mark has is some disco taken to Mars my the mission commander this provides an excuse for some enjoyably incongruous back ground music which I rather enjoyed. Overall I really enjoyed this and would certainly recommend it even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan.",10,1,2,14 September 2017
V for Vendetta," An Interesting Dystopia
","Like most dystopias this is set a little while into the future and takes the worst excesses of today to a totalitarian extreme. Here Britain is governed by High Chancellor Sutler, played by the excellent John Hurt. We learn that he came to power after a terrorist outrage that left tens of thousands of people dead. Once elected he had set about building a police state where undesirables were eliminated.The main character of the film is Evey (Natalie Portman with a slightly dodgy accent), a girl who is rescued from the police by a masked man known only as V, played by Hugo Weaving who performs well in a role where we never see his face as it is always covered by hid Guy Falkes mask.Shortly after rescuing her he takes her to a rooftop to watch as he detonates explosives that he has planted under the Old Bailey. He then announces that that in one years time, on the fifth of November he will blow up the now disused Houses of Parliament. He also sets about killing a group of people who have wronged him in the past. Inspector Finch, an honest policeman played well by Stephen Rea is tasked with bringing V to justice. The more he learns about V's victims and their connection to the government the more disturbed be becomes.Many viewers seem to consider this a left wing film that is attacking right wing values by taking them to an extreme; I never thought that though, to me it is a film about the evil of tyranny which would have worked in exactly the same way had the government been Stalinist.The acting is good throughout, the secondary characters were also impressive, especially Stephen Fry who played a television presenter who sheltered Evey at one point, in many ways his character is the non-violent equivalent of V, they even cook the same thing for breakfast.",8,1,4,24 June 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Another Coen Brothers' Classic
","Like most Coen Brothers' films that I've seen this had a surreal quality to it. Very loosely based on 'The Odyssey' it follows the adventures or three convicts on the run after escaping from their chain gang in rural Mississippi during the depression. Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), there self appointed leaded has told the others that he has over a million dollars from a robbery unfortunately the area he has buried it in is due to be flooded to make a reservoir in four days.On they journey the meet a variety of interesting characters; a blind oracle who tells them they will find treasure but not that which they expected, a man who had sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar, three very alluring sirens and a one eyed character played by John Goodman amongst others. Much of the story involves music, in fact at one point they even make a record to earn a few buck then unknown to them it becomes a hit.The story telling is superb as is the acting. While at times it feels more like a collection of incidents rather than a single story that is no bad thing as each incident that happens along the way is interesting and usually amusing.If you want to watch something a little bit different which contains little to offend and much to amuse then this could be the film for you.",8,0,1,11 July 2008
Furious 7," Fast & Furious 7
","After the events in 'Fast and Furious 5' where Dominic Toretto and his friends defeated terrorist Owen Shaw in London they thought they could finally relax they didn't count on Owen's tougher brother, Deckard, a former SAS soldier who is now out for revenge. He has already killed Han in Tokyo now he is after the others. One bomb puts Hobbs in hospital and a second destroys Toretto's house nearly killing him, Brian and his family. After Han's funeral Dom goes head to head with Shaw but they are interrupted by a special ops force led by 'Mr Nobody'. Shaw gets away then 'Mr Nobody' explains why he is there; a hacker known only as 'Ramsey' is in the hands of the terrorist group led by one Mose Jakande and he wants Dom and his crew to get her back before the terrorists get their hands on her 'God's Eye' program a hack that gives access to all CCTV cameras which uses facial recognition to find anybody in minutes. If Dom gets her back he is promised use of God's Eye to find Shaw. Of course it will not be easy; they will have to parachute, in cars, to a remote road in a Caucasus Mountains; jump between building, in cars, in Abu Dhabi; and finally back to Los Angeles where Jakande is coming after them with a helicopter gunship and drone equipped with missiles not forgetting that Dom and Shaw must face each other once again.If you are a fan of over the top action then this is the film for you; a minimum of time is spent to explain what is going on before getting into the nearly nonstop action. Expect numerous explosions, car chases, shooting, fights and some exciting (CGI assisted) stunts one couldn't expect a stuntman to jump a car between the upper storeys of three skyscrapers! It isn't just about the action; there is also a solid cast who have developed a great chemistry over the course of the seven films. This is particularly true of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as Dom and Brian; this leads to a poignant farewell for the later character as a tribute to the actor who tragically died during filming. The rest of the regulars were on good form to and fine performances from new-comers too; most notably Jason Statham who is great a Deckard and Nathalie Emmanuel who impresses as Ramsey; I wouldn't be surprised if they return in later instalments. Overall I'd say this was probably my favourite 'Fast and Furious' film so far; the action was great and the characters are people anybody who has watched the whole series will care about.",8,1,4,14 May 2017
The Godfather," A sprawling, epic, Mafia masterpiece
","This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed. The cast is great with Marlon Brando impressing in his oft imitated performance as Don Vito and Al Pacino doing a really fine job as Michael, a character who changes believably as events affect him. The rest of the cast, which includes James Caan, Robert Duvall. Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton are also great. Director Francis Ford Coppola does a great job bringing the story to the screen, helped by a fine soundtrack from Nino Rota. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fill fans.",10,0,0,16 September 2019
