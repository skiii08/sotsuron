The Sound of Music," Really wish I hadn't waited to see this
","I was 17 years old when this was originally released and just wasn't in a 'place' to see this.  I finally watched it for the first time in 1999. Well, it was my loss.  This is one of the three best movie musicals ever made -- it actually has an interesting and believable plot -- a rarity! 
Oh, okay, the other 2 best musicals are #1 My Fair Lady and #2 West Side Story.",Null,0,5,26 May 2001
