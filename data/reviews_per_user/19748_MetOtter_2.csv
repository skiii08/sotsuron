The Ring," Get real people!!!
","I had such high hopes from the promotion and word of mouth of this movie that I was sure that I was in for a big let down.  Let me tell you, I was.  This movie just doesn't work as a new legend, an urban legend or a folklore of old.  It's just plain dumb.  The acting is subpar and possibly lowered my rating because the plot does have something going for it.  What I don't understand and was never explained was how the tape came into existence to begin with?  I heard that this movie has expectations of being the next EXORCIST.  Exorcise it from your movie must see lists, wait for the video on discount night, and hopefully RED DRAGON will reclaim the top spot where it belongs.  While I'm at it...while it's not as bad as I thought it would be, SWEET HOME ALABAMA???  Get real people!!!",3,2,5,21 October 2002
The Deer Hunter," quite possibly the best movie ever made
","The Deer Hunter is a beautifully filmed and written movie.  The layers and textures of the locations, dialogue, and characters are forever burned into my memory.  While harsh and abrassive to the ears at times, one must remember the lifestyle that the movie is portraying. Robert Deniro turns in one of his top five performances of all time while Christopher Walken and John Savage still have not eclipsed their magnificent work in this film.  Meryl Streep proved she can play a plain Jane and hid her beauty so as to keep her character attainable to the steelworkers of the close knit community.  One only can wonder what wonderful work John Cazale would have continued to do if not for his untimely death. Clear three hours from your schedule and rewatch this masterpiece, and if you've never seen it...be prepared for a moving and memorable experience.",10,1,2,23 December 2001
