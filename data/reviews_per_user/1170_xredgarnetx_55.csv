Howl's Moving Castle," Another wonderful Miyazaki production
","HOWL is another feature-length 2D cartoon by the Walt Disney of Japan, Miyazaki. This time around, we have a disparate group of people suffering under various curses who find their way together and form a ragtag family to fight the forces of evil -- in this case, a seemingly never-ending war between two nations. Having said this, I will say HOWL is suitable for even the youngest viewer, because Miyasaki knows how to make such subject matter palatable for even the youngest among us. While not his best work, it is absolutely gorgeous and almost hallucinatory as it tells the story of a walking castle and its owner, a shy young warlock. In some scenes, the castle is CGI; in others, it is standard 2D. Either way, it is a marvel and at the heart of the story, which is loosely based on a novel by legendary fantasy author Diana Jones. Emily Mortimer plays Sophie, the heroine of the story. Christian Bale is Howl. Billy Crystal is the fire that keeps Howl's castle together (don't ask), and he is very funny. A mute scarecrow plays an equally important role. Highly recommended. Make sure you also catch SPIRITED AWAY, PRINCES MONONOKE, NAUSICAA and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO by this animation genius. He also is responsible for KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, PORCO ROSSO and CASTLE IN THE SKY, and contributed to the delightful THE CAT RETURNS.",8,0,1,4 March 2006
Alien 3," Waste
","What a waste of time and talent is ALIEN 3. Ripley wakes up to find herself on a prison planet. Newt is dead and it is many years later. The prison planet is dark and drab and stark, and so are the characters. For those ALIENS fans hoping for an extension of James Cameron's masterpiece of a sequel, what a huge disappointment ALIEN 3 turned out to be. Death and despair is at every turn, and there is little action to compensate for the gloom that pervades the storyline. Susan 'Sigourney' Weaver is absolutely wasted as Ripley. If she were a more discerning actress, perhaps she would have turned down a third go at the role. If the movie itself had been better, perhaps the series would have wound up a memorable trilogy. Instead, this turkey led to an even bigger turkey, ALIEN: RESURRECTION. Neither original director Renny Harlin nor his replacement David Fincher should have been allowed within 500 miles of this project. It needed a sure hand like Cameron's. Believe me when I tell you, you may safely skip this one and the one that follows. For that matter, the fifth movie in the series, AvP, isn't much of an improvement, but in its own odd way is slightly more watchable than ALIEN 3 and ALIEN: RESURRECTION. I agree with those fans who felt the series should have ended with ALIENS.",4,514,576,15 August 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," OK of its kind
","SLEVIN is a gimmicky crime drama about gambling and payback that depends much too heavily on a twist ending. It also has all the earmarks of an independent production, yet it stars some pretty damned big names in relatively small roles, including Bruce Willis as a hit man and Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman as rival crime bosses. Your tolerance for the film may depend on your tolerance for Josh Hartnett in the lead role as a loser mistaken for someone else. He wasn't bad, although it is hard to watch the kid without thinking of lookalike Ashton Kutcher and PUNK'D. If you can hang in to the end, you may be pleasantly surprised by the turn of events. Willis doesn't look particularly well, by the way. Don't know if this was intentional.",6,1,8,16 April 2006
Marie Antoinette," A failure
","SPIDERMAN actress Kirsten Dunst plays Marie Antoinette. Director Sofia Coppola, who gave us THE VIRGIN SUICIDES with the same lead actress, presents Marie as a very young and very innocent women sold to foreign royalty and never given a chance to be herself. The result is a 'Let them eat cake' lifestyle consisting of endless balls and lessons in silly etiquette. Plus the effort to procure an heir, only her husband (Jason Schwartzmann, of all people) is a gay man who spends a lot of time playing 'Hide the fox' with his male buddies. Rip Torn plays the randy old French king, but isn't given much to do. The film unfortunately goes nowhere, and spends most of its long running time in the never-never world of the Palace at Versailles. It's all style and no substance. When you see Sofia Coppola's name attached to a film, you best be beware. She gave us LOST IN TRANSLATION, after all (I still shudder when I think of Bill Murray kissing Scarlett Jo at the end).",4,1,2,24 December 2007
Deja Vu," Ouch
","I reviewed this once before, but that review seems to have vanished. In DEJA VU, Denzel W. plays a federal agent studying a ferry explosion that has killed hundreds of people, including many military personnel. He is allowed to view a government machine that lets the viewer look back several days, and he hopes to find clues this way. The real mystery is why a woman's body washed up down river with similar burns an hour before the ferry explosion. Then the worst possible plot turn arrives: Denzel figures he can literally go back in time using the machine and figure everything out. And maybe save the gal, among other things. From this point, the movie collapses like the proverbial house of cards. It is very enjoyable and suspenseful right up until good old Denzel climbs into the time machine, I will admit. Watch the first half, skip the second. This is no MAN ON FIRE II.",5,1,3,24 February 2008
The Big Lebowski," Fun for the guys
","I am one of those who think the Coen Brothers have done better movies than THE BIG LEBOWSKI. But I will give it this: This satiric tale of mistaken identity, kidnap and death has a Raymond Chandler-esquire feel that should certainly appeal to male viewers. Jeff Bridges is Dude Lebowski, who ends up being mixed up with a millionaire with the same last name (David Huddleston) who owes money to some very bad men. The Dude's best buddy, Walter (John Goodman) helps The Dude in his quest to find the senior Lebowski's hormone-crazed child bride (Tara Reid), who has done a disappearing act and may or may not have been kidnapped. The film is bizarre, to say the least, with Busby Berkley-type fantasy sequences, Bridges as a '60s burnout with long, unkempt hair and Goodman as an individual with serious anger management issues. Bridges and Goodman make the film worth watching, although their constant use of expletives may turn off some. They are supported in their efforts by Steve Buscemi as their strange pal Donny and Julianne Moore as the even stranger Maude Lebowski. Sam Elliott serves as the film's narrator and shows up in a brief sequence. This is quite probably Goodman's finest film, by the way.",6,0,2,12 November 2007
Shakespeare in Love," Approach with caution
","LOVE presents a pretty conceit that has the author himself pining for his next true love as he prepares his latest play. The conceit is that many of Shakespeare's plays are quoted from or acted out in part in this expensive comedy-drama. And this happens right from the get-go when a character shouts 'A plague on both your houses!' Any Shakespeare fan can tell you this is a line from 'Romeo and Juliet.' And 'Romeo and Juliet' is the very play the married but lovelorn Will is composing during the course of this movie, a play that will end up transforming and transfixing everyone who comes into contact with it -- the same effect that happens to those seeing Picasso's 'Guernica' or hearing Mozart's 'Requiem' for the first time. Could this magical effect have happened in real life? Probably not, but it is a witty plot angle. The acting is excellent, the costuming is wonderful, the sets are very authentic in feel. But -- and this is a very big but -- LOVE is a chick flick. Real men are not welcome. Shakespeare himself (Joseph Fiennes) looks and often acts like a woman in disguise -- one of the movie's plot elements indeed focuses on gender confusion and identity swapping, which is also right out of 'Twelfth Night,' another Shakespeare play. Claire Danes is wonderful as Shakespeare's latest muse, and the magnificent supporting cast is made up of many familiar faces, most of them British. Ben Affleck is the only other American in the cast, and he plays a small but critical role. In the end, all's well that ends well. But it does not change the nature of this film, which is for women only. Men, do not be fooled by the Oscars bestowed upon this film. As any right-thinking person knows, an Oscar means squat to most viewers these days.",6,0,0,22 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A dark and less funny sequel
","PIRATES 2 is an OK sequel to the original, with most if not all of the original cast back for another shot at buried treasure. This time around, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and company are after Davy Jones'locker, which contains an artifact that will keep Sparrow from falling into the clutches of the undead Davy Jones. Davy Jones, who sports an octopus for a head, pilots the Flying Dutchman, which among other neat tricks can dive underwater. Along the way, Sparrow and friends (including a rather haggard-looking Orlando Bloom and the ever-luscious Keira Knightley) have various adventures including falling into the hands of cannibals. One eye-popping sequence involves a duel that takes place on a runaway water wheel! Now for the not-so-good news: P2 is considerably darker than the first movie. The (bloodless) death count is so high, PIRATES 2 truly is not suitable for small children. Also, the movie ends like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, a cliffhanger that compels us to catch the third and final installment in 2007. Other than some impressive visual effects involving the gruesome Davy Jones crew and a rather large sea monster, there's not much new here. Many of the gags are lifted from the first movie. Plus the film is easily a half-hour too long. If you are a fan, by all means see it. Just keep the kiddies away.",7,2,6,8 July 2006
Hostel," Chilling quasi-documentary
","If we are to believe it, HOSTEL may be based on real-life goings-on in Asia, although the director has changed the setting to eastern Europe, a place few American tourists visit. Some backpackers are lured from the relative safety of western Europe to Slovakia on the promise of hot sex. But after the hot sex, they are drugged, tortured and murdered, along with hundreds of others in an old mental asylum refitted as a series of torture rooms in which affluent males from around the world pay heavily to play torturer. Jay Hernandez leads the unlucky backpackers, and the film takes a good 50 minutes before it gets down to business. The suspense is killing, and the last 40 or so minutes is all about killing. The gore and the production values are great, although most of the torture is suggested rather than seen, with terrific sound effects for those things we are not permitted to see. A good thing, too: the few scenes actually showing nasty deeds being done are patently fake, and had us alternately laughing and groaning. SPOILER: Sole survivor Hernandez has a great time avenging his buddies' deaths, and we're right there with him as he gets every last one of them in various, novel ways. You too will be screaming for their blood after you see what they have done.",8,1,2,22 January 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Solid children's fantasy epic
","This major theatrical adaptation by Disney of THE LION, THE WITCH and THE WARDROBE is not only faithful to the book, but an entertaining adventure film in its own right. It stands right up there with LORD OF THE RINGS and the HARRY POTTER films. Four siblings are shipped off during wartime to a distant relative in the country, and quickly discover a wardrobe that opens onto an alternate world, called Narnia, populated by talking animals and mythical creatures like griffins, centaurs and mermaids. The ruler of Narnia, a wise and compassionate lion named Aslan and voiced by Liam Neeson, is being challenged by the evil White Witch, played by veteran British actress Tilda Swinton, who may be a new face to many viewers here. After various adventures involving a helpful faun, fox and beaver family, a pack of extremely vicious wolves and Old St. Nick himself, the children join Aslan's army and do battle with the witch and her gruesome minions. The final battle may remind you of the final battle in LORD, but keep in mind LION was written before LORD. The actors playing the children are adorable and believable as siblings, the actors voicing the animals are for the most part OK, the special effects are seamless, and the music works 90 percent of the time. My only real complaint is the night scenes were much too dark, to the point I literally could not see what was going on in some scenes. I wonder what the director could have been thinking. Anyhow, see LION. This big-budget version (there are two previous TV adaptations and a wonderful cartoon) would not exist if it were not for HARRY POTTER, but LION is head and shoulders above the Potter films.",7,0,1,1 April 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Scrat wins
","ICE AGE 2 is a dull and plodding sequel to a film that itself had its share of dull moments. A trio of prehistoric creatures tries to get their fellow animals to hightail it out of the valley they live in when it becomes clear the ice is melting and a huge flood is imminent. That's about it for plot. The rest is all schtick, although it may keep the very young ones amused. The middle section is a long and boring stretch about the migration. Scrat the bug-eyed rat-squirrel helps keep the film afloat, as he did the first one, and Sid the bear-sloth has a very funny but too-brief encounter with a tribe of musically-minded mini-sloths. Diego the sabretooth tiger is strictly a bit player in this one, and a little bit of Ray Romano's Manny the Mammoth goes a long way. The 3-D animation itself is terrific, but frankly 1988's 2-D THE LAND BEFORE TIME tells the same story in far more entertaining fashion, and Littlefoot the brontosaurus and his pals put the characters in ICE AGE 2 to shame.",6,2,5,16 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," A solid sequel
","No one would ever argue that Sam Raimi doesn't know how make a great film and even a great sequel or two. The director of the EVIL DEAD trilogy and 2002's SPIDER-MAN comes through with a worthy sequel to that last title, as Spidey takes on Doctor Octopus aka Doc Ock while wondering if he should continue on as the world's most misunderstood wall-crawler. His powers are beginning to fail him, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson, is preparing to marry another, and his best buddy, Harry Osborn, is not feeling real good about him since Spider-Man 'killed' his father, the Green Goblin, at the end of the first film. Talk about a conundrum. The best parts of this mega-budgeted action flick are taken up with the lonely youth's personal concerns. As with the first movie, the least effective parts come whenever he dons costume and cowl. These scenes are almost 100 percent computer-generated cartoonery and hard to swallow. They're also hard to follow, as everything rushes by in a virtual blur. Toby Maguire again plays the titular character, and reminds us why the first movie worked so well. His internal conflict can be readily seen in every twitch of his face and those highly expressive eyes of his. He's Elijah Wood with acting chops. The chameleonic Alfred Molina is absolutely wonderful as Doc Ock, and puts Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin from the first movie to shame. Unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst remains a supporting player, little more than eye candy, although she tries hard in her few scenes. In the end, is SPIDER-MAN 2 worth seeing? Unless you are a die-hard comic book fan, probably not. It doesn't really advance the youthful angst and romance and action sequences seen in the first movie. It also lacks the grandeur and mythic components of the first two X-MEN movies. But it is a decent time killer, a pleasant diversion for a super-slow evening.",8,0,4,8 January 2007
The Terminator," Scary sci-fi
","I first saw TERMINATOR on a hotel room TV in Washington, D.C., with my wife and young daughter. I would say the film thrilled the heck out of us and probably scared my kid half to death, but the fact is, we were in a brightly lit hotel room and the TV wasn't particularly large. I know we were bowled over by the police station sequence and the final chase at the very least. This is one of Ah-nuld's best roles, and director James Cameron knows how to keep things moving along on a shoestring budget. The scene where Ah-nuld must deal with a partially ruined face is unforgettable. T2 came along a few years later and put the original to shame, much like ALIENS did to ALIEN. But if it were not for THE TERMINATOR, where would we be today? A groundbreaking sci-fi thriller, loosely based on a TV program and very old short story, by the way, neither of which is credited, as I recall.",7,1,3,30 April 2007
Silent Hill," Atmospheric, but too long
","(Forgive me if you find another review here by yours truly of this film. I wrote one but now cannot locate it.) SILENT HILL is a very faithful adaptation of a popular video game, according to my 19-year-old daughter. As a movie, it is certainly atmospheric and spooky, although it lacks any real scares, the gore is subdued, and the plot is all over the place. And it comes to an incredibly ludicrous climax. Radha Mitchell searches for her missing daughter in the abandoned W. Va. coal mining town of Silent Hill, only to cross over into an alternate dimension where she encounters a veritable army of creepy crawlies and assorted and sundry monsters. She finds allies in the form of a motorcycle cop (Laurie Holden) and a bag lady (Deb Unger) who also has lost her kid years before. All is made plain by film's end, perhaps too much so. Too much explanation tends to spoil the broth, Mr. Gans. Sean Bean plays the distraught husband searching for his wife and daughter. Mitchell and Bean are competent, nothing more. B movie queen Alice Krige as the head of a satanic cult plays it way over the top. A lot of the dialog is simply laughable, especially toward the end, and the film is too long by half. This is not the second coming of THE RING or THE OTHERS, but if nothing else SILENT HILL looks terrific. The set design alone should be an Oscar contender.",7,0,2,23 April 2006
Crash," OK look at race relations
","In CRASH, Canadian-born director Paul Haggis takes us on a whirlwind tour of race relations in L.A., where people from many nations collide every day. He examines how we view each other and how our lives intersect through a series of vignettes, and after awhile the film began resembling MAGNOLIA in its structure and plot; it even includes a slightly miraculous act of nature, although nothing as dramatic as raining frogs. Alas, there is no Tom Cruise on hand to anchor this episodic film. The best we get in CRASH is Matt Dillon as an anguished cop with an ailing father and Don Cheadle as a detective with a missing brother and drug-addicted mother. Both are very good, but neither has the star power to provide the focus of the film; this is strictly an ensemble piece, using a mix of known and unknown actors in key roles. It is sort of fun to watch the normally wholesome Sandra Bullock as D.A. Brendan Fraser's wife getting all potty mouthed and bigoted after she is carjacked by a couple of street blacks. An initially almost unrecognizable Ryan Phillipe plays Dillon's squad car partner, and ends up being the most tragic figure of them all.",7,0,1,30 May 2006
Final Destination 2," Interesting first half
","I may have written a review of this under my previous moniker. Watching FINAL DESTINATION 2 again the other day, I am again struck by the highway pileup, which appeared to have been largely physical gags and not a heck of a lot of CGI. It is probably the best highway accident scene I have ever seen in a movie, although a couple of others come close, including the ending of 2002's TRAPPED with Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron. The second half of this so-called sequel sucks, plain and simple. There are a couple of very gory deaths that look as fake as they come, and appear to be right out of an OMEN movie. The most offensive is probably the plate glass falling onto the kid. Without even slowing down the action, you can plainly see the glass hitting what appears to be the bottom half of a dummy filled with stage blood. Ali Larter's cartoonish flaming, flying death near the end is almost as bad. I love gore in movies, but only when it is handled realistically. The very first death after the highway scene, involving the goofy guy who has just won the lottery, is actually the most interesting to watch as it plays out like a slapstick routine that Steve Martin or Jim Carrey or even Lou Costello might have performed. The director may have thought he was making a comedy because you certainly can't take this movie seriously. And to think a second sequel is about to come out. Heaven help us! Where's Damien when you need him? Couldn't they at least have Death from FAMILY GUY make a guest appearance?",6,0,0,18 January 2006
Blade II," Great fight scenes
","BLADE II has our antihero uneasily joining forces with the vampire league to wipe out the Reapers, a group of degenerate vampires that prey on vampires. What Blade is actually doing is walking into a trap, but that's to be expected, and the climax of BLADE II plays out in similar fashion to BLADE. What sets this sequel apart from and possibly above BLADE are the fight sequences. They are spectacular, and the CGI used to make some of the more spectacular fight gags is less obtrusive this time round. Mr. Snipes as Blade is in fine form once again, and Kris Kristofferson is back as Blade's aide de camp. The delectable Lenor Varela provides the romantic interest as a fellow vampire, and Ron Perlman has a strong supporting role as one of several warrior vampires sent to aid Blade in his quest. Still, I would only recommend it to fans of the comic book or comic book fans in general. It will have no meaning nor make any sense to anyone else.",6,0,1,28 October 2007
Taxi Driver," An ode to the lonely and deranged
","Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER is an ode to the lonely and deranged, in this case a NYC cab driver named Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro). A Marine veteran and insomniac who is under heavy medication, Bickle is working up a head of steam about life in the jungle -- and NYC in 1976 was definitely a jungle, which the film's cinematographer captures perfectly. Bickle purchases several guns from a shady dealer and decides to kill a presidential hopeful, primarily because an aide to the candidate (the young and fetching Cybill Shepherd) has spurned his advances. What comes next is right out of a fairy tale. Without giving it away, let us say Bickle becomes a hero instead of a villain, like that nutcase Bernie Goetz who blew away his would-be muggers on the subway. Ah irony. This early Scorsese flick is really a showcase for the incredible talents of DeNiro. It also features a very young Jodie Foster as a cynical prostitute with whom Bickle becomes enamored. Foster won an Oscar for this role, as I recall. The film is dated by necessity. Much of what is on screen is now gone, passed on. Times Square was a cesspool when this movie was made, not the DisneyWorld extension it has become. Nevertheless, TAXI DRIVER remains extremely watchable, mainly because of DeNiro's intense performance. Harvey Keitel in a bizarre wig and hat has a small role as Foster's pimp, as does Peter Boyle as a fellow cab driver.",8,0,2,30 December 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Beware the dreaded chick flick
","PRADA is a lightweight comedy set in the fashion corridors of Manhattan, a movie aimed squarely at the teen and tween audience. Anne Hathaway plays a young college graduate landing her first job at a fashion magazine lorded over by an imperious and bizarrely attired Meryl Streep. As a fresh journalism graduate, Hathaway is a fish out of water as the new assistant to a boss obsessed with haute couture in the same way Martha Stewart is obsessed with turning the universe into her kitchen. But soon enough, Hathaway is transformed into a fashionista, and she quickly alienates her friends and family. The film is right out of the Disney or Nickelodeon school of film-making, and doesn't begin to live up to its arch title, which is based on someone's memoirs. Hathaway is pretty but just not up to her role, which would have called for someone like Sandra Bullock 10 years ago. Today, it might have been better served by someone like Rachel McAdams. But frankly, I don't think the director was up to the job. The tone is so slight and airy, the movie threatens to blow away at any second. And talk about clichéd. For girls only, preferably those still young enough to be playing with their Barbie and Bratz dolls.",6,0,0,15 December 2006
Cold Mountain," Great battle scenes
","As with the French weeper, A LONG ENGAGEMENT, COLD MOUNTAIN is a war film within a romantic film, a chick flick with some pretty awesome battle scenes and satisfyingly bloody violence. Jude Law plays a southern farmhand who goes off to fight the Civil War, vowing to return to his true love, the aristocratic Nicole Kidman, who has recently moved with her ailing father (a bewigged Donald Sutherland) from the big city to the hills of North Carolina. While Nicole is waiting for Law to come home, she undergoes various trials and tribulations, as does Law. An almost unrecognizable Renee Zellweger plays Kidman's spunky right-hand woman, and Natalie Portman is a woman with child and no husband whom Law befriends on his arduous journey home. Jena Malone, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, Philip S. Hoffman, Ray Winstone, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Giovanni Ribisi play supporting roles. With all this star power, especially all the foreigners, I half-expected Keira Knightley to pop in. The thick southern accents are something to hear, if not always understand, and the many fight scenes are worth a look by all you unreconstructed males out there. I could have done without all the romantic folderol, but you can't have everything. Zellweger gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Come to think of it, she did win an Oscar for her role in this.",6,1,3,22 January 2007
Over the Hedge," Great cartoon
","OVER THE HEDGE will delight young-uns and adult-type folk alike, as it mixes Looney Tunes-type destructive humor with loads of Baby Boomer references. A wily raccoon (Bruce Willis) helps a bunch of naive furry critters headed up by a thoughtful turtle (Gary Shandling) find food after they find most of their forest has been replaced by hundreds of cluster housing units. Talk about a timely topic, by the way. HEDGE is based on a comic strip, and the characters in this theatrical release are fully realized and all quite hysterical, each in his or her own right. There is a sweet porcupine family headed by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, a silly father (William Shatner) and daughter (Avril Lavigne) possum team, a sassy skunk (Wanda Sykes) and and a manic squirrel (Steve Carrell). They all play their parts to perfection. HEDGE is not as brilliant as CARS nor quite so smarmy as ICE AGE 2; it strikes a nice balance and moves the beat of to its own internal rhythm. Make sure you hang around for the closing credits.",7,0,0,18 June 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Excellent romantic comedy
","VIRGIN tells the tale of an aging and lonely electronics store wage slave who is good at collecting things but has difficulty relating to people, especially women. His store pals, who seem to have materialized out of an old MARRIED WITH CHILDREN episode, decide to do something about his condition and take him in hand, literally and figuratively. The first half of the movie is a raunchy, American PIE-type comedy. The second half, about the guy's romancing of a middle-aged divorcée complete with kids, is a sweet take on adult relationships. The ending, a very funny sendup of the movie HAIR, completes the no-longer lonely guy's journey in a truly bizarre manner. Steve Carrell, a character actor last seen in ANCHORMAN, is the aging virgin and plays the role as if he were channeling Ben Stiller in MEET THE PARENTS. Several other ANCHORMAN performers are on hand for the fun and merriment, most notably Paul Rudd as Carrell's lovelorn best buddy. That DEATH TO SMOOCHY gal, Catherine Keener, plays Carrell's love interest. Highly recommended, but only if you're an adult. This could easily have been an NC-17, and the extended and deleted scenes on the DVD prove it.",8,2,9,13 December 2005
Jarhead," Anti-war?
","It's hard to decide whether JARHEAD, ostensibly about the Gulf War, is pro- or anti-war. What it really is about is the day-to-day life of a Marine, and that includes an awful lot of sitting around, waiting for something to do. Hurry up and wait, I believe is what they call it. Like sitting in the doctor's office for an hour, waiting to be examined for three minutes. But these guys never even get their three minutes. Even during the height of Desert Storm war, the Marines in this picture find they have little or nothing to do, as the war always seems to be two steps ahead of them. In this telling, based on the memoirs of ex-Marine Anthony Swofford, it turns out to be an air war, and our boys are stuck on the ground. In the end, the film is really about personalities, and for better or worse we have seen these same personalities in a hundred other war pictures. The best of those flicks has been and remains the first half of FULL METAL JACKET. Watch JARHEAD for Jake Gyllenhall as Swofford, a very different character from DONNIE DARKO, his best known role. Gyllenhall's costar, Jamie Foxx as a platoon sergeant, turns in a pale imitation of Lou Gossett in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. Chris 'Twin Peaks' Cooper has a cameo as a commanding officer, but isn't given anywhere enough screen time to register. Dennis '24/Allstate' Haysbert shows up for about 10 seconds as another officer.",6,0,1,4 March 2006
Saw III," Well, now
","SAW 3 is a sequel that probably would have been better left unfilmed. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back, an improbability based on his condition at the end of SAW 2, along with his loyal minion (Shawnee Smith), looking sexier than ever. While Smith is putting new victims through the wringer, Jigsaw is having brain surgery. This brain surgery, the high or low point of the film depending on your point of view, is done in loving closeup. The film is just gross, but not a good type of gross as in SAW 1, which leaned toward grossout comedy. Nope, this one is all business and quite serious. The ridiculous ending suggests another sequel would be impossible, but guess what just opened. SAW IV, anyone? Give it time, and this series will go to STV land.",5,0,1,21 October 2007
Cars," Great cartoon
","CARS is Disney/Pixar's latest animated feature, about a race car that learns a hard lesson about life and love from a bunch of automobiles living in a forgotten desert town. Five minutes into the film, and you forget you're watching a bunch of motor vehicles; each has its own very distinct personality. The film is gorgeously drawn and animated, wonderfully voiced by Owen Wilson as the race car, Paul Newman as an old-timer with a secret, and several others, and the antics of the characters are hysterical. CARS provides one laugh after another, with a series of nonstop gags and one-liners leading up to a thrilling finish. Make sure you hang around for and after the credits for some terrific throwaway gags and 'outtakes,' the funniest one involving John Ratzenberger's character reacting to a rather peculiar situation at the local drive-in. Highly recommended. The film is preceded by a new Pixar short involving competing musical clowns. They have to be seen to be believed.",8,1,1,10 June 2006
The Number 23," The Number 23 means....
","Jim Carrey is on the trail of an author who wrote what appears to be a murder mystery that parallels a real-life case. Carrey isn't sure which, and off he goes in obsessive pursuit. He ends up identifying with the book's main character, a seedy PI who eventually commits murder. One may be reminded of IDENTITY or STRANGER THAN FICTION as Carrey works to clear the name of the man convicted of the murder. Ultimately, the author is revealed and all's well, more or less. The astute viewer will have guessed the killer's ID half way through. Now for the bad news: Carrey is not good enough an actor to pull this off. He does not have what I would call the gravitas. With his strange hairdo and odd antics in this movie, I was reminded of Ace Ventura and kept waiting for Carrey to begin mugging and laughing like a hyena. Virginia Madsen is fine as his long suffering wife and murder victim in the novel. I enjoyed a moment here and there, but not the whole movie. Director Schumacher has come a cropper with this one. It would make a perfect 90-minute feature on AMC or Channel 13/PBS. As a big-budget theatrical number that I paid good money to see, it falls down long before the sweet-as-molasses conclusion. See PRESUMED INNOCENT for a similar plot and much more intriguing ending.",6,0,1,25 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Popcorn flick
","'Ghost Rider' was a flick Cage had wanted to make for several years. Too bad he didn't make it earlier in his career. He is too old to play Johnny Blaze, and it hurts the movie. In particular, his wig is atrocious. The kid playing the young Johnny Blaze is fine, but no one would have paid to see GHOST RIDER with an unknown in the lead. Anyhow, Cage plays a motorcycle daredevil who sells his soul to the devil (Peter Fonda, who really needs to retire along with David Carradine). Blaze has to defeat a quartet of supernatural bad guys led by Joaquin Phoenix-lookalike Wes Bentley. Sam Elliott plays a graveyard caretaker who helps Cage from time to time and Eva Mendes is Blaze's love interest. No one exactly gives an Oscar-winning performance in this bit of fluff, but my kid and I agreed we would have liked to see more of the Elliott character, who gives the film a nice Western kick. GR is a rainy day rental. The CGI is passable, and the climax contains a neat surprise, especially if you are old enough to remember the original Ghost Rider. Nuff said.",6,2,4,17 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Disappointing
","BEWARE SPOILERS! The final episode in the X-MEN trilogy proves disappointing on several levels. The script is atrocious and confusing, the actors are not nearly as compelling as they once were, and in general this second sequel flies in the face of what went before, much like the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE completely rewrote and dishonored its much-honored TV source. Xavier as a villain? Magneto as a hero? Cyclops disposed of in under five minutes? Angel used strictly as window dressing? These are just a few of the film's many sins. A couple of decent action sequences do not make up for a muddled plot that has the government offering a 'cure' for mutants and Magneto trying to take over the world as usual. At least Bobby finally gets to be Iceman as we know him from the comics, and Beast shows up to provide some blurry ass-kicking near the end. Speaking of which, the final battle is way over the top, with CGI standing in for most of the live action. A 'gag' involving Magneto redirecting the Golden Gate bridge tells us we have left any sense of even comic book reality completely behind -- and speaking of which, why is Magneto back yet again? He was unimaginably boring and pedantic in the two previous films, and is even more boring here. Tthis Magneto seems about as dangerous as a hangnail. Well, at least the series is over. Or so one hopes. And who keeps giving this director (Ratner) work? He is absolutely terrible. Give him a nail salon to run in Miami Beach.",5,10,19,30 May 2006
Hellboy," For comic fans only
","While HELLBOY will hold little appeal outside of the comic fan circle, nevertheless it is a reasonably entertaining movie, much like BLADE, also adapted from an existing comic character. Hellboy comes from another, infernal dimension opened by some Nazis, but is rescued and raised by Americans and grows up to be a crime fighter. Only the criminals he fights are demons and mystics. As he matures, Hellboy does his best to fit in, which is difficult considering he resembles our classic image of the Devil himself. He keeps his horns cut off -- until close to the end, when the legendary villain Rasputin tries to get Hellboy to use his arcane powers to open the gateway to that hellish dimension. You've seen the same premise and a similar device used in STARGATE, LARA CROFT and EVENT HORIZON. The CGI in HELLBOY is plentiful but after awhile it gets boring. Better are the real physical stunts and gags. Ron ('Beauty and the Beast') Pearlman's flip attitude as the Big Red One and his apparent ease in the full-body makeup make the character come alive and the movie work. John Hurt and Selma Blair costar.",7,1,1,26 March 2008
The Longest Day," Grand scale if a bit dated
","THE LONGEST DAY begs for a remake -- SAVING PRIVATE RYAN style, of course. This 3-hour, widescreen retelling of D-Day stars a huge roster of then-stars like Robert Ryan, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum plus a quite-young and unknown Sean Connery. Not a drop of blood is spilled, and soldiers who are shot fall theatrically. We spend as much time in the company of the Germans as we do the Allies, which wears thin after awhile, and there are probably 2,000 extras in this early '60s epic. The special effects look pretty bad today, but I assume they were pretty impressive in their time. Minimal documentary footage is included, which is a blessing. The film is in pristine B&W, which gives it a greater sense of reality but will cost it many potential viewers. There are moments where the viewer will feel drawn into the action, particularly in the French commando siege of a hotel held by the Nazis. Some passing nuns give this incredibly tense scene a touch of whimsy. In its own, creaky and ham-handed way, THE LONGEST DAY is superior to RYAN, in that it holds one's attention the whole way through. RYAN falls apart once it leaves the beach. DAY is only beginning with its beach scenes.",7,2,4,7 February 2006
The Illusionist," OK period piece
","Like THE VILLAGE, THE ILLUSIONIST is a romance and not a thriller. Unfortunately, like THE VILLAGE, THE ILLUSIONIST was advertised as a thriller. Edward Norton plays a German woodworker's son in the late 19th century who falls for a beauty of aristocratic birth, portrayed by small screen actress Jessica Beale. They are forced apart but run into each other again years later, when Norton has returned to town as a prestidigitator known as Eisenheim. The remainder of the movie details their attempts to help her escape the clutches of a nefarious prince, played by Rufus 'Dark City' Sewell, who senses in Eisenheim a threat to his rule. It is a classic plot, one that has been employed since the days of the Greek Empire. Paul Giamatti plays the stern but secretly compassionate chief inspector of the city. Surprisingly, Eisenheim's magic tricks are subdued and subtle, and the CGI is used sparingly, at least until the big finale. The costuming and sets are first-rate, and the unusual cinematography creates a definite mood. Unfortunately, the twist ending is telegraphed early on, and once more I want to warn you this is a romance, not a thriller. THE ILLUSIONIST plods along a bit, especially after misfortune besets the lovers, and Norton underplays his role to the point of being almost absent. Beale is a natural beauty, but unfortunately not much of an actress. See THE ILLUSIONIST for Sewell, a much undervalued actor, and the jovial Giamatti, who gets the last laugh. Also, the legendary Philip Glass wrote the haunting score.",6,0,1,7 January 2007
Event Horizon," Flawed, but watchable, effort
","I have written about EH under another moniker, and have twice trashed this sci-fi/supernatural horror movie. Watching it again does not make it better, like BLADE RUNNER or THE THING, but it has allowed me to spot a thing or two I missed the first or second or even third time around. To recap the plot, a rescue ship arrives at the stranded Event Horizon, a deep space probe, only to find lots of blood and dead bodies and something far worse awaiting them. Anderson borrows heavily from other movies, and EH crosses ALIEN, 2001 and SOLARIS with THE SHINING and HELLRAISER, among others. EH's massive, Gothic-like sets and the sweeping cinematography are magnificent, and the first half of the movie is a humdinger as the rescue crew explores the creepy, sinister EH and begins running into ghosts, or demons, or worse. The second half is a letdown, as we discover that the EH has been where no ship has gone before, into an alternate dimension of pure evil. It doesn't take much to figure where things will be going from that point. Enjoy the first half but skip the second, especially after Sam Neil undergoes his transformation into a poor man's Pinhead. Lots of spooky stuff worth seeing in the first half, though, especially Kathleen Quinlan approaching a sick bay bed where a phantom version of her ill son awaits her under the sheet. I do not care for the film any better today than I did several years ago, but I decided my two previous reviews (written under a name I dare not repeat here) were too perfunctory.",6,1,3,13 March 2007
Saw II," Gore galore
","SAW II is an improvement over the original SAW, as a group of young people and adults find themselves trapped in Jigsaw's house of horrors. The traps and deaths are clever, the gore quotient is upped, and the action never stops for a second. Add to this the fact that the cops have found and captured Jigsaw almost from the outset, but find themselves powerless to stop his latest game. Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are back from the original, and the ending of this ties itself back directly to the original in a highly satisfying manner. Highly recommended for gore hounds who thought HOSTEL and HIGH TENSION were too tame.",10,0,1,11 February 2006
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Interesting and entertaining, but with a bummer of an ending
","HEDWIG is a rock musical about a German boy who grows up to be a quasi-woman. He/she is constantly haunted by a botched genital operation (hence the film's bizarre title) and his/her failure to achieve stardom and connect with his/her fellow human beings in a meaningful way. His/her songs reflect the various passages he/she is going through in life, and the actor playing Hedwig (also the film's writer and director) can really belt out a tune. The songs sound like a cross between tunes by Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf's songwriter and one-time partner, and Bernie Taupin, Elton John's former songwriter and longtime partner. Anyone expecting another PRISCILLA OF THE DESERT will be sorely disappointed, however. This is not a comedy and goes way beyond PRISCILLA in depicting the life of a transvestite/would-be transsexual. The ending is odd and something of a letdown, and mainstream audiences are simply not going to understand it. But this is not a mainstream movie; it's strictly for the art-house and intellectual crowd, great music notwithstanding. For most of you reading this, heed my advice and buy the soundtrack instead. The rest of you are in for a disturbing 90 minutes. For those into movie trivia bar bets, keep a close eye on Hedwig's guitarist. A very close eye. Nuff said.",7,1,2,20 July 2006
Green Street Hooligans," English FIGHT CLUB
","In HOOLIGANS, Frodo gets kicked out of Harvard and goes to stay with his expat sister (the delectable C. Forlani) in England. He immediately runs across a soccer hooligan gang, and the gloves are off for the remainder of this gritty flick that at times looks like a sequel to FIGHT CLUB and at other times like a sequel to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Apparently, there are roving gangs of soccer hooligans throughout England, if this movie is to be believed. Scary thought. Unfortunately, Frodo is not terribly believable as a college boy turned vicious street fighter, and the gang resembles nothing so much as a road show company of 'West Side Story.' But there is a message here about loyalty and standing up for yourself and your mates that keeps the movie from simply being a series of skirmishes and beer drinking. The movie also contains two decent plot revelations, both having to do with gang leaders. Charlie Hunnan as a head hooligan is impressive in a Paul Bettany kind of way, and his role reminded me of Heath Ledger during his A KNIGHT'S TALE period. Recommended for fans of fighting, although the violence isn't quite as realistic or gory as I would have liked. There is no ear biting or eye gouging or tongue removing, which is what guys usually do when they get together for a bit of a throwdown. You want some more realistic and satisfying violence, rent A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE or RUNNING SCARED.",6,1,3,15 June 2006
Invincible," Enjoyable
","You've seen the plot of INVINCIBLE a hundred times, and yet the story never grows old. It is the same plot as ROCKY, and it just so happens the story takes place in Philadelphia in 1976, the year ROCKY was released. Mark Wahlberg is the underdog, a down-on-his luck, aging, divorced, part-time bartender from depressed South Philly who tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles, a team that has seen better times. A new coach (Greg Kinnear) tries the gimmick of an open audition for the Eagles, with no particular expectations. Unlike ROCKY, there are no bombastic moments until the very end. It is all very low key and underplayed, much like the guy himself who is very quiet and never believes for one moment he has a chance. A new love interest, in the form of fellow barkeep Elizabeth 'Slither' Banks, gives the film an added touch. Wahlberg is great, proving once again he can act with the best of them, and Banks is very appealing as a savvy, not-so-young New York woman who has come to Philly looking for a new start. She also happens to be a huge Giants fan,which leads to some very funny moments.",7,0,0,16 December 2006
National Treasure," Oh, Indy!
","I suppose Nic Cage picked NT so he could say he made at least one movie his kids/grandkids can watch. This lighthearted INDIANA JONES-style adventure finds Cage and friends seeking a treasure spelled out on a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Sean Bean and his gang of cutthroats are also after the treasure. Hammy thespians Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel are on hand to lend Cage a hand as, respectively, Cage's unbelieving father and an FBI agent with a hidden agenda. The movie is wildly improbable, but then so was INDIANA JONES. And at least Cage doesn't wear a hat. NT is no better or worse than LARA CROFT or THE LIBRARIAN. If you manage to make it through to the end, there is a cute punchline.",6,1,2,1 January 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," OK Irish uprising movie
","I'm not sure if the world needs yet another Irish rebellion movie, but here it is. Except for a highly inevitable and predictable ending, WIND is watchable for the growing schism between brothers as each takes a side in the Northern Ireland uprising of the 1920s. Definitely an anti-war film, it portrays the Brits as the inhuman empire builders they were at the time (an empire doomed to erode a decade later). But it also portrays IRA members as equally brutal in return. Many graphic killings, and a real downer of a movie, so best keep the little ones away. The only familiar actor is Cillian Murphy, the hollow-eyed villain from REDEYE. The director uses some locals for small parts, which works in the movie's favor.",6,1,5,3 May 2008
The Descent," OK horror thriller
","The maker of DOG SOLDIERS is back with THE DESCENT, about a group of 20-something gals who go spelunking only to run into bloodthirsty cave creatures. Sound familiar? It should. The same plot was used for THE CAVE, although that group was coed. And like THE CAVE, THE DESCENT is only partially successful. The spelunking sequences are tense and scary, but once the monsters appear, all the tension and scariness blow out the window. The monsters can actually be seen as interfering with the plot, as the group has become trapped far underground and must find its way back to the surface. Furthermore, once glimpsed, the monsters are just plain silly. However, I will give the filmmakers kudos for the gore level, which quickly escalates once the monsters appear. There's also a 'rebirthing' scene involving the lead character that was virtually duplicated in the more recent APOCALYPTO (THE DESCENT is a 2005 production, so it is anyone's guess why the delay in getting it to the U.S.). See THE DESCENT (and THE CAVE, for that matter) for the spelunking scenes. Skip the rest. Even the 'surprise' ending is boring, although it may be a bit jarring for the unintiated.",6,0,1,23 December 2006
Inside Man," Entertaining to a point
","When is a bank robbery not a bank robbery? That is the million dollar question in Spike Lee's INSIDE MAN, a tricky crime thriller starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Bad guy Owen is holding 50 people hostage during what appears to be the robbery of a Manhattan-based bank, and Washington is a stressed-out, possibly larcenous detective who must talk Owen into releasing the hostages and giving himself up. The first half of INSIDE MAN is a gritty, fast-paced crime yarn, while the second is an intellectual exercise in piecing together just what happened while the bank was under siege. INSIDE MAN is Washington's film all the way, a huge improvement over OUT OF TIME, his last outing as a stressed-out, possibly larcenous law enforcer. Everyone else -- Owen as the bank robber-not-bank-robber, WIllem Dafoe as a fellow cop, Christopher Plummer as the bank's shady president and Jodie Foster as an even shadier 'fixer' who poses as a real estate mogul -- plays second fiddle to Washington in this one. Is INSIDE MAN a must-see? Not by a long shot, especially with a second half that crawls to the finish and distracting cinematography as the film jumps back and forth in time. Is it a compelling bank heist yarn? Not really, once we understand the bigger picture, which unfortunately is telegraphed early on. But the movie should make for a pleasant, nothing-else-to-do kind of evening viewing, if nothing else just to watch Washington in action.",6,1,1,12 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Nothing special, but worth a watch
","The movie version of THE DA VINCI CODE is an OK action thriller, but nothing special. Tom Hanks is miscast as hero Robert Langdon, but Ian McKellan, Paul Bettany and Jean Reno all acquit themselves quite nicely as various supporting characters. Audrey Tattoo as Langdon's unexpected companion makes for nice eye candy. The plot involves tracking down the Holy Grail, among other things, and is not a bad adaptation of the book, which itself is a hokey mishmash of conspiracy theories and alternate takes on the lives of Jesus and Mary Magdeline, with lots of international derring-do thrown in for good measure. Director Ron Howard perhaps bit off more than he could chew here, but he does keep things moving at a decent pace, right up to the unnerving climax. I just wish someone other than Hanks had played Langdon. When they get around to filming ANGELS AND DEMONS, an earlier and far superior Langdon adventure involving murder at the Vatican, I'd love to see someone like Christian Bale (astutely suggested by my youngest kid) take on the role. Or Harrison Ford, if he could somehow shed 30 years.",6,0,4,2 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," One wonders
","One has to wonder for whom this film was made. Certainly not for fans of the book, who were disappointed to see how badly it was adapted. As for the rest of us, well, since we don't tend to be HARRY POTTER fans in the first place, this choppily edited, disjointed, CGI-heavy kiddie adventure tends to leave a very unsatisfying taste in the mouth. I honestly am not sure who would want to see this. Whatever money it makes, it presumably makes off of those who read the book, and few others. And those who read the book are not likely to recommend it to others, nor be repeat viewers. I predict the studio is going to experience a dramatic downturn in the box office take on the final three movies. (An easy prediction, actually, as I am a former film reviewer.) Also, the leads are becoming less appealing as they grow older. And it doesn't help that the replacement (Michael Gambon) for Dumbledore, the school chancellor (Richard Harris, who died right after the second film was shot), is an absolute dud.",6,0,0,4 March 2006
Man on Fire," My reviews appear to be slipping away
","MAN ON FIRE, which I reviewed when it first hit DVD, is probably the best action film I have ever seen since DIE HARD. Denzel W. is a bodyguard whose charge (Dakota Fanning) is stolen away from him. He goes bonkers and in an absolute rage tracks down the kidnapers, who turn out to be a lot closer to home than he realizes. Denzel W. is great, Dakota Fanning is great, and the ending is something no one in his right mind will ever forget. This may be Tony Scott's greatest work and is a must-see. As usual with Scott, it's all surface but he pulls a fast one on us at the film's climax. At this moment, IMDb is asking for more lines, so I will type this sentence to satisfy them.",8,0,2,24 February 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Moving drama
","STF is a drama, not a comedy, about an IRS schmuck (Will Ferrell) who starts hearing a voice in his head. The voice belongs to a deranged author (Emma Thompson) who is suffering from writer's block and very slowly spinning a yarn about the schmuck with eventual plans to kill him, as she has done to the protagonists of her previous eight books. The schmuck understandably doesn't want to die, and goes in search of this mystery voice in his head. Along the way, he meets a winsome bakery owner (Maggie Gyllenhall) who helps him take charge of his own fate, more or less. Dustin Hoffman, sporting one hell of a Captain Kirk toupee, plays a coffee-snorting literary professor who helps the schmuck sort out what kind of story he is in, in order to figure out the author's identity. Hoffman is hysterical, Ferrell is tightly controlled as the schmuck slowly coming out of his shell, and Gyllenhall is just about the sexiest baker on the planet -- except for a really gruesome tattoo on her right arm, marking her feminist spirit. Linda Hunt has a tiny role as the schmuck's shrink, and an unrecognizable Tom Hulce plays the schmuck's strange human resources manager. A very good movie, but it is definitely not a comedy, even with quite a few laughs. So, as such, be prepared for a shock or two. The trailers for it stressed the few comic moments. The studio evidently did not want you to know it is a drama, along the lines of the director's previous STAY or that Malkovich movie with John Cusack or that Japanese hootenanny with Bill Murray.",8,1,3,11 November 2006
Lord of War," Excellent real-world fable
","Nic Cage is the world's most successful arms dealer in LORD OF WAR, which follows his story from childhood to middle age, at which point he is on the verge of losing everything that is dear to him as he continues to heed the call to arms. The script is a marvelous distillation of the madness and mayhem of the wars that have taken place across our globe in the last 30 years. Cage is compelling as a manic gun dealer, and plays his role in a most deadpan and droll manner. The cinematography is astonishing, especially in depicting massive convoys of war planes and tanks and endless weaponry rolling through the war-torn landscapes of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Russia. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Jared Leto as Cage's drug-addled brother and Bridget Moynihan as Cage's adoring but disillusioned wife. A must-see.",8,0,2,14 January 2006
1408," Scary and inventive, but a bit overwhelming at times
","1408 is the (mostly) scary tale of a once-promising author turned hack writer (John Cusack) who is determined to spend a night in a supposedly haunted hotel room in mid-town Manhattan, of all places. He is amply warned off this plan by the hotel manager (Sam Jackson), to no avail. The room has claimed numerous victims, most of whom have met bloody fates after spending an hour or less in the room. Cusack is no sooner checked in than he wishes he could check out, having almost lost his hand to a window with a mind of its own. And that's only the beginning. The room soon throws everything at him, and it all gets to be a bit much after awhile. The elaborate, eye-popping sets are magnificent and were obviously shot overseas to save money. Since the movie is derived from a short-short story, the scenario is opened up to include a subplot involving the writer's estranged wife and dead daughter. And this is where things go slightly awry. The dead daughter bit is a really tired cliché, and the actress playing the daughter is not particularly convincing. Nevertheless, what the filmmakers have done with Stephen King's marvelous little tale is quite the feat of filmic ledgerdemain. Cusack is great and he definitely sees ghosts, which were absent in the short story and are a welcome addition here. Jackson is also terrific, although physically he is quite a departure from the manager as described in the story. The movie ending is not that far off from the story ending, praise be, and it is actually more clever than the story ending. Aside from the boring dead daughter business, I would strongly advise you not to see 1408 alone. It is pretty scary. Even if it is only a PG-13.",7,1,2,24 June 2007
Tombstone," Gritty Western and a love story to boot
","Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career as Wyatt Earp in 1993's TOMBSTONE, a fairly accurate rendition of the Earp brothers adventures in a booming mining town. It's Virgil, Morgan and Wyatt versus a loose-knit gang of thugs known as The Cowboys for control of Tombstone. Things heat up after a showdown adjacent to the OK Corral, and Wyatt -- now a federal marshal -- creates a special posse including Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in top form) and a trio of Cowboy deserters to hunt down the remaining Cowboys. Many familiar faces dot the landscape, including Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp, Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, leader of The Cowboys, and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo, second-in-command of The Cowboys. Russell is given two women to romance in this film, Earp's drug-addicted wife Mattie (Dana Nicholson) and saloon singer Josephine Marcus (Danas Delaney) who has her sights set on Wyatt. A big production with a genuine feel for the mythical cowboy era, although the truth is more likely that the Earps and Holliday were as ruthless a gang as The Cowboys. The only concession to modern times is the Maybelline-style makeup on all the ladies and the contemporary use of the English language.",7,0,2,10 May 2008
Casino Royale," Back to basics
","Let's make sure we understand that Daniel Craig is not Sean Connery before I write that Craig's James Bond in CASINO ROYALE is very much in the mold of the James Bond of old, before things started getting out of hand in the Roger Moore era. The plot is simple enough, the number of characters stripped down (no Q or or Miss Moneypenny or stuffy prime minister, just Bond and M), the action sequences tight and brutal. Craig makes a believable-enough blond Bond on his first mission, as he uncovers a plot among a mysterious cartel to amass a fortune based on some nefarious doings including blowing up a jumbo jet and winning a high-stakes poker tournament. The actor playing LeChiffre is sinister enough, and the actresses playing the Bond girls (there are really only two) are strictly eye candy. The focus is heavily on Craig, who seems physically fit enough (or perhaps it is his stunt double) as he races around the world to expose and defeat this cartel. And the truth is, he does remind me of Connery's Bond, with a touch of Tim Dalton thrown in. No clownish Bond he, like Moore or Brosnan. The always entertaining Jeffrey Wright plays Felix Leiter, Bond's American counterpart.",7,2,9,27 April 2008
Munich," Ouch!
","I wish I could use my wife's one-word description of this dreadful film: Boring. But since I can't, MUNICH is about the killing of the Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics, and the deadly aftermath as the 'eye for an eye' Israel government sends out a hit squad to kill those involved in the massacre. All too quickly, the squad starts killing people not on its list. Then the squad itself is decimated. And in the end the squad leader starts having second thoughts about killing anybody else and even those he has killed. Each time he successfully kills a terrorist, the terrorists undertake much larger-scale retaliations. And to top it off, some terrorists are portrayed sympathetically! The movie ends on a very sour, open-ended note. Jews everywhere must have loved this one -- that is, assuming they or anyone else saw it. MUNICH is very long, very boring and confusing. And in his attempt to make the film ultra-realistic, Spielberg manages to make us not care about anybody. There are no good guys, no bad guys. I have no idea what he thought he was doing when he undertook this project. Certainly, it was not to entertain or enlighten the masses, which are the things a good movie does. I suspect Spielberg made MUNICH for his own private purposes, the audience be damned. As for the actors, I would have preferred someone like Viggo Mortensen in the lead, but then we would have had a distinctive, charismatic character with whom to identify, and Spielberg apparently did not wish this. He instead gives us the very bland, nondescript Eric Bana. The very detailed early 1970s look is wasted on a movie that never should have been made. You know how bizarre Hollywood has become when it nominated MUNICH for five Oscars and a best director nom for Spielberg. Unbelievable. Skip this one, big-time.",1,24,44,6 May 2006

Only Sandler has to find this out for himself, and does so. In CLICK, a unique remote control allows Sandler to fast-forward, pause and even reverse his life. But things quickly go awry. CLICK goes from being a laugh-out-loud comedy to a tissue box-required melodrama as Sandler makes mistake after mistake with his newfound accessory. And so that you don't make a mistake: This is no dream, regardless of what you may have heard. Sandler is fine, if no Jim Carrey, and Brit thesp Kate 'Underworld' Beckinsale does a passable American accent as Sandler's wife. As always, SNL pal Rob Schneider has a small role.

Predictably, West falls in love with Moore even when she warns him not to. Then her secret comes out (it starts with a 'c'), and he loves her even more, enough to ask her to marry him. The film is a tender tale of the redemptive powers of faith and love, and forgiveness. It is frankly very moving for such a hokey plot. Peter Coyote and Darryl Hannah costar as parents.

Sin City," A real comic book of a movie
","SIN CITY is a living, breathing comic book of a movie, not surprising since it is an adaptation of a graphic novel by former BATMAN writer Frank Miller. The production values are some of the best I have ever seen, combining live actors with CGI and matte sets to create a near-flawless visual experience. What the episodic movie lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in some terrific acting and great gobs of graphic gore, nudity and violence -- the last three being some of my favorite things. The only thing missing was a decent sex scene. In the first story, Bruce Willis shines as a -- what else? -- grizzled, older cop trying to stop a child killer. In the second story, Mickey Rourke plays an over-the-top quasi-superhero with a fright mask for a face (shades of real life!) up against a veritable army of goons who are killing prostitutes. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro costar in the third and final episode, which is about two quarreling guys and a gal -- well, actually, make that gals, lots of gals, and all of them great looking. Touches of BLADE RUNNER, KILL BILL, PULP FICTION and BATMAN can be felt throughout. SIN CITY is aimed primarily at a young and hip crowd familiar with today's stylized comic books. All others, beware. You won't be seeing this on regular TV anytime soon.",7,0,2,4 April 2006
Happy Feet," Joyous
","HAPPY FEET is a joyous, largely musical cartoon involving the search for a dwindling fish supply by a brave young emperor penguin. The gag is that this penguin was born with a bad singing voice in a society defined by its singing agility. But man, can he dance! The irony for the adults in the audience is that when this kid tries to sing, he sounds exactly like a real penguin. But to penguin ears, he brays like a donkey. The movie is filled with great pop tunes of the last 50 years. The animation and artistry are first rate, and it looks a lot like ICE AGE. The movie does bog down in the second half as this Fred Astaire of penguins goes in search of the 'aliens' who have disrupted his land. We lose the music and the film's rhythm during this extended sequence. But it comes around again at the very end for a big, toe-tapping finale. It should be noted the indefatigable Robin Williams voices not one but two characters.",7,1,2,15 December 2006
Donnie Darko," Sure to create controversy and confusion
","DD is a teen-oriented fantasy about a troubled young man who has a series of odd visions, including of a six-foot-tall rabbit that looks like Harvey's evil cousin. The rabbit advises Donnie on and off throughout the movie, while Donnie goes off on some apparently time-tripping adventures. Early on in the film, Donnie avoids a close call with death in the form of an errant airplane fuselage. From that point, the movie unspools like ALICE IN WONDERLAND on acid. My initial take on the movie, back when I was reviewing under another name, was that Donnie's visions were spurred by his schizophrenia. Thanks to my wife, the nurse, I have come to understand that his problems were more likely the consequence of being heavily and perhaps unnecessarily medicated. While the film is hardly perfect, it is interesting to read the endless interpretations posted here. Younger viewers tend to see the film as literally involving time travel while older viewers see it as a nightmarish dream. Whatever the answer, Jake G. is note-perfect as Donnie. And among the supporting players, Drew Barrymore stands out as one of his teachers. For reasons I have forgotten, the director has set the story slightly back in time, which in the end does no harm.",6,2,4,24 October 2007
V for Vendetta," OK comic book action
","V FOR VENDETTA is a nicely realized adaptation of an old graphic novel by Alan Moore. V (Hugo Weaving) is a Zorro-like character who defends the weak and punishes the corrupt regime that rules the people. Set in near-future England, V takes on the entire British government, run with an iron first by a sickly-looking John Hurt. A very sharp detective played by Stephen Rea is close on V's heels, and a lovely young innocent played by Natalie Portman becomes V's devoted ally. V is a terrorist, but a sympathetic one as he goes about blowing up buildings and battling cops and soldiers. V FOR VENDETTA also has a little bit of Batman and the Scarlet Pimpernel in it, and the ever-disguised hero has fashioned his 'new' life from THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The movie falters midway when Portman is imprisoned and tortured for a lengthy period, but picks up again for a slam-bang finale as V and Portman plot to blow up Parliament. A little more action and a bit less talking might have raised this B-flick to A-status. As it is, not bad for a movie adapted from a comic book.",7,1,3,29 July 2006
