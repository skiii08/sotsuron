Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a whole lot of hype and precious little substance
","Undoubtedly there was a market for another Star Wars film. How unfortunate that the offering we were served failed to come close to the worst of its predecessors. Modern technology should have been able to present us with a veritable feast of special effects. Some were excellent, some worse than useless, most run of the modern-day mill. The script failed to provide a decent vehicle for the actors as well as a reasonable storyline for the viewer. True Star Wars fans will probably have had their hunger satiated for a while. For myself [as not being totally blinded by mystique of the whole Star Wars story]I was massively disappointed in what I considered a feeble effort. 5 out of ten at best",5,0,1,1 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Red Line: Entertainment or truly hard work?
","Comparisons between 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Saving Private Ryan' are inevitable given that they are both running for a considerable number of the 1999 Oscars. In my view there is little comparison in terms of quality, powerful imagery and entertainment. 'Red Line' could have been an excellent film. It had the opportunity to use some wonderful scenery and actors to properly portray the viciousness of the Guadalcanal fighting, accepted by most as one of the major pivotal points of the war in the pacific. Instead we were treated to considerable numbers of shots of the local flora and fauna in between often difficult to follow passages where the story, such as it was, unfolded. Most viewers, even if they hadn't seen SPR, would have felt short-changed by action sequences that lacked the necessary bite and special effects which failed to portray any sort of real intensity. Having brought together the correct uniforms, weapons, talented cast and a wonderful location, for the director and crew to have short changed the cinema public like this is nothing short of diabolical. To fall so hopelessly between the two stools of message and entertainment is similarly unjustifiable. The entertainment factor was limited to some nice scenery, some average action sequences and the odd passage of excellent acting. It was also diluted by the meaningless ramble of some of the voice-overs. The message factor was always going to be lost on a cinema audience that was struggling to stay awake and concentrate on the evening I saw the film.  Most who pay good money in the cinemas would prefer to be entertained rather than mentally challenged I'm sure. The death of one of the main players in the movie was so understated in the 'dying' sequence that I'm sure many people only realised later. The rambling on of the film after the action is completed beggars belief. Although I can see many flaws in SPR I believe it would be a complete travesty for 'The Thin Red Line' to deprive it of any awards or kudos in any department other than acting, and then only maybe! How best to sum up the film; I have seen most films about combat and I own a great many. This one will only make my video collection if someone buys it for me before I can spread the word about it. For me 4/10 tops.",4,0,0,21 March 1999
