Catch Me If You Can," a fun movie!
","I usually see Tom Hanks films straight off but was put off by the kind of wacky/comedy trailer shown.  However, I finally went to see it tonight and it was a total delight. Love to know how true to life the move was, but hey, the story made a great movie!  I'm off to read the book.",9,1,2,1 March 2003
