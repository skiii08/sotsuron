The Blair Witch Project," Imagination is key to the movie.
","To all people with an imagination as active as mine:  this movie is one of the scariest, if not the scariest, movies that I have ever seen.  The way the film was made plays with your mind and it makes you think.  I can't think of another way to describe it without ruining the movie for you.  One thing is certain though, I sold my tent because I sure won't use it anymore.",6,1,2,5 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Who Knew?
","In the past few years it had started to seem that Hollywood was never going to do anything different or special.  For years it was the trend movies (ie-the disaster movies, WW2 movies, destroying earth movies).  Now we have this glimmering light from the depths of Hollywood shining through all the proverbial muck.  I can't say much more about this movie without talking about the story and plot.  But I can say that I was making plans to see it again less than half way through the movie.  And it doesn't hurt that the music is wonderful.  McGregor and Kidman are incredible together, and they have the most wonderful voices.  I recommend this movie to any person of any age, and especially to those of a theatre background.",10,0,1,19 July 2001
