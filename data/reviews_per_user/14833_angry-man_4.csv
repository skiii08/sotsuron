The Longest Yard," Not a bad way to waste a couple hours...
","I confess I've never seen the original '74 flick, but I found this version from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions to be a pretty good time. Sandler as the disgraced ex-football hero, plays it straight and understated keeping the character grounded, likable yet not without his personal demons. The inmates, the guards and the ever corrupt prison warden are all well cast, with Chris Rock, James Cromwell, and Reynolds (star of the original '74 flick) all turning in appropriately complimentary performances. Some of the most entertaining and memorable moments, however, belong to lesser known actors, without whom this film would've lost much of it's charm. We love the 'ol 'underdog story' here in the states and we get just that with this film, ultimately a typical feel-good American movie with some decent laughs. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours, but nothing beyond.",6,0,2,21 May 2006
Hostel," Fun but over hyped.
","Director of the indie hit 'Cabin Fever', Eli Roth's 2nd feature and latest horror offering is a starker and potentially more disturbing take vision. Though not without a sense of humor, which seems to deliberately compliment some of the more gruesome of the film, 'Hostel' succeeds most for me during the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the picture. Characters and setup are laid out smoothly and an abundance of bare-breasts doesn't hurt either;) However, once things really start to go from bad to worse, it became increasingly difficult for me to continue to take the situation seriously as scenes go over-the-top and humor starts to leak through. While this was likely a conscience choice on the part of the director, for me it hurt the film and my ability to stay engrossed. I'd have rather the tone and story remained consistent and not made the apparent change-up.Though still bound to be strong medicine for the average mainstream movie goer, Hostel seems unlikely to leave a lasting mark on genre fans. If you've heard comparison's to Miike's 'Audition' don't expect to have the same reaction because unlike the latter, this film isn't especially disturbing or horrifying. It's a fun time at the movies and somewhat of a step up forward from 'Cabin Fever', but just the same not particularly memorable.",6,0,0,21 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Not bad, but not great.
","I was a big fan of the Narnia book series when I was a kid and it was not without some skepticism that I went into the theater to see this, the first big-screen incarnation, of the series. That said, I rather enjoyed this adaptation by director Andrew Adamson - who interestingly enough is a native New Zealander like Peter Jackson of 'Lord of The Rings Fame' and considerable fortune;) Is there is something in the picturesque rolling landscapes of New Zealand that just imbues filmmakers with the passion and drive to see such large scale endeavors realized? Who can say. In any event, Adamson's previous co-directing credits for the wildly popular 'Shrek' & 'Shrek 2' and a strong background in visual effects were surely helped in landing him this gig on what has become (if I'm not mistaken, the most successful blockbuster of 2005). Young Georgie Henley sometimes stealing the show with her portrayal of little 'Lucy Pevensie' and Skandar Keynes as her brother 'Edmund' is also quite well cast and fills this the most dynamic role of the film quite convincingly. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are adequately cast as 'Lucy' and 'Peter' respectively but are out-shined (and perhaps rightly so) by the performances of their afore-mentioned younger colleagues. Tilda Swinton as 'The White Witch' is flawless: cold and menacing as I remember from the book. Indeed her introductory scene as she seduces young Edmund is quite a memorable moment in the film. Look for a good voice performance by Liam Neeson as the omnipresent 'Aslam' as well.The setting in the film are about as epic and sumptuous as you'd expect, shot in locations ranging from New Zealand to Poland, and the visual effects, while not flawless are generally satisfactory and the scale of the battle is certainly well realized. Of particular noteworthiness are some of the great creature designs by make-up artist Greg Nicotero (it's nice to see that Adamson had the good sense not go with CGI for everything).On the flip side, though, the pacing for the flick lags a bit and in the end, though I enjoyed the film, it's tough for me to say whether it really captured Lewis' world and characters quite as I remembered it, but then it's been ages since I've read any of those books;) So get out there and give Disney more money why don't you? It's certainly a film that benefits from being seen on the big screen.",6,1,2,21 May 2006
30 Days of Night," Falls short...
","This flick, based on the Niles/Templesmith comic definitely had the potential to make a decent movie, but the vampires and their weird Klingon sounding dialogue just didn't work for me, kind of took away from the suspense and made them less menacing and decidedly goofy really. Less vampiric hissing would've been most welcome. Kinda reminded a little of the theatrical cut of 'Land of The Dead' (still a better movie) where the lead zombie is always moaning constantly. Less is usually more. Hartnett was good and well cast, and there were some good moments, despite the crappy vamp antics, but I would've preferred that they not have changed the end as it was in the book. That's my take anyway.",5,1,3,16 December 2008
