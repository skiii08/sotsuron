Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mindless Crap
","I was expecting so much more from this movie. I found it thoroughly disappointing and feel that anyone over the age of 10 (God forbid anyone viewing it who is that age) would be bored to death with it. I'm no prude, but found most of the 'humor' shocking and obnoxious. It's a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. In all honesty, I can't think of one redeeming quality about it. The most surprising thing is the rating it received from the normally level-headed patrons of this site. I have always placed a great deal of credence in their ratings. I'll be a bit more careful in the future.Len",1,7,15,10 May 2007

","This will be the first movie I've reviewed. I was driven to it by this horrible movie I just watched. At the end I just sat there wondering what I'd just seen and why. I have no clue what it was trying to convey or where it was supposed to be going, but in my view it never got there. The worst of it was the plot, which was plodding and tiresome. This was followed closely by a fair acting job by Denzel Washington (who is one of my favorites) and terrible acting by everyone else, particularly Jodie Foster. Her portrayal of her character was just too cutesy and I found it annoying. I believed all the hype over this movie and ended up wasting 2 hrs. of my life that I will never get back!! I will be checking reviews more closely in the future.djlen",1,16,29,24 August 2006
