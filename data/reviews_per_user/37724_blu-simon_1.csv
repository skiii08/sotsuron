Angels & Demons," Angels and Demons
","the movie is not completely unfortunate. It is faithful to the book, in a nutshell, the music was over done, the special effects were fantastic and the acting even better. Although there are a lot of things very generic about the film, I enjoyed it richly. Ron Howard was not able to film in the Vatican and his studio substitutes were amazing. One massive problem I have with the movie is the idea that it does not add anything to the story to those who have read the book, I knew exactly when everything was going to happen, when the big musical numbers would begin, and I was able to guess pretty much every scene and set before it was shown on screen.What I most loved the film which makes it the difference between a rating of 6 and 7 is the facial expressions of Top Hanks especially at the end. They were very authentic. SIMON",7,2,5,17 May 2009
