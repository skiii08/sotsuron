The King's Speech," üé§THE KINGS SPEECHüèÜBetter Than An Orgasm Floating On A Cloud In The Fairy Tale Some Call Heaven Or A Balloon Of Heroin Appearing After 72 Hours Of Withdrawal
","Anyone that doesn't rate this a 10 is a robot, brain damaged, or a cynic--this was art at every minute and the type of history that makes you feel good and it's not a romcom or some fantasy--a real event presented truthfully that grips you leaves you wondering and has a happy ending that really occurred and colin firth should have won an oscar to act that well is hard to figure out how he accomplished such realism GREAT AND FREE ON NETFLUX no not great PERFECTION!!!",10,0,0,17 May 2020
It," OMG SO OVERATED - GOOD FILM FOR A 7 YEAR OLD...
",It is so obvious from the beginning ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE LOSERS GROUP is going to suffer one death--all this film is good for is some good banter for kids which Ive seen better in Stranger Things and awesomely beautiful special effects but man Ive never seen a more predictible movie in my life--and here I thought this was a sure-fire good flick and had my brother buy Chapter Two which I'm not even going to watch.,3,1,1,28 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The most unique idea yet by a screenplay
",The dialogue isn't typical Tarantino fact providing or of that unique nature unseen in atypical films but that maybe for a reason as we instead find ourselves insane with curiosity where this film is going and in the end WOWed like Iv'e never been WOWed before by an ending in my 45 years of existence.,9,2,4,28 November 2019
Creed II," Finally Hollywood Listens
",Finally no cutting out of old actors what an assemblage of again Stallone showing maybe he's an even better writer than surviving Hollywood purges of older unnameable actors with a much improved acting ability by Lungren and a sensible story that needed this 30 year spanning cast without omitting hard to get actors or changing them and giving spotlight time to old supposed no namers but which added such flavor and connectivity to this series with no one needed left out including Brigette Nielsen if that was her under all the practicality facial reconstruction that was her plastic surgery canvas of a face what a reward for us young generation x fans who saw Rocky 4 in theatres and again finally original unpredictable surprising turns so we're not telling our theatre mate what's going to happen cynically so sick of the same old same old boxing movie yahoo! kids good CREEDence,10,0,1,18 February 2019
