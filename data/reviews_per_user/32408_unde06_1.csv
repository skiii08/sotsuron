Walk the Line," Name of Song
","I just got done watching Walk the Line tonight for the fourth time. I have enjoyed it every time. But I cant seem to find the song when Joaquin Phoenix was performing with June Carter in Las Vegas and he passes out, what song was he singing? And which artists has sung it before Cash? I really did enjoy the movie, it inspired me to buy Cash's Vinyls and really get into some great songwriting. It is hard to get into country singers today they are to commercialized. To get back to the true music of Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Waylon Jennings was great. Any Help at all to the question asked above would be great. I want to hear the whole song. Thank you to whoever can help.",10,0,0,8 July 2006
