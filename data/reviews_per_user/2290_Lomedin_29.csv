Black Swan," More boring than 2 hours of classical ballet
","I have to admit that I never watched ballet, particularly classical. The little I've seen plus the fact that targets high class people whose opinion of themselves is even higher while trying to hide obvious psychological distress (a mental picture of Fraser takes shape), makes me think of ballet as something to avoid if boredom is not your goal.In any case, you can as well avoid this extremely boring movie. It seems like the director attempts to shock us with sex and mental delirium, something that bored me even more. Maybe he thought that taking the somehow worshiped 'lolita' N. Portman and making her fall into a vortex of sexual deviations would act as a leverage for boredom. How pitiful.He added some nice CGI to it, in order, no doubt, to boost the aesthetics of the movie. Still, boring.No matter the director's play with the sexual fantasies of people towards Portman or the little CGI shown, this movie is still predictable and slow. So much, that I'm sure critics love it.",3,3,4,10 February 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Entertaining and deep enough for the most part
","I remember watching some of the old 'The Hulk' series on TV when I was a kid. That's basically all my history with this green big guy. I saw the 2003 film, but either I didn't watch it completely or was overall bad enough to make me forget several pieces here and there. I admit that I'm a bit of a fan of Norton and I find Miss Taylor quite an attractive woman, so I decided to watch this movie right after my terrible experience with Iron Man 1 and 2. The first 10 minutes of The Incredible Hulk were already better than both Iron Man films. It feels, somehow, more mature, whereas Iron Man is a big budget shallow film directed to teenagers and people who don't give a damn about anything but simple action and special effects. The 2008 Hulk gives you a deeper look into the character of Bruce Banner, and his inner struggles fighting to control the green beast known as The Hulk. This alone makes the whole difference compared to, let's say, the narcissist and egomaniac Tony Starks in Iron Man. The Hulk is also packed with action and, although the special effects aren't as mind-blowing as in Iron Man, they will keep you stuck to your seat. The film loses a bit towards the last 30 min, although the very (open) end leaves you with a nice feeling. I also like the crossover stuff in it (The Leader, The Avengers...), even when that means the appearance of Tony Starks. I'd have liked to see more of Norton's acting instead of so much of his CGI face for The Hulk during the last part of the film, but still, not a bad movie.",Null,0,1,7 April 2011
Sucker Punch," Imaginative, geeky, crude
","It took me a little while to get used to this movie, since it's so different to any other film out there. It's great to have movies that separate themselves from the norm, and offer diversity to a saturated market of trash, clichés and stereotypes.First of all, I'll state what a lot of people already did, the special effects are BRILLIANT. Something that, apparently, caught too much the attention of many and they forgot that there's actually a plot, people who seem to think that this is all special effects and violence, like some sort of pacific rim for adults.Now, I like to see so many references to the geeky world here: anime, video games, cosplay, scifi, fantasy... All well mixed up in a potpourri that will make the nerds of the world go in ecstasies. C'mon, nazi zombies and samurai warriors with Gatling weapons? Yahoo! This is definitely a reference for all future anime/video games adaptations.I admit that the hot babes with big guns put me off a little at the beginning. I don't like 5 cm long eyelashes and that type of things, contrary to some who find lolita complex and Barb Wire style movies a blessing. Then, I understood (or want to believe), that's it's necessary for the drama to make sure the audience sees how society (men, mostly) treat women, and how the females can actually defend themselves if they need to, thank you very much. It's hard to say the reality of it, since the babes and violence might have been just a marketing strategy to catch a wider audience. Although the depth of the plot and how it unravels to the end makes me think otherwise.Ah, remember to watch the Extended Cut of the film (over 127 min), since the theatrical version was EXTREMELY edited (thanks censors for getting rid of logic, once again, to make more comfortable your reality of weak minded people). Apparently, if you watch the edited version, things don't make sense at all.I also like the crudeness of certain scenes of the movie. It's a blow of fresh air to have some entertainment for adults, with so many twilights out there and politically correct giant robots fighting monsters (wink to del toro).Alas, as some other reviewer commented, one has to wonder if certain people were watching the same movie when they say that it's shallow and simple. Certainly, they might have missed the point and thought that perfect special effects cannot but equal an immature plot.I can only say, well done.",7,1,6,28 November 2013
Iron Man 2," Not as bad as the first one. Then again, that'd be hard
","So, I watched this title straight after the terrible 2008 Iron Man out of some sort of masochistic instinct of mine. Luckily, the story in this second part is relatively better (or not as bad as). You will find the same excellent CGI and even more action. You will also find the same nonsense (such as how Tony Starks' friend in the military -he lost a bit of weight after the first part...- is able to pilot another 'Iron Man' and steal it after winning a fight against Tony's Iron Man without apparently any training in the mechanics of the suit. Oh, yeah, Tony was drunk, so I guess that explains why he lost. And why his friend is able to control the other suit perfectly (?)). They tried to put a bit of more depth into the story and Tony's relation with his late father, which is something that goes in the right direction, regardless how shallow it still looks. Nevertheless, this is just another Hollywood super-production for teenagers and die-hard Iron Man fans I guess (if they liked the horrible first movie, I'm sure they'd love this one). Don't expect much apart from action and supposedly hot babes behaving badly. Special mention to Samuel 'SnakesOnThePlane' Jackson for his role as Nick Fury. Another reason to forget this film.",4,0,4,6 April 2011
World War Z," More of the same: zombies for zombies
","I somehow had my expectations set up high with this movie, I don't know why. Maybe because I expect big budget films to surprise me now and again instead of being just another explosion and gunshots fest. Man, wrong again.The beginning of the movie, up to the titles, didn't make my interest go away. I was hoping to see some of the controversy shown there in the movie itself. All that about how humans are destroying the planet, and how there're people still denying facts like the existence of global warming and such. However, right after we see the title 'World War Z', I got this feeling of uneasiness, when the film goes into its second scene, the family kitchen. Setting, faces, mood, conversation... everything made me have an ominous feeling. It was only the very beginning, so it could just be me and my natural suspicion. The action doesn't take long to start. Explosions and frenzy festival for everybody. The movie goes on and my feeling of dread stays there, and continues to grow, slowly but surely. But, hey, only 30 minutes passed by. A lot can happen. It might not be just ANOTHER survival horror revival. I saw a glimpse of hope with the investigation itself begins. Now, we will have some seriousness rather than shooting, running and growling. Oops, wrong again. After that, I lost all hope: This movie is indeed just another action packed Hollywood shallow spawn.I admit it, I don't have any interest in zombies, I don't even know how there can be a zombie genre. It's always the same with anything with zombies in it. Great for the zombie fans, I suppose. I don't even know what this film it's supposed to be exactly. I recall they tried to put drama into it. How can anybody find anything related to zombies to be dramatic?? Zombies make me smile, at best. The way they move, the way they look, the noises they make. 'Zombieland', see, that's an alright movie because they make fun of the zombies (and fail when they try to be dramatic!). It's sad -and somehow, ridiculous- how little we are told about the zombies in 'World War Z', regarding scientific facts. OK, granted, it's stupid to talk science when we are talking about people who go undead after being bitten. Although, c'mon, they don't even try.My expectations about those controversies shown at the beginning being treated throughout the movie were also destroyed, the final message being HELP EACH OTHER. Wow, how's that for a moral dilemma.And what about Israel's issue and what the movie depicts over there... Now, THAT is funny. I would love to see Israel doing what the movie shows. This movie giving credit to what they have done in real life is already by itself bad enough.Please, please, don't make more zombie movies, series, comics... Nothing. There're plenty of real zombies already here in the non- fictional world. Now, let the hordes of zombie fanatics have a go at me. Because this movie, unfortunately, it's once again simply another zombie movie for zombie people. Even though zombies are ridiculous, I believe a real process of human zombiefication started many, many years ago. You want proof? Count how many zom..erm, people find this review unhelpful.To be fair, this flick have some few alright moments. Although a few OK moments don't make a movie good. This is a motion picture, no still photography.Bottom line: thoughtless action, plenty of explosions, bloody rush and even helicopters and jet fighters! Kids, be happy. Shallow plot, pathetic intents of dramatization sometimes... What else is there to say? Millions wasted on this... Brain dead, alright.",2,1,7,15 September 2013
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Harry Potter meets The Lord of the Ring (rip-off version)
","For what I remember, the first Hellboy was a dark and funny film, refreshing thanks to Hellboy's attitude and some nice designs. The creatures brought to memory Lovecraft and old, evil mysteries. This sequel is like a sloppy Disney movie. I'm not familiar with the Hellboy universe, although all those elves, trolls, and supposedly magical strange made up names had little to do with the feeling of darkness from the first movie. I had the impression of being watching a bad mix of Harry Potter and some other childish fantasy/rip-off where Hellboy just happened to be by chance. Don't get me wrong, I like crossovers. But this is absurd. The elves were nice though (prince and princess, marvelous make-up and acting/fighting), although the whole exotic elvish vocabulary mambo-jambo didn't convince me a bit. Too much of all that already. Then, the jokes seemed all to simple and re-used. Hellboy's attitude is still refreshing, but still, the script and crappy fairytale paraphernalia is too much for me. I wouldn't say it's a bad film. In any case, you certainly will enjoy it more if you are under 14 years old. I'll stick to those brilliant moments in the first film like Santiago Segura's cameo as the heroic train driver. Kids, you keep Hellboy II for yourselves.",5,1,3,28 April 2011
The Expendables," Fun movie to watch
","From the first minutes of this film, with heads blowing and bodies chopped in half, you know what you are going to find for the next 90 minutes. The Expendables, directed by Stallone, follows the same principles of the Rambo franchise: kill the bad guys, save the good people, make explode as many soldiers as possible. And it works. 100% action, it's nice to see such number of classic legends working together (even if Bruce Willis and Arnie are only on screen for a couple of minutes). It's interesting to see how, for some reason, Jet Li is some sort of 'not there yet' professional, and he seems to need someone to save/help him all the time. Stallone adds also a lil of emotional bits (as well in the vein of Rambo). Nothing that you big guys cannot cope with, since this is done in a manner that doesn't feel out of place or corny. You will be kicking ass again next minute. The bottom line, this is a very fun film to watch without any expectations but pure violence trying to be disguised as a way rather than a meaning. I don't think I need to say this, but don't be looking for an original plot nor anything similar. As I said, just an entertaining piece to have a laugh with while drinking with the lads.",6,1,11,2 May 2011
Interstellar," Not such a big deal
","We have to start by acknowledging that C. Nolan has been, for a while, Hollywood's golden boy and, as such, people will undoubtedly deify him; such is the dynamic of this strange and absurd system we live in. Thus, we can understand all the hype this movie receives, regardless of its authenticity.As, for me, from the beginning, after the 'ghost' is mentioned, I saw clearly how that was going to develop; such obviousness scores quite a few negative points for the Nolan brothers' imagination, creativity and originality. Something disappointing, taking in consideration some of the previous works. There's definitely more predictability in this movie than in previous ones, or so was my impression. Particularly, I see a bit too many similarities in ideas, cinematography and even music, to 2001. Apart from that, all that sentimentalism could have been turn down a notch, and clearly the whole 'love' concept. Still, there's much less of that than what you can find is the vast majority of productions nowadays (something that tells us how low the level of quality of movies and series is). Interesting how Matthew McConaughey was also involved in Contact, a movie that also touches one or two points present in Interstellar. Fortunately, the level of sentimentalism doesn't reach those of Contact and, even better, this movie doesn't dwell in god and such nonsense (something which killed Gravity for me).Although the special effects are no doubt very good, all the talk about IMAX and so on made me expect something much more impressive in that department.The story itself was, for me, a bit weak, and some points seemed to be connected with each others just 'because', or by very fragile threads. For all the praise I've heard about Interstellar 'science', I've seen a good few unexplained 'scientific' events in the movie which just seem to be taken for granted, and I can't see the science behind them anywhere.The fact that this is a story -once again- about how to make humanity survive didn't help my opinion, since there's no real intelligent reason, apart from selfishness and survival instincts, to see our species perpetuated along with its destructive behaviour towards all other lifeforms and itself. That makes me connect to the 'fake moon landing' scene, and how all these recent NASA movies might be part of some sort of propaganda machine to, once more, makes us look up to the stars instead of caring more for our planet and trying to stop and reverse all the misery we have been, for centuries, bringing upon it and all its inhabitants.Alas, not a bad movie to watch, but certainly not the shining jewel they want us to believe this is. As I said at the beginning, that's how the system (and thus, the masses), work.",6,1,1,18 January 2016
Pacific Rim," Monsters, robots, explosions and destruction
","Those are the undeniable ingredients for a blockbuster. It's what most people like, and this movie got it all.I didn't know much about this film before I started to watch it, just that there were giant robots in it. Since I watched Robot Jox back in the day (can't believe its score here is less than 5!!), I've always thought that somebody should make a mecha film, and never really understood why it wasn't happening. The beginning of this movie is just like that, it gave me an enormous feeling of being watching Robot Jox again: the acting, the dialogue, the music, the atmosphere... it all reminded me of it. Then, it started to remind me of other movies as well: Godzilla, Evangelion, and even HellBoy. This is particularly interesting: the mood of the movie, like some sort of comic book rather than a live action, reminded me incredibly of HellBoy. Then, I saw Santiago Segura (which gave me a funny surprise) and, after the appearance of Ron Perlman, I knew this movie had something to do with Guillermo Del Toro. I swear I didn't have a clue who the director was, but these points were unmistakable. The end credits confirmed my suspicion. Now, this says a lot about Del Toro, since he can give his particular touch to anything, apparently. However, it also says how predictable and clichéd his movies are. Because, unfortunately, the points that made me think of this director even before I knew it was him behind the camera, are the same points that make me think of this movie as a worthless piece of cinematography. The same jokes, the adolescence feeling... It's a pity that Del Toro has to be linked to these characteristics, rather than other details that shined with originality in some of their other movies like Pan's Labyrinth or The Devil's Backbone. Oh, speaking of predictability, after 33 min into the movie, you will know how it will be ending. Seriously. After 1 hour, you may even be able to predict what will happen in the next scene.Pacific Rim is the shallowest of movies. The whole point of it being simply using all and any instruments at the director's disposition to aid the showing off of hits, punches and so-called cool dialogue lines (nothing more than rancid clichés). The plot itself has sooooo many holes in it, each one of them the size of one of those giant robots. It's pointless to discuss them. This movie doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's a flick to be enjoyed by people who has the capacity of leaving their minds blank (or who actually HAVE minds like that). For Pete's sake, we even get a harangue! Pacific Rim made me feel the same as HellBoy 2 did: it seems a potpourri of this and that movie, these and those animated series, of rancid clichés and surrender-it-all to a grandiose FX's show of explosions and destruction. Is Del Toro becoming a new Michael Bay? I really hope not.Alas, once again, IMDb's rating will be deceiving for an audience who expects more than absurd plots and puberty's amusements. I would have enjoyed this 20 years ago, maybe. Like I did enjoy Robot Jox then. Now, I can only see another piece for the children at heart (and mind).",3,2,6,3 October 2013
Oblivion," The anti-Nero
","Tom Cruise continues to act in sci-fi movies, perhaps something to do with the scientology, since his creator was a sci-fi writer. He delivers the same solid acting as he always does, playing the cool guy with no problems (he could be the same character in all his roles, it'd not make a difference). It bothers me a bit that his girls are 30 years younger than him. I'd like to see him being the husband of an older woman for once. Hm, I guess that would make the partner 90 though.This is an entertaining movie, with flawless special effects. It's full of plot holes the size of Tet, a good few predictable occurrences and it seems to take some ideas from other movies/books like 2001, Moon, Independence Day or Terminator. The first half of the movie interested me more. After that things get a bit too Hollywood and we start seeing a little cliché here and there.Alas, it's an enjoyable film if you don't take it too serious and try to leave your mind blank to avoid seeing all the errors this movie makes. With that in mind, it's re-watchable, since its pace makes it a fun flick and the excellent fxs make it eye-candy.And, well, I saw that there were 666 review written before I started to write this, thus the review title, if anybody is interested and gets the idea. Sorry, temptation was too much!",6,0,3,16 September 2013
Independence Day," Worst film I ever watched, along with Godzilla
","I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich.Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clichés over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera.Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions.So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed.Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).",1,2,4,15 September 2013
No Country for Old Men," Not bad, for an average film
","I'm well aware of the Cohen's fame and I also know what to expect from their films, regardless the horde of fanatics awaiting the next 'Cohen revelation' and supposedly semi-intellectual old school classic. This film is not any different. Artistically, quite enjoyable. Nice photography, interesting characters, not a bad film to spend the night in the couch for. Now, as groundbreaking, blow-minding cinematography, little here. This film contains exactly the same topics the Cohen tend to use again and again. So I guess you will like it if you, like many others, worship them. Still, this is not a deep movie. It pretends to be, perhaps, can't judge on that since I don't know what was in the directors head. It may just be the actual public and their comments who give it that feeling. No country for old men is a plain and sort of predictable film. This doesn't take any charm away. It also doesn't make it the best film of the year. In any case, I know Cohen's worshipers will continue to think that I don't have a clue and I will continue to roll my eyes. Again, not a bad movie if you are into average, well executed cinematography. However, this is not by any means the great masterpiece so many claim it to be.",6,2,6,1 May 2011
Hellboy," An entertaining, funny dark film
","I was not familiar with Hellboy before watching this film. I reckon I knew he came from comic books, but that was all about it. I found this film to be quite good, a nice mixture of action, humor and darkness with excellent special effects. I just re-watch it and it definitely reassured the fact that this is infinitely better than the sequel, which lost all sense of gloom and simply repeated bad jokes and added non Hellboy related stuff (elves, etc). It's hard to see why people would consider Hellboy worse than Hellboy 2 but, then again, you just have to look at the world today to realize how messed up common sense and opinions are. That's my rant for today. Alas, a very watchable film if you are into sci-fi/fantasy/action. Also recommended for the common folk who enjoys his/her popcorn.",7,0,0,1 May 2011
The Mist," Another boring, clichÃ©, 'horror' movie
","I wasn't impressed after reading the summary and watching the trailer of The Mist. I'm not a fan of King and find any post-The Shining movie quite bad. However, because of the high score here, I decided to give it a try. Once again, a piece of rubbish receives inexplicable praise. This movie is terrible. It got the exact same elements you will find in any other modern King adaptation (weird creatures, the military and some hysterical people). Now, I understand that The Mist tries very hard to create antagonists and individuals normal people can relate to by boosting stereotypical personalities to the extreme, but this is ridiculous. I don't need to watch a religious fanatic portrayed like that, I already want them to stay well away from me without the need to go through a piece of thrash like this one. I also don't need this film to torture me with idiotic human behaviour because I can already see it by having a look through the window. Alright, The Mist have a couple of OK moments. That doesn't save it. I'm fed up with these movies showing the same things, the emotional (and shallow) stuff and the good guy who has to go through great sacrifices due to his do-gooder nature. Seriously, a slight change in the monsters doesn't make for a new film every year Mr King.",2,2,6,8 May 2011
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Rubbish
","I never had an interest in the fantastic 4 to start with. I didn't want to watch the first film at all. However, finding the Silver surfer appealing, I bought the DVD and gave it a try. What a big mistake. This film not only got all the stupid clichés you could think of, but the only character I thought would be interesting (The Silver Surfer) was reduced to a silly persona relating some sort of amoeba with god-like powers. Special effects apart, there's nothing to save from this film. There are people out there who want us to still believe that good special effects are enough to justify millions of dollars in expenses and a horrible plot. Michael Bay and company, please, take a $10000 budget and let's see if you can actually come up with a good film. I gave away this DVD and I feel ashamed of ever spending a few bucks in it.",1,0,4,15 May 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Overrated simplistic film
","While watching this movie, similar films which stories are based on flashbacks/retelling the past came to mind: Forrest Gump, The Bicentennial Man, The Bridges of Madison County... Well, I actually enjoyed this Clint Eastwood movie back in the day, although my personal circumstances were different. Anyway, what those 2 first films and B. Button have in common, apart from the way the story is told, is how they try to take superficial human emotions and overuse them in order to produce a movie that moves the viewer. And, as it happened with Gump and The 200th Man, it ends up being just somehow hollow. Sure, if you enjoy simple emotions and the views of morality and what's supposed to be important that most of the world shares, you will enjoy its 2 hours and 46 minutes. Although, apart from the fact that this is the story of a human being whose body grows younger rather than old, all else have been told in other films. In the same ways. A love story trying to grab more, trying to go into 'deeper' emotions that all human beings can feel connected to by exemplifying the occurrences in the life of one man. In this film you will find all your typical issues, including the subtle hint of americanism, all masterfully (?) crafted to make the common folk wet his/her eyes. I gave it a 6 instead of a 5 for the artistic value. Any person without an abstract mind who likes what's supposed to be 'touching' and 'emotional' will enjoy -don't know if that's the appropriate word for making you cry- this. If you seek a true deeper knowledge of the whole spectrum of human emotions, don't expect it here. Also, in a more personal note, I found the Louisiana accent a bit too much sometimes, but that's just me.",6,2,3,19 April 2011
Jurassic World," No innovation whatsoever
","I made a mistake watching this movie right after the new Mad Max. Ironically, one of the reasons for which I loved Mad Max Fury Road is the use of the same themes, camera angles and tricks from the old movies. That is also one of the reasons for which I find Jurassic World a terrible film.Back when I was 12 or so and I went to watch Jurassic Park in the cinema, I fell in love. OK, I was fascinated by dinosaurs back then, and the movie was innovative in more than one way. I even continued to follow the sequels, and liked them enough.Although I grew up both physically and mentally in these more than 2 decades, unfortunately it seems that the Jurassic Park franchise didn't: they still use the same bad jokes, the same clichés, the same predictability and the same scenes. In this last case, literally: you can actually see some scenes copied from the first movie, perhaps from the other 2 as well. OK, granted, there's not much to do with dinosaurs but to scream, run and hide, although re-using not only stories, plots and sub-plots but scenes themselves with new actors in them is a bit too much. Honestly, at this point, recycling scenes is not an option in what it was a multimillion dollar Hollywood franchise. Let's remember that this is not a remake, but a whole new movie/sequel on its own (presumably).Apart from that, we get some bad acting (that 'cool' guy, Owen... Jaysus...). Something the previous movies could boast about was a good cast, generally. I missed some cameo, although I liked the appearance of Dr. Wu (even when they gave him such a miserable part - I guess it's more to add to the lack of charm).And, why, oh why, do they have to include dinosaurs brawls??? Are these people 12? Hm, perhaps... Maybe some of us got stuck somewhere back there, more than 2 decades ago.Definitely, a very miss-able movie. Funny how they talk about innovation in it, when the product itself is all but that. One thing they should do, though, is to market those all-purpose high-heels, I'm sure women would appreciate it. I think there's an interesting entry in the msg board about it, along with other 'great' moments of the film. For all the plot holes, poor acting, repetitive and unimaginative action and so on, I'm extremely surprised and disappointed that Jurassic World has a score of more than 7 here, at the moment.From now on, I will also be screaming, running and hiding from movies directed by this 'genius'.",2,1,5,17 January 2016
Into the Wild," Talk about freedom, add a nice landscape and country music - instant success
","I'm starting to see a pattern here. I was recommended this movie by a friend of mine who thought it was great. I have a lot of free time at work (ha!) so I decided to watch it. It didn't move me much. People seems to see here the realization of their own secret desires and dreams. I only see a young fellow who decides to escape his problems and, simply, be selfish. There's a trend: a 'normal' person watches a film about a 'free spirit' doing what he wants to do and the viewer believes that the story is great, regardless how easy it is to actually do what you want, to be who you want to be. The only problem is that it's even easier to follow society's rules and simply being frustrated and emotionally castrated. Sorry about the Freudian analysis. However, it's impossible to properly review this tile (any title?) without understanding why anybody would find it attractive. This is the story of a scared boy who chooses to run away from his social responsibilities. As simply as that. If people find this brilliant because they cannot do it themselves, fair enough. I won't base a criticism on my personal failures though. There's no real morality here, no big teaching, only common sense. That might be already too much for most of the people I guess, alright. Anyway, that's how it is. Beautiful photography nevertheless. Alas, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters in this film and, honestly, couldn't care less if it's based on a true story. I can understand why this movie is so loved. And also why it's overrated. It's somehow easy to please the masses and 'alternative' people unable to jump the gap between what they want to be and really are.",6,0,0,19 April 2011
Elysium," Inferior than its predecessor
","For its creator, it's hard to surpass District 9. That mind-blowing, action packed, original debut couldn't possible compete with a movie starring Matt Damon. That said, Elysium has certain visual similarities reminiscing District 9 that will surely become a good trademark for its director. It also has the star of District 9 now in the role of evil and crazy psycho, which I find nice and funny. I found hilarious the way he used some dutch words in District 9 and, in Elysium, his repertoire expanded! Don't know how this will fit with people who don't have a clue of Nerderlands. For those fortunate enough to understand it, even the basic, it might be funny, like in my case.Apart from that, this movie repeats the little mistake -in my opinion- that other scifi flicks make: set a year. Why say 'In the year 2154' or whatever? I always then to find that not knowing what year the film is supposed to be set in gives a certain sense of mystery and, perhaps, even reality (they used to set old film in the year 2000 and have flying cars and robots around... I still have to see any of those in the real world).The creator once again focuses on the issue of immigration and how the government (mis)treat these people (or aliens, in the case of District 9). Alas, fun enough to watch once. Pity about Matt Damon in the main role. That didn't help the not-so-great story.",6,0,0,22 December 2013
Mama," Funny
","Welcome to the Hollywood big cliché (although with crappy CGI more often than not). Here you shall not find creativity, horror or imaginative writing. The acting is alright, pity that it doesn't save you from the lame story. The ending tries to be some sort of bitter sweet sentimental nonsense and, allow me to repeat myself, the CGI is laughable, most of the times. Hell, even the prosthetics are bad. I found myself laughing and smirking when the movie show us the girls running around in their fours at the beginning, when we discover the (supposedly) scary entity or with the priceless scene of the crawling wig. Honestly, is this a Disney production? I watched one of those parody movies before this (can't remember if it was Scary Movie 5 or what) and they are both competing for the title of most stupid comedy. The spoof could have taken scenes from the original directly and you wouldn't notice the difference.A very annoying issue is that, lacking any real scary moments, the movie tries to do the cheap trick many other bad 'horror' movies insist on pulling: use a sudden change in the volume of the soundtrack - due to the very low volume of the conversations, a sudden extremely loud noise will surely make your ears bleed; at least some reaction from the viewers, since the silly attempts to scare the audience like this will fail miserably. Unless you are in kindergarten, perhaps.Alas, completely forgettable movie.",4,0,1,10 February 2016
The Happening," Almost a comedy
","This is bad. I mean, so bad sometimes that it's almost a comedy. Firstly, the acting. My god... It's not only bad, it's cheesy. Some conversations/actions are totally irrelevant and absurd. Even the gory scenes give this film a touch of those old low budget funny horror movies. Don't get me wrong, not much blood or guts here. Still, sometimes you just have to laugh (otherwise you could take it serious and actually fall asleep). Except for Zooey Deschanel. She does look cute, and made me smile by simply doing certain movements. Apart from that, the whole plot about nature trying to get rid of men is quite appealing. However, this attempt is basically a disaster, a joke. I wonder if Mr. Shyamalan found some little story he wrote when he was 10 and decided to give it a try. This is certainly what it looks like in any case. I did like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village and Lady in the Water. It's shocking to watch The Happening knowing that it's coming from the same person. As a curiosity, at the end of the film, you can see the little girl carrying an Avatar bag pack, hah! I saw the trailer a few weeks ago and looked terrible as well. All FX's and typical story about a chosen one (not again...) with canned sentences that are supposed to be 'cool', smart and funny at the same time. This might have worked back in the day of Indy and The Lost Ark, but c'mon... Anyway, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan has been blinded by his own popularity, who knows. In any case, he always seemed to be a bit childish regarding certain aspects of his creations and somehow wanted to give a feeling of his movies being deeper and more intelligent that they really are, maybe, with those final twists. Alas, we will see what the future brings. I'd watch this film again if it was necessary, without falling asleep, although I'd rather go for a different title.",4,2,4,3 June 2010
Zombieland," Successful comedy - Bad drama
","This movie start up brilliantly. It got the push to get you involved and wanting more, a refreshing look and very good humor. It doesn't have as much blood as you could expect from a zombie film, although a couple of scenes are pretty gory. Anyway, as I say, the jokes, the comedy, is great. That said, things go a bit down when the film advances. There are moments when this movie tries to be serious and, at that, it fails badly. Those serious moments are supposed to be emotional. They simply slow down the movie and make it feel, well, not so good. And predictable.This is a fun film to watch and, even with the clichéd emotional moments, the funny parts and the amazing acting (except for the 2 female roles) is worth it.",6,0,1,16 May 2012
Iron Man," Iron Man - Cardboard Movie
","I was never particularly interested in Iron Man. No special reason, just didn't get the chance to read any of these comics and the character didn't appeal to me that much. Nevertheless, I watched this film expecting to be somehow enlightened about the (possible) dark origins of The Iron Man, and getting a bit of action. The result of my curiosity has been utter disinterest and disgust. Iron Man tells the story of Tony Starks, a weapon dealer, a playboy, a care-free guy with an over-sized ego. After getting kidnapped by a Middle East guerrilla in order to get him to build one of his hi-tech missiles, Tony is able to build a prototype of the exo-suit Iron Man IN A CAVE, FROM SCRATCH, AND BEING Continuously MONITORED BY HIS CAPTORS. That's right, he does this without these Middle East army people suspecting much. Don't ask me how though. The plot continues with more nonsense and your typical bigger than life ego show. Don't expect any war within Tony ala Batman while he struggles with a dark past or something similar. Tony Starks seems to be a shallow human being who loves himself, end of the story. I cannot help but wonder if the people reviewing this film before me actually watched the same flick. 'A flawed character that becomes honorable'? He doesn't change much through the film. 'Well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged'? Honestly, any Gardfiel episode has a much better script and twists. I also read that this won't disappoint Iron Man comic fans. I can only wish that the comics are actually better than this. Otherwise, I pity anybody attached to the misadventures of this fictional individual which biggest concern in life is to spit out a joke every time he opens his mouth. The only good points are the CGI and the action in the second part of the film.",4,1,4,5 April 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," Watchable, with action, but...
","There's nothing that wrong with Die Hard 4.0, as an action film. It got a lot of the Die Hard saga action moments. And, well, that's what Die Hard is all about. However, there's something here which isn't quite right for me. I don't get why the bad guy is... the bad guy. He's basically freeing the people from a corrupted system. OK, he's getting paid for it (choosing himself how much he wants for the service), but so does the government (the REAL one) day by day. The exact same thing the 'bad' guy does, it's done in a daily basis by the US government. The only difference is that the government is brainwashing the population instead of actually making it free, like this super evil character does. So, my dilemma is, why is Willis after the good guy? Selfishness, basically, once his daughter gets kidnapped. But before, for some weird and distorted sense of morality. And yes, the government (again, the real one) also kills people in a daily basis to keep things running smoothly, for 'the greater good'. I can't like this film simply because it's all wrong. If the director wanted people to think about deeper things, it wasn't necessary to cover it up with a huge pile of moral BS. Alright, perhaps if he wouldn't, the film would have been censored or whatever. But, hey, I won't sell myself, thank you.",Null,2,4,11 July 2011
Looper," Did they cast Willis because he has experience time travelling?
","Excuse my little title joke, I just find funny how certain people seem to have different roles with an apparently non-skill based point. Don't get me wrong, he does a good job here, it's just simply curiosity. Like Reaves an cyberpunk roles, for example (does he have a cyberpunk look or something?).Anyway, I found this movie entertaining enough. It has some obvious flaws (some of them what-the-hell level), although it tries to make sense as much as possible (even when, compared to this movie, Back to the Future's time travel plot and physics seem to have been written by Stephen Hawkings).If we ignore those little things, Looper becomes a very enjoyable movie, with a nice mix of scifi and supernatural (let's call the 'TK' that). The future has been presented is an overall credible way, and it has things in it that deviate a bit from the norm, which makes the movie look a bit refreshing in that aspect. We'll also find more typical futuristic gadgets (like the flying bikes), which are a nice touch and give the film some sort of classic scifi feeling without making it look outdated.Even though a couple of things throughout the film can be a bit predictable, I was positively surprised when more twists than expected showed up, and was glad to be wrong about certain predictions I had in my mind.Alas, not a bad movie for both scifi fans and people who want to watch an average thriller.",6,0,1,8 October 2013
What We Do in the Shadows," It has been done before, but this is funnier!
","The premise of a mockumentary about vampires living together in a home in an urban environment is not new: the Belgian 'Vampires' presented this to us back in 2010, also from a, somehow, humorous perspective.However, I found this 2014 movie funnier and, overall, better (from a comical P.O.V., at least). It has got nice special effects, used mostly for humorous purposes, and the actors speak English with a funny east-European accent, something 'Vampires' missed (well, I guess, since they spoke French and all vampires seemed native...). So, 'What We Do in the Shadows' is definitely not 100% original, but it contains more physical humour, more goofiness and overall more laughs than the 2010 release. And comedy is all this movie seems to aim for; mission accomplished!",8,1,3,3 May 2016
Deadpool," The Ultimate Cure to Marvelophobia
","I hate superhero movies. I used to liked them, until I outgrown them or, maybe, until they started to become a show of cheesy characters in some sort of idiotic pose trying to spout cool sentences as empty as their heads. A sign of what is also going outside the big screen. The new Spiderman, Thor, Batman vs Superman, The Avengers, Iron Man, X-Men Days of the Future Past (which ruined the memory of the first X-Men comic I ever read, by the way) and, in general, every single DC and Marvel production (particularly the latter, banging out films/series like there's no tomorrow) has been a nightmare for people who, like me, are adults with a brain fitting their age.That's why I love this movie. I can't get enough of the dark humour, of the jokes about X-Men and the whole clichéd superhero franchise so loved these days. I wish there were more movies making fun of superheroes and their stupid and silly behaviour. It's great to be able to watch something which one of its main purposes seems to be to laugh at everything, particularly at established and forced social patterns; and itself. So many people seem to miss that this movie, the whole thing, is a joke. Stop talking about a better plot and character development. You just want another clichéd superhero movie. Special mention to those claiming this to be the worst Marvel/superhero movie. Please, go watch Captain America profound psychological struggles and Avengers' heartfelt sacrifices and leave the rest of us with some serious (right!) fun.I'll end up this review by pointing you towards some funny and silly 'contributions' I noticed before starting my review. Let us take our friend Joshhanks777, with his 1/10 rating, 16 April 2016. This guy seems to have been so bored with the movie that he felt asleep, because he enlightens us by letting us know that 'The main character is very unlikeable [...] and the other characters are not memorable at all, particularly the bland villain and his girlfriend who is a stripper' Erm... Wait... What??? Was I, perchance, the one asleep? No, that couldn't be... But then... How can this individual, who comments on the movie like he watched it all, mistake the main character (who is supposed to be Deadpool) with the bland villain? Because I didn't see any other stripper girlfriend but Wade's, although she wasn't technically his girlfriend anymore... Or maybe he didn't realise what Deadpool looked like without the mask and thought that he stole the girlfriend from Wade the bland villain at the end???? Or, perhaps, he considered the plot of this simple movie so twisted and labyrinthine that he got lost in the deluge of deep, emotional characters with complicated relationships... It couldn't be that he doesn't have a clue about what he is talking about! That'd be impossible. Next, user mufcsince and his/her love for children's shows: 'Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie.' There you have your mindset. And continues 'if one wants to watch porn, they'd watch porn.' You seem to be confused about the meaning of the word 'porn'. Check it out. Learning can be fun! Does Bernie not teach that? Moving along, you have to wonder what the francis a person is thinking when he/she writes a review that is, in fact, a summary of the plot, without even a single personal opinion (which is actually better, considering the shiny jewels people drop for opinions). Take the user GoodHandsomeLad, as an example. Review 'Simply Excellent.', 13 February 2016. So much for brilliance, such genius and originality! Then we have muhammadwasim-40771 with his 'Indecent movie' post entry (the title should say it all). I quote (untouched grammar): 'Deadpool is a Marvel's super hero movie and is supposed to watch by more kids than adults [...]' This guy seems to be so sure of himself than he doesn't even care about reality! Superhero movie? Wake up! If kids watch R-rated movies, well, you are not doing a good job as a parent. 'These kind of movies are destroying new generation morally and physically.' Physically? Indirectly, or do kids hit themselves with new acquired Blu-Ray discs in a maelstrom of hilarity and decadent rapture of joy? Sure, they could not instead be destroyed by sending them to fight wars so the elite can have cheaper oil, or having to cope with irresponsible and alienating parenthood, or indoctrinating them with tales about some guy in the sky wanting to punish anyone who doesn't do as he commands. It must be, surely, this movie. Oh, and Marilyn Manson, of course. '[...] superhero movie should not be like this bcoz its a marvel character and kids don't understand why we r forbidding them to see the movie' Again with the superhero... Did you hear about the antihero archetype? Once more, you seem to be a lousy father, Muhammad. Perhaps you should have considered abstinence, particularly in light of human overpopulation and third world hunger.Anyway, I finish here this, my homage to Deadpool and his disappearing lot. I hope you enjoyed it and didn't find it abusive in any way. After all, my only wish is for all of us to get along. Until our politicians order us to go kill each other in some remote land for a made-up reason.Written by a Deadpool wannabe",8,1,11,27 April 2016
Cloud Atlas," 6 movies in 1
","This film presents us with 6 stories in different ages (19th century, the 30s, the 70s, the present, 2100s and 2300s), linked together apparently by some sort of spiritual humanistic plot.Cloud Atlas is like a mixture of Magnolia, The Hours and even Baccano! I wouldn't be surprise if they found 'inspiration' in those or other sources, since certain directors/writers siblings like to take from other works. Anyway, it's one of those strange cases in which my expectations matched almost perfectly what I witnessed. No more, no less. I don't picture this movie as pretentious, although I see how pretentious people may love it. In any case, it's not for everybody.Each of the 6 stories is somehow valuable (plot wise) on its own, and I found them interesting enough. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing boring. The toll of so many movies interlaced in one is the running time, close to 3 hours. It's bearable though. And you will find a bit of historical film, a lot of drama and mystery, some fantasy and nice scifi. Mind you, the fantastic and futuristic elements are there for the purpose of the plot only, not to show off. That doesn't rest importance to the nicely done special effects.It's also curious to note how the same actors play different roles in all different ages. The bottom line is that this film is yet another story that tries to inject spiritualism (non-religious) into our brains, in the again common current of seen humans through the eyes of humanism, and aiming for something bigger that the simple fact of us being just a sac of flesh.OK to see if you like drama and human related spirituality. This movie won't probably say much to a person with a true purpose in his/her life (no wow effect/change of life after watching it). I suspect that, if you are trying to find something to fill a void, you'll like it more.",6,1,4,22 November 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," Just wow
","I'm sort of a fan of the old Mad Max saga. Those movies introduced me to a 'road movie' genre of sorts, where films are centered around driving, ranging from Dead End to, even, Waterworld (I thought of that bad-mouthed movie as a sort of Mad Max with water instead of wastelands). I wasn't expecting much of Fury Road, to be honest. As the vast majority of sequels and re-makes nowadays, I thought it was going to be a hyped, clichéd attempt to revive the franchise. Boy, was I wrong.Mad Max Fury Road delivers the whole experience of the old saga, plus more. Let me start by saying that this new movie borrows A LOT from the old ones, from camera angles, to paraphernalia, even a bit of the fast-forward motion used in the old movies!! I checked afterwards and, to my surprise and delight, Fury Road creators are the same as the old Mad Max movies, so that explains a lot. I believe this new movie could easily pass for one of the old ones, minus that little extra CGI, of course. I'm glad they didn't try to add new, more modern stuff to the Mad Max universe.Oh, and this is not a sequel, but some sort of re-make. It is another vision of the same theme. Personally, I think it'd be better to watch the old movies to get a better understanding of the reality presented to us in Fury Road. Those flashback/hallucinations would also make more sense.The first 30 minutes of the movie are PURE NON-STOP ACTION, without cheesy or 'cool' dialogue added, something that ruins most films nowadays. In fact, there's very, very, very little talking (throughout the whole movie), something that stays intact from the old days, as well; and that I sincerely appreciate. But, hold on, the action still continues after that marvelous beginning! When the pace slows down a little (just a little), it's only to gather momentum! It's hard to surpass that first part of the movie, OK, although it's still great.The added CGI creates the perfect extra for that post-apocalyptic future, although it's mostly old stunts and little CGI (I think!), which is also a bonus, for me, in this industry overcrowded by cheap and over-expensive computer generated graphics.The cast, although not great for the main characters, is acceptable. I'm not a big fan of Tom 'one expression' Hardy or Theron. I'd actually have preferred Max to keep the 'mask' longer, it gave him more of a 'Mad' air. It reminded me of the sensation I got from seeing the last installment of Judge Dredd, where leaving the helmet on all the time supports the character and makes us focus more in what's going on, at the same time, instead of attracting unwanted attention to poor acting in the form of shallow facial expressions.I found the mythology in this new movie very appealing. I'm glad they stayed away from Christian themes. Allow me to also indicate that I hate movies like fast and the furious or whatever those are called. Please, in case anyone relates Mad Max to that trash, let me tell you that it's nothing of sorts; Mad Max uses the vehicles as a means to deliver a story of survival in a dystopia, contrary to the other movies where the means are the same as the end. This is not a movie about 'tuning', saying clichéd 'cool' one lines or any of such non-sense. This is a movie about survival. No matter how absurd it might seem, or actually be! You have to center in the action and forget about the rest, while still keeping it in the background as a reminder of what you are watching. Complicated? Well, it's just not about car racing and being cool, and let's leave it at that.I read they are going to make a sequel to Fury Road. I certainly hope they can stay in the same road (no pun intended), no need to mess up an excellent comeback.It's great to find a movie like this in this present reality of bad, over-hyped creations. More creators should go back to their origins and deliver shows like this. The only thing they could have added to make it more like the old movies would be Mel Gibson. I'm afraid that would have made Max too Mad, though.",8,4,9,23 January 2016
