Vertigo," Beautifully restored
","The colors in Vertigo almost seem brighter than life.  Living in San Francisco and watching this movie I couldn't help but wish I had lived here in 1958.  The quality of picture is not the only thing noticeable.  Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak are outstanding.  The premise is made believable by the two stars and the way Hitch continually shows Stewart observing Novak from afar:  growing more and more intrigued. The premise?  An ex-detective(Stewart) is called on by an old friend to follow his wife.  The man is afraid his wife is literally possessed. Stewart doesn't believe this at first, but the more he watches Novak the more uncertain he becomes.",10,5,6,20 August 2003
Scarface," Intense
","From reading other reviews, particularly from Ebert, Kevin Thomas, and the like, I'd have to say this is underrated.  Al Pacino plays the part of Tony Montana with the sharpness of a mach 3 razor blade. The American Dream obtained with wretchedness: classic story told with zeal.",8,0,1,20 August 2003
Citizen Kane," A man and his Rosebud
","'Rosebud' Arguably, the most famous word spoken in cinema.  What does it mean? Citizen Kane is about longing.  Similar to how Jimmy Stewart wants an image of a woman(Vertigo), Charles Foster Kane longs for something that isn't there.  Humankind is always longing.  What you need or want becomes what you have, and so you need or want more, and so forth.  Kane is a man who can have everything he wants, yet he still longs for the unattainable.",9,2,4,20 August 2003
Lost in Translation," do it!
","Lost in Translation has elements of a great film.  The feeling of alienation is presented well.  There is chemistry between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  The subtly in the relationship between the leads surpasses most films.  Where in most films, the characters would fall into a passionate kiss early in the picture, these two fall into an intelligent and touching conversation.Spoilers: Translation is not a great film, though.  It is a good film, but it lacks some key elements that would take it to the next level.  That a young, intelligent, beautiful woman(Johansson) would waste her time in Tokyo isn't unbelievable, but it is unlikely.  Before her and Murray begin their consanguinity, she seems quite slumberous.  It is revealed that she is dissatisfied with her marriage to the photographer she has accompanied. Then why did she come along?  Did she want to reconcile?  She makes no attempt.  It is only the Murray character who enlivens her. 
I found it realistic that they didn't have sex, but a little less believable that neither made more of an attempt at this.  Each actor rendered feelings of desire well, but characters become less appealing when they let opportunities slide through their fingertips.  Did they not give in to temptation because they were married?  This seems like the wrong explanation.  Otherwise, they should have avoided one another because their attraction could have yielded sex,  not to mention that Murray sleeps with a lounge singer.  Their relationship goes deeper than sex?  Yeah, I'll buy that, but why not consummate such a bond?  That these two truly love one another would hurt their spouses more than a physical act.These are only slight problems.  The movie is well made.  Tokyo looks exorbitant and frightening.  Bill Murray gives a good performance, but Johansson gives a better one.  Sophia Coppola seems to be a promising young filmmaker.",7,0,1,27 April 2004
Barry Lyndon," Beautiful
","Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.  It is well known that this picture was shot with natural light.  This works so well I found myself pausing the movie to admire many scenes.  The landscapes galvanize the eyes.  Victorian England has never looked so good.For many this may not be enough.  For me, it would've been but didn't have to be.  I found Barry Lyndon to be very thought provoking as well as resplendent.  Can't we all relate to Redmond Barry(Barry Lyndon) in this film?  Don't we all long to be respected and to 'do something' in our lives? Don't we all have flaws?  Of course.  This film is extremely relevant despite being a 20th century movie about a 19th century novel about a relatively unimportant 18th century life.POSSIBLE SPOILER: This movie also contains one of the most gut-wrenching scenes on film. Barry's stepson warrants punishment, but Barry unfashionably deals with him. It is the worst way possible in light of the high society he is among. Barry lashes out with raw emotion and pulverizes the despicable youth in front of a large crowd.  This is an unbelievably pertinent display of violence.  It disturbed me that, on some level, I actually enjoyed watching this beating.  The ironic and poignant thing about this event, is that it is essentially the downfall of Barry.  If he were to have challenged the young man to a duel and killed him, the society at-large would have been much more forgiving.  The lashing he gave publicly, that only wounded the stepson, was deemed so lurid by the crowd, news of his cruelty spread and his reputation was decimated.",10,2,4,1 March 2004
North by Northwest," More Hits than Misses
","North by Northwest is a highly touted Alfred Hitchcock film.  Ranked among his classics such as Vertigo, Rear Window, and Notorious, N.b.N. is generally thought of as one of the suspense master's all-time greats.  It is an overall appealing film but is not on the same level as the aforementioned flicks.  There are terrific moments, but the film doesn't come together as well as these other Hitchcock thrillers.  The ending is not quite up to par, either. The movie deals with Roger Thornhill(Cary Grant) as a cool, witty advertising executive in Manhattan.  He is wrongly identified as an agent for the government by a crime organization.  He is setup and narrowly escapes his first brush with danger.  The police do not believe his story, and everyone, including Thornhill's own mother, thinks he is out of his mind.  From here, Grant goes on a wild ride to clear his name and find out what the hell is going on.
This ride involves planes, trains and automobiles and he meets up with Eve Kendall(Eva Marie Saint) who is very forward with him, and we can tell right away that she's up to something.  Their conversation reminded me of a conversation Frank Sinatra has with Janet Leigh in The Manchurian Candidate. Unlike the latter, which can be seen as having several different meanings and subliminal messages, Grant and Saint have chemistry in their teasing, but it stays rather one dimensional and more formulaic.Scenes like the one where Grant intentionally gets arrested at an auction to escape a couple henchmen are comical and clever.  Even now with computers and high-tech special affect the cropduster and Mt. Rushmore scenes are exhilarating, to say the least.  The cinematography is wonderful throughout the picture, and except for the 50's automobiles and attire, looks remarkably fresh and modern.
While Vertigo's ending was one of the most shocking, Rear Window's the most suspenseful, and Notorious' perfectly fitting, N.b.N.'s didn't thrill me quite the same.  Perhaps I am being overly critical because of my expectations.  The three Hitchcock movies I've compared to North by Northwest are all 10's in my book, while this one gets an 8.  I enjoyed watching it and recommend it to anyone, especially suspense/thriller or Hitchcock fans.",8,12,25,3 May 2004
City of God," Deus of a Film
","City of God is a vivid, compelling work of art.  Not only do directors Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles tell an amazing coming of age story, but they also graphically display the violence and danger of life in the slums of Rio.  This is a place where one certainly does not have to look for trouble to find it.  Children grow up with a gun in their hand and a nonexistent conscience.  School and work are frivolous activities reserved for the weak and meek.  Hoodlums, as they are called, can become revered for their crimes and 'getting out' is something frequently discussed but rarely done.
Rocket(Alexandre Rodrigues) narrates the film as one of the few characters who does not fall victim to a gangster lifestyle.  This is one case where each character is truly victimized, whether they are killing, being killed or just trying to stay out of the way.  The film shows, with unparalleled clarity, how incredibly young children can become murderers.  It also depicts the innate differences in people even in this environment.
Rocket's brother Goose, along with a couple buddies, get the story going and set the foundation for what will become a horrible cycle.  Children start out idolizing the current hoodlum leaders and 'grow up' to become killers, thieves and rapists.  Long before their wicked florescence, what innocence they had is lost by constant exposure to grotesque violence.   As leadership is fought for constantly, and drugs become the most important commodity in the city's economy, Rocket tries to have a much more subdued adolescence.  He isn't that interested in taking up the family business of selling fish, but he also does not want to be a hoodlum like his brother. He smokes pot and hangs out with the groovy crowd.  He does consider crime. On a bus and at a diner he tries his hand at robbery, but never gets the gun out of his pocket.  People he encounters seem to be 'too cool' for him to steal from.  Later on, he gets a job delivering papers, hoping he can eventually use his interest in photography to escape his abysmal surroundings.
Subplots abound and they are wonderfully thought-out and executed.  Things we suspect are substantiated and things we never thought of are uncovered. Its all so tightly wrapped and succinctly told with such velocity that I was astonished to find that I had just watched a two hour movie.  City of God is an amazing movie thats a surefire classic.",10,0,2,23 June 2004
Schindler's List," Shade of Hope
","Oskar Schindler represented a snippet of hope and optimism for an otherwise beleaguered people.  The fact that one man could be responsible for saving well over 1000 people is astonishing in itself.  The story Schindler's List tells magnifies our astonishment.  How a man who seems so self-absorbed and moneygrubbing could end up sacrificing his fortune and risking his own life to save others, is what the film principally deals with.  This interesting subject, shown in the midst of the Holocaust, and combined with other interesting subplots, makes for a stirring movie experience.One detail quite noticeable and frequently discussed is the occasional use of color in this black and white picture.  The most obvious of these being a small girl in red coat.  We see the girl and follow her path for a short time in the film.  This is symbolic on many different levels.  I see her mostly as a glimmer of hope in a tenebrous world for the Jews.  Later, her red coat looms on top of a pile of dead bodies.  Here, we see her singled out among the dead to remind us that while 6 million died, each individual's death mattered.The cast is wonderful.  Liam Neeson plays Schindler subtly but with the right emotion at the right time.  Ralph Fiennes plays a pertinacious German officer with zest and complexity.  The rest of the cast, especially Ben Kingsley as an intelligent Jewish accountant who starts out helping Schindler but finds a way to help his people, too, all play their roles accordingly.  Certainly, anyone who enjoys film should add this to their collection.",9,9,13,13 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," What Plot?
","Oh yeah, its about revenge.Negative comments about this movie seem to pertain to there being a lack of plot and dialogue.  Some critics think that the film is incomplete. Everything about it, however, is intentional.  Less dialogue gives more time to action, the plot is simplistic on purpose, and the movie may be seen as incomplete, because it is the first half of a two-part story.
The film reminded me more of Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels than Pulp Fiction.  But, then again, Barrels reminded me a bit of Pulp Fiction when I first saw it.  At its worst Kill Bill Vol. 1 is Matrixy, with its huge fight scene involving The Bride(Uma Thurman) against the countless foes of the Crazy 88.  At its best, Kill Bill is a fantastic action packed movie that takes on the look and feel of Japanese Anime(and there is even a short section that is animated).  
The fight scene pitting The Bride against O-Ren Ishii looks like a state of the art fighting game on the XBox gaming console.  So much style and pop-culture references arise throughout that I don't know if this is on purpose or not.  Tarantino keeps the movie in its own world where Japanese steel is used to make a sword that is the ultimate weapon.  The world is similar to ours in the 21st century, but it follows different guidelines. We see guns used, but only in certain situations.  The sword is the honorably weapon of choice.
Thurman, Liu and crew do a great job at doing what they are suppose to do, which is: look tough, act cool, seem passionate about what's going on, and be beautiful.",8,0,2,4 May 2004
Big Fish," Embellishment
","Big Fish is a unique and fascinating movie.  While the comparison to The Wizard of Oz may be a little high-reaching(in 1939 The Wizard of Oz was a landmark film beyond what Big Fish is today), I can see why people may make that connection.  They are both whimsical tales of adventure.  Visually, it is fictive, but not in the way the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter movies are.  The chimera in Edward Bloom's mind is understated.  We see what we are meant to see: an embellishment of what really happened.  Yes, many of the scenes representing Bloom's stories are impossible, but they are not as incredible as other stories and fantasies.
William Bloom(Billy Crudup) is a fellow who started viewing his father as an extraordinary hero, then a tall tale teller and finally as a liar.  During his wedding night, William is perturbed when his father tells a story about catching a gigantic fish with a wedding ring.  One he's heard since childhood.  William feels he is only a 'footnote' in the story and his father is telling it merely to stroke his own ego.  After this event, William and Edward(Albert Finney) do not speak for three years.  When William's mother, Sandra(Jessica Lange), calls to tell of Edward's poor health and ensuing death, he decides to see his father and find the truth about the man he knows only through the outlandish stories he's heard.
The opening scenes show that William is not only upset with his father for telling him these stories, but he's tired of hearing them told to his friends, dates and anyone else old Edward can get an ear from.  Flashbacks abound throughout.  We soon delve into the visual presentation of these stories as they are told.  As William makes it home to see his dying dad, we go back in time to see Edward as a young boy and then as a young man, played with jocund bravado by Ewan McGregor.As we begin young Edward's adolescence, he is talented at basketball, football and baseball.  He, in his own words, is the biggest thing the town of Ashton had ever seen.  We are immediately taken into the fictional parts of the tales.  First, Ed Bloom encounters a witch, a giant: a man as big as a two story house.  An enchanted forest is next, then a werewolf and on and on we go.  The town of Spectre is seen like everything else: through the embellishing eye of Edward.  This is an important part of the film because it is a place like many may stop in their lives.  Its a town that seems like a great place to stay.  Yet something is calling Edward somewhere else.  It is looked back on with nostalgia and as a would-be wonderful final destination, but not a place to be when you are young and filled with ambition and adventure.  This resonates deeply with anyone who has ever found themselves in an unexpected town or city that seemed terrific, yet they knew they had to leave.One of the most remarkable things about the film is the resemblance between Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney as well as Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange(young and old Sandra).  This is simply perfect casting.  Many films lack this.  They use the same actor for young and old roles.  This works much better.   Another of the endearing qualities of the film is that as William slowly realizes his father isn't the liar he thought, the flashbacks become less fairy tale and slowly seem more realistic.  This intertwines beautifully. Finally, we see the giant as just an abnormally tall man of about 7'6'.  We see that the twins from his military exploits aren't really conjoined, but simply identical twins.  So in the end, William sees his father for what he is.  He's not a liar, and he's not the hero he was to William as a child. He's a tall tale teller.  A man who romanticizes his stories and embellishes them so that they are a bit larger than life.  The question is, is there any real harm in that, or does it just make life a little sweeter?",8,0,0,12 May 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Greatest Film/Novel Co-production?
","*assumes knowledge of film - contains details of plot*2001: A Space Odyssey is just that: a long wandering voyage of the body and mind.  Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark collaborated brilliantly.  In examining both works, the film and the novel, there are certainly differences, yet the theme and overall idea coincide thoroughly.  That this was made in the 1960's augments both accomplishments.  The visuals, seen in 2004, are still captivating.  What they must've seemed like in 1968!  I flout those who received this movie poorly in those days.  Would I have received it as well without having a preconceived idea of its greatness?  I can only hope I would have known what I was watching.It is rare a movie inspires me to read the novel it is based on.  Here is one occasion.  On my first viewing of the film, I was baffled by the special effects so my appreciation was attained.  This was done when digital effects did not exist.  Scenes of the space station, the moon, Jupiter, Earth from space, and the sun are model works at their finest.  However, I thought I did not fully grasp the story.  After reading the book and seeing the film again, I realized I comprehended more than I gave myself credit for on that first watch.  This is a work that was meant to raise questions rather than give solutions.  At any rate, I was extremely pleased with the book, which brought about a need to see the film again.My second viewing heightened my reverence for Stanley Kubrick.  What he chose to include, change and eliminate is crucial to the film's success, as well as a tribute to his discretion.  Clarke's novel does disentangle some details.  There is no better way to completely realize the ascent to the Star Child than to read Clarke's final chapters.  Still, cinematically, with no dialog or voice-over, Kubrick gives enough clues for an intelligent viewer to take in the concept.  To a lesser extent, the trek Dave Bowman takes to another dimension/galaxy, which is explained in great detail in the book, cannot be fully construed visually.  Still, you know what's happening when Bowman enters the 'wormhole'.  Your eyes are lucky, too.  If you ever wanted to experience true psychedelia and haven't the stomach for hallucinogens, here's your chance.
2001 originated from Clarke's short story, 'The Sentinel.'  This, in no way, takes away from the originality of the film.  An obvious benediction of the movie is Kubrick's use of music.  The classical pieces intensify the sense of awe.  From the ape man to the starchild, the music detaches us from the events.  We view them as we would events in a documentary.  Kubrick deliberately adds, deletes and modifies.  Hal never reads the lips of the astronauts in the book.  This is a stroke of  genius in the motion picture.
We are not as far along in space exploration as 2001 predicts we would be by now.  It's eerily accurate nevertheless.  With the Hal 9000 computer, we see humans as secondary in astronomical research.  In today's actual space missions, humans are rarely even along for the ride.  While technology is not capable of the malevolence seen in Hal,  it is certainly as, if not more, important to the furthering of our knowledge, as Clarke envisioned in his writings.
The movie, coupled with the novel, awakened my interest in astronomy and particularly astrophysics.  It also made me aware of the importance modern media and people in general place on somewhat trivial events, while our planet rotates on its own axis at one thousand miles an hour, and revolves around our sun at around sixty-six thousand miles an hour.  These types of facts may seem trivial, but does the latest reality T.V. show, or the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger called some other politician a girly man blow your mind?
Arthur C. Clarke was a forward thinker.  His ideas on astronomy were far ahead of his time.  Stanley Kubrick was extremely gifted at finding challenging pieces of literature and turning them into spectacular films. The film and the novel are transcendent.  They evoke emotions beyond the everyday.  Of course, if works of art like this were in abundance, they wouldn't be masterpieces.",10,1,3,11 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great until the last 20 minutes
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy will certainly go down as a masterpiece overall.  The third installment picks up where the second left off.  There are battle scenes colossal enough to make it a classic.Spoilers: Both for the review and the film.What I didn't like was the lack of suspense.  It seemed certain throughout the whole movie that Frodo would complete his mission.  Not a single headliner dies.  Frodo loses a finger in a scene and then later we see his hand undamaged.  Even worse is the slow motion homoerotic scenes with Frodo and his Hobbit buddies lolloping in bed together with Gandalf and the other humans looking on gleefully.  I almost thought it was some kind of a joke it was so gaudy.
While these flaws dilapidate the movie I can't say they totally ruin it.  If I ever see it again I won't stick around for the last drippy moments.",7,1,1,30 December 2003
