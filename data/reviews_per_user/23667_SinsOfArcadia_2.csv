The Double Life of Véronique," Life, Conscious, Connection, and Death.
","The Double Life of Veronique | 10/10 This is an incredibly haunting and poetic work that raises a plethora of questions regarding life, death, and the unexplainable connection that some people share. I was stuck in a sort of trance while watching this, as beautifully photographed scenes seemed to follow one after the other for the film's entirety.There wasn't a moment that I had lost interest, and the questions posed throughout are some that I found myself thinking about on many different occasions as a child. Do we, perhaps even simultaneously, share the same thoughts, feel the same feelings, and take part in the same actions as another person we have never met? Is it more than instinctual for us to avoid certain things, or act in certain ways? This film spoke to these questions, but of course never answered them. It turns out, I believe, that there are no answers to begin with.This is the fourth Kieslowski film I've seen, and most certainly the best. Visually, it shares a few things in common with the Colors Trilogy, and Irène Jacob (Veronique and Veronika) was actually the main character in Red. Her acting is extremely good in both films, and the mood she creates in this one is understated, but incredibly graceful. I should mention the music in the film as well, which in addition to being beautifully presented, plays an important role in the connection between the two women. This is one of the best films ever made, presented by a man of great vision who left us far too soon.",Null,7,9,11 August 2007
Lost in Translation," Enigmatic Emptiness.
","Lost in Translation is an anomaly to cinema, at least the cinema that I know. So much can be said about it and yet so little needs to be. There is an allure within the world created by Sofia Coppola that is entirely unique. I can't say I remember very many specific 'parts' or particularly memorable pieces of dialogue, despite having seen it on a number of occasions. I am, however, almost endlessly drawn to the near-enigmatic nature of what does happen, perhaps because it is so easy to relate to. Of course I'm not implying that I empathize with Bob's actual character, but rather, I feel connected to his plight (or lack thereof).If you've ever wandered your neighborhood alone in the early morning hours and felt somewhat indifferent to the world, there may be a small part of either of these characters locked inside of you somewhere, longing to find someone that shares your own troubling sense of apathy - someone that may also lend you a whisper, a bittersweet sense of hope, and a truly private moment that would have the potential to make everything a little more bearable.",9,1,2,21 May 2011
