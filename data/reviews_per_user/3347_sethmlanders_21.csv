The Hangover," It makes Superbad look like Casablanca!
","The trailers for this looked so good, so when I saw it in theaters, I was extremely disappointed. I was ashamed at all of those who were involved with this project and the fact that 35 million dollars went straight down the toilet. I didn't laugh once while watching this dismal piece of garbage! This is probably the most unimportant and overrated comedy ever made. Don't believe any of the hype you may hear, because the 7.8 rating is far from accurate.Now I enjoy stupid comedies and buddy flicks, but this movie fails on every single level. It's pretty obvious that they ripped off the plot of 'Dude, Where's My Car?' (a good comedy) and replaced it with Vegas, proving that they can't even get the story right. Just because Mike Tyson is present, doesn't automatically make it funny. When a naked Asian guy jumps out of a car, that doesn't automatically make it funny either. This movie was so painful to watch that I ignored the sequels.The writing sucks, every joke fall flat, the characters are one-dimensional gag machines, and worst of all...the movie is NOT funny. They rely too much on shock value, with zero build-up or punchline. Humor is entirely based on situations and timing, two things this movie messed up on. If you want to see a comedy that's actually funny, watch 'Dumb & Dumber' instead of this ridiculous rubbish!",1,4,7,28 May 2014
Wayne's World," Excellent!
","This movie is so funny from beginning to end. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey play two best friends who get a deal to start their own T.V. show. All the pop culture references, hilarious cameos (Chris Farley and Alice Cooper included), the Oscar snob scene, and those fourth-wall jokes which make the jokes work.I thought that the love interest was hot and the Mr. Doughnut-Man scene always cracks me up. There's a lot of confidence with the acting and the characters are so memorable. Sure, the plot may be a little thin but this film never gets old!If you wanna see Mike Myers when he was in his prime, it's a must-see.",8,1,1,17 June 2014
Memento," It's nearly a masterpiece!
","This is one of those movies that keeps you guessing until the end. It follows a non-linear pattern in storytelling, which has a similar pace to such great films as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Mulholland Drive'. Not trying to compare those two to this, I'm just saying that the way it weaves between the time-line gives it a strikingly familiar resemblance.What's the story? Leonard Shelby is a man who's out for vengeance. His wife was murdered and suffered a head injury to save her from her death. This head trauma resulted in him not being able to make new memories, while still recalling past occurrences prior to his accident. He lives in a hotel room, trying to figure out how to find his wife's killer). To remember, Leonard writes down notes and takes pictures. As this plays out, we ponder if this condition is psychological or solely just a physical consequence of his state of mind.I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will say that by the end, we figure out the truth behind his wife's death and who real killed her. Mr. Nolan has done an amazing job at keeping the audience guessing in suspense, very methodical and quite effective. Watch it and put the puzzle together yourself!",10,0,4,2 May 2014
Madagascar," Overrated, Such a Waste of a Great Cast!
","Before you judge me on my rating, I want to inform you that I enjoy a lot of these family flicks (such as Toy Story, The Iron Giant, Megamind, Pinnochio, Shrek, The Princess Bride, Babe, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Ice Age, Tarzan, The Lion King, etc.) and my point is that it can be pulled off. I was 12 years old when I saw this movie and even then, I was absolutely disappointed. How can they waste such a great cast and have them participate in this awful movie? This animated film truly had potential, but they ruined it with its unimaginative script, dull characters, and completely predictable story. I can't believe Dreamworks green-lighted this piece of garbage. It's a letdown not only for parents and adults going to see this, but for children who enjoy animated movies!",1,1,3,24 September 2013
Superbad," SuperFunny
","I'm glad this movie exists and is what it became, a cultural phenomenon and a box office hit. Anyone involved in this project should be proud of themselves and thanks to it, Christopher Mintz-Plasse now can get more acting jobs while having a boosted ego. This is the quintessential raunchy teen comedy, it's up there with American Pie, EuroTrip, and The To-Do List.The story isn't that hard to figure out. It's about two best friends that try to get booze for the big party after high school. The problem is how they get the alcohol and what they do to get from point A to point B. When I first saw it, I didn't believe the hype. Yet the more I saw it, the more it made me laugh out loud. Its a rare occurrence to hear dialog this realistic with characters we care about from start to finish while keeping it consistently entertaining with the substance provided.Overall, this is a great late-night comedy with lots of genuine laughs and an honest film with a lot of heart. The casting is great, the jokes work, and the writing is superb. If you're with a bunch of friends and you want to have a fun night, pop this movie in and they'll thank you later!",8,0,1,17 August 2014
500 Days of Summer," Fascinating!
","I heard so much positive things about this movie that I never got around to it until the trailers made me wanna see it. Out of curiosity, I bought a DVD copy and it was worth my $3! This movie was fascinating from beginning to end.It's about a man who falls in love with his co-worker and things seem wonderful but everything abruptly changes. That's as far as I'll go with discussing the plot, because I don't wanna spoil anything. Let's just say that it was an unpredictable and hypnotic experience. Here are the good things about it. Joseph Gordon Levitt is perfectly cast and has a great screen presence. The writing is witty and quirky, which I really thought was a smart move for the filmmakers. Webb (the director) has a precise vision and you could see it in every frame. One last thing, don't expect this to be a laugh-out-loud comedy or else you will be easily disappointed by it. There are a couple chuckles here and there but it's not one of those raunchy, crude humored sort of movie.If you go in with an open mind and don't expect a hilarious comedy, you'll really enjoy it for what it is.",9,1,1,17 June 2015
Knocked Up," Apatow's Comeback
","Don't worry this review is spoiler free. Where do I begin? I really enjoyed 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' and after watching this, I can safely say that it's just as good if not better than his previous film. This is one of those quirky comedies that balances out the romance and drama elements within its two hours. The plot is easy to figure out. Seth Rogen plays Ben, a goofy slacker who is the life of the party. He meets a happy-go-lucky woman named Allison (played by Katherine Heigl). They have a one night stand and weeks later, she finds out that she's pregnant.There is so much to love about this film. The characters are great, especially Ben's friends who are hilarious. The writing is superb and the jokes hit nearly every time. I know some people are going to be disappointed by it, but I had a fun time watching and enjoyed every minute of it. Judd Apatow should be proud of this accomplishment of a movie, this was a comeback project that worked from start to finish. If you enjoy raunchy comedies with a lot of heart to it, this movie is definitely for you!",8,1,3,15 July 2014
American Pie," A True Masterpiece That Has Heart and Nostalgia
","Please try to ignore the negative reviews for this movie and just hear me out. This movie has captured the soul of my youth; I loved it as a teen and I loved it even more as an adult.This movie is an absolute must see and if you haven't seen it yet, this is going to be an informative yet spoiler-free review from a fan's perspective.The atmosphere, the hilarious one-liners, the appealing conflict, its strong character development, the witty writing, the inspiring directing of it all, the ideal cast who played believable characters (except for Vicky & Heather, who are both one-dimensional, but the rest did an amazing job), these are the strengths that I hold dear to my heart.Our story revolves around the raunchy misadventures of four horny friends that are on the quest to get laid. Will they succeed? What tactics will they use to get the women of their choice in bed? What are their strengths and weaknesses? When is the deadline for getting laid? Which guy gets which girl? All of these questions will be answered once you sit down to watch this movie, after reading this.Every time I watch it, I wish my high school life was as spectacular as it's portrayed. The diverse characters enhance the experience of watching it. Of course, everybody knew a Stifler and the male audience can relate to Jim, our protagonist, and his struggles throughout his journey.I hope this review was helpful and if I could rate it higher than a 10/10 (10 out of 10), I would. Trust me, once you finish watching this memorable film filled with laughs and genuine fun, you will thank me!",10,1,2,5 April 2013
Edward Scissorhands," Pointless and Mean-Spirited
","Everybody gets all excited over this movie...not me. I never liked this movie and for good reasons. The concept is horribly executed. We have a sweet guy with scissors for hands and people take advantage of him in the most cruel ways. If you're going to be mean-spirited about it, have it get resolved in a satisfying way for your audience. How can you have a conflict that makes the experience unwatchable? Not only was this piece of garbage painful to watch, but there is nearly zero redeemable qualities about it.The overall message is awful and when the guy gets treated like crap, no one does anything to stop it. It basically tells us that if you get mistreated, just kill the jerks and everything will be okay. Seriously, this is one of the most overrated movies ever made and people are oblivious to how unimportant it is. I'm giving it 2/10, because I did like the sets and costume design. Other than that, avoid this like the plague!",2,5,14,23 April 2014
The Princess Bride," An Amazing Film!
","This is the kind of movie that can appeal to anyone of all ages. It has romance, adventure, drama, comedy, and somehow, it succeeds at every aspect. Rob Reiner is a talented actor's director who cares a lot about the story and his characters.The story is about a boy who is sick and his grandpa reads him a book. It transitions from what we visually see as Peter Falk narrates. Wesley is a charming yet poor farm-boy who falls in love with a woman who is engaged to the wrong man. The girl, Buttercup, is engaged to a egotistical royalty prince (Humperdink). Along the way, we run into some quirky characters that somehow win our affection from the beginning. A giant and a Spanyard, Inigo Montoya, who eventually work with Wesley to stop Buttercup's wedding from happening.Overall, a very magical experience that still holds up to this day. I loved it as a kid and I love it even more in my young adult years. This is one film that you can show your date or family. Watch this movie as you wish!",9,1,2,8 March 2015
Good Will Hunting," One of the BEST Movies Ever Made!
","This review is spoiler-free. Please read on, especially if you haven't seen it yet.....Never has a film emotionally touched me more than this. Hands down, one of the best drama films I've ever seen. My father showed this movie to me at a young age. Unfortunately, he died not too long ago and I'm so thankful he showed me this wonderful film. After watching it several times in recent months, I observed some of the strengths that made him enjoy it as much as I did. Despite its noticeable flaws, it still holds up and leaves an impact in my heart!Is it slow-paced and predictable? Oh there's no denial about that yet it connects with us on such a deep level and gives us time to learn about these interesting characters. Also, the pacing is so hypnotic that I still didn't want to stop watching, even after it ended. The vast majority of people who dislike it are either disappointed by the hype it received or are offended by the excessive profanity. My solution for these two issues is incredibly simple. One is to get passed its publicity and just take it for what it is. As for the constant swearing, try not to judge the movie based on how times the F word is spoken and instead, merely appreciate the flow of dialogue or solely listen to the purpose of why things are being said. The only way to know whether it's good or not is to watch it. I'm aware that this movie isn't for everyone, but I personally recommend you sit down and watch it from beginning to end, even if you hate it afterward.For quite some time, it's been speculated that Kevin Smith and Rob Reiner at one point did revisions on the script, all the better for it! This movie is brilliantly written with powerful scenes and an alluring plot that revolves around a troubled man (played by the talented Matt Damon) who needs direction in life. Its internal conflict is something that is thought provoking with an astonishing payoff. The characters are alive and believable, while Van Sant effectively puts the audience in the right atmosphere. Some fans might have been disappointed with the apparent blandness of Skylar (played by Minnie Driver) or perhaps her weak performance, but I think she tried her best and had excellent chemistry with Will.In conclusion, watch this movie to see how amazing it is. Anyone who was associated with 'Good Will Hunting' should be proud of themselves, because they have earned my respect as an audience member. Not exactly a masterpiece, but something you can relate to and care about!",10,1,4,5 January 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Disappointment (Spoiler-Free)
","*DEEP BREATH* Here we go: I just saw this in theaters and holy cow was it bad! 'How bad was it?'. To be fair, I've seen Spider-Man 1, 2, 3 and the first Amazing Spider Man. So far, they were all great (except 3). I had very high expectations for this to be decent enough. What can possibly go wrong? As soon as the lights went down in the movie theater, I was excited.The first 10 minutes were catchy. It's getting interesting with back-story and appealing visuals. All of sudden, it goes downhill. First thing's first, the actor who played Harry was completely wrong and miscasted as this character. This Dane DeHaan guy makes James Franco's portrayal of the same role look like Al Pachino! Next, it started getting really slow after the 30 minute mark and it felt like an eternity until the credits started rolling.It's pretty clear that Jamie Foxx (who is a talented actor) couldn't refuse the paycheck. Also, that Rhino dude was unintentionally hilarious to the point where the film literally took itself way too seriously. Now I know that Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor but sometimes, the confusing writing forces him to do things that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example, Peter stalks Gwen to her appointment for admissions to this college she got accepted into. He then fraudulently poses as a college staff member to the woman at front desk and it isn't even clever/believable. Here's another issue I had with this over-hyped superhero flick. Peter dresses up as Spider-Man at Harry's request. Out of nowhere, Harry tells him that he's dying (I'm guessing that the cause of it is alcohol poisoning) and asks for his blood. 'Spider-Man' makes up excuses, leaves, and sends Harry in a drunken rage making it a pointless filler scene for Harry to be shown as a a villain for less than 20 minutes of screen time. Overall, the special effects were impressive but the script was obviously rushed and it was surprisingly boring. Even in 3D, this was a flop!",2,1,16,15 May 2014
Mulholland Drive," Best Mystery Movie I've Seen in a Long Time!
","I never knew that such a suspenseful plot that had both horror and romantic elements made me feel different spiritually, after watching. This movie has more questions than answers, folks, so it's not for everyone. There are too many ways to interpret the story. Just pay attention, figure out the differences between perceptions that transitions between reality & dreams, enjoy the performances, and you'll have a darkly wonderful night!Recently, I read a review that Roger Ebert (R.I.P.) posted about the film saying, 'There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery' and he was sure as heck right about that! There was so much inspirational passion behind Mr. Lynch's mind, he's eccentric in his craft and determined in his vision. Although the movie is nearly flawless, you're more than welcome to fast forward the certain redundant/uncomfortable parts (such as Rita saying 'Silencio' a million times or Betty's audition where she makes out with an old fart), but besides that, this was an experimental project that amazed me. Focus closely on the blue key, anything related to murder, and the all the elements that slowly come together.It gets a 10/10 in my book and if only David Lynch won that Oscar. Relax and enjoy this trippy yet thought-provoking mystery movie!",10,2,3,2 September 2013
Reservoir Dogs," Not on par with 'Pulp Fiction', but still an enjoyable work from Tarantino!
","It took me a couple times to full enjoy this movie for what it truly is. A real ensemble piece! The movie is about a group of gangsters with names that represent basic colors that are trying to comprehend why their big heist went so horribly wrong.There's a lot of style and confidence with this film that really shows in the quality of work. The writing is top-notch as usual and yet it's still not on par with the superior 'Pulp Fiction'. One of my favorite scenes is the opening sequence with an argument about believing in tipping in restaurants.I gotta give Tarantino credit for this being his directorial debut and figuring out how to give his characters a lot of personality and wit. This is a pretty good movie and I enjoy it for what it is. If you want to see a character study based crime drama, then this movie is for you!",8,0,0,9 September 2014
Pulp Fiction," One of the Best Movies Ever Made in the History of Film!
","It's hard to put in words how much I love this movie, but here it goes. Pulp Fiction is an absolute masterpiece. A story that's told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if you've viewed it before. It's so amazing that it's nearly flawless!Where to begin, where to begin. The dialog is interesting yet realistic. Rather than giving us frequent exposition, which most filmmakers suffer from, Tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. The movie's time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence, it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. The direction is sure-handed and Tarantino isn't afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. The casting is first-rate, this is the movie that helped revive John Travolta's career and made the rest of the actors' reputable to the Hollywood system.For those who are concerned about the level of violence, it's actually not as graphic as it seems. Yes, it's intense but if you look closely, the content of it isn't gratuitous or repulsive. Gene Siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with Roger Ebert. For example, Bruce Willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. The victim is faced away from the camera so you don't see the weapon attack him. Then, when Willis stabs the sword into the guy's knee, it's out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction.Don't worry, I'm wrapping this up. If you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is, you are going to have a fun two hours. Hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burger!",10,1,3,30 August 2014
The Happening," Worse than you can possibly imagine...
","Okay, so it's not Shyamalan's worst film but it comes pretty close. Mark Wahlberg is very talented but he looks confused most of the time. The plot is about some sort of wind that makes people do crazy things. On certain sources, this was labeled as a horror. While the trailers appear that way, there is nothing scary about it at all. I never felt frightened or at the edge of my seat, it's wind and plants for heaven's sake!The first five minutes had serious potential but then it went completely downhill. I could not take any of the dialogue seriously. There's nothing wrong with campy horror movies but there's no satire or humor for it to be considered that. It just gets ridiculous with a moronic anti-climatic ending that I won't give away because it's not worth explaining. Avoid this movie, I want my time and brain cells back.",3,1,4,6 December 2015
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Absolutely Disappointing!
","Jack Black has proved his talent and has been in many great movies, especially Orange County & Saving Silverman. People loved and cherished the band's song 'Tribute', so I felt let-down that two really funny comedians made this movie without putting any solid effort into it. Seriously, I love Jack Black, but this movie was a bunch of hooey! I wasn't expecting a brilliant story or significant character development, but my gosh, was this a terrible experience. All the hype for nothing! If you're a fan of Jack Black, like I was, I can guarantee you'll hate this movie (unless you enjoy pointless humor that's incredibly forced and doesn't work). The only way to know how bad it is is to see it for yourself and I dare you.",1,1,3,26 November 2013
Con Air," Don't take it too seriously or you will be very disappointed!
","I'll admit, the story is goofy and the plot is completely unrealistic. That doesn't make it a bad movie, it's actually an entertaining movie if you can look beyond its flaws. I'm not the biggest Nicolas Cage fan, but he plays a likable hero in this movie. John Malcovich's performance steals the show at the times with his sinister and charismatic personality as the villain.The action sequences are over-the-top and the direction is well done. If you're looking for a logical story, you will be disappointed. That's why some don't like it, you can't take a lot of the material seriously. With that being said, it's such a fun experience. It's about a guy (played by Cage) named Cameron Poe accused of manslaughter after defending his pregnant wife. Years later, he's released and is transported through an airplane with the most dangerous criminals who end up hijacking the plane on the day of his daughter's eighth or ninth birthday. Poe hasn't met his daughter yet and is at the mercy of psychopathic and violent convicts. Will he make it to see his daughter or will he make the wrong move with the criminals?I like the way they mix action and humor. Despite a laughable story, the actors all do impressive performances and it's exactly what you expect from a Bruckheimer film. Overall, this is stupid yet great movie and it's loads of fun if you don't take it too seriously.",8,0,0,11 November 2014
The Sixth Sense," A Masterpiece from Shyamalan!
","After hearing so much hype about it, I decided to watch the movie recently and I was satisfied. I know, everyone spoils the ending, but that doesn't make it bad. Yeah, the pacing is slow, but at no point is it boring. This movie worked on so many levels and I enjoyed the chemistry between Bruce Willis & Haley Joel Osment, which was phenomenal! Just putting it out there before you see it, this is a psychological horror movie, so if you're expecting a gory slasher movie, you'll be incredibly disappointed.The film revolves around a troubled young boy named Cole, who sees ghosts and is very intelligent. Bruce Willis plays his psychologist named Dr. Crowe and was faced with similar circumstances when a former patient broke into his home, earlier in the story. After making that fatal mistake, he is determined to not screw up again, by closely listening to Cole and helping him through his problems.Rather than relying on bloody violence and/or constant mutilation, which most horror movies use as their substance, 'The Sixth Sense' keeps you hooked with its unpredictable twists and deliberate suspense that Shymalan puts on the audience. Watch it for what it is and you'll enjoy it!",9,0,0,27 November 2013
Jackie Brown," Huge Disappointment!
","Before you get on my case about the director, I want to let you know that I'm a big Quentin Tarantino fan. I like Reservoir Dogs and I really love Pulp Fiction, so I had hopeful expectations prior to viewing this film. Sadly, I was very disappointed by what I saw.Robert De Niro was a wasted talent who had no purpose to the story, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and Samuel L. Jackson doesn't make a convincing hustler. Does that mean I hate everything about this movie? Not necessarily. I like the direction, the dialog is smooth, and the production value is good, but I wanted more and the movie just didn't deliver. For example, there's a scene where the female lead is getting a bag full of money in a dressing room. It shows you this exact same scene from three different perspectives which was annoying and didn't move the plot forward. Tarantino did this method so well in Pulp Fiction, but that movie worked because of its non-linear structure. Here, its like Tarantino ran out of ideas on the way there and didn't know how to translate his vision.Overall, this movie was a disappointment. It's unoriginal, the characters aren't interesting, and the whole thing is a convoluted mess. Spare yourself of Jackie Brown by seeing better movies of his than this inferior piece of garbage!",2,2,10,27 July 2014
The Godfather," Watch it twice!
","I wasn't too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say it's a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but I'm not denying that it's a good movie.Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it like I did!",8,1,2,24 March 2015
