Spartacus," I like epics, but this wasn't among the best I've seen
","I went to Rome last fall and I'm now amusing myself by watching lots of movies set in Rome, both present-day and ancient-history oriented. I enjoyed 'Ben Hur' and 'Quo Vadis', but 'Spartacus' was kind of difficult to sit through. Maybe it was too much of a Kirk Douglas overdose. Maybe it was Peter Ustinov (who I usually enjoy) hamming it up to the point where he was out-hamming Charles Laughton, a neat trick in itself. Ustinov apparently won an Oscar for his performance; personally I thought his humor was misplaced and overdone in this context, although he was certainly funny.I've read that up to 10,000 people were associated with this film, and I think I saw them all in one scene where the slaves are coming over the hills towards the Romans. For a moment I automatically thought the effect had to be CGI, but then of course I remembered this was 1960 and those were in fact real extras running down the hillside like thousands upon thousands of ants. That shot was absolutely breathtaking; I'm glad I saw the film just to be able to experience the awesomeness of that scene.One of my favorite character actors, Harold J. Stone, had a significant supporting role as one of Spartacus' advisers; it was fun to see him in his prime doing drama.I'm sure I would have gotten less out of the film if I hadn't had the 'I was in Rome' focus to hang it all on. The sight of the crucified slaves, dozens of them, hanging all along both sides of the Appian Way was rather sobering, to say the least, since I couldn't help but recall the moments I spent walking along that same road.I've seen 'Ben Hur' a couple of times and I would certainly consider watching 'Quo Vadis' again, but I think once was enough for 'Spartacus'.",6,1,3,24 March 2015
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," I just can't watch this movie anymore
","Really. I can't. I can't stand Roger's screaming. It's too bad, because I liked the film when it first came out. It's an incredibly creative effort, very entertaining to have all those familiar cartoon characters making cameos, good performances, good story, all that. I remember Toon Town, the little car, the exquisite effects blending the live-action and animation... what's not to like? It was ahead of its time.But a few years ago when I tried to watch it again, to re-live the good memories, I had to turn it off. Roger's constant shrieking was so distracting I began to hate him within the first 20 minutes. Good character voice... but WAY too over-the-top, WAY too loud. As a kid I could take it; as a grown-up I just can't.",6,10,18,28 January 2015
Finding Neverland," Not that great
","After reading some other negative reviews I guess I'm fortunate that I had no real expectations and no preconceived notions or knowledge of the real history of J.M. Barrie. It came up free on streaming so I figured I'd give it a try. About half an hour in I admitted I wasn't invested in it, but I left it on so I could keep listening and went into the other room to peel up some sheet vinyl flooring (yes, really). At Winslet's first cough I said 'Dead by the finale' usually I can't predict what's going to happen, and I had no idea that the real Mrs. Llewellyn had died, but as it turned out I was spot on. I finished my flooring project and returned for the last 10 minutes or so, and I didn't feel I needed to go back to see what I'd missed.To be totally fair, I'm not a big fan of fantasy, so with one exception the scenes of the imagined Neverland were totally wasted on me. That exception was a simple scene where Mr. and Mrs. Barrie said their goodnights and went to their respective separate bedrooms off a common hallway Mrs. Barrie entered her real Victorian-era room, where Mr. Barrie entered a room that emitted bright colorful light around the edges of the door, almost like Dorothy Gale first stepping out into the Land of Oz. This hint that Barrie was living in a fantasy world that was very real to him was a nice touch, I thought, and I found it very clever. I'm glad I wasn't stripping linoleum during that scene; I wouldn't have appreciated it if I couldn't see it.I'm not a Depp fan, although I thought he was terrific in 'Ed Wood'. He's fine here and seems to have a good handle on the accent. Winslet's role could have been played by any number of actresses and she really didn't bring that much to the part. Overall I'd say this was average; I might have rated it higher if I were more of a fantasy fan, or lower if I had more knowledge of Barrie's real life before viewing. Not my cup of tea.",4,0,0,7 June 2015
The Notebook," Sticky, saccharine dreck
","I'm glad I'm not the only one who hated this one. The DVD was loaned to me by someone who watches all types of movies from the silent era to present day and whose opinion I respect. I had heard good things about it from others as well and yet I procrastinated about watching it for three months. It was as if some little voice was saying 'don't do it don't do it' I wish I had kept listening to that little voice. The night before I was to see the DVD's owner again and did not want to lie about having watched it, I put it on. The good news is that I thoroughly cleaned the kitchen that night I couldn't bear to sit there and engage with it after the first few minutes, but I did allow it to run its course while I busied myself with useful pursuits. If I had randomly selected this film on my own, I would not have finished it.Where do I start? Well, for one thing, it's predictable. I am one of those people who can NEVER see what's coming in a plot, and for me to call this whole thing within the first 7 minutes or so is pretty damning. 'Oh, lemme guess, the old couple is the young couple and she's got dementia and he reads her their own story'. Yep. And towards the end, guess what I did? I called it again. 'Oh, lemme guess, they both die together.' Yep, right again.Maybe part of the reason I was so deeply offended is that I have married friends who are going through the dementia nightmare right now, and it's not like this at all. Gena Rowlands without a hair out of place, fully made up? C'mon. Flashing in and out of lucidity like she was on a light switch? Bull. It ain't like that in real life, folks, and to have it portrayed so cutesie-wootsie on screen is a poke in the eye to people who are really dealing with this illness. The only 'real' thing I saw was when Rowlands' character flipped out on James Garner; his reaction was the truest, most honest thing on the screen during the entire two hours.The young actors were both terrible. I've never seen either of them in anything else and I hope I never do. The script was vapid, simplistic, and contrived. It seems hell-bent on trying to FORCE viewers to feel, rather than ALLOWING them to feel. I have a soft spot for good old James Garner and I consider him the one and only light in this entire mess. Oh and I liked all the swans. One star is for Garner and the other is for the swans.",2,4,5,28 December 2013
The Jungle Book," Didn't like it in 1967, don't like it now
","I remember seeing this at the drive-in probably not too long after its release, so I would have been about 7 years old. For some reason I didn't have good memories of it the way I did with other Disney features, so when I recently had an opportunity to see it again I figured it would be interesting to take a second look at it.Honestly, I still don't like it. I can understand how I was bored at age 7 in the back seat of my dad's Studebaker, and I was just as bored in my living room last weekend in my early fifties.So what's the problem with Jungle Book? Well, we can start with the disjointed storyline: Mowgli is sent off to the man-village without so much as a 'so long, son' from his wolf-parents, and viewers never really get an idea what it is that he's leaving or why he should feel bad about not being there anymore. He encounters several jungle creatures, including King Louie who has a long drawn-out musical number and then vanishes from the storyline altogether. Why was he even there, except to eat up ten minutes of screen time? The villain, Shere Khan, doesn't even appear until the film is half-over. And the stand-by villain, a huge snake, just isn't very scary with Winnie The Pooh's voice coming out of his mouth.The musical numbers and some of the characters are also extremely dated: there are beatnik vultures with Liverpool accents, and King Louie himself is also pretty full of late 1960's attitude. And when Mowgli decides to join the man-village just because a pretty girl winks at him well, Mowgli's around 10, right? A little young for that kind of thing, isn't he? Some reviewers have criticized the animation; I didn't have a problem with that myself. I'm familiar with the slightly rougher style and as it's a product of its time, it worked for me. I also don't mind when animals and humans speak English together, or when bears sing and dance (ARE there bears in the jungle, by the way?). The story just wasn't very good. One catchy song and that's it. Disney had much better efforts in that era, and I'd recommend just about any of the others over this one. If you liked it as a child you might still like it today, but this kid needed prodding from her parents just to stay awake for the end.",3,3,16,14 April 2014
Gone with the Wind," I don't see the appeal
","My vote is for the technical achievements. It would be higher if the plot and characters were more appealing to go along with those, but unfortunately they aren't.I guess the Civil War is thought of romantically by some, which I find odd. I'm old enough to remember the miniseries 'North and South' that you absolutely could NOT get away from when it was on TV. Everyone but me seemed to be watching it.I'm not overly offended by the portrayal of slavery in GWTW... it's inaccurate for sure, but it's no worse than that portrayed in 'Song of the South' which has been banned and shunned for decades. Why is GWTW still worshiped? I don't know. Scarlett can threaten to beat Prissy with a strap and that seems to be okay, but God forbid Uncle Remus tell a few morality tales about a cartoon rabbit to a little boy. But I digress.My real problem with GWTW is that all of the characters are either unpleasant or stupid... sometimes both (hello, Prissy). It's hard to sit there for four hours without being invested in what happens to anybody because they're so difficult to care about. Scarlett is cruel and selfish, Rhett is cruel and selfish, Ashley and Melanie are so dimwitted one wonders how many generations the Wilkes cousins have been intermarrying.In short, it's beautifully filmed, but leaves me almost entirely cold.",6,2,11,3 July 2017
Mamma Mia!," Um... no
","I almost turned this off about 20 minutes into the film, and I never turn movies off. The stage musical must have been much better... I don't know; I didn't have the eighty-five bucks for a ticket when it played in Boston. The over-the-top hysterics by both groups of three women... the pancake-flat vocals of Brosnan... the shrieking cackle of Walters... where do I logically begin to figure out exactly why this movie was so terrible? I suppose I should say something nice to prove that I actually was trying very hard to find something I liked in it, so here goes: Christine Baranski was amazingly good at both singing and dancing. I never would have expected it. Maybe she should have played Donna. I love ABBA, I still have my vinyl and a few cassettes, and I'm going to go play them now. I can't recommend this film to ABBA fans, to musical fans, to Streep fans, or to anybody with any taste.",1,4,10,15 January 2009
Amadeus," I remember when it first came out
","When this film was released in 1984 you literally could not escape from it ads were everywhere, all over the TV and print media. My usual impulse is to refuse to see any film that gets crammed down my throat hundreds of times before it even arrives in theaters, so it can be quite some time before I get around to seeing a movie even if the reviews are generally good. My impression from the numerous trailers for 'Amadeus' was that it was a farcical treatment of a real-life classical composer, starring a man with a stupid grin wearing a fright wig, accompanied by a lot of people in 18th century garb dancing in ballrooms.Yep, that's what it was. I finally watched it last night, 30 years after Tom Hulce's ventriloquist-dummy grimace first appeared on my TV screen. It was even the ultra-long director's cut which added about 20 minutes to what would have been a long film in the first place. I finished it, but I'm really not sure why. Obviously they spent a lot of money on it, F. Murray Abraham was good, and naturally the music was good, but I don't think it lived up to the hype and accolades. Maybe my taste is all in my mouth, but I don't regret not beating down the theater door to see it 30 years ago.",4,3,6,22 July 2014
Mission: Impossible," I didn't finish it
","Well, there's no chance of letting any spoilers slip, because I only made it about 30 minutes in before giving up. I can start by saying that I was not a fan of the original series, so I'm not comparing it to anything... I just didn't like it. I found it very loud and confusing, way too intricate and convoluted plot-wise. I didn't care about any of the characters... that's usually the test I give a movie just before I turn it off in the middle: how would I feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? If the answer is that I wouldn't care one bit, I go ahead and turn it off, which is what I did here.The three stars are for the special effects, which looked pretty good but weren't enough to keep me interested for two hours. Not saying it was a bad movie, just saying I didn't like it.",3,0,1,28 September 2012
Life Is Beautiful," Missed the mark
","Actually I'm not sure where the mark was exactly was this a comedy? A drama? Half and half? I wanted to like it, expected to like it, but really, really didn't.To the folks who have been calling this 'Hogan's Heroes' it really isn't that either. 'Hogan's Heroes' knew exactly what it was: a silly, impossible sit-com. It was never presented as or intended to be taken as something theoretically possible, while 'Life is Beautiful' seems to be doing just that. But the reason I didn't like this movie isn't because I found the subject matter offensive. It simply wasn't very good. (Just for the record, I like 'Hogan's Heroes'.) For starters, I caught myself saying out loud (fortunately I was in my own living room), on several occasions, 'Boy, are you annoying' directed at the star, Roberto Begnini. I'm a Rowan Atkinson fan, and I've read some pretty scathing reviews on his performances written by people he doesn't appeal to I think that's exactly how I feel about Begnini. I find him profoundly annoying and not in the least bit funny. The first half of the film was a real chore to sit through. But I can be pretty sure I'll never forget the Italian word for 'princess', since he hollers it every two and a half minutes, so I guess I learned something.As for the second half: completely and utterly unbelievable. No way. The concept was an interesting one, but it would never work: the child would need an IQ in the single digits to believe the 'contest' story spouted by Begnini's character. Are we viewers to believe that all those men in the barracks with them are not too overworked, starved, and terrified to be perfectly happy to play this 'game' along with Guido and his son? And at the end when the sentry takes Guido off to be shot, giving him the opportunity to do his Italian Mr. Bean impression one more time in front of his son why take him anywhere? Why not just shoot him on the spot? Neatness didn't count at that point; the Allies were at the gates, the Germans were fleeing, and there would have been no point in taking Guido to an out-of-the-way alcove to shoot him. In fact, it's likely he would have been ignored as the soldier ran for his own life. But that would have made for a non-Oscar ending, I suppose.Seriously overrated film with a seriously overrated star. Thankfully it was free on streaming.",4,2,5,13 October 2014
Scream," Why am I even watching this?
","That was what I kept asking myself for the entire duration. My motives were weaker than those of the killer I had a couple hours to kill, I didn't feel like thinking, the cat was in my lap, those are my only excuses.I've heard a lot about how great this movie is but I honestly didn't see any indication of it. I was interested in the references to other horror movies, most of which I had seen and many of which I had enjoyed enough to see them multiple times, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested. The one thing in the movie that I thought was sincerely funny was the scene where Henry Winkler (Fonzie, what are YOU doing here??!) as the school principal goes out into the hall muttering some obscenity, and the nearby janitor who's dressed in a green-and-red striped sweater wearing a cruddy brown hat says 'what did you call me?', and Winkler replies 'sorry, Fred'. Now, THAT was FUNNY. One of the two stars I'm giving this movie is for that scene.Eventually the film turns into a total bloodbath and you lose track of who's dead, who's dying, who's still upstairs, who got out of the house it just all happens so fast it's utterly ridiculous and you stop caring about the whole deal. At least I did. Oh and Matthew Lillard is possibly the most annoying young actor working today. I couldn't wait for him to get murdered and it took way too long.Disappointing.",2,0,2,10 October 2014
The Truman Show," First time I managed to tolerate Jim Carrey
","For quite a while I refused to watch this based on who the star was. I was familiar with his 'style' and didn't care for it. I finally gave in to all the assurances that this film wasn't like his other performances, and I really liked it.The reviewers who say it's like an episode of 'The Twilight Zone' aren't far off. But I like the fact that it's not taken too seriously, unlike many TZ episodes... this subject matter, as evidenced by many of the 'hated it' reviews, could easily have been presented and intended to be taken in a deadly-serious way, but it's not, and I like that.There could easily have been a 'show-down' scene at the end between a disappointed, unbalanced, angry Truman and his 'creator', Christoph. I usually don't like open-ended conclusions, but in this case I thought it worked. Truman remains the nice, trusting guy he always was... he sees his newfound freedom as a gift, a long-awaited chance to see what the actual world has to offer, and he takes it, with no visible hard feelings. Why not? That's his character and his nature. A confrontation scene would have been interesting and most likely well-played by both Carrey and Harris, but it wasn't necessary. The payoff for the audience is that Christoph loses everything in the blink of an eye (fame, power, income, and the biggie: complete control), while Truman goes off to begin his REAL life (and presumably track down his lost love somewhere along the way).It's especially interesting to view this today, with the reality-TV wave cresting. The real people on these current shows are called 'cast members', their lives are called 'storylines' which are played out in 'seasons', and sometimes it can be hard to remember that they're actual human beings.'The Truman Show' started, by Christoph's own admission, with an unwanted pregnancy. So did 'Teen Mom'.",8,0,0,14 November 2016
The Martian," Surprisingly dull
","I had heard so much great stuff about this movie I almost went to the theater to see it. Then I figured I'd wait for DVD. Then... hey, it happened to be available on a trans-Atlantic flight I was on last weekend, so I dove in.Wow, was it dull. I couldn't believe a situation like that one had so little tension attached to it. Damon's character seemed so happy-go-lucky about the whole thing I figured he wouldn't mind staying where he was, so why worry about him? I know nothing of the (lack of) science that other viewers are commenting about, but most if not all of them probably know what they're talking about. I don't mind suspending disbelief, but I need to be entertained, and this failed on all counts.Can't spoiler it... didn't finish it.",4,2,5,1 April 2016
The Godfather," I just don't get it
","I finally watched this movie, and I just don't get the hype. I didn't dislike it, and the violence didn't bother me, but I found it over-long and very, very slow. I'm a 50-something who doesn't demand a break-neck pace in a film, even an 'action' film I'm used to watching long movies that take some time to unfold, and I don't mind that. I have patience. But 'The Godfather' just seemed to be moving at the wrong pace for its subject matter. I never got into it. I finished it, but I didn't feel drawn into their world.Not helping was the fact that of course by now everyone, even those who haven't seen the film, knows about all the catch-phrases and classic scenes, so they seem like jokes (although naturally that wouldn't have been a problem when the film was newly-released). Brando almost seemed to be a caricature of himself in the early scenes although he got a little better, a little less heavy-handed, after the Don came home from the hospital. In that first sequence in his office during the wedding, I could hardly understand a word he was saying. How could anyone take a man who spoke that way seriously? But again, I was watching it after many years of encountering deliberately bad Brando imitations, so I was at a disadvantage in that respect.That wedding good lord, it lasted longer than many marriages do! I thought it was never going to be over. But while I was watching it, I recalled that I had in fact tried to watch this movie about 30 years ago, when my brother was really into it. I didn't even make it through the wedding. I remember my brother fast-forwarding the VHS tape to show me Abe Vigoda when he became convinced I wasn't going to sit and watch the whole thing with him one quick look at Abe Vigoda and I was outta there. This time I also noticed one of my favorite character actors, Vito Scotti, in the wedding sequence.The people who did 'General Hospital' in the 1990's must have loved this film. They even lifted the mobster's-chick-gets-blown-up-in-car idea for recycling on the soap opera.I watched the DVD over two nights. The local public library gives me 7, and for a while there I thought I was gonna need 'em all. A good illustration of my feelings for the tension and pacing of the film are that after Sonny bought it at the tollbooth, I turned it off for the night and went to bed, since that was as good a place as any to break. Just didn't care, one way or the other, what was going to happen next. One less character to keep track of. Plenty more where he came from. I was just hoping Vito Scotti would come back.I won't give it a 1 as others have in a deliberate attempt to bring down its average I'll give it an honest rating that I really feel it deserves. The fact that I don't understand why so many people are so crazy about this film doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right and they're wrong in fact, it might well be the opposite. But I stand by the title of this review: I just don't get it.",6,4,10,19 April 2013
