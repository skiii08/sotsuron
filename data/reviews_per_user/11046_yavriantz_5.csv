Blade Runner 2049," The biggest letdown i've experienced in the cinema
","Wow, 8.5 score om IMDb. So where do i start?What we didn't have in this movie:1)Music. 2)Interesting dialogues. The movie was over 2 and a half hours long and not even one dialogue to remember. 3)Interesting story. Also only one lame twist in the whole movie. 4)Interesting action. There was very little of it, and when it did take place, it was very dull and uninspiring, as was the whole movie. 5) Decent acting. What we did have in this movie:1) They manage to create an atmosphere from the start, which made you feel involved and wait for the masterpiece to come (of course, it never did). A wasted effort here. 2) Loud noises instead of music. 3) Long episodes of complete silence, a lot of them! 4) Lame villains 5) Nudity.In the end, it was very hard to fight with my body, which desperately wanted to fall asleep! Very, VERY boring movie, there is no excuse for this kind of abuse of the moviegoers. My friend who i went with to the cinema said he is not sure if he'll be able to recover from this and go to the movies again. Dreadful experience!",1,14,25,22 October 2017
It," Good book adaptation.
","Saw this movie yesterday, overall very satisfied with it. It is loyal enough to the book's spirit, although i missed the escape on the Silver scene or Ben fighting Henry after falling off the bridge scene. Unlike some other reviewers, i dived right into the movie's world and enjoyed every second of IT. 8/10 because IT's not a perfect movie, highly entertaining though.To Wade Huski - the movie is R-rated, so you obviously shouldn't take a little child and show him IT.",8,5,10,17 September 2017
Django Unchained," A great movie, that could be perfect, but there is one major flaw
","OK, it WAS perfect until the moment Dr Schultz shoots Calvin Candie. That moment just doesn't make any sense. This character (the German) was built up to this point as a very smart and strategic. All of a sudden he just shoots DiCaprio's character without any obvious reason. He had some flashbacks about a slave being killed by dogs earlier in the movie (which was an order Calvin gave to his men), but that hardly justifies the shooting. What's worse - after he shoots Calvin instead of killing the guard as well he just stands there waiting to be killed. This was quite an upsetting scene, i even paused a movie for a few minutes before i finished watching it to the end.Still, i won't go crazy and give it 1 point because of one upsetting scene like some people did. Probably this is because unlike the people in the theater i had an ability to pause the movie and calm down. Unlike some others i liked what i saw afterward and it made me forget about that scene by the end of the movie. During the movie there were a lot of great scenes, some of them really epic. The acting was almost perfect, really loved the actors work , the music was great, even the rap wasn't disturbing, but probably the movie would be better without it.Overall i really liked this movie and would recommend it to all the people, that are not afraid of violence of Tarantino's movies.",9,0,2,9 March 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," And the award of the most predictable horror movie goes to...
","This one is starting with a spoiler, so you're warned twice now.OK, so it was obvious from the start, that nobody is getting out (the moment the bird crashed on that force shield). That kind of killed the movie for me, but because i am not feeling well and couldn't sleep, i continued watching. And i'm sorry, that i didn't turn this off. It was very boring and predictable until the very end. Especially boring the first 50 minutes.The 2 points are for a little bit of fun i had, when they let all the creatures out. Apart from that and several other minor scenes, i didn't like this movie. And i saw someone writing about twists and giving this score of 10, are you serious? Every single 'twist' you can see before it happens. No suspense AT ALL. Too bad Sigourney Weaver took part in this movie.To summarize - i couldn't believe this has above 7 score, i hope my vote will help to fix it.",2,5,8,26 September 2013
The Martian," So much better, than Interstellar
","This movie actually was more funny, than many comedies, such as Dirty Grandpa for example. This was nice, as i was a bit worried because of the length of the movie and the fact it was about a single man, trying to survive alone on another planet. What surprised me the most was Matt Damon's performance. A lot of movies with him i get the impression, that he just plays....Matt Damon. This time though we could see some acting skills from him.Overall a great movie! Me and my wife enjoyed it and even it was very late we didn't stop to end watching it some other day. I don't get the IMDb score sometimes. Probably the worst space movie of all time - Interstellar has a higher score than this?",10,2,4,20 August 2016
