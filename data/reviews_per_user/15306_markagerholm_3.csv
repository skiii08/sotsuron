Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a Children's Movie
","I consider The Phantom Menace to be the second worst film in the series. It's not a horrible film by any means, but you must be prepared for one particular letdown: this film doesn't seem to have been made for the aged fans of the original trilogy. Instead, it appeals mostly to small children and die-hard fans of the saga. For that, I give this film praise; it is a very decent children's movie. Granted, it's nothing up against the likes of The Secret of Nimh, The Brave Little Toaster, or even The Incredibles and other recent Pixar films, but most boys who were under the age of ten when The Phantom Menace was released thought Anakin Skywalker was nothing short of awesome.For seasoned veterans like myself, however, the childish humor really falls short. The combination of Jake Lloyd as Anakin and Jar Jar Binks almost completely ruined it for me, and I feel as though I have to block those characters out in my mind to enjoy the film. Anakin's one-liners during the assault on the droid control ship sounded like the Ninja Turtles in the early 90s. Furthermore, between him and Jar Jar, the seemingly epic battles were won completely by accident. No such travesty existed in the original trilogy, and furthermore, it diminishes the heroism of both characters. Essentially, the only true hero of the film is Obi-Wan Kenobe, and for the entirety of the film he is mostly kept in the background as a babysitter for the queen, whose acting in this film resembles that of a crash test dummy.My last gripes about this film are mostly visual problems. The CGI really dominates this movie. I personally found it more charming when costumes ruled Hollywood. It's just that many of the CGI stunts are so ludicrous and overexaggerated, making this more resemblant of a multi-million-dollar cartoon than a Star Wars film.On the good side, there are many positive aspects of this film. The story, for one thing, is great for the saga. Focusing on a number of things, including Palpatine's rise to power, Obi-Wan's last days of training, Anakin's incredible skills as an engineer, and the rebirth of the Sith after a long time of peace. The dialog is even fairly decent, so long as Jar Jar, Anakin, and Queen Amidala have nothing to say.I found Qui-Gon Jinn (sp?) to be the most likable character. In the entire prequel trilogy, in fact, he has more lines of wisdom than even Yoda (whose puppet actually looked worse in this film than it did in The Empire Strikes Back).Darth Maul was a great villain. His mystique was what kept me interested in him--sometimes it really is better to only show the tip of the iceberg. A lot of people complain that he was underdeveloped, but, honestly, I like it much better that way for characters like him. In addition, his lightsaber battle against Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is my favorite lightsaber battle in the entire series.While Episode I definitely did not live up to the hype or the original trilogy, it was a decent addition to the saga. 6/10",6,2,4,14 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Enjoyable, but the worst in the series
","Just like the title, this whole movie seems botched and full of contrivances. I may be one of the few that thought The Phantom Menace was actually a better film than this. Needless to say, it does not live up to the name, Star Wars.Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christensen, plays a pubescent, irritating little sh*t with lines reminiscent of 'teens-gone-bad' movies from the 1950s. In fact, he's pretty much interchangeable with the protagonist from 'I Was a Teenage Werewolf.' His only good scene occurs in the village of the Tusken Raiders--after that, I found myself begging him to don the Darth Vader suit and have James Earl Jones take over his lines. And this is not Christensen's fault. He is actually a great actor (see 'Life as a House'). This is proof that the writing and directing were at most of the fault for botching this potentially classic film.Attack of the Clones is mostly known for its love scenes. The film moves incredibly slowly, and action is quite sparse. The love scenes are so ridiculously cheesy, I found Corey and Depanga (sp?) from 'Boy Meets World' more convincing.As for the battle scenes, I really had troubles. While Jango Fett was a great character to introduce Boba, the fight between him and Obi-Wan was probably the most contrived scene in Hollywood blockbuster history to date. While Obi-Wan is falling to his death, he tosses a string, and, using the force, ties a knot (while he's FALLING, people!!!), and is saved at the last second in an event that should have ripped his arms out of his sockets. You really have to see this to believe it.The Jedi battle in the coliseum is engaging, as is the final battle on Geonosis. Yoda duking it out with Count Dooku was a blast, though Dooku is nothing compared to Darth Maul as a villain.My biggest problem is that the heroes seem so invincible in this film that it's hard to believe many of them are supposed to die in Revenge of the Sith (a far better film, by the way). There is no tension. Only eye candy. It's too bad we have to muck through this awful film to see the whole series. I recommend the cartoon, 'Clone Wars' over this any day.",5,1,2,5 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best since Empire
","Yeah, it's better than Jedi. It's even arguably better than A New Hope. It beats the living daylights out of Phantom Menace and Clones. But of course, certainly not Empire...It's Revenge of the Sith, Lucas's latest (and final) addition to the Star Wars sextant. And it's good...If you saw the first two Star Wars films to come out in the last decade, as well as that awful 1997 remastery of the original (I can't even bring myself to pick up the new DVDs I'm so distraught from those...), then you just might be under the opinion that Episode III is going to be another example of Lucas's senility...Episode I and II were chock full of wooden acting. Well, gee, Episode IV, do you recall Luke whining about going down to the hachi station to pick up power converters? Yeah, that's one of those lines that I try to repress. Then Empire comes along. Leia kisses her twin brother with tongue. Gross. Jedi? Hello, the evil empire was ultimately defeated by...what? Teddy bears? Get out! The truth is, the original trilogy had a charm that the new trilogy lacks, and that charm is visual flaw (especially episode IV). They weren't nearly the big budget mammoths that our new films are, and the fact that the new generation of films are mostly animated seems to aggrevate a whole lot of die hard fans. Of course, back then the Death Star was a ping pong table loaded up with fireworks, which would just be silly to use today. However, in truth, the overall appeal of the characters isn't quite as strong throughout the trilogy this time around as it once was, and this is a claim that one could argue easily in favor of the original trilogy. The difference is, however, less than it seems...Okay, lots to say here...First, it seems somebody paid off some poor girl to go on a single date with Lucas because he seems to have the concept of love somewhat better in this film, albeit barely. He has limited his cornball love story as much as possible, making most of it take place within Anakin as he searches for a way to save Padme from certain childbirth death. However, the dialogue that takes place between the two of them is still trashy jargon. I think Lucas should have scrapped the idea of love and had Anakin just knock up some girl on a one night stand with twins. Sure, the morals would have been a little warped, but it's better than what we had to deal with in Episode II.And Jar Jar doesn't bite the bullet like I had hoped he would. Well, at least he doesn't get a single line in this. Nope, not one. But still, he was the only one I really was excited about getting killed, and he didn't.And that wraps up the flaws of the new film.Christenson's (sp?) acting in the new film is miles ahead of how he was in Episode II. He appears much older and wiser. He has scars. A cool haircut. He's not crying out 'it's not fair, obi-wan holds me back, waaaaaah.' Nope. He's cool this time around. When he first kills Dooku in the beginning of the film, he responds quite rationally. 'I shouldn't have done that. He was an unarmed prisoner.' And from there, Palpatine proceeds to further dilute his morality. His descent into evil is honest. He wants to save the one he loves. The dark side clouds everything. Even awareness of what one does, apparently. But think about it. Anakin really would find Padme worth the deaths of a hundred or so 'younglings' (oh there's another flaw. They won't say he killed children, they need to use the 'youngling' euphemism. laaaaame). Pay attention to his character as the story progresses. It's not the first time he's slaughtered a bunch of children (see also: tusken raiders).The truth is, much of the evil that Anakin commits in this movie is stuff he's been waiting to do all along. He would definitely have done to the viceroy of the Trade Federation what he did after turning evil had he been given the chance in Episode II. Again, I say, refer to the tusken raider sequence in Episode II. Almost every question regarding Anakin's seemingly erratic behavior can be answered there. There's a bit more to it, such as betrayal, but I believe that Anakin liked Padme a whole lot more than Mace Windu, who was the physical embodiment of Anakin's conflict between his power and his youth, and the one person that made him feel insignificant.As a fan of McGregor since Trainspotting, I believe this might be his most brilliant acting job yet. It seems as though most of the great lines in this movie were reserved for him and Palpatine. Obi-Wan is convincing and truly emotionally brilliant. His reaction to his pupil's change is so utterly real it's amazing that it actually happened in a Star Wars film.And it's fantastic to watch where the evil emperor really came from, where the master/student bond between him and Vader really began. Watching those two work together was perhaps the greatest joy of seeing this film.This movie ends on a down note that makes Empire look like Sesame Street. And it leaves you wanting more. And this time, you don't have to wait three years. You just have to watch the crappy remastered episode IV instead of the charming original. Too bad, but hey, at least Lucas went out with a hell of a bang. Not a flawless movie, but surprisingly, next to Empire, the second least flawed of all time, meaning the second best of the series. That's right, I said it. 10/10.",10,2,7,12 June 2005
