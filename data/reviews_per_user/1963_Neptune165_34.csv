First Man," Events are accelerating
","Imagine being so incredibly stupid that watching this makes you mad, because you genuinely believe the whole thing was faked. The movie is constantly shaking like a person with a nervous condition has filmed the movie without access to a tripod. Not okay! The events in this film are very quick. its like they are on rush",4,1,3,26 April 2019
Come and See," total nonsense
","Do anyone feels the audio in this film kinda sucks? It's not trash but sometimes the laughing dialogue in this movie feels very unnatural and kinda triggers me a little bit. the film wasn't horrifying at all. because it is fake Also stop saying it was such a great film because it wasn't as it literally jumped from scene to scene with no explanation what happened in the middle and half I don't get what people are talking about. Yeah I see the deep meaning, but I have to try hard to actually feel something. I watched this movie and it wasn't scary or hard to watch. A bit of it was disturbing but other than that it's boring & this is a soviet propaganda against Germans.",2,3,14,5 February 2020
Come and See," Shooting a cow for realism? Thats a step too far
","That's disgusting and cruel : shooting a cow with a machine gun. Because the human mind clearly separates the death of a movie and a real one, & this probably wanted to emphasize the horror of those non-real deaths. This Movie is nothing more than a Masterpiece of Propaganda! This Movie truly shows how feelings can completely blind you from seeing the truth. And the truth is that the German Wehrmacht did NOT consist of Psychopaths who just wanted to Murder anyone that isn't German! I just can't understand how an Army that was largely drafted and forced to fight could be portrait as a Psychopathic Murder Unit. I just don't know what to say about this Movie except for that, if you want to learn about ww2 then don't watch Russian Propaganda like this! The film make the Germans look like monsters while 4 million Russians served in the German army against the monster Stalin. Great propaganda film but far from reality ..read the wild east and get a totally different perspective of what happened in that theater of operations .Stalin imprisoned many of the so called partisans because he did not trust them and most of the partisan hunters were local villages protecting there crops . the movie was made before the fall of Communism.",2,2,14,4 February 2020
Come and See," This movie was boring and this is the only interesting scene. It's not worth it
","It doesn't tell me anything about the plot or the characters involved, about where it takes place or even the nationality of the people it's about (which is pretty damn important if you're talking about WW2 considering the international scope of the conflict). There's literally nothing to get invested in as an outsider to this movie except a bunch of pretty cinematography. The whole film is based on a wrong communicated historiography.",2,2,21,6 February 2020
Hereditary," This is one of the best horror movies out there
",This movie make me cover my eyes. No movie was able to do that to me. it was a jumpscare movie not a slow suspenseful. at the Dinner Scene when she screaming at Peter is such a good portrayal of a dysfunctional family. my favorite scene of her is when she found out charlie is dead. her cry and scream are so painful and real brilliant movie and the best horror of 2018,7,1,4,5 May 2019
Captain Marvel," I feel like they just made the movie to put her in endgame
","It will be forgettable in the end. My biggest flaw with this movie is how Fury lost his eye...Not the best MCU film, I would of love to see her past more fleshed out. The movie didn't have anything that pulls your emotions ..no love connection, no tragedy etc. Tbh I didn't even know they used CGI to make them look young. I really didn't feel an emotional attachment to Carol or her story. It was just a bland movie where a lot of stuff could be cut out. Captain marvels character is very forced and her in endgame I don't like her She was portrayed to be the ' over power' but she was hardly in the movie. And when she was it like meh (except when she saved Tony) She has no chemistry with any of the cast in the films. It was so so with plot holes that don't add up. One of the biggest ones? Fury coming to know that their are powerful entities in the universe during Captain Marvel. It's one of those movies where if I don't watch it again in a few years, The daughter also just seems to accept it as if she just got back from a vacation, not as if someone they thought was dead came back. I really hated how it was handled. Captain marvel should have been played by a different actor in my opinion this movie was not a good fit for her. A movie is supposed to make the audience connect with the main character and, for me, this movie does not do that, I had absolutely no clue what was going on in this movie. The plot was so confusing. Captain Marvel did a good job on being a boring and very annoying character in the MCU! Why was she able to absorb the core power? Is she Kree or is she human? if she's Kree why did she have red blood? Why did she have to be injected with blue blood? The last fight was not epic at all.",4,1,3,2 September 2019
Us," A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending
","It's been a while since i've been this satisfied with a movie. I have watched a bad ton of movies in my life time and this is by-far the greatest. 'DON'T BLINK, YOU'LL MISS THE BEST PART'. Twisty, and mind-bending, one viewing won't be enough. Not gonna lie the plot twist in the end was surprising. This movie will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever. The acting was great, the plot was amazing, and it kept everyone on the edge of their seats",5,1,5,25 May 2019
The Irishman," it's actually more a documentary
","The Irishman tries hard to be a 'classic' like 'casino' or 'Goodfellas' with some scenes that try to be similar, but somehow struggle to have the same impact. I was wanting to love this film and my expectations were severely let down. Puting aside the slow pace, the great cast of my favorite actors (especially in this type of film) just felt flat where it should have been cool. I don't know what went wrong,..script, story, acting, old age! But this film just does not compare to the previous excellent 'classics'. The film was simply boring after tow hours you will be interested in this movie!! And the scene where DeNiro beats up the store owner has been the worst scene I've ever witnessed, he looked like an old, really pretending to kick the owner, and when the owner smashes the glass on the front door he doesn't even hit it hard, they obviously only did one take and he was meant to go flying through rather than just slapping the glass with his hand. The character are way too old to be playing these parts DeNiro looks like a 75 year old trying to play the part of a 45 year old but looks like a 55 year old guy that really is 75. I hate to say it but it's pretty bad all I'm going to say is that they tried hard but these guys are way too old now the aging looked weird especially on Deniro and their movement and body language was off this was a role they should have done like 30 years ago in my opinion Pacino was really the only bright spot of the film but everything else was just boring and uninteresting I just didn't care about nothing in this film or the characters at all it was just very boring honestly",4,1,4,17 January 2020
Aquaman," is this a joke
","I can't believe what my eyes saw the worst effects in all DC super hero movies Lasers Explosions are they serious, the costumes not that good. this movie don't deserve any credit. That Octopus playing the drums was very ugly",1,2,4,5 May 2019
"I, Tonya"," Woah I never noticed how many small details they included
","I was actually really impressed with Margot in this movie. I don't care that she doesn't look like Tonya (and I thought I would)--as I was watching, I forgot it was Margot. I thought her acting was great. This movie blew me away for many reasons. What's amazing is that Margot Robbie had to learn how to ice skate for this movie. Tonya could've had it all had she had good people around her growing up had she listened to the very few good people around her that wanted to guide her. This film was so well done. So well shot and well crafted",7,1,2,17 July 2019
Molly's Game," success story
","Crafted drama with sharp dialogues, entertaining too. it was amazing the 2 hrs and 20 min just fly, Jessica Chastain she isn't acting she literally turned into the character, a really good film",8,5,9,4 November 2018
BlacKkKlansman," absolutely amazing
",I just saw this movie can't speak highly enough I loved it such a powerful movie it leaves an impact on you it was a masterpiece. It was powerful & heavy,7,2,4,20 November 2018
The Doors," The movie ain't really accurate
","Felt that this movie gets such a bad rap. They made him to dumb in this movie. He was very intelligent. This movie kind of portrayed Jim as a drunk It didn't really show the aspects of his life or upbringing a little on how he wanted to become a poet, and how The Doors broke through with their music. what a terrible film. just a hopeless caricature. a lesson in bad acting, bad singing, and bad writing i don't hate the film but this movie according to the original band members that actually played with Jim, well its hard to follow a movie where a lot of what they are saying in this film is false but this film is 2 hours of Morrison behaving like a spoiled brat and talking stupidities nonstop Irritating because it portrayed Morrison completely wrong, like a he was a psycho when in reality he was a nice person. Val Kilmer was flopping around way too much. Worst was the part with sunglasses and the beard.. Jim was a lot calmer and introverted. I'm guessing Val just got really into the character and exaggerated him a bit more. Jim did have hyper moments and jumped around but he didn't do it constantly. He was also a lot less seductive in the way he moved. For me Kilmer far from sucked. I believe much of the reason actors seem to be over acting or too hyper when portraying a real life person is due to how it may come across on screen in the finished product maybe coming across as too flat. What was even worse was that after he was done filming the movie, it took him two years to get out of his role. The worst part is exaggerating the 'girl we couldn't get much higher' so cringe. The movie was meh. Morrison was charismatic ally magical. The actors were shadows of the real people. But they tried.",5,1,3,29 July 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," The attention to detail was amazing
","I adore this movie. But I have to give most credits to Rami Malek. This is honestly one of the greatest performances I've ever seen, if not the greatest. Like some other people have said; I didn't see Rami Malek, I saw Freddie Mercury. And I completely agree. What an astonishing movie, good job to the directors and producers and everyone involved for being able to represent a feeling, a person , a life so magnificently. The amount of detail is so amazing in this movie. Whenever you see them play their instruments, they play the actual chords and music. Also with the clothes, the way of acting. Amazing. The Live Aid concert was a complete copy of the original. I was very much amazed by it. So well done. I was hooked with that Brian May style 20th Century Fox fanfare, I had the biggest smile on my face. And the last twenty minutes made me feel like I was at Live Aid, it was incredible",8,2,2,28 June 2019
The Thing," The real masterpiece of 1982
",Greatest Horror movie This movie brought out paranoia and fear in us all Still my all time favorite horror and one of the best sci-fi films ever,9,1,3,24 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," This is legit my fave movie of 2018.
","This film is better than Incredibles 2 and more deserving of winning Best Animated Feature. Incredibles 2 lacks the depth of the first film and play a bit too safe. While Into the Spider-Verse looks and feels unique and different from other animated films from this decade. This movie is 11/10, hands down THE best comic book movie I've seen since The Dark Knight.. This is worth buying.",10,1,2,13 September 2019
Apocalypse Now," VERY boring and highly overrated
","I personally hate this movie all characters are stupid and gives a numb feeling not an exiting movie highly overrated and boring to watch. Apocalypse Now a lame and boring movie. The special effects are laughable. Being barraged by pop rockets are supposed to be scary??? Fake little pyrotechnics everywhere. Laughable. The dawn airborne beach attack and other earlier scenes are still okay, but the attempt at creating gravitas and horror as the boat moves up the river ... trying way too hard and failing miserably. Coppola seems to think that strewing any given scene with pointless corpses in illogical contexts is all that's needed to create a feeling of horrifying madness. The opposite is true, as the overdone backdrops make the whole movie seem childish and forced.",4,0,12,3 September 2019
Dunkirk," the day seemed to last forever
","The horror of war. Everything in this movie is perfect. It's a mesmerizing and horrific masterpiece. The movie purposefully is not about characters. They barely talk, a lot of them don't have names and they all share equal screen time. Even the biggest star in the cast doesn't get any special treatment from the camera. This is a fresh new approach to war movies and portraits the fact that war is about everyone and about every single event, small or big. a lot of people miss the point and try to judge the movie like a traditional war movie. This movie is all about feeling and perception. one thing worth mentioning are the sounds of the movie....not (only) the sounds tracks, but the sound effects....the shooting - its all so loud and authentic. make sure you watch this movie at a system that has good sound, because the noise of the gun-shots and Aeroplane engines are incredible the bombs. this movie grabs you by the neck, drags you into the war with these soldiers and does not let you go until it ends. 2 hours felt like 40 minutes, the cinematography looked spectacular and the sound was fantastic, and not just the music. Bombs, bullets, screams, airplanes, it all sounded so raw and realistic and you're constantly on edge. Not one dull moment in the entire movie. Yes, there's not really a character arc or development for these characters. All these people were equally represented in this event and this is how they reacted to it. And this movie shows beautifully that most of these men don't want to go to war, they don't want to die or kill, but they have to. One of the best movies of the year.",7,2,5,16 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I present to you The highest grossing movie of all time
","Endgame has surpassed Avatar for the highest grossing film of all time. Not only this is the best movie in the MCU, this is probably the greatest movie of all time. How fascinating that Tony stark died after their mission was completed, the first 2 hours were great, the last hour was legendary. The story just didn't flow with me.Last hour is epic! Loved the ending credits sequence with each of the actors and their signatures. Definitely a wonderful film. I couldn't find much wrong with it outside of nitpicking. This is definitely a once in a generation experience but Natasha really hurts... that one still messes with me. After Iron Man's death 'Whatever it takes' hits you a lot harder. I loved what they did with most characters. My only complaint being Steve and Natasha, but everything else I was satisfied with. I just wanna also say that if people are going to be disappointed with Tony creating time travel and Bruce helping out big time, then they're gonna have so many complaints with Mr. Fantastic if they end up adding him and the others into the MCU now that they have the rights. I absolutely loved the movie. Loved how well they gave me closure over the entire journey they've brought us on. One of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite movie going experiences so far. I really admire them sacrificing Black Widow over Hawkeye. Hawkeye has a family, which would have made his sacrifice sad, but in a very cliche way. Nat had NOBODY aside from the other Avengers. Someone who nobody besides the main heroes would mourn sacrificing themselves to save half of the universe is so much more powerful than it would have been with virtually ANY other Avengers character",10,43,68,9 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The most boring movie I have ever seen
","Boring film honestly. The performances are great with very memorable lines, the cinematography is awesome, the music choices are perfection and it rewards multiple viewings but I literally took a shower during the 2nd act, sat back down, continued to watch and didn't feel like I missed anything. I honestly felt very indifferent to the movie and it left nothing to take with me after it finished. it felt like NOTHING!! The movie has almost no direction or narrative, it feels like it's stuck for it's entirety, I'm not saying that every shot has to mean something but almost every scene felt like it was doing nothing to move the story or it's characters forward, putting that aside, why include Manson and Sharon in this movie? Like if you're gonna have them do something with them because it has no other purpose other than to have the murders occur and changing real history because that's what Tarantino does it breaks my heart to say and feel this.. bc I'm a Tarantino fan. I have no idea what Tarantino was trying to say. This is one of those movies I'll never watch again.. A waste of an amazing cast .. Dragged for no reason .. the Bruce lee scene was so unnecessary..so sad he did that. I went into this movie knowing nothing, and I was constantly asking myself 'what is the plot?' You have DiCaprio and Pitt in the same movie and make this movie no action no plot and just empty. Don't waste your money",4,6,10,14 January 2020
Aladdin," This movie looks like a Bollywood movie...
","Jafar Wasn't even scary to look at. The movie didn't take me Aladdin singing was so blend and Jafar was awful. Jafar was definitely the worst. he was supposed to be having a conversation instead he monologues. that's just cringe worthy.I blame the director on that. he can instruct the actor to not monologue but didn't clearly this was the directors move felt rushed (Jasmine and Aladdin met too quick, The desert tunnel didn't appear out of the desert, The singing during the action parts were hard to watch as well. It didn't do justice to the animation sorry to say. The visuals and costumes were good though. I felt the character development was forced and I couldn't emotionally connect with any of the characters. The only thing i disliked was jasmines new song, it was cringey for me. I feel she could've just been more action and less singing about it also she annoying. I couldn't really feel the chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine",6,2,4,19 September 2019
Hellboy," Hellboy movies are awesome,
","The 2000s Hellboy movies are still some of my favorite movies of all time, witty, action packed, originals are still good as well as many other movies before they decided to think they need to do remakes. I really liked it. Ron Perlman as Hellboy all the way! The first hellboy will always be the best. The 2004 version is an good movie and is very faithful to some of the material Mignola created. Hellboy 2 is just hot garbage, it literally takes almost everything Mignola created and threw it away, the story is not for me since it is not some actual myth that is in some folklore, it is just pure fantasy which ruins the thing for me I love the creepy, mythological, and lore friendly creatures/stories Mignola created.",7,1,1,17 September 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Dudes kissing Dudes romantically ....I'm out!
","I go by the sleeping scale. I was able to stay awake during the movie. There was a fly in the ending scene, even though it was winter. The worst 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. The characters felt so fake and it was so boring I just couldn't wait for it to end. He's 17 and the other is an adult! did nothing for me. None of the characters was likable in the slightest, so I couldn't sympathies with them, I felt no chemistry between them. Both of them were pretentious jerks. What was fairly obvious was Elio's frustration, but blue balls does not equal love. And what completely blew my mind was how chill the dad was with a stranger coming into his home, living there, sharing his bread, and touching his child under his roof. it's just. Ugh. The movie was deeply boring. So... Another bad movie which we have to grade as a masterpiece because of we don't we are intolerante haters homophobics ignorants.. Yeah. This is crap... And please let's all ignore the pedophile aspect of it because well.. We don't want to be haters. Indeed, it is unbelievable in every sense that this film got all the attention it did! This movie has absolutely nothing to offer... The story is flat and the love between the two unmatched characters is very unappealing, This film is shallow, empty of substance, miscast with mismatched and one dimensional characters. It is poorly directed with one detached, meaningless scene after another with pretentious but terrible dialogue don't kill two hours of precious life on something totally forgettable...",4,7,30,19 July 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," the most boring movie of all time
",Worst sci-fi ever made At the beginning there is the black screen for three minutes with the music the secondary astronaut character so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! the movie him self is too slow the astronaut flying for five minute the most of the movie are silence fell asleep right away within the first 15 minutes. finally try to avoid this movie as much as possible,1,8,16,27 December 2018
Midsommar," Most stupid movie i have seen all year hands down
","I just watched this movie today and i didn't understand anything, especially the beginning it make you feel super bad watching this!! This was perhaps one of the weirdest film I have ever seen. I was expecting horror, but instead I got people tripping on drugs, weird mysteries and some kind of cult. When the movie was over I was left with a really weird feeling - I could not define the genre, I felt drugged. I was a bit disappointed with the movie, and that's a shame. I was expecting more after the very, very good Hereditary, Worst horror movie ever it was so slow , dragged on and it was so boring. I didn't like Midsommar and the main reason is because I felt lost during the whole film. The community or 'the cult' just acts to weird, I struggled to understand their behavior in almost every action. I think this movie overrated ,,, i like hereditary,, but Midsommar just to slow and predictable. some scene just wasted time. To be totally honest I thought it was a bad movie. To me they tried to make another Hereditary but failed miserably. Their friends are disappearing one by one. And it didn't phase any of them. Out in the middle of nowhere, eating and drinking whatever was put in front of them. And how did they keep those white clothes so clean? Obviously no running water I damn sure didn't a lake or a river. Weird movie. Old grandma gets behind dude and starts pushing on his back. Assisting him with.. never mind.",1,33,59,30 September 2019
Joker," Why Is Everybody So Rude, Why Is Everyone So Mean To Each Others?
","When Villains make more sense than Heroes. After watching this, i feel sad for Arthur. they always look down on him, make fun of him but they didn't know the true story behind that funny face of him. he's a victim too by a twisted society. i feel bad for his tragic life. Joker wasn't the villain,the society is, Joker was the victim The 'mother' was the villain you could say. Yeah, she had a mental disorder but it was still her responsibility to control it. Joaquin Phoenix made a new era in the world of cinema. his acting was so real that you could actually feel his pain throughout his laugh. Whoever disliked this movie doesn't live in a society. Major difference between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker: Heath Ledger's Joker: he creates chaos, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker: Chaos created him. Honestly this is one the best movies DC created.. how this movie end was straight masterpiece.. so real how Joker was born and Batman origin picks up.. How Bruce Wayne actually got killed.. the set up.. the riot at the end.. man i can watch this movie 2- 3 times straight.. Joker is my favorite Villain of any comic book.. Batman is best ..",9,2,5,4 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Let's get real.. It sucked COMPLETELY
","This film was quite predictable, Too long and the ending of killing pennywise was so anti climatic. Not trying to be funny but that grandma is scarier than it. My main complaint is that they relied too much on visuals instead of building a real sense of foreboding and suspense. There was nothing scary about those CGI monsters that kept popping up... The scene where Jessica Chastain sits down with the old woman was really creepy. Until that CGI cluster burst through the kitchen. I literally started laughing i was just rolling my eyes!! Every monster just made me ask my self are they serious?!! The CGI was atrocious, It chapter 1 was 10 times better. it wasn't as scary as the first movie due to the perspective shift, I love long movies you can settle into but The movie was BORING",4,0,1,13 January 2020
Parasite," What a masterpiece
","The movie starts with warm fuzzy feeling and a bit of laughter here and there. Leaves you with such a disturbing thoughts in the end. The movie shift comedy into dark horror just like that.. One of the most powerful thing that a film maker can do, leaves you feeling off/disturbed. The Best movie I've seen so far 2019/2020 no doubt. The ending also is very brilliant. While the rich were able to run away from the house where lots of sadness and drama happened and start from scratch somewhere more peaceful and stable, the poor had no other choice than to come back to their semi basement. They are stuck living in a place that reminds them everyday of the horrific adventure they had. No second chance for them and no starting from the scratch. The Koreans really know how to make movies. Never fail to amaze. One of the best films I've ever seen. The flood scene was breathtaking. Had no idea what to expect. Completely blown away.",10,0,0,2 May 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," was highly overrated
","An awful story and boring. I wanted to like Birdman way more than I actually did. I loved the originality, but it had this slightly over-the-top, theatery vibe to it that I really wasn't into. That and the way the camera hardly ever got more than five feet from the actors made it a little exhausting to watch. Birdman. It was very well acted and had some amazing scenes but I couldn't get into it at all minus the scene where Keaton roasts the critic. Not saying the movie is bad by any means technically, just it caters to a particular audience. But I just wasn't excited about this movie at all. I saw the ending coming miles away. At the end of the movie, I just felt tired. Maybe it is because of the camera work. In all sincerity I couldn't relate to any of the characters, they felt alien to me, going on and on on their traumas made me rise my eyebrow and watch the clock. to me all the 'bad' stuff happening was something I already knew. Nothing new to see. I got bored as hell. Maybe it's a niche under niche movie",4,1,2,20 August 2019
Scream," A literal masterpiece
","I love this movie forever my favorite horror movie Not just my favorite horror film, but my favorite film of all time One of the best horror films ever written. 'Scream' was one of the first horror movie that was psychologically connected to the teen audience. Wes Craven was smart enough to not create a monster who came from the inferno or outer space, but from the house near yours. The reason why the killer acts is not only because is bad, but also because is lost generationally. So many people was addicted to the 'Scream' series",7,0,3,11 December 2018
Mother!," Hated this movie
","Oh boy, this movie was terrible Saw.0/10 its even too much I just want to know why the movie is called 'mother!'? this movie just got nominated for several Razzies? Jennifer Lawrence for Worst Actress? exactly ,,, This is the most stupid movie of all times . I'm so sorry for the time I lost on this Just feel dirty after watching this depressing awful show...save 2 hours of your life. This was the most disgusting and disturbing movie I have ever seen and I consider that director needs some psychiatric help I thought itÂ´s going to be some good horror about a haunted house but it was not even scary in a real goosebumps meaning. It was just abominable I was so disgusted and shaken, I wanted to throw up I don't believe any sane human can create it. I regret the time I spent on this movie, it was like poison for normality. I don't understand how such a sickening madness can be praised, just because it pretends to be art. I am going to watch classical regency romance for a whole month, just to retrieve my good taste",1,1,3,8 August 2019
Midway," Horrible movie...it was like a B-grade movie
","Too much noise and too much special effects. Is that for hiding a lack of talent ? This movie was consistently horrible. Bad writing, bad casting, bad directing and ridiculous effects. It's like they did no research on ww2 or America in the 1940's. They spent so much money on the actors, that they couldn't use halfway decent CGI. Not only that, but the writing for this movie was absolutely terrible. It's literally like watching a train wreck. You want to see it because of the cast, but once you do, you immediately realize the absolutely horrible script and graphics. The actors had a total different lighting then all the objects around them.
It's like watching action game clips stuck together but with real actors in them!! This movie is horrible. It gets nothing right about anything.",4,2,2,2 June 2020
Incredibles 2," Movie was pretty forgettable tbh
","This movie was too long plus bad timing i fell asleep I just didn't care anymore unlike the first i loved it and cared so well too predictable. They took everything that was awesome about the first incredibles & dumbed it down. I legit knew the entire plot a half hour in the movie. Was so obvious the villain was going to be who it was. Sure the animation was good but that can only take the movie so far. To me this seemed like a dumbed down kids movie where as the first one was an epic adventure for all ages. It was boring and dash was really annoying it feels like they played more cliches in this movie. Had its moments with elastergirl having the spotlight she was just boring and could of made a more Interesting. whatever happened to the underminer? did he escape? he was such a big deal in the first movie. The new heroes like voyd? She is so annoying they're horrible looking they're not fun or funny to watch is just a bunch of big dumb dumbs and ugly designs wow. does anyone even remember their names? they were used pretty badly. now... the villain... Oh! the lamest villain of them all oh my!!! there was no master mind behind anything she didn't plan the plan of the century like they tried to make us believe. Heroes are illegal, she makes them legal so that she can make them illegal again ... wh... what? she gave up her plan by allowing heroes into her space in the first place she really isn't the smartest. It was terrible the movie didn't focus on any character",4,3,6,20 October 2019
Incredibles 2," it was too long and sucked
","Fun, but stupid writing. i was so disappointed, i watched the first movie just to compare and it definitely isn't better than the first one. I felt like I was always waiting for the main story to begin but it seemed like it never did and felt cliche. This movie was really bad in my opinion. love the characters, love the animation, the plot sucks & doesn't make much sense considering the first film. if u watch the first than the second you will be like 'wait what? why r they complaining about supers being illegal??' the first film already fleshed out that idea, yet this movie pretends as if it didn't. In about the first hour i lost interest i just didn't care anymore the first one was classic and waited to long to make a 2nd. Not gonna lie i felt they went a little to hard on the feminist stuff. AND I SUPPORT LEAD FEMALE ROLES. In the first one bob leaves and does what he has to do but in the movie the women comes and saves him. See? The first movie was perfect. However in this one bob suffers with the kids. Kinda like oh idk the implication that a man can't do it like a woman can. Kinda sucks but I hope the 3rd one can fix and kinda 'battle of the sexes' bs however cool that bob kept It together. just let me enjoy an animated movie about superheroes without throwing that feminist stuff in my face every 2 seconds. If I watch superheroes I want to see them having adventures, that's the point. if I wanted to see 'family problems' 'parents taking care of the kids' and all that.",4,2,4,18 October 2019
