Blade Runner 2049," Too many references to the first film
","Could have been a much better film if it had left out 90% of the references to the old Blade Runner. Background music, sound clips, whole copies of scenes and characters... it seems the film is just falling over itself in an attempt to 'relive the good old days' of the first film. It's really too bad because the story and effects could stand on their own without these cringworthy flashbacks.The film didn't need Harrison Ford, he too seemed like an unnecessary character wedged in where the legend of him would have been much more potent. I hope there is a better cut in the future at some point as this was a let down.",7,0,1,3 July 2018
