Despicable Me 2," very funny film great family entertainment
","Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film, The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell)is likable and funny. The minions however are the main stars, they had me laughing on multiple occasions during the film. The language created for the minions is very well done as they speak in a fictional language but you can always gather what they are saying.I found the visuals very impressive, it was very colourful and very imaginative. The action scenes we also very well done.I will say tho you have to love the minions there like the squirrel in ice age it just wouldn't be the same with out them, special with the thing they do, they really do have you rolling around on the floor laughing your head off.In this film their just more funnier than they were in the first film which was good as well, but this is a great family afternoon film that will leave you happy after watching as it a feel good film. I recommend it for those who love animation, especially if you enjoyed the first 'Despicable Me' film",9,0,0,18 October 2013
The Finest Hours," Incredible film , Chris pine & Holliday Grainger outstanding performance
","Likes : This film is incredible storytelling of courage & bravery at it best to face nature most destructive force at sea to rescue 32 men stuck on a stricken oil tanker that has only hours before she sink like the rest of the ship did.The fact this is based on a true story as well made it even better which i didn't even realise until the end of the film , the film is based on history of Bernard C. Webber (played by Chris pine) (May 9, 1928 – January 24, 2009) was a United States Coast Guardsman. He was a petty officer assigned to Station Chatham, Massachusetts and part of his duties were that of coxswain of Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500. Webber and his crew of three rescued the crew of the stricken tanker SS Pendleton, which had broken in half during a horrific storm on February 18, 1952 off Cape Cod. Webber manoeuvred the 36-foot lifeboat under the Pendleton's stern with expert skill as the tanker's crew, trapped in the stern section, abandoned the wreck of their ship on a Jacobs ladder into the Coast Guard motor lifeboat.It was kind of weird the way Chris pine played this role but knowing this was based on a true story i assume that how Barnard was , which if i can assume must of has slight autism just but the way he was taking & acting its a brilliant performance from Chris pine. Holliday Grainger playing the love interest & future wife of Bernard's Miriam Webber who he married in April 16th 1952 stayed married for 58 years until Bernard death in 2009 at the age 81. Her performance in this film was just outstanding in showing a worried engaged woman worried for her future husband to make it back safe in the most dangerous environment on earth. It without a doubt one of the most intense , heart breaking roller-coast film that like perfect storm , of men trying to survive the most dangerous sea's while trying to keep half a boat afloat until they are rescued. It because a film of will they survive which make this film hearting breaking , intense & very satisfying to watch with good special effect & visual effect to add the scene believable at sea during a storm. Special with almost a full cast of stars your probably recognise like Chris pine, Casey Affleck , Abraham Benrubi ( who actually looks like WWE Kain ) , Keiynan Lonsdale , Josh Stewart ,Graham McTavish , Holliday Grainger , Kyle Gallner , Eric Bana & Ben Foster bring you a spectacular film.If you love perfect storm this is a film i highly recommend , its easily a film to dismiss if you not sure about it but trust me this film is brilliant & worth checking out.Dislikes : There isn't really must to say about anything in the film being unbelievable because stranger things have happened in life, but for half a boat to that smashed in two the front half of the ship sunk taking with it its captain & other crew mange's to stay a float for 5 hours at least before sinking.Now if you were to nick pick at that yes you would see that as just dramatising the film a bit, but accord to the report this actually happened which is nothing short of a miracle if that was true. But apart from that there isn't anything else to say was not believable.",10,3,9,7 April 2016
It," One of the best Adaptation of IT
","WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE, COME WITH ME AND YOUR FLOAT TOO! Wow when i first heard they we're doing a remake of Tim Curry original penny wise IT i was a little sceptical about it working, this was because of recent reboot and makes from other films haven't been that great. With this Reboot of the TV mini series IT that starred Tim curry as the terrifying clown i'm glad to say that this is very 'book accurate' which the TV series wasn't; this will please IT fans across the world. What i will say is that this version of Pennywise's character play by the young brother of (Alex Skarsgård star of Tarzan ), Bill Skarsgård who's playing a very dark version which is brilliant has this heavy influence from nightmare on elm st films with a psychological nightmare feel that makes it very dark and creepy.This works well with the brilliant acting for the child stars who some have a story of their own to which gives them a reason to come together, this is great because it follow what the original had where together they are strong which work for the story.Another thing i did notice is that it doesn't quite follow what the original IT done which is brilliant for this film as it adds something different that doesn't seem like you're seeing the same film again, although it does have some element like the town bully which seem to be the original part from the film as the character have a different feel. With penny wise himself it's all down to attention to detail that make this version more dark that Tim Curry which i was impressed with as Bill Skarsgård bring a more sinister feel to the character, it this head slightly down and eye looking up just under the eye brows look with a sinister smile and grin that make this version better that Tim Curry version in my opinion.Yes i just said better as this version actually give this film this psychological creepy play with your mind theme that gives you shivers down your spine and give it an edge, special with the Japanese film cinematography with lighting and shadows it really give this film this great feel of Immersion that draws you in.As great as this film is there is one element that for me lets the film down just slightly but i think this is because I've seen the original film i know the story, but for someone that has never seen the original TV mini film i think this will be frightening for them.What also give this film a very hard core creepy psychological feel is It's lair, there was just something about this area of the film that gave this very dark child nightmare feel which just added to penny wise nature, this was a great addition to the film that the original didn't really step upon which give this film something new. So if you a fan of the original IT i highly recommend this film as it a great film adaptation that is close to the book. Dislikes : My only complaint for me in my opinion is the film isn't as Frightening as i hope it would be, but does have a psychological creepiness to it with does give it some frightening elements. I feel this film should've of had an 18 cert to go full on dark, maybe this could've of been truly frightening as i do feel the 15 cert held the film darkness back a little.",9,9,21,8 September 2017
Gravity," Extremely Intense, Frighening & Brilliant Film
","This film is a one of a kind, I don't think I've left a film emotionally drain, I think I left my jaw on the ground when I left, this film is seriously intense, emotional & frightening from the get go, what's makes this brilliant is it start off with this beautiful visual Cinematography of the earth with stunning effects everything is claim then it hit you in the face with a roller-coaster of intense frightening nail biting moment & emotions.George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky bring an outstanding performance with some emotional scene that will shock the hell out of you this is exactly what you'd come to expect from the Oscar-winning producer and actor like George. He utilizes his wit and charm to be a lighter force of our dark tale, and is a perfect balance to Bullock's frantic demeanor.Sandra Bullocks character you start to feel sorry for as you learn about her past but what her character is put through in this film is beyond shocking & a feet of courage against all odds to survive in space, I believe that this acting in this film she should get a Oscar for best supporting actress or best actress award for this film alone because her performance was outstanding really dose bring you to tears.The intensely of the film alone seriously pulls you to the edge of your seat you find your self in shock as you witness the action on screen that bring a cold chill down your spine & really dose bring you to cry your eyes out because the intense emotional dark concept that this film brings. It also has that tragedy feel to the film which also adds to the emotional side, which is why this film is one of the best film I've seen in a long time that you will not be disappointed with, I highly recommend you go watch this in 3D at the cinema because its one of the most spectacular film ever this year",10,3,6,10 November 2013
Lone Survivor," Brutal ,100% acute on the event & heart breaking
","An undeniable aspect of war, whether or not you make rationalizations on its regrettable purpose or demonize its existence entirely, is that it's an utter hell that tries the mentality and physicality of the courageous men and women who fight in the conflict. Most war film try to capture what its really like in war,but none have never real come close than this one has one review i saw from a former navy seal said this film is spot on to what it really like, i wouldn't disagree with him. This film serious take you on a roller coaster of emotion through it Astonishing camera work, heart-breaking moments as you see them come under fire & pressure to stay alive, it one of the war film that has a very Powerful and Gripping story knowing that this really happened this way in the film is frightening. My heart go out for the brave men & woman of the army force's for the jobs they do. Mark Wahlberg play the the soldier to survive that day on 2005 he plays this role perfect, as well has Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana ,Alexander Ludwig play there role with honor with brilliant performance to those who had fallen that day. Ali Suliman played what i call an honorable man that helped Marcus Luttrell , his name is Mohammad Gulab who is still helping fight today against the Taliban this is what i call a good man i wish him & his family well for this. One thing i want to do now is honor those brave men that gave their lives by putting there names on this review because what they did made them all heroes Red wings men we honor you.: Jeffrey Taylor 30 petty officer first class.(R.I.P) James Suh 28 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Jacques Fontan 36 chief petty officer (R.I.P) Jeffery Lucas 33 petty officer first class (R.I.P) Daniel Healy 36 senior chief petty officer (R.I.P) Michael Russell 31 sergeant first class (R.I.P) Michael Mcgreevy jr 30 lieutenant (R.I.P) Chris Sherkenbach 40 chief warrant officer 4 (R.I.P) James ponder 3rd 36 master sergeant (R.I.P) Kip Jacoby 21 sergeant (R.I.P) Marcus Muralles 33 sergeant first class (R.I.P) Shamus Goare 29 staff sergeant (R.I.P) Corey Goodnature 35 chief warrent officer 3 (R.I.P) Shane Patton 22 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Danny Dietz 25 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Erik Kristensen 33 Lieutenant Commander (R.I.P) Matthew Axelson 29 petty officer second class (R.I.P) Michael murphy 29 lieutenant (R.I.P) Marcus Luttrell petty officer first class (survivor) This is as close as your going to get to a war film that The director did his research because everything was 100% accurate in this film according to what I've read, so if your into war type film's or true story's this is one you should watch, because its brutal,breath taking & heartbreaking that so many lives were lost in one mission my heart goes out the family's of these brave men.",10,4,14,3 January 2014
This Is the End," This is one of those film it's Iver your sense of humour or not..
","This film was funny only one maybe two scene, There's hardly any funny moments because the humour was very slow & dull & over the top crud jokes. The only thing really good in this film was the special effect special with the demon's that was cool C.G.I. I personally think this film is i'ver your sense of humour which you will like this film but if you don't have this type of sense of humour you're going to find this film very dull & dry in humour, as its very slow there just isn't enough funny humour to really make you laugh. I personally think where this film has gone wrong is they tried to mix religion, horror & comedy in one film it just didn't work i'm afraid to say. The only good thing was the special effects of the apocalypse & the power ballad at the end of the film which surprising gave the ending a really cool ending to what was a dull film. Just to say how dull this film really was over 7 people left the viewing of this film in the cinema, they just got up 50 Min's into the film & walked out.",5,3,9,29 June 2013
World War Z," The most realistic Zombie outbreak film you'll see
","People say it would be cool to see a zombie outbreak happen because they think it would be cool to see, I say watch this film & your change your mind straight away. This film off the bat throws you into an intensely frightening scene of mass panic & horror, World war z is about as real as your going to get a zombie outbreak & is extremely intense and frightening throughout the film. This film really draws you into the story of struggle against an over whelming & fast growing army of zombies around the world. This film is outstanding & is the best zombie film ever, if any one tell you it sucked they lying or trolling the film because this film was cleverly made & showed a realness to a breakout which made it even more frightening because this could happen.A warning if you are faith out heart I would be warned as this film does have a lot of intense moment's that make your heart bounce faster because it not just a zombie film, its a zombie that in your face frightening. It just the beginning story there will be a sequel as there are more than one book to this story. I recommend watching this film if you love zombie films because this doesn't disappoint",10,11,26,23 June 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," incoherent mess that doesn't understand what Ragnarok mean's
","Likes : I'm sorry if you're looking for the bandwagon ten star review here you're better off look at a marvel fanboy review, because here you're getting an honest and straight to the point review on this film.Now i'm not gonna complete trash this film as there we're moment in this film that we're funny but sadly not many moment, the action scene including the the fight between 'Thor' and the 'Hulk' we're good in areas but had one major flaw with this scene which i will explain in dislikes.The main character that stood out more was Cate Blanchett playing Hela (the goddess of death), my god did she play this with perfection as she carves her way through Asgard solider with easy she is a force to be reckon with. Cate clearly was perfect casting for this role with a very sexy look in a dark way and very charismatic villain in having one purpose to destroy and control.Tessa Thompson didn't do a bad job with her role as a 'Valkyrie' which we go a slight back story of why she no longer with Asgard, she does add a little bit humor to the film, with Karl Urban character not sure where the writer of this film were going with this character but seem a bit of a waste as he wasn't really doing much though the film. Benedict Cumberbatch playing Dr strange in the film as a cameo like iron man but shorter scene was a little funny in places but a little over the top, Jeff Goldblum playing the grand master one of the ageless Elders of the Universe and has mastered most civilizations' games of skill and chance, did OK with this role you could see he had fun with this role.Mark Ruffalo Hulk is a little different in this film as the look and manor of the character has changes but still the same hulk, there a few jokes though around about the other avengers, Chris Hemsworth put in a OK performance and did offer some funny moments though the film as well as the bad ass look with the lighting around him which gave the character a better flare.Although this film is entertaining in areas and some of the visual effect we're good, sadly this film was full of flaws that makes it a mess.Dislikes : The visual effect in this film throughout most scene felt like an amateur had done it on a cheap PC, even from the scene which is in the trailer when Hela smashed the hammer was bad. This scene of where they are before this event happens look seriously bad, specially when they are looking out at the sea you could see that this scene is in front of them is a Green screen. This just made the scene so fake it almost take's you out of the moment they are trying to portray and clearly from the trailer the alleyway scene was so much better, it's looked like they swap the ally-way scene for a cheap look visual effect cliff-side which they should of kept with the ally-way it would have looked better.The concept alone was a complete mess even for a marvel film, i know a lot of fans will say he just a Dc fanboy marvel hater but i'm not saying this for the sake of trashing this film it really is that bad from a critic stand point.The film doesn't know what it trying to be iver a comedy or serious it just come off so bad it pull the film even some of the joke and humor fall flat which is bad for comedy, some of them feel completely forced at time to make it funny. Sadly the only funny part in the whole film was Thor with a bowling ball, that one scene was the only time i hear the audience laugh because that was funny.It like the Director or writers have forgotten what Ragnarok actually mean's and they've try to make a comedic film with a serious tone (sorry but this just doesn't work in a film), specially a film with Cate Blanchett character who's very tone is very dark, this should've been a lot more serious, darker and the humor less maybe this would've work for the story alone. Instead we get this incoherent mess with music that doesn't even fit the film what so ever with bad jokes and over use of the word like a child would do using the word Ass several times, sorry but Thor 3 Ragnarok is by far the 2nd worst movie marvel has done even though it was entertaining. P.S There two end credit scenes but the very end credit scene wasn't even worth staying behind to see after the credit rolled, it was a waste of time even adding it as it was nothing to do with Infinity war.",6,14,42,24 October 2017
Ready Player One," Epic Masterpiece of pop-culture and a reflection of how the movie and game industry is.
","Wow Steven Spielberg once again shows that he hasn't lost his touch in making an epic masterpiece and visual effect movie that has so much nostalgia, spanning three decades of pop-culture that anyone that loves gaming and films will recognise.I read that Steven Spielberg and his wife read the book, which prompted him to make this film and what Ive heard is the book itself is very fast paced and basically tell you everything, but it one of those cases that the film is actually better than the book. 
Rather than having the same old story where character give everything away by explaining everything or having to explain everything to the audience, were given a 2 hours an 20mins epic ride of visual effects and nostalgia from gaming, anime and movie character that has spanned across from the 80's to today's industry that the audience will sit in ore of just how awesome this film truly is.You might be thinking ya it just a film about nostalgia with a weak plot, but you would be wrong their, what Steven Spielberg has done with this story is add something between the line of the film's story itself. It's one of the biggest middle fingers to the companies that have become corrupt not just in the gaming industry but the movie industry as well.You may be thinking how is this possible? well, it's a sutal hint with the main villain of the film played by (Star wars: rogue one villain Ben Mendelsohn who plays Sorrento who in the virtual world look like an old school evil superman character. 
What I mean is his character is a perfect representation of companies like Konami, Activision and EA, which if you're a gamer like me you understand what I mean by that, the film as a whole is a perfect representation of the state of the gaming and movie industry has become today in our world with microtransaction and corporate greed.I love how Spielberg has secretly put this in the film very clever as it works for the story as well and doesn't compromise it any way, special the acting with Tye Sheridan playing the main role of the film with an outstanding performance along with co-star Olivia Cooke as well as the rest of cast as well this film is just outstanding.From what I saw there are at least 100 or more characters spanning across so many games like battle toads, halo, Comand and conquer so many more as well as movie characters like Chucky which was hilarious to the iron giant to anime and Comic book characters from DC. Seriously this film is like a porn film for nerds and geeks alike with all this nostalgia and the epic battle scene which won't disappoint this truly is a film not to be missed.The Music choices as well just add the films perfect direction and the sutal message's this by far is one of the best films of 2018 and a must to watch. This will most definitely be the most paused film on home video with look for certain characters.",10,1,5,29 March 2018
The Book Thief," one of the most beautiful written & beautifully filmed film I've ever seen
","I'am not normally one for the drama film because they tend to be very slow but this seriously captured my heart, its one of the most beautiful written & beautifully filmed film I've ever seen. I can't tell how many time i was in tears through this film, as it really fill's your heart on a emotional level like never before. The whole film is shown from a little girl perspective surviving during the the height of the second world war in German, but what is brilliant is that it is also told from death perspective a well as this little girl captures his heart & see the human race in a different light through her eye's, its brilliantly written. Strong performances from Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and newcomer Sophie Nélisse who plays the little girl Liesel with a stunning performance who has a bright future ahead in the film industry.The film clothing & speaking were all perfect for the era of the film its set in, as was the perfect scenery that was breathtaking and captivating, and I felt transported back to 1941 German.The emotional impact & Captivating and extremely powerful scene make this one of the best film your see in a long time, i know i normal say this about some action film but this is just an outstanding journey in the heart of human life seeing through death eye's as the literary vehicle of death as the narrator really is a masterstroke and works perfectly giving a sense that death is always with us you cant live forever. I know from the trailer your thinking this is going to be a slow boring film but if you think that you seriously are missing out on one of the most emotional, powerful, beautifully written film's of 2014 that i recommend seeing at the cinema or owning on DVD.The ending of this film really blow me away with just how beautiful & emotionally fitting it was as you hear death narrating Liesel life to the very end in present day such a perfect way to end a film on a sad happy note really brings you to tears.",9,8,14,2 March 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best sequel I've seen, fast action & good story-line
","Wow, probably the best sequel I've seen in a film, although the plot was a little weak as to carry on the hydra story-line which was OK not the best idea but the action is off the chart's which redeem's that side of the story it well balanced.The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time. There is one faultier in this film tho that could of been in this film, Anthony Mackie as the falcon done a fantastic job in his role he looked amazing,Scarlett Johansson as black widow done brilliantly as well, but i felt like this film could of done with iron man or hawk eye to help captain America as well in this film as they were shield agents as well they were no where to be seen. I think marvel failed on that point despite this film be fantastic because i think they could of been called in to help as well, Good thing about the story-line as well is it revels what really happened to buck before he became the winter soldier i thought that was well put & clear to understand, also a good move was to bring back Hayley Atwell character Peggy carter i think that was a nice touch to the film slightly emotional as well. I never would of thought that you would get Samuel L. Jackson & Robert Redford in the same film together two brilliant actors that played there roles brilliant in this film,I don't know if it just me but the fight scene were mental & brutal just the way he throw he's shield with such force it make you cringe to think what that must be like to get hit with that force. This is a film well worth the money & film i recommend watch on the big screen which as always with marvel film's there is a scene mid credit that ties in with the Avengers 2 film which revels surprising character's if you have already know who they are & a scene at the end of the credit roll.This is a must see.",10,8,15,26 March 2014
Doctor Strange," Good but no where near perfect
","Dr Strange (Comic book / fantasy/ action) Well final got around to actually watching this & read most of the reviews which let be honest here. People are saying no flaws in this film mmmmmmm.Yes the film is actually good in place i did notice the one thing that holds this film up is it casting , because i think if this film didn't get the casting it has this film would have failed big time.Don't get me wrong when i say that, the acting is brilliant , yes the visual effect are good although copied from different films like captain America, inception, dark knight, dark city which most of visual effect clearly are copied from let not hide that fact.Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome fit for this role as Dr strange, as he come cross as a sarcastic arrogant ass's on screen , with the controversial political reason for changing the character of the Tibetan ancient one Tilda Swinton actually did a brilliant almost perfect performance.Chiwetel Ejiofor character I'm not sure where the director is taking this character as Ejiofor play a character that in the lore of Dr strange is a super villain yet in the film he a good guy so not sure what was going on with this character.Yes there is one or two funny scene involving Dr strange fighting with Lucian (scott Adkins) & Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) it was something out of slap stick comedy which was funny.Sadly this film is not without is flaws & plot holes as several scene didn't make sense , Director Scott Derrickson has copied way too much from other film's too make it a unique & original film which its actually not as a few Dr strange film have been done in the 80's.The camera work is really poor when it comes to fights scene the camera is too close to the action, the fights just come off on screen like a blur you can hardly see the fight.Im not saying the film is a disaster not by a long shot , acting, a few visual effect that were original & casting is what holds this film up apart from everything else just hold this film back from being perfect.The other thing really that hold this film back is weak villains.(Mads Mikkelsen is a great actor but i cant help but feel they written his character a little weak, as for the dimensional villain come on it was almost as bad as parallax in green lantern film. (just being honest.) Marvel fan will like this film anyway because nothing marvel does is wrong in their eye, but to an unbaisest point of view you may or may not like this.",7,9,19,25 October 2016
Pacific Rim," Fantastic Film
","I've just watch Pacific Rim i'm going to give you a short review on what i thought no spoiler I promise :) . Right fact one is if you can see past the power ranger, transformer, Godzilla & independence day feel of the film, its surprisingly a fantastic film. It has emotion moments with some pretty intense moments which balance the film out, a lot of thought & passion has gone into this film as it shows a lot about Honor & respect in combat situation. The C.G.I design on the creature's & the robot's were amazing & it has some of the best monster fight scenes that you will think wow!!!! that was awesome, but there is a slight twist in the story which I cant say because it will give away spoiler.What I can say is I don't think this film will be for all, as I said if you can't get past the simple film mix you won't like this film or find it fantastic or entertaining. To me I loved this film for what it is, a very passionate, emotion action fight for survival film that really gives this film its edge. Film rating for me 8 out of 10.",8,3,10,12 July 2013
Man of Steel," One of the Best Superhero Film Ever
","Man of steel is Outstanding in every way, one of the best Superman film's ever since Christopher reeves superman. Henry Cavil so bring a performance that's outstanding for the character, giving him a more emotional & character traits that was spot on which really show through out the film,clearly the best actor we've had to play superman as he fits the role perfect. Michael Shannon is just amazing as general Zod he brought this cold ruthless side to the character,as he would stop at nothing to save his people which bring destruction in he's wake.I love the fact they didn't go with the original music as they use the music from Hans Zimmer which really set the mood of the film brilliantly. Along with the amazing Visual effect, special effect, fight scene & the brilliantly done flash back's to Clark's story grow up this film is not to be missed.I give this film a film rating of 10 out of 10 for outstanding performance's by all actors & actress's.",10,0,3,14 June 2013
Ender's Game," Despite the flaws this film is entertaining
","To start off with the story is good but this film as a few flaws special at the beginning of the film as most part's of this film have flaws as well but despite these flaws it's still entertaining.Acting isn't Oscar winning but still good, Harrison ford played his part pretty well but the drill Sergeant just seem out of place, I don't think the actor they got to play that role fitted it to be honest, it kind of compromises the film storyline in away to a point it wasn't convince enough of a believable character.The sub plot & twist in the story is OK, but this film lack emotional content & action. It more of an illustrated storyline than an all out Sc-fi action adventure film but because of the flaws in this film for me it fall below what IMDb rates this film.sorry but this film from the trailer looked like it had potential but it falls short of being a perfect Sc-fi because of the flaws.It should of been a lot more action than the way this film was filmed, hardly any action & to much story just doesn't make for a interesting story its what lets this film down really. With the film being slightly slow as well there just wasn't enough to keep me interested in saying this was a fantastic film.",5,4,27,25 October 2013
Now You See Me," One of the best Thrillers i've seen in a while
","Now you see me is a brilliantly made thriller that take you into the limelight of vega's life of magic but this is no ordinary story of magic. Four magicians are chosen at random to do a task there unaware of but must complete it to the end. Woody Harrelson really play a funny part of this film he got this cocky but funny sense of humour which make the film quite funny in places, Isla Fisher is looking beautiful as ever performance was brilliant,Jesse Eisenberg plays the uptight J. Daniel Atlas pretty well, Mark Ruffalo was also brilliant in this film as well play his role perfectly. Dave Franco played a good part as well in this film, I've got to say one of the best twists in the storyline ever you never see coming, some film like this you can see what's going to happen but with this film its a clever twist of deception that keep you thinking as to what's going on. I recommend you go see this film if you like thrillers because this was a well made film.",10,7,17,19 June 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Pretty much an average film from marvel a lot of mistake in the filming & casting
","Likes : People are entitle to opinion which is fair enough , I'm sure i will get a lot fan boy with stupid comments about what I'm about to say here, to be honest i don't care what they have to say because its my job to be objective point out the good & bad about this film, oh boy there is a lot of bad with some good.There are certain part i liked other i didn't , some areas of the film felt awkward like certain things were force , but The film story-line is bad its just felt winter soldier had a better feel than this film. The fight scene are brilliant choreograph the acting is pretty sold , we get to see any ant man with a new power which was unexpected but kind of cool , but can't help feel they copied that from DC atom. The film story follows the aftermath of age of ultron perfect along with some new development that force the government to act on group with the registration act as certain events cause a lot of death , but the story also seem to be a redemption for Bucky which was a good story continuity. Action scene were good but some scene which i will put in the dislike were that great on screen , Were introduced with two new characters x-bones & black panther. Although x-bone's feel more of a cameo which i though he was one of the big villains in the marvel universe which felt a little off. Black panther i will say was pretty awesome in the suit , the picture didn't really do the suit justice, but seeing it on the screen was better.Chadwick Boseman was perfect casting choice for black panther , carried himself amazing on screen for a protector of his country with a brilliant performance. I'm glad they gave Elizabeth Olsen character with a better in depth look at her role showing a more human side to her with an awareness of her own powers we saw more depth to her character with some quick witty humour.Comparing this film with the last one i can say that winter soldier had the better story all round , although civil has more of the emotional drama in it which is good , the tension between tony & captain is pretty clear in this film even more that the tony past come's up in the film adding even more problems between them. There are some problems with this film but its not a bad film to watch , its some i can recommend to watch but don't except anything special from the film. Dislikes : There is several problem's with this film one is starting with the camera work for the film , I've said this a few time in the past shaking camera in action scene is god awful when your trying to watch a fight scene the camera is all over the place. Directors seem to think this add for dramatic effect but its not help the film in any way because your hardly seeing the action because the camera isn't focus on the people fight, its make you sea sick which I'm glad i watched this in 2D, because the shake camera really hurt the eyes when your trying to watch a fight sequences. This happens through most of the fights its hard to see what is going, this is why this shake camera effect need to stop because it ruin the flow of the film.Second problem is character development although Chadwick Boseman performance was brilliant with black panther there was nothing in a origin story what so ever , it felt like they had just thrown his character in just to introduce him with any back story other that a few words of how he became the black panther. This is bad script writing leave the character in an odd position of Iver feeling out of place or just thrown in for extra characters to fill the gaps with out thinking about it, sadly to say its a let down for such a great performance.The third I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of flack for is spider-man , what the hell were they thinking don't get me wrong the spider-man suit look great, he had the right body size for spider man , as much as Tom Holland is a good actor this was not the right role for him.The scene with spider-man felt out of place even the acting wasn't right for spider-man, this is bad casting because Tom Holland is a good act but he doesn't have the right cocky attitude that peter Parker has as spider man , the only person that has ever come close was Andrew Garfield. Im not being funny spider-man in this film felt so awkward & out of place special with the banter just wasn't the right tone this is a failure for casting. Fourth thing i noticed is the banter & campy joke even they felt awkward at times , don't get me wrong there are a few time its funny but some of the joke seriously fall flat on face unfunny awkward joke at the wrong moments this is not the standard marvel film usual has.",7,4,14,29 April 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Outstanding film, Best dragon design ever on smuag
","If I could say one thing about this film, it would be outstanding, the storyline was told brilliantly although there is a slight change in the story from the book in a curtain scene, but the dragon scene is just outstanding special effects. When I first saw the dragon on the trailer I did think at first oh this is going to look really cheesy but after seeing this film my jaw nearly hit the floor when the dragon reveals itself just the look alone is outstanding, Seriously it was like looking it to the face of pure evil, it can tell it was not cheaply done iver it just match the evil & arrogant nature. Benedict Cumberbatch I can say what an outstanding performance for the voice of the dragon Smuag, he seriously bought out what Smuag would sound like in middle earth & seriously gave me chill's just watch this dragon on screen, im a big fan of dragon's the design & look was just perfect for the last dragon it show a demonic & evil look, special the way benedict voice give's the character of its own evil concept is just amazing, Benedict is the voice of the necromancer which the special effect were amazing as well.Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel was nothing short of brilliant, her character as a humble humanity side to her but she is not woman to mess with as she seriously kick ass in this film, she not a character that in the book but its a welcome character to the film that really dose fit in.A female Wood-elf from Mirkwood, Tauriel is the captain of Thranduil's guards. Her name means 'daughter of the forest'. When Tauriel was still small her Silvan parents were killed by Orcs; she was raised in Thranduil's halls and thinks of Legolas as an older brother. Tauriel is approximately 600 years old she fights like legolas which is awesome in this film.Orlando Bloom as legolas, I this film show a different side of him before the fellowship of the ring , he seem to have this cold hearted demeanour about him which is a characteric's of his father King Thranduil played by Lee Pace who doesn't seem to care about the world outside he own kingdom, but legolas has a fondness to Tauriel I think its because there is something about her that changes he ways or the way she see thing's for the better, it noticeable in this film.Martin Freeman return as Bilbo you come to see his character as become a lot more braver & courage in this film, I like the way you get to see him use the ring, which show's a lot more going on than we think, but you notice that the ring is changing him like it did with Frodo in lord of the rings. What make this character shine is the confrontation with Smuag ,wow what a performance really showing a believable scene when he was speaking with Smuag you could hear the fear in his voice, to be honest if you were being starred down by a dragon that looks like that , hell you would be scared as well. You will notice that this is a very darker & menacing side of the story of hobbit which really work's in show a dark evil has arisen & is drawing power again to burn the world down. A lot of people probably wont like the way it ended but I think it a perfect ending leave it on a cliff hanger, because it leaves you wanting to see that last film there & back again where I bet we will get to see a much darker story than this one.I found this film better for character development as really brought out all the characters personality better, you kind of notice with Thorin Oakenshield play by Richard Armitage he attitude started to change as they got closer to the mountain it was like he was going the same way as he father. what I also like was the necromancer peter Jackson actually gave it a character & body in a spirit form of a dark misty cloud with extremely dark power which was good as it give a dark edge to the film other than the dragon. This is a film u shouldn't miss at the cinema, this is one lord of rings film that is outstanding in every way possible, just down to the way the acting & special effect, the design & look of the dragon this film deserver's an Oscar, I only watched this film is 2D but I bet the dragon scene is amazing in 3D.This is a film I recommend to all lord of the ring's fans.",10,1,8,13 December 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Perfect balance of dark and light tone in it concept.
","'In time you will know what its like to lose, to feel so desperate that you're right but to fail all the same, dread it, run from it destiny still arrives' WOW marvel it's taken you 18 film's to get a real balance in your films, Infinity war is truly worth the hype.For years ive been a DC fan more because of the tone of those movies I found were better for the villains with that dark tone in the films, yes they struggle to get their film right but it the overall tone and ground storeys that draw me toward DC more than marvel film.Don't get me wrong I don't hate Marvel films, I just didn't feel they had this ground story that really draws the audience in, they only really appealed to certain fans. I'm pleased to say that Avengers infinity war is the first Marvel film that hasn't used the typical cheesy over baring childish humour that make the film a comedy and not an action film.From the get-go, this film seriously dives in from where we were left in Thor Ragnorok with a seriously dark tone scene that arnt normally seen in a Marvel film, This really does help with the tone of Thanos and the way he's portrayed in this film with the black order, who throughout the film you can understand why he choose them as generals without even having to know about the comic books.This is great for those people that have never read a comic book because you get a feeling from this guys but the way they are on the screen which gives the audience a sense of dread to the dark tone of the film. Thanos himself from the previous film's when we have seen him is nothing compared to how we see him here, whats great about this which most comic book readers will possibly hate its the characters driven motives.Compared to the way he is in the comic book which is different in the film, I feel this new version is better, this is because it gives the story a solid foothold and ground story of why he's doing what he does, which is what made kill monger from black panther a good villain.Having a motive for a character to be the way he or she is, is great for the story progression, Especial for the way Thanos is portrayed here, this gives the hero's a motive to band together to stop Thanos at all cost. There is a real threat feeling in this film which is helped by the dark tone, it's refreshing to see a director using this for once, this is because using a light tone just to make the film lighter sadly you don't get this feeling.Ya, there are a few humour moments which I can honestly say are better timed than any other Marvel film, plus they were natural funny moments even I laugh. For the first time, a marvel film actually made me cry with Vision and Scalet witch, these scenes alone has so much passion and heartfelt tone you can but help has tears in your eyes, this is because love is the most powerful thing ever to lose it is the most heartbreak thing ever.The other few things you will notice is thor would be a perfect fit for the guardian of the galaxy, he would fit in so way with those guys its unreal, you notice from these scenes that they work well together which if there is any future for Thor being in the MCU, we should by all mean have thor join the guardian of the galaxy as I personally think he would be a great choice.The visual effects and back storeys are brilliantly done, as well as some returning characters from previous films and a surprising character return which most people have been wondering about for ages was a welcome addition to the film in kind of a creepy way.Be warned this film very natural unlike winter soldier does have a very blick outlook and tone due to the nature and concept of the film, this truly is one of the most darkness marvel films you see it works for the character of Thanos. But as ive sad there are a few humorous moments that break this up a bit, but the ending may disappoint you as it one of those film endings that has a WTF moment and unexpected which leaves you with a feeling of despair.Although you may feel this when leaving the cinema or after watching on DVD/ Blu-ray if you don't watch it at the theatre, Don't despair too much as there is Avengers infinity war part 2 coming in 2019. All cast involved in this film pulled off the best performance of their career.
Dislikes: I kind of didn't find the ending a little disappointing, especially leaving you with a deeper feeling that what the hell out they gonna do now, which thankfully there is a part 2 because they cant leave it like that.But the real flaw that I wanted to bring up was a certain C.G.I moment with Bruce Banner if you have seen the film is pretty much in your face, there was a bad green screen effect with CGI that just looks bad on screen it might have been something the editing team missed.",9,1,4,27 April 2018
Frozen," Outstanding emotion heart-warming adventure
","This is the very reason why i love Disney animated film this is an outstanding emotion heartwarming animated tale of courage,love & laughter. It is an incredibly touching story with fantastic music, score, script and incredible singing & performances by Idina Menzel (star of glee) and Kristen Bell we haven't heard in a long time.A lot of people criticize Frozen which is so wrong because you cant go wrong with animated film, because there so much fun for all the family.Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before.The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some.The score and music is perfect for this film fit it pretty well special the theme music by the beautiful Demi Lovato 'let it go ' which is also performed by the beautiful Idina Menzel in the film who voiced Elsa with amazing sing voice along with The sing voice of Kristen bell who voiced Anna its beautiful song's really set the magic of this film to new height's .If you looking for amazing animated adventure then look no further as this is another one from Disney with outstanding performances & character that truly captures the heart of the young mind.",9,1,3,10 January 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Beautful & Inspiring film
","Im not a big fan of Ben Stiller film's normal there a bit to goofy & over the top but what Ben stiller is best at is the mellow drama movie's special like this one, it was so moving & beautiful made it really dose make you think about life, for a remake this film is brilliantly & beautiful done. Through the movie its a little slow which was perfect for this type of film, it adds perfect to a chain of events where Walter take a leap of faith from his boaring life & set of a journey of discovery & adventure to track down an old school legendary photographer played brilliantly by Sean Penn.This movie isn't about narrative or script having to be perfect its about stretching the imagination & this film dose it perfectly, its kind of a film for the day dreamer's that dream of a better life if your one of those people you can relate to Walter's character which make this film perfect to watch.If you are hoping to see Ben Stiller doing one of his usual humorous roles, you will be disappointed. If you want to see him capturing the emotions of a man that has a hard time expressing himself, you will love this movie, although there are a few scene you will laugh you head off at because it has that comical moments. Its one of those movies that really capture the heart of imagination & the true beauty of the world while giving the message that life is about courage & discovery, if you want something or you want to do something don't let life hold you back just take that leap of faith & discover the world for what it is a beauty world with amazing sight's.. The soundtrack. While I was definitely distracted by the visuals and Ben Stiller's spot-on performance, the soundtrack deserves a nod as well. Every song fit perfectly with the tone of the film. There are a few scenes that stand out as particularly wonderful, special the mountain range scene & the stake board scene just brilliant captures what life is all about. Kristen Wiig dose a brilliant job plays the love interest of Walter which perfectly capture the romance side of the film & the very reason for Walter to take this journey to fit in her life, perfect performance from Kristen wig.The entire family can enjoy a spirited albeit superficial comedy without scatological or romantic excess. And the lesson about living the dream comes gently and believably. An enjoyable comedy this is. These very words are inspiring & capture the heart of imagination with every word: 'To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to....' Life Magazine. This is a film for the dreamer's in life, this is the film for those with a romantic heart & see the world for the beauty it holds, this is one film to experience in the cinema, its very inspiring.",10,1,5,30 December 2013
The Lion King," Visual stunning, Great voice overs.
","Since 1994 Dinsey has started taking on their animation film's and adapting them to live-action movies which started in 1994 with The Jungle Book. This started a role of films after with this lion king being the 13th film they've adapted to live-action.But the question is does the lion king live up to the animated film? to which im gonna say easy and no there is a certain area of the film that I thought kind of let the film down a bit but I will explain that in dislike, but let talk about the good things about this film.Visual this film is incredible with the Perfect CGI with all the spiece of animals across the plains that plays out a play by play of the original animated film, the cinematography of actually bring these moments to a lve action is breathtaking.The creator of the film have done an amazing job with the way the animal talk, it's like looking at a Real animal in real life talking in a natural way like they havent done stupid animation for the mouths, they keep the natural animal look and just given slight movement of the mouth when the animals talk, I think this is great and actually works for the film.From the trailer, I was a little concerned concerning Scar, not with the way he looks because I mean the way he looks was Perfect, its more the voicing. Scar had this Charismatic charm about him which Jeremy Iron voice was perfect for in the original animated movie when I saw the trailer Chiwetel Ejiofor was voice scar at first it showed a little off, but watching the film as a whole Chiwetel actually did a great job with the voice over which I was pleasantly surprised with as he does give this slight evil tone to the character.The return of one of the best actors ever in acting and voice-overs James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa character just wouldn't be the same without him, He has this Commanding powerful voice of a philosopher that I could listen to all day.Donald Glover voice over for Simba was brilliantly done, alone with Nala voiced by Beyoncé who has great chemistry with each other in the for the character as well a great singing voice. Few funny moments with Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) who scene was just like the animated film with a few tweaks here and there.I can't express this as much as I can this film Monumental Technical Achievement achieves with digitally Enivorment that David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is a jaw-droppingly photorealistic landscape and animal that looks so real you would believe that it's just a film.It's a film I can recommend watching.Dislikes: The Critical issue I have with this film is the Musical moments, they feel a little bit flat in the film where the animated film actually had better musical moments, I feel here the music could've been better done in this film.",8,1,4,19 July 2019
Grudge Match," Great film
","I don't know if i should take this film seriously or laugh because this certainly is one film that has the both the serious tone & makes you laugh with the quick one-liner p**s taking banter which really dose make you laugh.This film is like watching rocky vs raging bull which is good for boxing film fan as this film is pretty realistic it hold no punches in the ring. Even tho Stallone & Robert de niro are looking there age now they have proved no matter how old you are they ca still go a few round in the boxing ring.What funny with these two ageing boxing is when they start throwing insult at each other it start in a big fight it like watch a campus fight with two students, you get what i mean when a fight breaks out the camera come out it go on you tube & through the film its mostly like this which is seriously funny with Kevin Hart it just makes it even more funnier. The same goes for a funny Alan Arkin as Stallone's trainer who also plays the same type of character that he always does. So there's nothing truly unique about the movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and that's kind of a good thing. It focuses on the funny for the most part, but also adds some depth to the characters when it shows the struggles they're having in their personal lives. A lot of people will probably say this film is going to be a bad but its surprisingly a great film to watch it has the funny moment as a well balance serious tone that make this a pretty well made film that's well written congrats to the Director: Peter Segal for making a good film.This is a worth while film to watch you wont be disappointed if your a Niro or Stallone fan because this is a great afternoon film.",8,0,3,11 January 2014
Prisoners," Brilliant emotional journey & outstanding performances
","This is got to be Huge Jackman best powerful performance to date as you from the trailer of this film he play the character of Keller Dover who's kid & friend kid gets taken, from there this film taken you on a trip dark intense & emotional journey as the family is put through hell during its darkest hour.Also from the trailers you know that his character is out for blood as their daughter's are missing, throughout the film you can really feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he try's deal with this situation & its this performance that really show Hugh Jackman brilliance as an actor because he bring the most believable performance ever playing this role. Also bring an outstanding performance Jake Gyllenhaal as he plays the Detective Loki who try his best to find the girls & track down who took them before its to late.The director Denis Villeneuve does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even though some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative, this film is not for the faint of heart as some scene of torture may be disturbing for some viewer but this is a worth watching film that will shock you & bring you to tears in emotional moments as its a pretty shocking film.This may not be a film for everyone which also depend on your taste of film's but this is for me one of Hugh Jackman best performance to date & a film you must see.",9,2,4,12 October 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avenger age of Ultron is a great film but not perfect
","To start with I've seen a lot of reviews that are buyest giving this film a full 10 out of 10 from marvel fan's so let me be clear this is a fair & unbiased review of the film as it wasn't a perfect film I'm not going to let just because it marvel effect the way i review this film.Joss Whedon hasn't done a bad job at making this film there are a few flaws in this film which i will explain in the dislikes, but as for the start of the film it throw you into a battle with hydra which has no build up which i assume this scene follow from the end credit of the first avengers which i thought could of had a bit of a build up to it but it wasn't to bad. Cant believe they actual snook the F-word in a 12A film but gladly follow by a funny one-liner from one of the main characters which i did find funny but i couldn't believe what i heard,the dose appeal to a mass audience that enjoys action and super heroes combine in to one film which is all good. With the character of Ultron i actual was in-pressed with the way they brought him in to this film, although having his origin story change this wasn't badly executed. The only reason why marvel screwed this up was because the original origin story of Ultron was from Hank Pym's, which comic book reads know as Ant-man but because Ant-man wasn't filmed before this film they couldn't go with the origin story of Ultron so it had to be change which didn't seem off balance or out of place this was well executed in the film giving the character life. Which James Spader done perfectly voicing Ultron, what the trailer doesn't show you all to well is the way James gives this character its nature, its was like watching a child with a psychotic, mental, ideal, person hell bend on destroy everything so a master race could rise, that the way this character came across he actual was pretty menacing but he attitude just matched his way of looking at thing & look.I did notice that there is something going on with Bruce banner (Mark Ruffalo) & Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson ) which had a bit of a spin in the film although felt something was missing about it, in certain part you do notice the atmosphere between tony stark (Robert Downey Jr.) & Steve Rogers ( Chris Evans ) you can see the civil war aspect coming between them which is a future film project for marvel which is clever implant in the film i did notice that. Some of the banter is funny in places, but some times come across a little unnecessary for the scenes but you do find yourself laughing at them. Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) pull off a great performance as a woman with powerful magic you don't mess with along with the speedster her character brother Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who dose have a few funny one-liners although most of his scene are C.G.I effects he dose a great job. The Other new character that is introduced in this film Vision (Paul Bettany ) was a welcome addiction to the team, love the design of his look, comes across very powerful, there is a moment with him that had the dose have the whole audience thinking W.T.H moment with Thor which was brilliant executed scene in the film that even had me god-smacked because i wasn't expect it, as well as a few scene with Clint Barton aka Hawk-eye ( Jeremy Renner ) There is unexpected scene that was keep from the first film which made me a little puzzled but it was explain briefly which i liked otherwise it would would have been a plot hole. Visual effect are & action in this film dose keep you attention on the film although a few scene are little slowed down this was to bad of a film, not perfect but still an OK film, but with a surprise end credit scene which most of the story-line in this film set up for the 3rd film.Dislikes : Sorry but i need to saying this because most everyone complains about the use of C.G.I in film's, I've heard a lot of people complain about the C.G.I in transformers saying it look fake, well I'm sorry to say this but Age of ultron use a lot of C.G.I in visual effects that is very questionable. Although the performance of Ultron is brilliant from James spader the C.G.I use is over the top for some of the scene, its come across a little fake in a lot of scenes which make the character a little to unbelievable at time, the only part that actual look real was when you see himself which is seen in the trailer talking about not being worthy. I feel some part of the film were showing crack in Joss Whedon directing as he been stretch to much with doing a lot of other film's because its show in the story plot of this film which is over shadowed but visual effects & action, sadly if you take away these visual effect & action there isn't much story there which is a shame because this film is more style over quality story.the other thing was i disappointed in is that Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch background isn't explain much other than the fact they were experiment on by hydra, i feel the story was lacking there as well as the other characters lack of humanity in there manors. I feel Vision could of been in the film more as he's not in the film much.",7,0,3,25 April 2015
The Witch," Total borfest , waste of a potential dark story
","Likes : Well after viewing this film i can say all hype over nothing , what i mean by that is that that this film was advertised as being scary & generally frighting well not at all. Yes there are some good point about this film the acting is pretty solid using a Shakespearian language in speaking along with its authentic costume design for the period this film is set in , the mood of the film is bad , but my god this film is so flawed in story scripting Dislikes : First mistake is the beginning of the film you see a family in a country for some unknown reason which is not explained they are cast out of the village to live in exile in the wildness which set not back story for the film so you just throw in to a film with not direction.Now the film is meant to be scary yet there is hardy anything happening apart from a baby that goes missing in a mysterious way , strange woman in the wood of a temptress witch that it , you get three moment in the film that were meant to be frighting & psychological its just fails is so many way to be frighting. The pacing of this film seriously with not much going on seriously was enough to put you a sleep , this film had potential too be so much better with a more darker story instead its just a mediocre horror that trys to hard to be frighting by with hardly anything happening this is a very poor story in a film.",4,2,6,20 April 2016
12 Years a Slave," Astonishing, heartbreaking ,Powerful and Gripping story
","12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup played outstandingly by Chiwetel Ejiofor, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. This Astonishing, heartbreaking ,Powerful and Gripping story really dose bring you to tears & anger over how these people were treat over there colour just for slaves & money,this is the very reason why i hate the human race at time there no reason what so ever to treat these people this way it upset me that we as a human race let this going on back in the 18th century. This is one film that has left me speechless as the credits rolled with shock , i was in tears by the end of it as it such a beautiful & powerfully made film I've ever seen in a while, that gave this story justice. The trailer just doesn't do this film any justice really, you really have to see this film for yourself to see why this is a very powerful film, with some of the best performances from all the cast & actors, i was Surprised to see a cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch & Brad pitt who's few lines really made his character a good man standing up against slavery brilliant done for a 5 min scene.Steve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth I seriously can't express the anger, the emotional feel i got from watching this its that shocking you get the feel you just want to walk out the room because what you see in this film was very brave but the story of one man struggle from being a free man to be tricked & sold into slavery really make every emotion come out of you.12 years a slave is a masterpiece of a film that is one film i seriously recommend you watch.",10,2,6,3 January 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Amazing intense Groundhog day action sc-fi film
","Wow this film is amazing for a sc-fi action movie that full of valuable twists, surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences special some of the beach scene in the battle if you could call it a battle it more like a slaughter. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal. The thing about this film as well is the Most unexpected of all , the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well which you don't expected in this type of film most of it is from Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey, but here you need to forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes role, as here he plays an entirely different character as he a reluctant hero force in to a situation he not prepared for. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.The rest of the cast is also brilliant performance's to sell a great film, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real on screen this is why she a fantastic actress, here in this film she succeeds in portraying her character very well as a tough, seasoned soldier which other soldiers refer her to as 'full metal bitch' (i'm not kidding you hear that twice!) As you see with her squad the have white skull painted on the helmets so they must be elite soldier.With her character not just being this hard ass soldier she come across with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable as the character she portraying.Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great, character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before there kind of a cameo role in a way for the film. This basically is a Sc-fi film that is very fast paced & brutal with some stunning cinematography & amazing C.G.I effects on the alien design, with a Groundhog day concept that really work for the film as the whole Live ,die & repeat concept that give this film its humor & as-well as the edge this film needed. I know lot of people don't like tom cruise but this has to be his best performance to date in a film special for a blockbuster like this, it a film i can recommend watching.Dislikes : I don't know if any one noticed this , but there was a flaw in the story-line at the very end of this film which didn't make scene with the way it ended it was nothing major to pull a film down because it was at the end of the film but still enough to notice it didn't make sense, other then that the whole film was brilliantly done.",9,10,20,30 May 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Not a bad film
","Martin Scorsese is one of the best director in the world, this is one of his film's that contains a lot of adult theme content, based on a true story where its easy to become corrupt with power & money.Coning people to make money & get rich fast which goes against ever law in the state, is why this man ended up in prison with a few other men that worked in wall street proving you can escape the law of the F.B.I because they will catch you out sometime down the line. I'm not much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan but he's performance in film is spot on, special with this film as he plays Jordan Belfort , Jordan Belfort is the son of Max and Leah Belfort of New York. In 1989, he and Daniel Porush founded the now defunct brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont which became the largest OTC firm in the United States at that time. Jordan and his business partner were charged with 10 counts of securities fraud and money laundering for the stock manipulation of at least 25 companies that Stratton had underwritten. After serving approximately 22 months in prison he was also ordered to return $100 million to former clients. He reportedly had been earning upwards to $50 million a year during his later years before the Department of Justice in the United States shut his operation down. Some of this film you kind of find yourself straying a little as it dose get a bit boring at time, but the funny moment's really dose make you laugh special some scene there so ridiculous you can help but laugh i bet the stars film on set couldn't stop laughing after film that scene because I've never laugh so hard it was to funny. There is a lot adult content as i said most of it is a gay concept & naked woman, with a lot of drug's & alcohol use which is pretty strong in this film but that to be expected in this type of film being rich & powerful. All in all this wasn't a bad film to watch as i said its has its laughable moment's to dam right stupid moments but as a true story i think they told a pretty true story of the life of Jordan Belfort down to every detail of what he did.This is pretty well scripted with some brilliant performance from all the stars in this film f you a Leonardo DiCaprio fan your like this film.",7,0,4,10 January 2014
It Chapter Two," A better true form reveal than the TV series.
","Im just gonna come right out with it Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd Pennywise Creepy hell out of me, you know what I love it, this is the perfect adaption to a real Pennywise from the Stephen King book. Not to say this was, by all means, a bad sequel this was way above average, I do feel the first film was better on the scary jump points that gave you chills.Not that this sequel has them, there are a few moments throughout this film that give you those moments of did that just happen and another moment when pennywise is just being seriously creepy to the point it almost like a child with sinister intentions that give you the chills, the film doesn't try to overplay it.I swear this is the creep part of the film, the casting! When you are watching the character all grown up it really freaky how well cast this film is because each act in this film acted and play the older version of the kids. It like they were cast as themselves in the first film just younger and now playing the older version in the sequel, never before have I seen this in any film, so this is well done by the Cast and director.The film itself just give some what of a background to it but doesn't really go into too much detail of why this demon ended up on the earth, though Stephen kings book actually does go into more detail which has a connection to another Stephen King book the dark tower.But as ive said It chapter two is way above average and actually a pretty good sequel, probley by now people are wondering how does the ending happen, that I can't give away because of spoilers, all I can say is it better than what teh TV series of it did, though I do feel it could have been done slighty a bit better on IT true form reveal, but I understand what they were going for with the way it ended.With talk of a possible third film, to be honest, the only direction I can see them taking is a prequel way before the loser club stumbles on the demonic clown, possible around the era of the circus or further back. It chapter two is worth watching but seriously dont take a red balloon from a strange clown you might just end up floating, as they all float down here.Dislikes: There are a few slighty pacing issues where scene jump slighty drags the film down, the scary part of the film was a little dull in this sequel which is because we're used to watching Pennywise from the first film.The big reveal of It true form was good, it was miles better than the original Tim curry It tv series, but I do feel as if it could have been designed a little more frightening, but I understand what they were going for it would have been the same if they had the look a different way.",8,3,4,6 September 2019
The Conjuring," Based on true events back in the 1970
","First thing you notice with this film is that its based on true events, now you think here that OK its just a made up story for entertainment for shock & horror value for a horror film.Well you would be wrong, This is was a investigation that has never been told to media or anyone until now because of the Amityville haunting, this film is truly based on an investigation of a family that was haunted by some evil force when they moved in back in the 70s which also lends to one of the most famous paranormal investigation of the Amityville house haunting & a few other haunting in the area. Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson portray two of the worlds famous paranormal investigator's Lorraine Warren & Ed Warren which you can Google them they have done a lot of paranormal investigation through their life some of which were the most frightening to them.This film I kid you not is not for the faith hearted, it is one of the most spin chilling, disturbing horror films your ever see, that really insight your fear of the dark.it refreshing to see a horror film exactly scare the living hell out of you for once. Knowing this is a real story make it even more frightening to know that there are thing in the dark that you should be wary of.",10,1,3,2 August 2013
Wonder Woman," Incredible character adaptation Gal Gadot was incredible and beautiful.
","This is the true an honest review you about to get from, this film blow me away straight up no lie, its's not just on the passion that gone into this film but the emotional content as well that just blow me away in so many ways that had me in tears by the end of the film.The direction and dialog of the film is incredibly done to bring one hell of a film with 'love', 'adventure', and message to the world that bring wonder woman character out the right way on screen. The hype is real as director 'Patty Jenkins' has done an incredible job on this film with a great balance of humour, inspiration moments and the incredible sound track as well just made the dramatic scene amazing it gave me chills.The emotional scene in the second and third act gave this film a brilliant way to end, which i was seriously holding back the tears it really hit the heart; when a film can do this you know this is a fantastic film. The film is so perfectly done with the first half the film showing Diana growing up around the amazons on the island of Themyscira as the film give the audience a back story of the gods which perfectly sets up the character Aries.The way this film show the woman is brilliant done in a way that it not this overbearing feministic theme, it show men and woman as equals which is brilliant special when it comes to Steve and Diana character as Steve is like an equal to the character of wonder woman it comes off brilliantly on screen.Connie Nielsen performance as Queen Hippolyta the Queen of the Amazons in Greek mythology was amazing not only playing the mother role but also playing the queen with concern about Diana, Robin Wright in her own right was a bad ass on screen as we she her kicking ass in the first half of the film playing hippolyta sister Antiope who train Diana too hippolyta displeasure.Elena Anaya perfect casting choice for Dr. Maru aka Dr poison as we she her character as this psychopathic Alchemist creating some thing that could single handily destroy the world she play this role brilliantly with Danny Huston character who was actually a real German general in the first world war by the name Ludendorff, who came across very ruthless which i feel was Aries influence on him.David Thewlis performance was actually dam good in a 'Alec Guinness' way with a someone sinister tone in the third act, but as Aries he was seriously good, although these scene were C.G.I which was the only way you could do this, which was one hell of a fight scene with Diana, he done amazing in this film.Chris Pine performance is one of the best his done playing Steve Trevor playing this guy that strong but weakness at time, but his dialog throughout the film is well written with some emotional parts and the on screen chemistry with Gal Gadot was amazing which just added to the film flare.One thing people were worried about was can Gal Gadot pull wonder woman character off as we only saw her character in full warrior mode in third act of Batman v superman, i can honest say you can't keep your eyes off her throughout the whole film. Not only is she incredible beautiful in the film ; her acting playing this woman that's never been in the world of men, let alone seen a man is incredible.The way she come across which add's to the character is the naive woman unlike what we saw in Batman v superman, she is complete someone that new to everything like this natural curiosity to everything which she pull's off incredibly on screen; giving the wonder woman character the justice it need on screen.Although the most of the third act 'EPIC!' battle is c.g.i, you can easily forgive this has the rest of the film is amazingly directed, with the film score as well is probably one of the best movie sound tracks that not only adds to the dramatic effect of the film just give that edge it needed. Special the scene we've seen in the trailer when Diana step out on to the battle field on the tench the sound track playing then gave the scene an inspiring powerful moment of heroism.There seriously is nothing i can faultier about this film, its great soundtrack, acting performance from all, Gal Gadot Chris pine and the others just made this film for what it is, its a must to watch you would be a fool to miss this film.Dislikes : The only nick picking i would give is Aries Armour which I'm sure some people will complain again, i do feel it could of been better designed, but it was OK as the scene was to epic to actually care about that fault.",10,14,31,1 June 2017
Black Panther," Good but over-hyped film with flaws
","One seriously don't go into this film think its a racially motivated film, if you're looking for this to fuel some anger and use it as a political standpoint to fuel a race war then you need to check your moral campus, because this film is completely opposite on political views which address a lot of the world issue not just in Wakanda, some of which that were mention in this film I agree with.But I'm not gonna spend the whole of this review explaining the political side of this film, although most of these motive from T'Challa played brilliantly by Chadwick Boseman show a man seeing the past mistake of his ancestors and wanting to make the world a better place through help each other and become as one tribe there for each other. But know that its ok to help each other but the world has its issue that it must overcome in order to bring peace and help each other, me person not even reading or know anything about the comic books of black panther, watching this film I understood his motives and passion, not just for his own people but to help the world as well.If you never read any of the comic books this film does do a great job in giving black panther a backstory while helping you understand his character and motivate. I personally love the lion king style reference which was a nice touching moment for this film with the animal spirit guides.although the film doesn't really represent Wakanda as Wakanda is a fictional place based on the nation in Africa like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, and the Congo more like an amalgamation of these real African nations, economies, and cultures.Which is represented in trial by combat for leadership and the woman shown as strong African warriors kind of like the amazons which is shown perfectly in the film with Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira playing these role along with ladies playing warriors There is also a few moment where we get some funny moment which does overdo it like most other Marvel films have done in the past.Even the whole casting is pretty good in this film along with its acting but it does suffer a lot of problems, not that this is a bad film, there are a few things that make this a pretty average film and not a perfect one. By far out of all the Marvel villains Micheal B Jordan is best so far in having a true motive to be evil but with one flaw in his story playing Erik Killmonger. With the mention of this black panther being the James bond of the comic book universe I would say total true on that part with Letitia Wright play a technology expert like Q from Bond films, so in a way, that reference is true which actually works.Although this of what I said is all the good parts of the film, there is a lot of issues the film has which will be addressed in dislikes. Dislikes : Few problems with the film one being the main villain, which is a shame since Michael b Jordan playing this role is the best villain they have done by far, the problem here is that he doesn't get enough screen time as the film focus too much on the political and tribal side of the film.Which is ok which puts more focus on world issue and the conflict with T'Challa having to be a king while protecting the world around him, but as the main villain of the film there should've been more focus there as well because it seem that michael b Jordan character was only relevant in the 3rd act, he only become the golden jaguar for the last 30mins of the film.  This is what I mean by the film being unbalanced too much focused on the political side which drag the film down slightly.The other issue is some of the camera work it like the camera person can keep the camera still for 5 mins, there were a least 20mins of the film that was slight shaking, the some of the action scene again with this shaky camera. This show complete amateur filmmaking when a director has to rely on shaky camera effects for action screen, it the most hated thing in a film every, i urge film make to stop using it.",7,33,85,13 February 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Pitch perfect 3 is a perfect end for the girls, Great film
","Likes : Ya i know what people are gonna say pitch perfect is just a small time film and a chick flick not really a worth it film, although it a guilty pleasure of mine as some of the main cast singer are gorgeous specially two of which Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow.Simple after three disappointing film at the end of this year you kind of need something fun to pick your mood for Christmas up and wide down the year, i'l be honest pitch perfect three was a perfect film to just relax in the ambiance of music which is at it best with this film.Although this is the last film of pitch perfect it gone out with a big bang in give the audiences some of the best music mash ups and comedy, but unlike the previous two movies it add a surprising twist as one of the groups father turn up after a few year, but you would think it a happen reunion but nope.This reunion almost get the girls killed before they can do their last stage appearance together, which was good for the story give the movie more than just singing which was great.With cameos from Ruby Rose and music industry DJ Khaled playing himself really added some flare to this film which is great, making it a really enjoyable film to watch. It always great listen to Anna Kendrick singing as she has this amazing singing voice that so beautiful to listen to it also has you in tears, she not just a brilliant actress but amazing singer.Although the comedy is a little weak at time, this is just one of those great fun movie to watch if you had a disappointing end of 2017. Dislikes : The only thing wrong with this film is some joke did fall flat in places and John Lithgow brilliant actor but it felt like the way they've written his character in this film felt like a creepy old man it just came across that way on screen.",8,4,11,22 December 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Slightly over rated but still worth watching.
","Likes : OK ill start by saying I have a positive review to tell you but I have a negative one as well, as this film is slightly overrated. Marvels director Alan Taylor has done a good job with this as its enjoyable to watch, it has it (WTH) funny moment that you do find yourself laughing at because it was funny special some of the Thor & Loki moments in the film.This film does have a dark tone which might be disturbing for younger viewers, visual effect were brilliant as we see lot more of Asgard after the first film, I will say it more of emotional storyline to be honest this time I did find myself tearing up in some parts.There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but it's noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.Christopher Eccleston played as Malekith the Accursed dark elves leader played a some what insane bad guy that wanted to turn all the worlds to darkness, there isn't much in the way to say why he was doing this other than the back-story of the darks elves & this world destroying energy.There is a bit at end of the credit but there is a bit mid credits that seems to lend toward Thanos possible for some reason, it was just that one scene that had that mysterious feel to it like something bigger was going on behind the scenes but we don't know yet, as we've heard Avenger 2 or 3 will have Thanos appear so it could be a link but its unclear at this moment.With the character of Loki I did think it was going to be a little repetitive since he been 3 films now but I believe he's character has more of a big part to play in coming events I think he's still working for the dark forces of Thanos for some reason because of he behaviour or it just Loki being Loki. What I did notice was a bit of a jealously Starr from Sith (Jaimie Alexander) to Jane (Natalie Portman) because from what you can see Sith has a thing for Thor even in a moment of the film a scene with Thor & Odin seem to suggest that.This film in the way of fighting scene dose have a few battles but not much, probably the most important character in the film showed just what he can do even tho he a gate keeper but from what I saw he can seriously kick ass Heimdall play brilliant actor Idris Elba I through it about time some one write him in the storyline doing something awesome instead of just watch the gate & the universe because he has such a style in he acting he stands out with an on screen presence.For me the comical moment were OK but some people mite find this ruins the dark tone of the film because it become less of a serious film at times & more of a comedy film of Thor, but it enjoyable to watch.Dislikes : The negative side of this film, is the slight humour I did find that it wasn't really need but Disney being Disney they want a film that kids can watch as well, I think Malekith character as to why he want to turn the worlds into dark could of been explain in the back story but it wasn't real much explained .My only real complaint about this film was the way it ended the last 5 Min's of the film You could see what was going on but there was curtain elements as to why & what the hell is happening.It leave you with an open ending with no closure with you wanting to see more to see what is going on in that scene but that where the credits role. This main is why I feel this film is slightly overrated .",7,6,14,30 October 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," brilliantly written storyline
","I watched the first film of this which was OK but I wasn't to impressed with it normal when a sequel came out the sequel is normal bad but I was surprisingly surprised that this sequel was better, the storyline was better written it had a bit more interesting things going on.There is a lot of smoke & mirrors going on in this film that you find yourself glued to what is going on which to some people mite be predictable where other wont figure out what's going on, but the special effect specially with the island & jungle there is more than just a group to attend with it like they up the game in this sequel making it harder to survive.I love the way they put a bit of humour but as well as the defiance scene's to stick it to the man was funny even I laughed at which work pretty well for the story of the film, The cast that were chosen for the film was perfect.The beautiful Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss with exceptional strength and even grace made her for a believable character as Katniss I just cant see anyone else as the strong heroine for this role. Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch with a respect for the character in terms of how the character truly feels about the Capitol and showing him as a man made bitter by his life hence the drinking heavy, which in my opinion was pretty much what Haymitch was.Donald Sutherland as the vicious President Snow you kind of feel you just want to get a hold of the guy & punch in the face for having no respect for human life. Now I could go on and on about how superb the cast was because it is true, Everyone brought something great to the film but it was Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss that held the movie high standard with her performance is outstanding & believable. The action and violence was also pretty gruesome & done just right so that it didn't go overboard to look ridiculous & to Hollywood it was just right.You will get a lot of people with mix reviews about this film, but it a film you should experience for your self as it dose surprise you as being a good film, all these it the next twilight film is not of the sort completely different storyline altogether & a completely different genre altogether.Now I didn't think I would like this film at first when I watch the first film, but I decided to watch this sequel since I've seen the first one I will say this one is better than the first film.It a film I recommend you watch just for the experience of seeing a great film that well written from the books, I cant wait to see the 3rd film, as this film has that gladiator feel to it which make this film a good film to watch.",8,1,21,26 November 2013
Godzilla," Finally a Godzilla that pay homage to the original films
","Likes : Let me just say that everyone complains about c.g.i being in a film but this film will change your mind, the special effect, the C.G.I of this film blow me away, this is one of the most fantastic film's I've seen in a long time, although some of it is slightly flawed this film is awesome. The direction of this film is perfect it doesn't just start off with an all out monster fight, it build's the film up to one massive monster fight, but it doesn't just focus on the monsters it also focus's on the human in the middle of the cross fire. Who every design the features & look of Godzilla i would shake their hand because they made one of the best looking bad ass Godzilla looks ever it was like looking at a pit-bull on steroid big on a massive scale which gave Godzilla this mean looking don't mess with alpha monster, i love that they gave him a personality which i did notice because in curtain scene he seem to avoid killing an humans as he came in which was so odd because at first you don't really notice it but you start seeing that he not there to kill human but there to kill the creature's. This is nothing like what has been done before because this seriously pay homage to the original Godzilla film's not the failed attempted 1998 version of Godzilla, but this has one special surprise which i loved the fact they introduced in this film which really show's homage to the original films was brilliant done in this film. Bryan Cranston's acting in particular is fantastic in this film really sell the emotional scene although (Spoiler Alert) he not in this film long, he part was brilliant to give the film its build up which was also emotional & intense at some point, The monsters? The visual effects? The story? are all Spot on. This is truly the monster Godzilla film we have been waiting for all the fan of the original film we be surprised just how close to the original versions this film is the director who is a small time director has made a massive gem of a film that fans have been long for, the creature design is awesome in way they are parasite type creatures where the female is bigger & male are smaller but the fight scene with these creature with Godzilla is just beyond awesome this is a big must to see at the cinema.Dislikes : (Spoiler alert) One thing that was annoying that was disappointing its the lack of fight scene's, about two maybe 3 fight scene just has it get in to a fight it cuts to other scene just as your about to get in to the fight, but the film does redeem that at the end because it was an awesome fight scene.",10,4,10,15 May 2014
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the best war film since we we're soldiers
","Likes : Wow this film is incredible on storytelling of one of America's greatest heroes during the WWII that never fired a shot once due to religiously beliefs , with his courage and bravery he rescued over 75 men from the what i can describe 'hell on earth' that was hacksaw ridge.This film is brutal , emotional , intense and very frightening as it throws you into a story of the bravest men that throw them self in to a 'meat grinder' , as wave upon wave of Japanese fighter's throw them self at them with a kamikaze attitude.This is how war film should be portrayed with brutal violence , with an emotional concept giving a realistic point of view of how war was like during these times , Despite all the things Mel Gibson has said in the past it look as if Hollywood has forgive him and give him a chance. Mel certainly is good at directing as what his done with this film is incredible directing , with good direction and flow.Andrew Garfield we haven't seen a lot of since the spider man film although his recent film silence after he was fired , but i think after this film he's proved to Hollywood that he can have a variety of acting skill as his performance in this film was nothing short of perfection.Andrew portrays Desmond Doss on screen playing a simple country farm boy that found god after an incident with his father who refuse to carry or shot a weapon in this war , yet he wanted to be apart of it which cause some upset with the generals & sergeants as they all called him a coward but despite of this allow him to serve as a medic.Clearly during this war he's shown absolute bravery in the face of danger and death by rescuing 75 injured men from the Japanese onslaught on battle field which he was alone and by him self doing this , which to the shock of his fellow soldiers who we're all off the ridge saw him in a different light after this.Andrew portray this brilliantly on screen with one of the best performance I've see in a long time , giving us a believable character and showing that Andrew has what it take to become to the next big star in Hollywood. Andrew is also up for a nomination in the Oscars which he well deserves for his performance in this film.The action choreography and stunt work gone into this film to bring us a brilliant story is amazing done , these brutal scene through the film show a real situation in war. It very similar to film such as 'Apocalypse Now ', 'Platoon' or 'Saving Private Ryan' in brutality , which add's to the film entertainment value also show us i vivid blood thirsty violent war.The supporting cast made this film as well as they all play their part in the film with brilliance , from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer put in some screen time performance in this film surprised me on how good the casting is.Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind being good as the side characters but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn , who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film , particularly that of an Army Sergeant which he done brilliantly.Very rarely does a film in the year hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to film making from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best war film's I've seen since Mel Gibson 'we we're soldiers' you be a fool to miss this film special on the big screen as this is a phenomenal film you must watch.I will say this ; this is true heroism to actually rescue injury soldiers knowing that any min by yourself you can get shot , Desmond in the history of soldier is the bravest man I've seen who received the 'Medal of Honor' the highest award for courage under fire.He went on to marry his wife after the war until she sadly past away in 1991 son after he spoke up about the war saying ' the real heroes are buried over there' at hacksaw ridge , Desmond Doss one of the bravest men to service in the us army who saved 75 men sadly past away at the age of 87 in march 2006.",10,2,7,26 January 2017
