Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is not a movie for those who don't love the story.
","I have reviewed a few movies in my time and I want to give it a shot for The Phantom Menace. First for those that said this is not a critics movie they were right. The elements that many critics look for aren't all there, but I think that there is a shift in critiques for this movie.  Because many today that critique movies are from the generation that created the first Star Wars trilogy. This movie is for those members of the generation spawned by that generation.  This is generation X's star wars trilogy. The visual effects were great, the plot line was very evident and well thought out and I thought this movie is well deserving of the 9 I gave it. I had only one worry about the story line while going into seeing the movie. In 'Episode IV' young Luke was being told by a wise old Obi Wan that he first met his [Luke's] father and he was already a great pilot.  OK that's fine...but then the teaser trailer comes out and shows Obi Wan meeting Anakin at the young age of 9.   Lucas obviously thought of this and actually made young Anakin a great pilot and eventually the savior of Naboo in a round about sort of way.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
