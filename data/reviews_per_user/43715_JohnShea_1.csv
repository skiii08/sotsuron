Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not what I expected
","The Phantom Menace did not live up to it's expectations, at least in my opinion.  Aside from the disgustingly annoying Ja Ja Binks and the bad acting of  Anakin Skywalker it was an ok movie.  The special effects were good, but that is about it.",3,0,1,27 May 1999
