Hereditary," Not gonna lie
","Not gonna lie, I've never seen anything like this before. It starts off pretty slow and at times, the viewer may wonder where exactly this strange plot is taking him. The momentum builds gradually to a final 30 minutes that will chill the most experienced horror fan. There's faint hints of David Lynch at times. The cinematography is great. Lots of creeps subtly hidden in the perfectly exposed dark shadows. Also, not gonna lie... I had to look up the folklore after the movie was over to understand wtf. But it was good enough as a stand-alone horror without understanding the satanic backstory from the start.",8,0,2,16 January 2019
