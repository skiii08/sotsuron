The King's Speech," Well Done Bertie!
","Going into THE KING'S SPEECH, I was a little skeptical. Admittedly, after seeing the over-rated 'English Patient', I wasn't a big Colin Firth fan. I have nothing against him, perhaps it's just the roles he's gotten up until now. He was excellent in BRIDGET JONE'S DIARY, but still I had reservations about his Oscar-worthiness. Now that I've seen him as the man who'd become King George VI, I can confidently say he deserves the award! His performance as the stuttering, deeply troubled Bertie is spot-on. Not knowing much about British royalty (shame on me, considering my heritage) I was utterly blown away to learn about Bertie's troubles. To help him with his speaking problems, Helena Bonham Carter (in one of her most subdued roles) as Queen Elizabeth suggests that Bertie see a speech therapist of sorts named Lionel Logue played wonderfully by Geoffrey Rush. As their sessions get more involved we, along with Lionel, learn why Bertie developed his speech impediment. His upbringing definitely hints at how it got started, and was only made worse by the treatment he receives from his father (George V), his older brother (Edward VIII), and his cold, distant mother. As a matter of fact, we learn that sadly Bertie had virtually no friends while growing up, apart from a few nannies. Once again, this movie helps to reinforce a belief I've had: The real parents for the rich and royal children were the hired help. A solid friendship develops between Bertie and Lionel as world events loom in the background. The start of the movie is in the mid-30s, so the threat of Nazi Germany feels very urgent and immediate. Through a series of circumstances, Bertie finds himself in the position of king and now he must find a way to lead his people during the dark days ahead. The movie's conclusion has Bertie giving his finest speech. And as he concludes it, one can't help but cheer for Bertie, who gave such an inspiring and triumphant speech. Technically speaking, the cinematography, editing and music are perfect. In conclusion, it's no wonder this movie was such a winner. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know a little about British royal history, as well as anybody looking for an inspiring story!",10,0,0,25 April 2011
Black Swan," Into the Mouth of Madness
","Whenever I sit through a Darren Aronofsky film, I always feel like I've just been hit by a train at the end! His movies are usually assaults on our psychological make-up. I dare anyone to sit through REQUIEM FOR A DREAM or BLACK SWAN and not feel overwhelmed afterwards. Both films delve into the darker sides of the characters and we're brought along for the ride. In BLACK SWAN, we're invited into the world of professional ballet. And we meet Nina, the protagonist, who's been doing ballet all her life (though it's more than hinted that her domineering mother forced her into it.) Nina is quiet, perfection-driven, and most likely virginal. When she gets the part of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, Nina must somehow find a way to display both the White Swan (forlorn, looking for love, graceful) and the Black Swan (seductive, insane, domineering, powerful.) As practice goes on, we learn more about Nina's life and psyche as it starts to take a downward spiral. In fact, it seems that her own life is becoming the story of Swan Lake. By the end, we can all but tell she's gone over the edge. Not being a ballet fan, I have little knowledge of the art form. However, being a performer, I can understand where the character of Nina comes from. Whether you're a ballerina, a musician, or an actor, there comes a time when you're no longer the normal, average person. That person has stepped out and has been replaced by the character or persona. It's quite difficult to maintain two or more roles at once, especially when you also have to contend with everyday stresses, like work, relationships, and bills. However, the greatest performers are able to disappear into their roles and present to us the truth of their characters. Nina has simply taken it one step further, as we watch her crazed and tragic ascent and descent into the role of a lifetime. Natalie Portman does a tremendous job, as always. Mila Kunis does an equally stellar job as Lily, her rival. In fact, the whole cast was spectacular! From an artistic standpoint, I liked how most of the color scheme was on the gray scale, with a few dashes of pink, red, or green to highlight crucial moments. Once again, Darren Aronofsky astounds the senses with tricky shots and surreal imagery. This film is not for the light-hearted who are looking for cheap thrills. But for the rest of you, take the journey into the mouth of madness!",10,1,2,3 May 2011
Alien 3," It's Too Bloody Dark!!!
","The first two ALIEN movies struck gold, so it was inevitable that a third movie would be made. Unfortunately, in this case, third time is NOT a charm. Now rumor has it that ALIEN 3 went through a long and horrible process called 'Production Hell.' In Production Hell, studios try to get a movie made, but they keep running into problems. ALIEN 3 was originally supposed to be made by another director. But somewhere along the way, the director and writers had a falling out, and left the project. I don't how many directors the film went through, but it eventually was given to David Fincher (director of THE GAME, SEVEN, and the Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS.) And what you see on screen (if you dare to watch the monstrosity) is simply awful. Ripley has crash-landed on a prison planet, the lone survivor yet again. However, an alien has also followed her... Do I REALLY need to tell you what happens next?! The main problem with the film is that none of the characters (apart from Ripley) are interesting at all. You'd think that with a cast of prisoners turned monks, they'd have at least a few, but no. And why oh why did they have Ripley shave off her hair and adopt a Susan Powter look? Also, most of the film is too bloody dark! Considering they're in a prison, you'd think there'd be more lighting. I know, I know, it makes everything appear scary. However, even the scares are lackluster. Halfway into the movie, I don't think the film had a script at all, because every actor just runs around in the dark, screaming at the top of his (or her) lungs. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the ending is blatantly ripped off from TERMINATOR 2. Sheesh, skip this fiasco and move directly onto ALIEN RESURRECTION.",3,1,4,18 December 2013
This Is the End," Hey, It's The Apocalypse... Let's Laugh!!!
","These days, movies about the end-of-the-world are a dime a dozen. If it's not raging zombies or terminators, then it's evil super villains. But what if... what if... the Apocalypse were to happen, with little to no warning? What would you do? In THIS IS THE END, one of the latest films from the Judd Apatow entourage, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel go to a party at James Franco's house. Soon after arriving, a giant sinkhole appears outside the front door. Many of the party-goers wind up falling in, leaving behind Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride. Now, with the Apocalypse underway, the guys do their best at surviving. Inevitably getting on each other's nerves in the process. The humor, as with all their films, is an even mix of raunchy, usually sex-related, conversations and brilliant one-liners. Of the entire cast, I found Danny McBride the funniest, as well as the most antagonistic. Jay, as usual, is at his geekiest best. Of note, there are two scenes that stand out: 1) The death of Michael Cera and 2) The Exorcism of Jonah Hill. Both will have your sides splitting. For a mainstream movie, I was surprised by their attention to detail pertaining to a Biblical Apocalypse. Yes (Spoiler Alert) there is a Hell and a Heaven. And it's comforting to know that the Backstreet Boys made it!",9,3,7,12 May 2015
Dawn of the Dead," Bloody Good Remake!!!
","Normally I'm stand-offish towards remakes. Usually it seems when filmmakers decide to remake a classic, what they're really saying is 'The original sucks in some way. So now I'll do it better.' And 9 times out of 10, the remake is worse. Filmmakers of a good remake however say 'The original is excellent and we're not going to mess with it. Let's set it to one side. Now here's our version!' In many ways, a good remake is an alternate story. DAWN OF THE DEAD is an example of a remake that is done very well. Taking the same basic concept as Romero's 1978 classic, director Zack Snyder and his team create their own frightening zombie film.The story: For nurse Ana (played wonderfully by Sarah Polley) her rough day at the hospital is finally winding down. All she wants to do is go home and fall into the arms of her husband. On her ride home, kids are playing, birds are chirping, music is blaring out of her radio. Just another normal day comes to an end... Next morning, in one of the best scary scenes in recent cinema history, she's attacked and must flee her home. Shortly afterward, she meets up with Kenneth (Ving Rhames) along with several other survivors. With nowhere else to go, they head to the enormous Crossroads Mall. And the rest of the story involves their struggle to survive in a zombie-infested world. There are so many individual scenes and gory special effects that I wouldn't think of revealing them all. Everything from the witty, sarcastic dialogue to the fleshed-out characters work together. Does it improve on the original? No, the original is still the best. However, it does make a wonderful companion piece. So if you want to have a double feature, go ahead and watch them both. Also, if you're not satisfied with the 'happy ending', stay through the end credits!",9,0,1,19 June 2013
Alien: Resurrection," She's BACK!!!
","If any of you haven't seen ALIEN 3, I'm sorry. In order to review this movie, I have to give away the ending. At the end of that fiasco, Ripley killed herself having discovered she's carrying an alien inside her. Flash forward 200 years and now scientists have resurrected her through cloning, in order to extract the alien embryo she's carrying. The new Ripley is even tougher than before, since some of the alien's DNA mixed with hers. She now has superhuman abilities and can sense when aliens are nearby. A group of mercenaries (headed by Wynona Rider) invade the scientific research ship, which results in the aliens being released. Where ALIEN 3 was dark, dank and depressing, this one is brightly lit and played, at times, for laughs. There's a sense of wonder and excitement at some of the new alien breeds on display here. Performances are, on the whole, good. And the movie's ending brings the series to a satisfying conclusion. While not anywhere near as good as ALIEN or ALIENS, this film is loads better than the appalling ALIEN 3. Now, let's hope the studio allows the series to rest on its laurels.",7,3,4,18 December 2013
World War Z," Pretty Exciting, But Stick To The Book!
","Having read Max Brook's wonderful book, I was thrilled when they announced a forthcoming movie. After seeing the trailer, I had my doubts. The book was separated into sections, chronicling how people around the world survived the zombie epidemic. And Max mercifully had the zombies be Romero's slow-moving, flesh-eating ones. In the movie, they are extremely fast, smart and do many unzombie-like things like incredible leaps, bashing through windows with their heads, etc. A few of the stories do make it into the movie. The most notable, for anyone who's seen the trailers, is the wall in Israel. But that's where the similarities end. In the movie, Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN operative. He's driving his family to work and school when they're stuck in a traffic jam in Philadelphia. A building in the distance explodes and people start running away from zombies. The rest of the film follows Gerry and his family as he re-joins the UN and flies around the world, trying to figure out a cure for the epidemic. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. There are a few places where you're guaranteed to jump with fright, and the finale is freaky! My biggest problem is that they took what was an excellent book and watered it down to fit a 2-hour time slot. I'd much rather them leave the story like it was, and have it be a TV mini-series, like THE WALKING DEAD. You could definitely get a good three seasons at least, just following the book's style. Overall though, WWZ is pretty exciting with smart characters and a gripping story. Just don't go into it, if you've read the book, expecting it to be the same!",8,0,4,18 July 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Funny Little Break-Up Movie
","The Apatow clan have made a name for themselves over the past decade or so. Since first appearing on the big screen with THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, the clan has proved they can make more-than-the-usual gross-out movie and populate it with realistic, well-rounded characters. The plots for most, if not all, their movies involve characters (normally slacker types) who drink, get high, date, and all-too-easily wind up making mistakes that have consequences. And while the humor tends toward the gross-out, the clan likes to portray the human body and it's functions in a matter-of-fact way.Anyway, on to FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. For anyone who's ever had someone break up with them, only to subsequently see them everywhere, here's a film for you. Personally I know, I've been there. Peter (played by the always quirky Jason Segal) has been dating Sarah Marshall, a famous TV star, that is of course until she surprises him one afternoon and breaks up with him. Peter is devastated and forlorn. So, on the advice from his half-brother (played by the equally quirky Bill Hader) Peter takes a vacation. Bound for Hawaii. Unfortunately, Sarah (Kristen Bell) is also vacationing there with her new boyfriend, a controversial rock star played by Russell Brand. Caught in the middle of all this is Rachel (Mila Kunis) who likes Peter and may be the one to help him rebound from the heartbreak. And that's the main story in a nutshell. There are so many funny and poignant little moments that I wouldn't think of revealing any. A movie like this is meant to be savored. Speaking personally, I also liked the sub-story involving the newlyweds. Their story alone could make for an interesting film. Granted, there's some very graphic nudity and a lot of sexual content, but deal with it! Because for once here's a break-up movie with something to say.",9,0,2,30 December 2011
The Hunger Games," The Girl On Fire!
","Shortly after this movie came out, a lot of viewers wondered if Suzanne Collins was inspired by a Japanese flick called BATTLE ROYALE. Having viewed both, I can see where one might've inspired the other. But did Collins deliberately steal from the earlier work? We may never know. So, allow me to review this film on its own merits. The story: Some time in the future, America has become a dictatorship now called Pan-Am. Parts of the country are broken into 12 districts. Once a year, two children (from ages 11-17) are chosen from each district to participate in a death match called THE HUNGER GAMES. Only one can emerge victorious. In District 12, that honor (if you want to call it that) falls to Peeta and Katniss. Though the human drama takes up much of the first hour, the main story takes over when they start the game. While much of the book's violence has been toned down to ensure a PG-13 rating, it's still disturbing to watch teens killing each other (sometimes with sadistic glee.) Jennifer Lawrence's wonderful performance as Katniss placed her on the map as a talented and rising star. Everyone gives their role 110%, which includes Donald Sutherland as the icy President Snow and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, District 12's mentor. Forgiving some laughable CGI effects late in the film, this movie is excellent all around and I would recommend watching this on a double-bill with BATTLE ROYALE. Both are equally strong! Also, keep an eye out for CATCHING FIRE, now in theatres!!!",9,0,3,3 December 2013
Shaun of the Dead," You Got Red On You!!!
","Okay, what if you woke up one day and discovered that everything was pretty much the same except... now there are flesh-crazed zombies out there, trying to eat you? What would you do? Well for Shaun (Simon Pegg), he plans to: 1) Save his girlfriend, Liz; 2) Save his mum, Barbara; 3) Go to his favorite pub, The Winchester; and 4) wait for everything to blow over. However, things don't go as planned, because... watch the show. This movie almost single-handedly launched Simon Pegg's career, and justifiably so. In SHAUN OF THE DEAD, there's a plethora of memorable one-liners, quirky characters, and (yes, gentle bloodthirsty viewer) a healthy smattering of bloody zombie action. Though the emphasis is more on laughs than chills, this Zomedy (or ZomCom) will leave you rolling in the aisles!",10,3,7,5 June 2015
127 Hours," Between a Rock and a Hard Place
","The first thing I have to mention, and I'm certainly not the first, is the incredible performance by James Franco. His role as Aron is gut-wrenching and charged with emotion. The various hallucinations and struggles he goes through more than convinced me that the real Aron went through the same torment. Which brings up a good question. What does it take for James Franco to get an Oscar? I asked the same thing of Mark Wahlberg in THE FIGHTER. I know there can only be one Best Actor, but WHAT. DOES. IT. TAKE? Both are talented, who infuse their roles with convincing emotions. When both actors are going through struggles, you feel it and cheer them on when they succeed. And both have played roles that are so natural and down-to-earth (with the exception of Max Payne in Wahlberg's case, but let's forgive him for that.) Second, the cinematography is astounding. Considering that most of the running time takes place with Aron trapped in the crevice, Danny Boyle and his team are at it again! Filming their scenes in dozens of new and creative ways. The best scenes I felt were the hallucinations. They were spot-on without feeling staged or fakey. There is one in particular that makes you think the movie's over, until you realize along with Aron that it's all a fantasy. Of late, I've been really impressed with Danny Boyle's work. TRAINSPOTTING was a force to be reckoned with, 28 DAYS LATER redefined the zombie genre, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE was an inspiring journey into a part of India that we rarely see outside of Indian cinema, and now 127 HOURS has us diving into the world of extreme sports (along with the perils of living life on the edge.) I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inspiring story, with a word of caution if you're squeamish about realistic gore effects.",10,0,4,13 April 2011
Terminator Salvation," I'll Be Back... Now in the Future!!!
","The first three TERMINATOR movies were all time-traveling capers in their respective eras of 1984, 1997, and 2003. Here, finally, in TERMINATOR SALVATION, we get to see the war between man and machine in the dusty post-apocalyptic year of 2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is a soldier in the human resistance movement. Not yet the leader, he inevitably takes it upon himself to track down a very young Kyle Reese (the late great Anton Yelchin), who will one day turn out to be his father. Meanwhile, a mysterious man (Sam Worthington) wakes up in an underground facility that the resistance fighters come across. Traveling through the barren wasteland, he soon learns of his origins and purpose. Admittedly, the plot is virtually a shoestring, keeping the events loosely tied together. But that's fine, because the real strong points are the spectacular and epic battles on display here. And yes, fans of the series, Arnold Schwarzenegger DOES make an appearance in this film. While some have felt that this movie was a let-down, I disagree. In fact, this is the movie that TERMINATOR 3 should've been!",9,5,7,9 June 2015
The Terminator," I'll Be Back!
","Over the years, James Cameron has made quite a name for himself. Especially in terms of 'sci-fi' and 'action/ adventure' movies. But long before TITANIC, AVATAR, and ALIENS, he came up with this original idea. In the not-too-distant future (now anyway), a nuclear war has taken place between the world superpowers. In the wake of the fallout, homicidal machines have risen up; attempting to exterminate the human race. In a desperate effort, the machines have built a time machine and sent a nearly-indestructible cyborg assassin, The Terminator (played icily by Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance. To protect her, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) a future soldier is sent back through time as well. Combining the best parts of horror, sci-fi, action, and crime drama, James Cameron keeps the movie going at a blistering pace without sacrificing the compelling (and necessary) human story. In many ways, this film was (and still is) a classic from the 80's. Now with TERMINATOR GENISYS due out in the theaters this summer, maybe it's time you go back in time and see how the series all began!",10,1,1,9 June 2015
Alien," In Space...
","Space may still be the final frontier, but after seeing ALIEN, one can't help but reconsider discovering it. Far into the future, and far out into the reaches of deep space, workers on-board the NOSTROMO, a mining ship, are wakened out of cryogenic sleep because the ship's sensors have picked up a supposed SOS from a nearby planet. Amid the crew's bickering and complaints about 'fair wages,' they decide to investigate. Upon setting down on the environmentally-torn planet, their ship sustains damage that requires them to stay put until repairs can be made. So a small team, headed by Kane (played by John Hurt) choose to explore the source of the SOS. And what they find is incredible, the remains of a downed spacecraft. Venturing inside, they find evidence of the ship's inhabitants, in particular a fossilized corpse in a chair with a gaping hole in its chest. Still going further into the ship, they find the hold full of what appear to be eggs. One opens up and something jumps out, attaching itself to Kane's face. Against the better judgment of Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) the team is let back on-board the ship. And I won't tell you anymore, except that an alien is let loose on-board that proceeds to kill the crew. For those of you unfamiliar with ALIEN, I won't reveal one of the greatest and most graphic special effects in sci-fi history. Only to say, you'll never think of enjoying a relaxing meal around the dinner table quite the same way again. The film works so well because it's basically a haunted house set in deep space. As one by one, the various characters are forced to investigate darkened corridors, air shafts, the occasional weird noises and so forth. Everything from the lighting, use of shadows and darkness, to the unsettling sounds of the ship itself, lend to the mounting tension. So watch this and be prepared to scream. But if you're in space, don't expect anyone to hear you!",10,1,3,6 June 2013
Predator," Get To The Chopper!
","To best describe PREDATOR, think ALIEN in the Amazon. But please don't go thinking this is merely a knock-off. For once, the filmmakers took the same basic concept and ran in a completely new direction. Somewhere in Central America, Arnold Schwarzenegger heads up a team of bad-ass soldiers, who have been sent in to rescue VIPs from a downed airplane. For the first 30 minutes or so, we get treated to some of the coolest action scenes as they attempt to complete their mission. Unfortunately, all is not well. For the only survivor of the crash is a frightened woman, who knows a lot more than she admits. On their way back to their rendezvous point, the team finds themselves being hunted by... something. And that's where the movie shifts from Rambo-style action to white-knuckle horror, as one by one the soldiers are pursued and dispatched in a variety of creative ways. While almost as good as ALIEN or ALIENS, some of the performances are a little uneven. A few characters stupidly put themselves in danger. But the finale is all worth it as Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Predator square off against each other in a sinister game of cat and mouse. So cover yourself in mud and get ready to be taken on a thrill-ride!",8,0,1,18 December 2013
28 Weeks Later," It's All the Rage... Again!!!
","With the success of 28 DAYS LATER, it was almost inevitable that a sequel (or two, maybe?) would follow. In the opening scene, my personal favorite, we're introduced to a group of survivors. They have taken refuge in a boarded-up house when a large horde of Infected attack. With terrifying swiftness, the survivors are cut down or turned. And in the end, only one man remains- guilt-ridden and running for his life. From there, the story picks up 28 weeks after the first person got infected. Now, NATO and the US Army have moved back into London to rebuild. However, it soon becomes evident that all is not well. For you see, the Army scientists learn that certain persons can act as carriers of the Rage virus without turning into zombies. And through a simple affectionate kiss, the plague begins again. Now survivors must flee as the Army resorts to more drastic measures to contain the epidemic. In this film, we get less of the existential philosophies of the first as the filmmakers focus more on extremely graphic, pulse-pounding effects and scenes. While this is a fairly good sequel, it's not as good as the original. However, I still recommend it and hopefully wait for the much-anticipated 28 MONTHS LATER... please Oh Please OH PLEASE?!?!?!",8,0,0,26 October 2011
The Thing," Because It's Different, Because It's From Outer Space
","If the tag-line for ALIEN was 'In space no one can hear you scream', then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: 'In Antarctica, no one can hear you scream.' Originally, The Thing started life as a novella called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien. Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems... Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer, there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!",10,6,11,17 December 2013
Hugo," Georges Melies Lives!!!
","If I were to describe this film in one word it would be: beautiful. For once, here is a movie that fills you with a sense of child-like wonder and awe. The cinematography is simply brilliant and the actors are spot-on in their roles.Now the story: A little boy by the name of Hugo lives in a train station in Paris. During the day, he sneaks around and repairs the clocks. However when he's not working, Hugo spends his days stealing from an elderly toymaker and using the parts to put together an automaton. After being caught by the toymaker, Hugo is forced to work fixing his toys. Eventually, He finds a friend in the toymaker's grand-daughter, Isabelle, and together they set out for a series of adventures. And discover the toymaker's history. For you see, the toymaker is none other than Georges Melies, an early filmmaking pioneer. And from that point on, I won't tell the rest.You simply must see the movie to appreciate and enjoy its rich story and wonderful characters. Speaking personally, I loved learning about Melies in college, and was more than thrilled when this movie came out. This justifiably won quite a few Academy Awards. So run out and rent it now for a night of adventure and wonder!",10,3,6,13 March 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I'll Be Back... Three!!!
","THE TERMINATOR was a monumental classic from the 80's, neatly blending sci-fi, action, and horror. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was an Oscar-winner from the 90's, featuring one of the coolest movie villains in the T-1000. Next in the series is TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. In this one, a female Terminator called the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back to eliminate all the future leaders of the human resistance. Yet again, another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes back to stop her from killing John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) while getting them to safety before Judgment Day. However... Where the first two films felt fresh and original, this one feels a little more run-of-the-mill. There's more of a comedic wit in this one than in the previous two. But still, it feels like we've seen it all before. It's not as bad as some cyborg sequels (*clears throat* ROBOCOP 3), but it's far from anyone's brightest moment. Followed by the excellent and pulse-pounding TERMINATOR SALVATION.",6,0,0,9 June 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I'll Be Back... Two!!!
","In 2029, the battle rages on between killer machines and human resistance fighters. In a plot to eliminate John Connor, leader of the rebellion, the machines sent a Terminator back to 1984 to eliminate his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). When that failed, the machines sent one more. This one about thirteen years later, to eliminate John himself while still a child. This time around, the resistance chose to send another protector: a re-programmed Terminator T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Flashback to '97 (though filmed in '91), John Connor (Edward Furlong) is a disrespectful, foul-mouthed, little punk. As for Sarah, gone is the mousy woman from the first film. She's now a hard-as-nails survivalist. Because she tried to blow up a computer company, she got put into a mental institution. With steely determination, the new Terminator, T-1000 (Robert Patrick), tracks down and attempts to kill them both. But the T-800 proves quite a worthy defender! Building upon the original movie, Terminator 2 goes further into the back story of how Judgment Day came around. As well as the scientists responsible for the fateful events. The relationship between the three central characters is at turns touching and even heartbreaking. Personally, I got a little tired of John's wise-ass attitude after a while. And perhaps Sarah's tough persona was a little too violent and unstable at times. But the movie does have some thought-provoking comments to make on technology gone awry, and man's inevitable slide into self-destruction. Visual effects have never been put to better use, especially in regards to the T-1000, who has the ability to morph itself into virtually anyone. My only real complaint is with the re-issued special edition that adds about thirty minutes of footage back in. Some of the extra stuff seems unnecessary. But apart from that, this film is pitch-perfect. Representing the best that sci-fi/ action has to offer!",9,0,0,9 June 2015
Aliens," Get Away From Her You...
","In 1979, Ridley Scott's ALIEN invaded the theaters, scaring the pants off of everyone with a highly lethal extraterrestrial. In 1986, James Cameron made this sequel. And what a sequel it is! ALIENS may, in fact, be the best sequel ever! For 57 years, lone survivor Ripley (Weaver) has been floating out in space. Shortly after being rescued, she's asked to go back to the planet where the alien ship was discovered in the first movie. In the 57 years, colonists have settled on the planet and recently went missing. A team of space marines tag along to investigate the disappearance. What they find is truly terrifying! Building upon the original movie's premise, Cameron turns it into an action thriller, with a healthy dose of chills, tough guy theatrics and instantly-quotable one-liners. Ripley's character has been strengthened, now tough as nails and bad-ass. Late in the film, her fight with The Queen is a memorable cinematic battle. Overall, the movies is excellent. My only complaint is with the re-issued SPECIAL EDITION of the film, in which 15 additional minutes were added back in. The extra footage included several unnecessary exposition scenes (one of which introduces Newt way too early). To that version, I give only 9 stars. As for the original cut, it's a classic that deserves 10 stars!",10,1,2,17 December 2013
Alien vs. Predator," Where Are the Bloody Aliens??!!
","Man, did they go wrong with this one! Let me count the ways: 1) It's set in the frozen land of Antarctica (like the much better THE THING). 2) Given a stellar cast, why were there no interesting characters? Come on, they couldn't even give Lance Hendrickson a decent role?! 3) Where are the bloody aliens? We go through half the movie before any aliens or predators show up. And when they do show up, their battle is less-than-stellar. Hardly fitting for two races of mortal enemies. 4) There's not one bit of interesting dialogue, no scares, or even thrilling action sequences. Trust me, you'll be bored to tears within the first ten minutes. 5) The special effects leave much to be desired. 6) Don't waste your time, skip over this one and hunt down AVP: REQUIEM.",1,0,2,18 December 2013
28 Days Later...," It's All The Rage!!!
","I have been a fan of Danny Boyle's work for a number of years now. He always finds a way of merging intuitive camera-work with a compelling story. When I learned he made a zombie movie, how could I turn it down? At first, when I started watching 28 DAYS LATER, I thought it was going to be one more standard-issue zombie film. But right after the chilling opening scene, I was joyously thrilled and confounded by his new breed of zombies. Though not entirely original, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD beat Boyle to it some 15 years earlier, his movie definitely redefined our old notion of the slow-moving, flesh-crazed, mainly-stupid zombie. Instead, we're presented with living humans infected by Rage, a rabies-like virus, that causes them to turn murderous. So onwards they come, running and howling like banshees. Actually, the zombies are kept to a minimum as instead we witness the horror and drama unfold as a handful of non-infected persons learn to survive in a post-apocalyptic London. And along the way, the film has some poignant existential messages to leave with us. To be certain, the film is chilling and uncomfortably realistic. In fact if there were some sort of real zombie epidemic, a Rage-type virus would probably be the culprit. But aside from that, look at what this film managed to do. It inspired a whole slew of fast-moving zombie movies including DAWN OF THE DEAD (the remake), REC, QUARANTINE (its American remake), BERLIN ZOMBIE (AKA: RAMMBOCK), and the upcoming WORLD WAR Z, to name a few. So please gentle viewer, if you haven't already, put this on your must-see list!!!",9,0,1,26 October 2011
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," We Have A T-Rex 2!!
","JURASSIC PARK is a sci-fi/action classic directed by the maestro Steven Spielberg himself. After it became such a hit, sequels were pretty much a given. THE LOST WORLD (AKA: THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK) takes place some time after the events of the first film. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is perplexed to discover from John Hammond (Richard Attenborough, looking old and frail) that they had worked on a second Jurassic Park. What's even more perplexing is that his old girlfriend Sarah Harding (the always delightful Julianne Moore) has gone to the island to study the new breeds of dinosaurs. Going along as part of a research/ rescue team, Ian hates to have his chaos theory proved right... again! Second time around, there's less of the sense of wonder that the first film inspired when we see the dinosaurs. Now, they've been turned more into just movie monsters that stomp around and eat the disposable actors. Ignoring the annoying sub-plot involving the capture of a baby T-Rex and his angry parents, the film is still worthwhile. Followed by the completely forgettable JURASSIC PARK 3!",8,12,16,16 June 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Third TIME's a Charm!!!
","(Spoiler Alert!) At the end of PART II, Marty's trapped back in 1955. Doc is trapped back in 1885. Young Doc is frantic and confused that Marty is still in the past. Through a letter, older Doc sends word to Marty about where to find and how to repair the time machine. Upon learning that older Doc is destined to die at the hands of a gunman, Marty decides to take one last trip in the Delorean. FLASH! In 1885, he comes across his relatives (but hides that fact by calling himself Clint Eastwood), runs a-foul of some gunmen led by Mad Dog Tannen, and eventually tracks down Doc. Now, they have to find a way back to 1985. But... There's a lot of story crammed into this one. Almost rivaling the complex plot of PART II. In this one, the focus is more on Doc as the main character. Though he's trying hard to leave the past alone, he falls in love with Clara, a schoolmarm. Which is tearing him apart: Should he stay or should he go? (Why doesn't he just bring Clara along?) We also get to see some of his ingenious inventions, including a gigantic fridge. Some viewers have come to consider this the weakest entry, but I disagree. Of the entire series, this one focuses most on the relationship between the various characters. It's a film with heart. And it has the coolest finale of all! So what are you waiting for? YEE-HAW, GO AND SEE IT!!!",9,7,8,24 November 2014
The Evil Dead," Don't Shut It Off!!!
","If one were to think of Sam Raimi the director, what springs to mind? Perhaps the SPIDERMAN movies? Maybe DARKMAN? Most assuredly ARMY OF DARKNESS (the third movie in the EVIL DEAD series!) Back in '80 and into the winter of '81, Raimi along with his pals Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell, set out to make a student film that would eventually cross over into their first feature. And what a doozy! Borrowing story elements from some notable Italian horror, SUSPIRIA for one, as well as popular American horror, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE EXORCIST spring to mind, the young filmmakers then proceed to tell their own twisted tale. Five college students spend the weekend at an old dilapidated cabin, only to discover an ancient book of spells called the Necromonicon and a tape recording of the incantations. Unfortunately, the tape recording awakens some very angry demons who then proceed to possess four of the students, soon leaving Bruce Campbell as the iconic Ash the only survivor. And if that wasn't bad enough everything in the forest, from the trees to the fog and wind, seems to have a mind of its own. Worse still, the only way for Ash to defeat the demons is to dismember each one of his friends. Tons of low budget gore, an unhinged plot and some very wicked special effects are what makes this movie shine. It's guaranteed to shock, appall, and terrify you. So gather together your brood of friends, unless you dare to watch it alone. Either way, the best way to watch it is with the lights turned down and the volume turned up! Enjoy some bloody good fun!!!",8,1,2,13 October 2011
Jurassic World," Yes, we've STILL Got a T-Rex!!!
","Finally, at long last, we have a worthy sequel to the Jurassic Park series! 22 years have passed since the events of the first film. The island of dinosaurs has continued thriving in a newer, bigger, better park called Jurassic World. The park's geneticists have made breakthroughs including gene-splicing and hybrid engineering. They've recently created a new attraction, a cross-bred carnivore called the Indominus Rex. However, the park's owners have been experiencing problems with the new dinosaur and it's paddock. One thing leads to another, and before you know it, the I-Rex escapes wreaking havoc on the tasty wildlife and people. In the lead is Chris Pratt as former-Navy turned game warden. He's completely awesome and shows that real men still wear mustaches! Beside him for most of the film is Clare (Bryce Dallas Howard) picking up the reigns from where John Hammond left off. Clare's two nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) also happen to be in the park when the rampage begins. The series has always had good solid acting, even if the characters in 2 and 3 were (annoying, paper thin, crunchable, etc.) This time around, the filmmakers wisely avoided having any of those types.So now, everyone's on a race to stop the I-Rex, save the visitors, and rescue Jurassic World from permanent foreclosure! As I already stated, this is a worthy sequel. From the writing to the cinematography to the music and characterizations, everything works beautifully. You'll be at turns thrilled, chilled, saddened, and have your heart warmed again! Welcome back to the park!!!",10,7,10,20 June 2016
The Hangover Part II," One Hell of a Bachelor Party!
","Having missed out on the first HANGOVER movie, I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, though I had a few notions: non-stop zaniness, as well as raunchy and potentially dangerous situations. It's a tried-and-true formula that has been with us since the early days of cinema. While you sometimes get horrible variations (the countless American PIE off-shoots come to mind) this time, it works! Once again, we follow the gang of drunken idiots on the verge of a wedding, who wake up and have to piece together what happened the previous night. Only this time, instead of Las Vegas, it's Bangkok. Great scenery by the way. You really get a sense of place, as we visit dingy night clubs, bars, and a strip club that's not quite what it seems. If you don't mind raunchy guy humor, this movie is your cup of tea!",8,0,4,1 June 2011
Saw," I Want To Play A Game!
","Every decade, the horror genre becomes re-defined. In the 50s, it was Universal with their giant bugs. In the 60s, it was Alfred Hitchcock with PSYCHO and then George Romero with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The 70s saw a dramatic spike in wild and woolly films, like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, HALLOWEEN, and countless others. The 80s had their run of 'dead-teen' flicks. Followed closely in the 90s by the 'copycat killers', like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Right before the start of the millennium, along came THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. While I personally didn't find it as scary as they made it out to be, it certainly paved the way for a sub-genre of 'shaky-cam horror', like PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES and REC. Finally, in the mix, came what could best be described as 'puzzle bloodbaths'. And that's when SAW came into being. In the world of film, the simplest way to make a movie is take a camera, two actors, and put them in a room for 90 minutes or so. And that's pretty much what SAW is.The story: Adam, a photographer, and Lawrence, a doctor, wake up in a dark room chained at opposite ends. Through a series of harrowing flashbacks, they try to piece together how they ended up trapped. It turns out there's a devious killer on the loose, nicknamed 'Jigsaw'. See, he likes to put people into elaborate traps and then the victims have to do increasingly-horrendous things to be set free. The occasional deviation outside of the room, focusing on other characters, is a little distracting and unnecessary. Because both actors inside the room give such authentic and believable performances. I particularly liked Cary Elwes. Apart from that, fellow blood fiends will not be disappointed in the special effects department. Let me just say that SAW lives up to its name. But please, gentle maniacal viewer, don't bother with any of the sequels. They're just blood messes without any of the finesse of the original!",9,1,2,20 August 2014
The Fly," Along Came A Fly...
","In the movie world, science always winds up running amok. Even if the scientists' intentions are good, something inevitably goes wrong. THE FLY started life as a story written George Langelaan for the June 1957 issue of Playboy. In '58, it was made into an exceptionally creepy movie starring David Hedison and Vincent Price. Then in '86, the studios decided to remake it. With David Cronenberg directing and Jeff Goldblum starring in it, you know you're in for quite a thrill ride! Jeff Goldblum plays quirky inventor Seth Brundle. At the start of the film, he's trying to woo Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis in her best role) back to his laboratory. Once there, he unveils his life's work: a teleportation device. So far, he's had success teleporting inanimate objects. But soon, he's hoping to start trying living beings. But not all is as it seems, because Veronica is a reporter. At one time, she and her editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) had a fling. Early on, it's clear he's somewhat obsessive about her. And he decides to get back at her by having her assigned to a full expose on Brundle's experiments. For Veronica and Seth, what starts as cold, detached fascination turns into a budding romance. But once a determined scientist, always a determined scientist. After a few successful tests with a baboon and a steak, Seth decides it's time to try the experiment himself. But along came a fly and... For a horror film, there are some really disturbing topics that are explored here. And not wanting to reveal too much of the story, let me just say you won't be disappointed. The special make-up and effects are incredible and notably drippy (quite deserving of the Oscar they received). Everything else about the movie is pitch-perfect, too. This is easily one of the best horror films ever made. Followed by a lamentable sequel three years later, featuring an excellent performance by Eric Stoltz.",9,1,2,12 May 2015
Zombieland," Zombie Kill Of The Week!
","What SHAUN OF THE DEAD did for the UK, ZOMBIELAND did for the US. The story: A mysterious virus (reminiscent of mad cow disease) has swept America, turning people into bloodthirsty 'mad zombies'. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has a list of rules that he follows to a tee in order to survive. However, his loner existence is soon shaken up when he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson in his best, laidback, nonchalant role). Teaming up, the duo exchange witty banter while looking for the one thing post-apocalyptic society can't live without: Twinkies. But their plans are further complicated by sisters, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and Wichita (Emma Stone). Late in the film, there's a memorable cameo by a 'famous comedy actor', but I won't reveal who it is... Just in case you're one of the few people who hasn't heard the secret already! Overall, this popular zomedy (or zom-com) has a healthy dose of chuckles, quotable zingers, funny and fresh characters, as well as the requisite of gory zombie violence. So sit back, relax, and have a bloody good time!",10,1,3,5 June 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," It Certainly Is!!!
","Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, loved by critics and viewers alike. Well, most. So much has been said that praises this heart-warming tale of George Bailey that I won't bother going over the same stuff. What I will talk about instead is the other side of the film. While most see it as a holiday movie, at the core is a dark and powerful story. George has spent all of his life wanting to go out into the world, go to college, do amazing stuff, travel the globe, and whatnot. However, every chance he gets, he's faced with a moral dilemma: Do the right thing, or go his own way. Inevitably, George winds up doing the right thing, which almost always conflicts with what he really wants to do. As the years roll by, we see his life develop in unexpected ways. At the heart, George is a terrific guy who has chosen to put others before himself. He's made a ton of sacrifices, but in ways he's taken his life for granted. And on one fateful Christmas day, a 'monetary' bomb is dropped into the midst of his life that totally throws him off. Distressed and hurting, George feels there is no way out but to end his life. And that's where the Almighty steps in and sends down help in the form of a kindly, rotund angel named Clarence. Ultimately, what Clarence grants to George is the opportunity to see what life would've been like without him. And this is the where the movie takes its darkest turn. We see that every person's life, even the town of Bedford Falls itself, has been corrupted by the absence of George. And after George asks to live again, we begin to understand that despite whatever trouble is coming for him, it's better to face it alive. Some have complained that the bad guy, Mr. Potter, doesn't get his comeuppance in the end. But I say, Mr. Potter will one day get his own tale, in the form of 'A Christmas Carol.' Until then, George learns what life really means: No matter the turmoils, no matter whether you're rich or poor, life is the richest reward you can be given. And that is what makes IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE such a classic, because anybody who lives long enough must face the reality of both the good and the bad in their own lives. When they sing Auld Lang Syne at the end, it does mark a new year. It's the new year for George Bailey, and anyone else who's faced similar dilemmas in life. Plus, if ever there was a mainstream (secular) movie to convince us that there is a God and angels that watch over us, this is the movie to do it. So, keep ringing those bells every Christmas!",10,2,4,26 April 2011
Jersey Boys," Love the Four Seasons and Clint Eastwood, But...
","The Four Seasons made a name for themselves in the 60s with hits such as 'Sherry', 'Big Girls Don't Cry' and 'Walk Like A Man'. Honestly, who can resist the lovely voice of Frankie Valli? Their music was pleasant to listen and dance to. Along the way, an award-winning play was made that chronicled the lives of the band members, both as musicians and as friends. Having never seen the play, I can't honestly say if the movie's the same. But I have to ask: Has anyone else grown tired of the tedious drama that goes into biopics like this? Maybe it's all true. And maybe I'm being unfair. But come on, not EVERY single musician is mixed up in sex, drugs, or crime. I know the work wouldn't be nearly as exciting or interesting without all the drama, but after a while, it just starts to feel contrived and fake. Which ultimately begs the question: How much of what we see is anywhere close to the truth? For instance, were the Four Seasons REALLY mixed up in the mob? Or is that just what we've come to expect every young Italian from New Jersey to do? Nitpicking aside, however, the film is visually impressive, the acting is spot-on, and Clint Eastwood is once again an excellent director. So, take it or leave it.",5,1,2,19 November 2014
Love Actually," Sprawling Rom-Com
","I admit, even though I'm a die-hard action/ horror/ scifi fan, there's also a little part of me that loves the occasional romantic comedy (or rom-com as it's known in the movie world.) While admittedly most rom-coms are pretty formulaic, every once in a while one will come along that tackles romance in a unique way. Amazingly two of my personal favorites share several things in common: both are set at Christmas time (so they also count as Christmas movies), both feature a good number of British actors, and they portray most (if not all) their characters in a realistic light. The first is THE HOLIDAY, featuring a charming cast that includes Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Eli Wallach, and a very nuanced Jack Black. The second is this film, which quickly becomes a roster featuring all the talented, and uprising, stars in London. Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Andrew Lincoln (THE WALKING DEAD's Rick Grimes) are just some of the noteworthy roles. The whole cast gives 110 percent. The movie covers a multitude of stories also, I believe somewhere around a dozen. And it shows how all of these seemingly random people are connected. All the stories explore certain aspects of relationships: between parents and children, siblings, married couples, friends, co-workers, etc. The most wonderful parts are quiet little poignant moments that appear throughout the film. For instance in most rom-coms, a guy proclaims his love for a woman who's with someone else. As he's walking away, the woman runs after him and kisses him. Followed by a short little pause as the guy is conflicted. Then they kiss a second, longer time before the music swells and the scene fades. In LOVE ACTUALLY, when this same situation arises, the two kiss for one tender moment before the woman walks back inside the apartment. And the guy walks away, happily determined, saying 'Enough.' At another point, Emma Thompson's character excuses herself from her family's Christmas celebration and ducks into her bedroom where she silently cries to Joni Mitchell. A few minutes later, she composes herself and rejoins her family, with a brave smile on her face. Moments like that happen in real life, and that's what is so great about the film. Clearly the makers were interested in capturing real human interaction, feelings and emotion, even in the most awkward situations. With this film, you will laugh and cry and become teary-eyed. And you'll leave the movie feeling a sense of hope and maybe even love as you discover that there are other flawed, hurting, lonely, caring, passionate, and loving people in the world. So enjoy this heartwarming tale!",9,1,3,14 February 2012
A Hard Day's Night," No, I'm a Mocker!
","What's not to like about this film?! The slim plot: The Beatles are heading towards an upcoming televised event, on which they'll perform. But everywhere they go, they have to run from millions of adoring, screaming fans. Once in a while, they'll get into a light-hearted scrape. It's a slightly fictitious account of the Beatles' early years. You'll laugh as you watch them running and gallivanting all over the place. And you get treated to many of their hit songs! Like I said, what's not to like?! Recently, Criterion released a version of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. And it's, once again, the best out there. The special features are just as good with never-before-seen outtakes as well as insightful interviews with the musicians and filmmakers. The whole production was clearly an energetic labor of love for all involved and it shows!",10,0,0,13 August 2014
Jaws," Out Of The Water!!!
","One of the most iconic horror/ adventure films began life as a book written by shark expert Peter Benchley. Based loosely off a real-life incident that happened in New Jersey, it scared readers out of the water. While some of the book's content left much to be desired, along came Universal Studios. And a young director by the name of Steven Spielberg was given the chance to make the book into a summer fright film. The rest is cinematic history. By now, we all know the story, so here's the overview: A monstrously-large great white shark has come into the waters off Amity Island, feasting upon swimmers. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) along with shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and salty fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) are tasked with hunting down and killing the shark. Everything about this movie works wonderfully from the beautiful cinematography to the fast-paced editing and the legendary Jaws theme. Forgiving some fake-looking shark effects, the film will at turns chill you and thrill you. The finale is particularly nerve-racking. Watch it if you dare, even though it might keep you out of the water for a while!",10,2,7,3 July 2014
Halloween," Creme De La Creme of Slashers!!!
","In 1978, a young filmmaker named John Carpenter set out to make a chilling horror movie about some babysitters being terrified by a masked killer. From this one film spawned a whole generation of what came to be known as the slasher/ dead teen flick. While the countless slashers to follow would borrow or blatantly steal from it, none come close to its greatness. Every Halloween, I make sure to set time aside to once again view HALLOWEEN. What's not to like about it? You have a simple creepy premise: Years ago a young boy murders his sister and now as an adult escapes from a mental hospital to kill again. You have a stellar cast, including the young Jamie Lee Curtis as heroine Laurie Strode and horror great Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis. John Carpenter and his crew wisely borrowed techniques used in Italian horror, like electronic synth music, to ramp up the tension. Of particular merit, I'd like to mention the art direction, lighting and cinematography. Using a mixture of varying amounts of light and shadow, the filmmakers wisely allow the viewer's imagination to run wild. Sometimes you'll think you see things hidden in the shadows and nothing's there, and vice versa. When the deaths come, they are usually swift and filmed in partial shadow/light also. If ever a movie embodied the spirit of Halloween, it would be this one. So I highly recommend this for either group viewing or, if you dare, to watch it solo. Just be prepared to be thrilled by the creme de la creme of slashers!!!",10,1,2,15 September 2011
Back to the Future Part II," Second TIME's A Charm (Get It?!)
","Okay, so at the end of the first film (spoiler alert!) Doc Brown, Marty and Jennifer fly off in the time machine. Going to a place where 'we don't need roads!' FLASH! Enter Part II: The date is October 21st, 2015. And the three time travelers find themselves on a highway in the sky (a skyway). Cars are flying by at a dangerous clip. And it's pouring rain. (A little nod to Blade Runner, maybe?) Landing in Hill Valley of the future, Doc and Marty go about saving his son from becoming involved in a robbery attempt. Though things get complicated, the guys manage to succeed. But a very old Biff discovers their secret and goes back to some time in the past to change his own future. The movie deftly handles the parallels in the timeline. In this one, we get: 2015, 1985, 1985 A, and finally 1955. And it's in '55 that the film really takes off. Because it just so happens to be the same night that Marty goes back to 1985. So both Marty and Doc have to be careful about running into their other selves. But then... Just watch it, you won't be disappointed! While some think that the movie's too bleak, I think it shows the dark side of time travel and what happens when technology is used for evil or selfish purposes. The ending leaves you hanging and eagerly anticipating Part III. As a side note, I'd like to also warn both Universal Studios and Mattel: October 21st, 2015 is coming around quickly, guys. And some of us are looking forward to hoverboards!",8,2,3,24 November 2014
Carrie," Carrie, The Original Teenage Witch
","Adolescence, that most tormenting of times for young and old alike! It's a time of great and uncomfortable change. We begin to learn more about our bodies and minds than we probably ever wanted to know. It's a time plagued with zits, mood swings, and awkwardness. Both the Stephen King book and movie capture adolescence in all its mystery. The movie opens with what appears to be every high school guy's fantasy, then quickly turns to shock (and perhaps even empathy) as we're introduced to Carrie. Carrie is the most unpopular girl in high school, picked on by the jocks and cheerleaders, made fun of by everyone. With that constant bombardment at school, you'd think Carrie would find solace at home... Not a chance with her totally-bonkers mother who spouts religious drivel and forces Carrie to repent for something that is completely normal (however embarrassing it may be.) Along the way, Carrie discovers that she can move and levitate things. Even though we're shown little moments of her telekinetic abilities, the filmmakers wisely downplay it to show us the brutal horrors of high school and adolescence. Here is a movie that boldly shows us real teenagers in mostly real-life situations. However, that's not to say that special effects take a back seat. In fact, following the famous 'pigs blood' scene, we're treated to one of the greatest displays of destruction ever witnessed. The only part that was a little weak is the very ending, but only because it's been copied innumerable times since then. Sissi Spacek is dead-on in the role of Carrie. In the book, she's described as overweight, which Spacek isn't, but I believe that Spacek's thinness helps accentuate the deep vulnerability that's central to the character. Piper Laurie is equally wonderful as her zealous mother. In my opinion, next to THE SHINING and SECRET WINDOW, this is the best King movie!",10,2,3,19 April 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Where the BLEEP Is the Dark Knight?!
","Being a solid fan of Batman, the Dark Knight, whatever he's also called, I went into this movie expecting the same quality entertainment that the previous 2 had. And sadly, I was underwhelmed. Now I know many out there will probably hate me for saying this, but hear me out. The acting is excellent, the villains are menacing, and there's plenty of action-oriented moments, but I didn't like the film. First, why oh why did the film have to be close to 3 hours? Seriously? They couldn't cover the same story in a shorter 2-hour time slot? For most of the first hour, Batman is hardly seen at all. Second, when Bane faces the city of Gotham with the dilemma of letting him rule, or die in the massive explosions, why does the city so quickly allow itself to be overtaken? After that pivotal moment, the film suddenly thrusts us into the dead of winter (I'm guessing some time has passed) and now the city is under the constant threat of armed militias and execution squads. And still, Batman takes his sweet time showing up. Third and finally, what's with that ending? So, Batman wanders off, and now suddenly Robin shows up to take over?! Kind of a lackluster ending to what would have been a great trilogy, in my opinion. With this one, Christopher Nolan I think got struck with 'epic-itis.' Epic-itis is what happens when a director makes a successful epic and from that point forward feels he can't make anything less. Sometimes it works out: the original STAR WARS trilogy comes to mind. Then, just like George Lucas, he can't make anything less than epics, hence the over-long next three STAR WARS movies. As for Nolan, he also recently did INCEPTION, a much better and successful epic film. Along with INCEPTION, both of the first two Batman movies were each around two and a half hours. Pretty epic by today's standards, and at times squirmingly slow to sit through. Aside from the long running time, with almost every scene, Nolan tries to top himself with more spectacular visuals and whatnot. And in so doing, he loses focus on what makes Batman so appealing: a dark and brooding hero, wickedly delightful villains, and a world at war between the forces of good and evil. If you must see this, go right ahead. But I personally think Nolan screws up the Batman formula too much!",5,2,7,6 June 2013
Blade Runner," A Beautifully Hypnotic Techno-Thriller
","There's no other way to describe this Ridley Scott sci-fi noir. Based loosely on a Phillip K. Dick story called DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, it chronicles the exploits of Deckard, a blade runner played by Harrison Ford in a wonderfully understated performance. He's been assigned to hunt down and destroy a group of Replicants, robots who look and act human, who escaped from an off-world slaving colony and killed some people. The group, led by Roy Batty- played icily by Rutger Hauer, has become self-aware of their four-year life limit and returned to earth seeking their creators, for more life. The story is set in Los Angeles of the future, where massive skyscrapers and flying cars tower and soar against a constantly dark and rainy sky. That equally matches the undertones of the film: marvels of modern science and technology, along with the dark side of such advances. Throughout the film, there are hints that Deckard himself might be a replicant. And the story has some interesting philosophical points to make about life, death, and memories. It even questions Deckard's job: It seems ridiculous for him to hunt down and kill creations who only want to live longer. The finale between Deckard and Batty is perhaps one of the most chilling and thought-provoking scenes in any sci-fi thriller, and the ending is appropriately dark and somewhat of a downer. But with this type of story, a happy ending would feel unnecessarily tacked on. So, if you're a fan of artistic sci-fi, watch this beautifully hypnotic techno-thriller!",10,0,2,6 June 2013
The Purge," Same Old, Same Old!
","Since time unmemorable, stories have been written about people engaging in government-sanctioned death matches. Before THE PURGE, there was THE HUNGER GAMES. Before HUNGER GAMES, there was BATTLE ROYALE (the movie HUNGER GAMES ripped off). Before BATTLE ROYALE, there was THE RUNNING MAN. And on, and on, and on the list goes. While there's probably some unhappy corner of the globe, where such events are possible, it gets old after awhile. Enter THE PURGE. In the US of the near future, crime is now non-existent and there's very little in the terms of rage and violence. What's the solution? One night a year, for 12 hours, the nation holds The Purge. In that period of time, all law enforcement, firefighting services, and medical assistance is suspended. People are allowed to commit atrocities with impunity. Anyone who doesn't want to participate simply has to close the shutters and wait it out in the 'safety' of their own homes. YEAH RIGHT! In THE PURGE, we're introduced to a bland upper-middle class family who want nothing to do with the annual cleansing process. But wouldn't ya know? The baddies come a-callin' and won't take 'no' for an answer. So now, this mild-mannered family must find it in themselves to fight against the various murder-hungry punks. Overall, it's exciting. Though it does stretch the boundaries of believability quite a bit. Take it or leave it. But underneath it all, it's just the same old, same old ultra-violence!",5,0,0,2 June 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Freddy's Comin' For You!!!
","Most of the time, dead teen flicks are pretty standard-issue. A deranged, masked killer slowly stalks a group of teens and picks them off in a variety of inventive ways. It could take place at summer camp, or in a mine, or any number of isolated locations. But along came this, Wes Craven's best and most demented. And with it, dear Ole Wes set out to do something a little different with the genre. A group of high school friends are having weird dreams about the same badly-scarred man in a dirty fedora, striped sweater, and a glove with razor claws. But what of it, they're only nightmares... right?! WRONG!!! See, it turns out that man is none other than Freddy Krueger. Years ago, back when he was alive, some parents burned him for being a child murderer. Now, he's back to attack their offspring in their dreams. As their numbers dwindle, a teen named Nancy chooses to try and fight Freddy. The script is pitch-perfect. So are the remarkable performances by Heather Langenkamp as Nancy and a young Johnny Depp as Glen, Nancy's boyfriend. And of course, Robert Englund as Freddy. He gives the role a true sense of menace. Unlike the sequels, this one at least treats Freddy dead seriously, with a wicked streak of humor. The elaborate death and dream sequences are some of the most imaginative. Half the time, you'll be wondering 'Is this a dream or real?' Unfortunately, the ending is kind of a letdown. But apart from that, this is a solid entry in the dead teen flicks and should be required viewing for all horror fans. Just watch out, Freddy may be coming for you!!!",8,0,0,21 October 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Second Time's A Charm!!!
","Rarely does a sequel surpass the original film, but CATCHING FIRE does just that! The story: Having survived THE HUNGER GAMES, Katniss and Peeta find it difficult to adjust to their new found glory. On the one hand, they are disgusted that they are viewed as heroes, since they had to kill in order to make it. And on the other hand, they are frustrated to learn that their on screen romance has to continue for as long as they both live. Worse yet, President Snow is still greatly enraged that they deliberately flaunted his rules. People within the districts are starting to rebel and they look to Katniss, in particular, as a leader of hope. So in a devious maneuver, Snow forces both Katniss and Peeta back into next year's HUNGER GAMES. Building upon what the original HUNGER GAMES started, everything is strengthened. The directing and editing has been tightened. From a visual standpoint, everything looks gorgeous and impressive. The human story manages to go even deeper, touching upon issues such as hope under fire and freedom under oppression. Acting wise, we get the same strong performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as well as veterans Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Naturally, the main focus of the story is the death match itself. And in this sequel, the viewer won't be disappointed by a bevy of new and inventive traps and threats. Perhaps best of all is the ending, which leaves one excited for the upcoming sequel!",9,2,19,3 December 2013
Back to the Future," 1.21 Gigawatts
","Time travel. Has there ever been a sci-fi concept that's gotten more mileage? H.G. Well's famous novel THE TIME MACHINE may have started it all. But to this day, imagination still booms at the possibilities of traveling through space and time. To witness historic events. Or even see where our world is heading in the future. Pop quiz: How many films can you name in 30 seconds that deal with time travel? Quite a lot, right?! In 1985, along came Universal Studios. Taking the well-worn 'Time Travel' formula, they set out to make one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. In a word, BACK TO THE FUTURE is cool! The story: Cool kid Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) is friends with quirky scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc has just built a time machine. Through a series of mishaps, Marty winds up back in the year 1955. Now, Marty's forced to track a much-younger Doc and convince the budding scientist to help him get back to 1985. Along the way, he's also bumped into his future-parents. Thus screwing up his own future. So now, he's got to find a way of getting his dad George (Crispin Glover) and mom Lorraine (Lea Thompson) to fall in love. But that's not going to be easy with the local bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), hanging around. The rest I'll leave for you to discover. It's an instant classic with eye-popping special effects and a stellar cast. Followed by two equally-strong sequels. So if you haven't seen the BTTF trilogy yet, what's stopping you?!",10,3,4,22 October 2014
Jurassic Park," We Have A T-Rex!
","The prolific writer Michael Crichton was famous for writing stories about science gone awry. Naturally, he'd probably get around to genetic experimenting. Hence, JURASSIC PARK came into being. The novel was monumental for capturing the imaginations of readers. Honestly, who wouldn't want to see dinosaurs again? When the book made a splash, it was almost inevitable that a movie would be made at some point. Directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, the film is a masterpiece.Imagine being a little kid, sitting in the darkened theater, as the credits roll on a black screen underscored by eerie vocals. The screen fades into an as-yet-unknown location. It's pitch black, harsh spotlights illuminating the area. A group of heavily-armed men stand around a fenced-in compound. A cage is slowly lowered in. The men jump back as whatever's inside screeches at them. Despite being hissed at, the group push the cage into place. But that 'something inside' goes on a rampage, knocking the cage and the men out of the way. In the process, one of the workers gets grabbed. Screams and growls reverberate off the theater walls as whatever's inside slowly eats the man alive. Despite the other workers' best efforts to stop the creature. Scary? Oh yeah! And we haven't even seen the first dinosaur yet! Following the accident, the story really takes off: In order to quell the safety concerns from the park's investors, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a small team of experts and his grandchildren to take a trial vacation at his island resort. What they discover is a magnificent theme park populated by genetically-engineered dinosaurs. But their amazement quickly melts into fear when the power goes out, and the fences start coming down. Now, on the run from the dangerous prehistoric carnivores, they must find a way to survive and escape Jurassic Park. Still twenty-some years later, the special effects and CGI are astounding. Never before (or since, in most cases) have dinosaurs looked so alive on-screen. All the actors give their roles 110%. For you, the viewer, you'll be thrilled, chilled, and amazed at everything happening in this movie. Come on, it's a Spielberg movie! Followed by two 'less-than-classic' sequels. With JURASSIC WORLD out now in theaters, why not go back and re-live it all over again?!",10,3,4,16 June 2015
The Fighter," Stay Off The Ropes!!!
","When someone mentions a boxing movie, what titles spring to mind? ROCKY is probably the first, some would say RAGING BULL (though I think it's overrated), and hopefully some day THE FIGHTER will come to everyone's mind. In many ways, it's not just another boxing movie. Sure there are scenes of Mark Wahlberg boxing, but a larger portion of the movie focuses on the strained relationships between his character and his mixed up family. The dynamics between Wahlberg and Christian Bale are believable to anyone who's had a sibling. Recently, I saw 127 Hours which (to date) featured the best performance of James Franco. And in both cases, I found myself asking the same question: What does it take for James Franco or Mark Wahlberg to get an Oscar? In both cases, here are two fine actors who have gone out there, played loads of roles over the years, and yet when Oscar time comes around, they're mostly forgotten. Thankfully, both were noticed this year, but why did it take so long? Watching Mark Wahlberg in THE FIGHTER, one can't help but feel for his character who's had to live in the shadow of his older brother. Their mother treats the older brother like royalty, despite the fact he's a drug-addicted has-been. When Mark finally decides to break away from the family and strike out on his own, you want to see him overcome the bitterness and scorn. So, even though the movie is a boxing movie, the real fighting comes between Mark and his family. The struggle to break free to live your life is definitely worth fighting for.",9,0,2,13 April 2011
