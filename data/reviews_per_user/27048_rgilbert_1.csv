Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absolutely AWFUL
","This movie was a joke.  Lucas is definitely a fine movie stylist, but he cannot write a script.  The acting was wooden, the computer effects overused, and the story was cannibalized from the first three movies.  I have seem more of a plot in Barney videos.  Don't waste your money on this film.",Null,0,1,1 June 2000
