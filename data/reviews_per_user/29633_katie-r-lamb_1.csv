Skyfall," I Don't See Why Anybody Wouldn't Like This Movie.
","Anybody who is reading this, I would strongly suggest disregarding all bad reviews about Skyfall. This was the first Bond movie I have ever watched, and it blew me away. In fact, I went and saw it in theaters twice...twice folks. After watching such a fantastic movie I decided to buy and watch a ton of old Bond movies. All of them bored me. There were a few great parts in all of them, but for the most part, it was hard for me to make it through them. Daniel Craig is by far my favourite Bond, and probably will be unless they make Robert Downey Jr. Bond some day. Anyhow, I highly recommend this movie. Buy it, watch it, love it.",10,5,15,17 December 2012
