The Ring," A horror movie that freaked me out...
","With the release of 'Thirteen Ghosts' and 'House on Haunted Hill,' you're not expecting much out of many horror movies - especially when you know they're going to be lame. They're all the same; immature young adults move into a house rumored to be haunted. 'The Ring,' however, is a different story. It is truly disturbing and mind-boggling. It is probably the scariest movie I've seen in years.From the moment I saw the videotape - which will kill its viewers in seven days - to the very end of the movie, I was totally freaked out. 'The Ring' doesn't rely on jumping out of your seat but constantly builds the tension, giving a sensation like that's going to happen. But it never does.'The Ring' relies on images. There are times in which there is no music and very little sound, but what we see is scary and enough to give us nightmares. Director Gore Verbinski shows us the remains of victims killed by the videotape, courtesy of Rick Baker, he shows us an eerie video tape with a mysterious woman brushing her hair, looking in the mirror, among other things on the tape.'The Ring' asks tons of questions but never answers them, leaving it remain mysterious. I don't think it's necessary to make a sequel or prequel, as the ending and the beginning of this film are absolutely perfect and unique. We are left asking ourselves the questions... and are sometimes answered them in our dreams.",9,1,2,25 January 2003
Minority Report," Entertaining film despite its slow moments...
","First of all, I'd like to start off that Steven Spielberg is my all-time favorite director, and believe it or not, 'A.I.' has got to be my all-time favorite film. A year later, the genius director comes up with another futuristic tale that has an even more rewardingly dark tone to it than his previous outing. But does that mean it's as good?It's tough not to like 'Minority Report,' given that I'm a die-hard science fiction fan. I will admit that Spielberg's 'Minority' is slow at times, but entertaining, nonetheless. The casting is brilliant as is the beautiful futuristic world, even if it does have a quite uglier nature.Last year's 'A.I.' paid homage to some of Stanley Kubrick's movies by incorporating some of the darkest elements of human nature, which I'm very fond of. It allowed its audience to think as well as be stunned by its colorful world. 'Minority Report' perhaps had the most complicated story elements of any movie I've seen up-to-date. It's impossible to understand the story completely in just one viewing, especially when the audience tends to get lost somewhere in the middle of the 2-and-a-half-hour movie. I rather believe that this is the beauty of the whole film. It's not your ordinary action movie, but it's more of a deep psychological thriller. That is what makes 'Minority Report' yet another homage to Stanley Kubrick from Steven Spielberg.What will catch the audiences' eyes at the first viewing are the state-of-the-art special effects. However, unlike 'A.I.,' 'Minority' shows the most obvious effects at the beginning rather than the end, where most people make their final judgments as to whether or not they like the movie. Spielberg tells the story with special effects, which is why the effects in the second part are for the most part very subtle. The nice camerawork by Spielberg's long-time cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is also what helps the film's mood.Overall, 'Minority Report' is a decent sci-fi flick. I'm not going to say it was great because there is still a lot I've got to figure out. I'm sure with several more viewings I will learn to like the film. By then the minority will rule.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Definitely on my top ten list of 2001...
","The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring is definitely on my top ten list of 2001. The film has some of the most beautiful sets out of any movie I have seen in recent times. The battle sequences were simply astounding. Director Peter Jackson did a fine job of putting this film together. Although, to me, the film doesn't have as many good qualities as other people say it does. A lot of the effects were outstanding, but some of them were a little too cartoony. Also, I really wasn't impressed with the cinematography and I didn't think it deserved an Oscar nomination for that category. Another problem was the editing, I felt that the film was too long, and at times, extremely boring, but there are plenty of entertaining sequences and the acting was top-notch, especially by Ian McKellen as Gandalf. Christopher Lee also does a great job as the villain Saruman. Overall, the film was a masterpiece. A-",8,0,0,15 February 2002
Dark City," Truly a work of genius...
","John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), an amnesiac who can't remember his wife, ends up in a city with no sunshine controlled by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans in what is by far one of the most stylish sci-fi movies ever made.A clever combination of sci-fi, suspense, and film-noir, 'Dark City' is an intellectual mind-bender that truly defines the art of filmmaking.In the bleak, urban setting, John Murdoch wanders the nightmarish city to try and remember his past and what he left behind. His wife, Emma, played by the lovely Jennifer Connelly, shines as a ballroom singer struggling with a husband that doesn't remember her.William Hurt plays Frank Bumstead, the workaholic detective obsessed with solving a case that may or may not involve John Murdoch. And Kiefer Sutherland plays Dr. Daniel Shreber, John's mentor with a truly eccentric personality as he continually makes two- or three-worded phrases to make a point.Director Alex Proyas ('The Crow') manages this dark and unique sci-fi film in such a way that it actually stirs the viewer's imagination. Proyas' artistic genius is really shown in this film, as we are constantly showered with the combination of sci-fi and film-noir visuals that have never even been attempted in a movie.Definately an alternative film, 'Dark City,' is for artists and general movie-goers alike. Its mind-bending story and bleak, yet colorful, sets will continue to be more unique than anything I've (or we've) ever seen before, or will see again. I doubt there will ever be a movie as imaginative as 'Dark City.' A+",10,3,7,28 March 2003
Dark City," Brilliant storytelling...
","When I was first about to watch 'Dark City,' I really had no idea on what it was about, what the characters would be like, or whether or not the film's visual storytelling would work. The thing I admire about films like this is that you hardly know about the movie until you actually see it.I've had some bad relationships with movies that tell their story visually. For example, 'The Matrix,' although having some cool special effects, wasn't really that good of a movie. It really didn't tell the story with special effects the way 'Dark City' did.One fantastic thing about 'Dark City' is the beautiful production design by Patrick Tatopoulis. It reminded me of movies like 'Batman,' as it was impossible to determine when this movie takes place. The characters in the movie also don't talk like they do today (A prostitute says 'shoot' rather than 'sh*t').Having not seen enough of director Alex Proyas' movies, I can already tell that he's a genius behind the camera. He often utilizes Dutch angles, which help with the visual storytelling. He can tell a story with just enough special effects, which don't get in the way of the experience.'Dark City' is a movie that's definitely ahead of its time. It's story and storytelling are wonderfully inventive and they constantly ask you questions. 'Dark City' defines exactly what filmmaking is: an art. And the art in this movie is crafted with pure genius with its direction, photography, editing, and production design. Director Proyas knows that special effects should be told with the story, and that they always come second. Not many movies get to be like 'Dark City,' and this is one that should be remembered for a long time to come.",10,1,3,20 July 2002
1941," Steven Spielberg directed a comedy that was actually funny!
","When I see most comedies, they are usually not funny. However, 1941 is an exception along with films like Airplane, the Naked Gun, Austin Powers 1 & 2, and Hot Shots. People who don't think 1941 is funny don't know what a true comedy is and obviously don't have a sense of humor.",8,2,5,22 February 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Unique visual style, but still not for me...
","I was reading an article on the visual effects of Moulin Rouge in my Cinefex--a magazine for special visual effects--and saw a beautiful, yet stylized, matte painting of Paris at the turn of the century. It was absolutely breathtaking. After a long time of debating on whether or not I should really check out this movie, I finally realized that I could rent it and not waste a terrible amount of money if I didn't like it. My opinion on the movie: I can't say for sure on whether I did or didn't like it. In many ways, I found it to be unique, and you could say that I'm not a big fan of musicals, but it turns out that the majority of the songs played in the picture is very modern.Another good thing about the movie is its unique art direction and set design, along with the stylized visuals accomplished via computers and miniatures. Australian Director Baz Luhrmann has quite a visual sense of style. He is able to combine the historical elements with today's and practically create a brand new movie genre, or enhance a movie genre, I should say. I must say that he's quite successful. However, I can't say that I'm particularly a fan of this 'new' movie genre.Aside from having dazzling special effects and art direction, Moulin Rouge is rather boring when it comes to telling a story. In addition to my opinion on musicals, I'm not really a fan of romance movies, either. Unfortunately, Luhrmann was able to do nothing to fix this genre. To me, if a romance movie is good, then it probably has action, which I am particularly fond of, like Titanic and Pearl Harbor. However, I am able to admire the amount of effort by the cast and crew, who were able to try something new, it's just not my type. Story: D  Visuals: A-",5,0,2,20 March 2002
Men in Black II," Didn't think much of the first or the second...
","One thing you have to consider when seeing a 'Men in Black' movie is that it will just be a 'Ghostbusters' with aliens. Nothing more and nothing less. However, 'Men in Black 2' is much more improved compared to director Barry Sonnenfeld's previous big-budget special effects effort 'Wild Wild West,' which also starred Will Smith.I can't say that I'm a fan of the first 'Men in Black' movie, the same goes for the second installment. What the audience sees in the second movie is basically the exact same thing seen in the first. Thus, this sequel is even less impressive. If you've been watching the trailers on television, what you see is what you get.In 'MIB2,' Jay (Will Smith) is trying to get Kevin Brown,(Otherwise known as Kay, played by Tommy Lee Jones)--who now works at the post office--to join the Men in Black once again to stop the evil alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle)--whose shape shifts from a small plant-like alien to a Victoria's Secret model from a magazine--who needs something known as 'The Light' before the she destroys the earth. How original.People who thought that the second film would continue where the first film left off, you'll be disappointed. There is no evidence whatsoever that those events ever happened. What we get instead is a remake of the first movie. Therefore you get the sense that you've been there, done that. Unless there is a prequel set sometime in the middle of these two movies, maybe there is still hope for the franchise.Will Smith returns with his funny one-liners, while Tommy Lee Jones prefers to give us his dry humor. Fortunately, since 'MIB2' takes place in the present, it's not as awkward to have the modern slang come from Will Smith's pie hole, as it was in 'Wild Wild West.' I suppose I should be thankful for that. But what about the rest of the movie?People claim that a sequel is supposed to bigger, better, and more elaborate than their predecessors, but it seems that almost all sequels only succeed in the technical aspects, such as the special effects. 'MIB2' contains lots of special effects. Some of them are spectacular, while others leave a lot to be desired. For example, there's a worm that lives in the New York Subway tunnel being ridden by Will Smith's character. While this worm is trying to devour a subway, Jay is trying to calm the creature down. Unfortunately, the sequence is too revealing. Sure, it's a creative idea, but revealing effects make the movie less desirable.Some directors don't understand that special effects are tools used to tell a story, not to impress us. I admit that I do enjoy seeing eye candy, it shows how creative some people could be. But there's a time to show it and a time not to show it. Personally, I'd rather see a movie with mediocre effects but a decent story, rather than one taking so much advantage of state-of-the-art technology that they forgot to tell the story. If you do the latter then you end up with things like 'The Matrix.'Overall, 'MIB2' is a big improvement over Sonnenfeld's last sci-fi action comedy, but is that enough? If we ever do see a 'Men in Black 3,' I'd really like for it to either be a prequel (though that would probably mean no Kay), or for it to start where the previous film left off. There's nothing I hate more than a sequel that opens to a story that has nothing to do with the first movie, which was wide open for a sequel.",6,0,0,3 August 2002
From Hell," An admirable piece of art...
","I have to admit that this is the first film I've seen directed by Allen and Albert Hughes. The twin brothers directed 'Menace II Society' and various other street crime dramas. Their latest film, 'From Hell' -- starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm -- is a street drama of a different sort.Set on the streets of London in 1888, 'From Hell' focuses on Jack the Ripper, and his infamous serial-murdering spree of innocent prostitutes. Johnny Depp plays Inspector Fred Abberline, who is sent to investigate these most gruesome killings, along with his partner Peter Godley, played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute suspected of being one of Jack the Ripper's victims, who helps the two detectives search the murderer.In reality, nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was. This is what makes the film so interesting. There are so many people in the movie who are suspected of being a serial killer, and this keeps you guessing until the film reveals the killer's true [fictional] identity. There are often times where you hear the killer's voice, and even times where you're actually seeing the contents in his home. But you never really figure his identity until the story tells you whom.Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, 'From Hell' is so well-directed, contains such lavish sets, and great costume design, that you actually believe you're roaming the streets of London during 1888. There are times where the sky is even painted red, possibly to indicate bloodshed, as the film has a lot of that. This is all what helps the picture seem more disturbing.'From Hell' is a film in which the characters are likeable, and where you're absolutely disturbed when witnessing prostitutes get their organs torn out. It's actually an incredible experience. The murders are so accurate, the filmmakers even did research on how exactly the corpses were positioned, and where the wounds were. You actually believe the film came from Hell. B+",8,0,1,11 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent movie...
","I've never read the 'Harry Potter' books, but I can say that I'm quite pleased with the movie. It's not every day that you could find a bunch of children who would actually act. In 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' the children are not only likeable, but they also blend in well with the story.Originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Haley Joel Osment as the title character, 'Harry Potter' was helmed by Chris Columbus, a director experienced with working with children. His direction is fine. He gives the story appeal to both adults and children, which is not that common in today's movies. It has some psychological moments, as well as brilliant art direction. Having not read the books, I can already say that 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a wonderful adaptation to J.K. Rowlings' first book of the 'Harry Potter' series.And the film does have some state-of-the-art special effects, over 700 shots. However, some of them suffer from having a sharp-looking foreground, while the background is rather blurry. Many of the special effects scream to the audience revealing that they are indeed special effects. Yet most of this doesn't distract us from the story, which is another uncommon thing for today's movies.We also have some cool magic tricks along with some exciting and suspenseful action sequences, such as Quidditch, a wizard's sport, and a game of Chess played by living humans. We have fun exploring the campus of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as characters go up on moving staircases and meeting the three-headed dog, Fluffy. And there are also some funny and heartwarming moments such as a newborn dragon breathing fire, singeing one of the characters' giant beard.'Harry Potter' is an enjoyable film for the whole family, which I'd recommend out to people who don't read the books or aren't interested in magic tricks. This is all because of Chris Columbus' clever direction that makes kids feel like adults and adults feel like kids.",9,0,0,6 July 2002
Signs," Another M. Night triumph...
","'Signs,' starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who helmed 'The Sixth Sense,' could possibly be one of the best films of 2002, so far. Yet again, Shyamalan treats his viewers with some Hitchcockian-style camera angles, which provide enhanced suspense for an already suspenseful picture.Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a former reverend-farmer who recently lost his faith in God over the death of his wife. His younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a former Minor League Baseball player, helps support Graham's children Morgan and Bo Hess (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin). Before long, the family soon discovers crop circles in the farm's corn fields. Could they be signs of an alien invasion, or just an elaborate prank played by people with too much time on their hands?M. Night Shyamalan proves yet again that he's a very gifted director. (Although some call him the next Spielberg, I consider him to be the next Robert Zemeckis, as he utilizes more subtle special effects rather than the in-your-face eye-candy sort.) Previously helming 'Unbreakable,' and before that, 'The Sixth Sense,' M. Night takes elements from both of those movies to create 'Signs.' He successfully utilizes the frightening and intense moments borrowed from 'The Sixth Sense,' as well as the simple, yet somehow, fancy camerawork from 'Unbreakable.'Mel Gibson gives a solid performance as the widower who loses his faith over the death of his wife. He acts as if he desperately cares for his kids, and even his brother. Although some may disagree, I believe Gibson yet again gives an Oscar-worthy performance. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he acts like a second father to Graham's children, who give a stunning performance, as well.Although some believed that 'Signs' would be a typical invasion movie and special effects extravaganza, I found it to be something more than that. It's about faith, and the film constantly asks us questions, such as: Are there miracles in the world, or is it just luck? Shyamalan directs and writes 'Signs' with such intelligence that many will think that it was slow and needed to be cut down a bit. I don't believe this; if you are following along with the story, you'll see that almost every scene is needed somehow in the movie.As a special-effects movie freak, I could say that 'Signs,' which does in fact have some special effects, intelligently provides us with a more subtle view that focuses more on the characters rather than what's going on outside. (There is very little second unit photography in this film.) Most of the effects will go unnoticed, and what this says is that the special effects team has done their job.'Signs' is yet again a unique piece of art by M. Night Shyamalan. Though it's more predictable than the director's previous movies, it's still very entertaining, and often frightening at times. Shyamalan knows how to make a movie that literally forces you to care about the characters, and not the eye candy. I can't wait to hear what M. Night's up to next.",7,0,1,3 August 2002
The Matrix," I don't care what anybody says, this is nothing original.
","When I first saw the Matrix a few years ago, I thought it was a pretty good flick, but as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that the film ripped off from a variety of films such as the computer-animated masterpiece Tron and the intelligent action film Face/Off to name a few. Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved. Grade: D",7,13,25,15 February 2002
