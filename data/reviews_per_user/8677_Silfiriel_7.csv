Sucker Punch," Don't let the rating fool you!
","Now I wasn't going to review this movie, but seeing how Zack Snyder's '300' which is a load of...well, stuff has a rating of 7.7 and this movie only got 6.1. I am thinking why?? Perhaps the story was too deep for most viewers.Anyhow, it's a great movie, when I am picking a movie to watch I usually don't pick anything that has a rating below 7, unless strong recommendations from friends, but this movie didn't deserve a 6.1.It's got a story, the visuals and CGI are amazing, the action sequences will leave you breathless and the story will break your heart. By the end of the movie you will feel like you want to get into it and help the characters.Watch it!",10,5,10,24 February 2013
Aquaman," Who have done this
","It was barely watchable. Such amateurish scenes and clichÃ©s have not been witnessed in the worst B category movie.Great CGI I suppose, but not the best.Direction is the worst part of the movie, along with the bad dialogue and awkwardly executed by the cast.Amber Heard...well, not the best choice to say the least.Jason Momoa is okeyish, but the only birght part of the movie is Nicole Kidman.I first rated it five, but it really does not deserve it.",3,1,1,15 March 2020
Interstellar," Don't watch it a third time
","It's a great movie, but the third time I was watching it, everything seemed obnoxiously pretentious.
Especially the science dialogues, and an hour into the movie and everything sounds horrible, the acting as well, overacted.That's my advice, don't watch it a third time.When the movie came out it was celebrated for the scientific accuracy, now I feel like in about 50 years, when the science advances (hopefully) this movie will seem like that old short movie 'Journey to the Moon' where the rocket lands in the moon's eye.Otherwise, the music is great, the story is beautiful, all nicely arranged.",8,0,3,2 April 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Useless
","first, it's a really really good moviesecond, it's absolutely useless with the only purpose to satisfy David Fincher's ego and greed for money and the all American need to own everything.a remake just after two years of a fan/critics praised original? and nothing is changed but the actors?the swedes speak English now, with some weird accent? authenticity???also the title character is seriously underdeveloped just like the emotional connection with the male lead protagonist. I said its a really really good movie but hence the above stated rating:3",3,33,60,25 January 2012
Now You See Me," Don't try to debunk it!
","Movies like Now You See Me are rarely done lately. The last time I was surprised pleasantly like this was Pirates Of The Caribbean the first movie. The movie has it's own faults, like the underdeveloped characters and no emotional ties are really happening, but the it's fast paced and intriguing. During the 2 hours of run time you are always wondering trying to guess who and why is doing this?Now you might start and question the validity of the tricks that are happening in the film, but it's a movie about magic and much more impossible things are happening in regular movies.So just take the advice of the movie itself, 'the closer you look the less you see', don't try to debunk it, just enjoy it.",9,0,2,23 August 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Rating: Awesome
","This was one of the best, freshest moves in a long time. Despite the fact that we've seen the visual style in video games still it seemed really original and refreshing. The humor was subtle, there were no laugh at loud moments, but it kept the humorous pace from beginning to end. This is my first review, but what can I tell you the movie was slick, well packed, full of fight scenes, action wise and adventurous.The visual effects were amazing, nothing overdone or less effects where needed. Can't believe it didn't go so well on the box office, but I'm sure it'll bank on DVDs or BRDs. maybe the story could've been a little better, but i can't really say there was anything wrong with it. BTW Cera plays his usual ( which fits the story), Winstead is OK, it was a pity Anna Kendrick's character (Scots sister) has a little screen time.All in all, you have to watch this!",10,6,16,4 November 2010
Joy," Handing out roles to friends is really unappealing
","First of all, I just want to mention that I was disappointed even before I saw the movie, when I realized that this is the third time David O. Russell is making a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, and second time with De Niro and the other two all together. It just gives off a 'me and my buddies made a movie and you have to see it, mostly because we're all the rage nowadays' vibe. Does David O. Russell even knows how to direct a movie without these artists? Does he realize that as fans we're getting nauseous of his christophernolaning the movies he directs?Factoring this throughout the movie you have a feel that someone has been miscast, a feeling that is even stronger because of the uneven pace of the movie. Parts of Joy are happening fast and in an incomprehensible fashion, while the rest of the movie is a family drama with no obvious or superficial emotional ties between each other. It's really hard to pinpoint what is wrong with the movie, and you constantly compare it with the Silver Linings Playbook even though the two movies are worlds apart in aspect of the story, and yet, there's no way you can escape the comparison, when all faces are familiar. As a result of this the viewer is left with the feeling that no actor was rightly cast or good for the role even though their performances are solid, and when I say solid I mean solid as much as the poorly written script allowed them to be at their best.So maybe working with the same people over and over again is not the best idea. It limits audience to think inside the box and alters expectations.",5,10,25,1 January 2016
