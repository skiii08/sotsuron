Catch Me If You Can," What's not to like?
","When I saw the trailer for Catch Me If You Can, I was hooked. I like movies about con-men, deception, and the line between fantasy and reality. To me, Catch Me If You Can was a positive family-friendly Talented Mr. Ripley. The movie doesn't sparkle and it really has no flash to it, for which, I'm quite grateful. It is a solid well-produced movie in the tradition of Quiz Show, that left me wondering how much of the story was true. Hanks and DiCaprio stepped aside from any normal scene-stealing and let the story capture the audience's fascination and like many others, I'd agree that Walken was on top of his game. I recommend this to anyone who wants to entertain his or her family or in-laws.",8,1,2,7 January 2003
Amistad," Love it, love it, love it
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time and also, I think, oneof the best. For anyone who has ever had American History in highschool, this film touches on so much that you learn about. Wowlook, Martin Van Buren! John Quincy Adams! And John Calhoun!You could see this and it would be just as great if it were aninvented story, but the fact that it is grounded in fact makes it allthat more awesome, horrifying, and powerful. I really have no complaints with this movie, though I couldunderstand people seeing it as dry. The set, directing, acting, andcostumes were all excellent, and the story is gripping and moving.I get goosebumps sometimes when I think of this film and it gavea group of junior high kids nightmares. While a lot of people willobviously object to the scenes of slavery and the barbarisms theyreveal, I think that Amistad is a must-see film for the family.",10,0,1,16 September 2002
Blade II," Great action movie
","Tired, I fell asleep within the first thirty minutes of the originalBlade and never finished it. Now I'll have to go back and see it,because I enjoyed Blade II so much. How much? Tired again, Iwatched it a second time in a row to listen to Guillermo Del Toro'sawesome commentary. This was my first exposure to this newdirector, but now I'm renting all of his other movies. I highlyreccomend this movie to all of my customers as a good actionmovie. Similar to Aliens or Alien Resurrection, it has this cowboy/ hunter/commando squad feel to it. It has just the right amounts ofsuspense, shock horror, and action to it and, in general, thespecial effects do their part well. I particularly reccomend watchingthe DVD for its special features.",8,0,1,11 September 2002
Signs," It had me until the end
",Riveting is just the word for this film that had me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire movie. Almost. But the events that occur in the last fifteen minutes of the film ruined the whole thing for me. We have come to expect a surprise twist at the end of any of this director's films and this one was quite a let down. The acting and the suspense-laden plot were all very well done (though the kids always tended towards under-reaction to events) and the movie surprisingly had a number of points of comedy. But that end! Pure crap and that's why I give it a 6.,6,0,1,11 September 2002
Hart's War," Hart's War, Hart's Bore
","Hart's Bore, as I oh-so-wittily refer to this piece of Hollywood trashis worth seeing exactly one time. I can't see any reason for me togo back and watch it again. The plot tempo and the movement ofthe story weren't so bad, it is just that this movie was frustrating towatch. Colin Farrell was much better in Tigerland and I couldn'thelp thinking about Tigerland and its plot while I was watching thisdud, perhaps wishing that the films would magically switchplaces. And like someone else has mentioned, this movie mightfind you actually rooting for the Nazis, who aren't villified very well.",4,1,3,11 September 2002
