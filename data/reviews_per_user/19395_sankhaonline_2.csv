Lucky Number Slevin," Watch it as soon as you can
","This is very interesting movie. Initially it may look a bit confusing, but pay close attention and you would thank me at the end.One guy with a towel is found in a room and is found by many odd characters one by one, first a sexy Chinese chick, then two Luda Chris, and one The Boss villain, then two Sabbath boy, followed by cool Mr. Torah. Like a shadow we see everywhere this Mr. Wills. Two bookkeepers are dead back to back and the guy in towel is getting punch all the time, still manages to smile at the cleavage of little miss Chinatown.Wait, he looks like some Nick Fisher (so fishy!!) to everyone and got some lucrative offer to kill and on top of that to pay huge greens (to two different boss, thank God!).Man, quite s story. The spices are all up when this 'bad dog' police officer joins the circus.And let me tell you, together, all these big shots will keep you glued to the screen for next 1 hour and 40 odd minutes.Its a short movie with lots of big characters, some good dialog, some mystery, some dead-shots, some kissing, some emotional moments... in a nutshell, some of everything.Don't miss it. and definitely don't ask yourself some dumb question, like, why or how come etc at the end. Some questions are better left unanswered. Just enjoy the show. Who wants the explanations if you get a nice roll in the hay?",8,1,1,12 July 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Those who have give more than 2-4 are either paid or corrupt or bot or QT himself.
","Don't get me wrong, I ain't no QT hater, rather before I watched this, I had lot of admire for him as a film maker and visionary.
I am not sure what he was thinking (It may very well be the case that he was smoking on of those acid cigarettes (no spoiler here as there's nothing to spoil than the entire movie already is and that prop had no big twist moment)), but he could showcase some of the closet hatred/dislike he probably had for hippies and definitely Bruce Lee.
I gave two stars only because of some great moments by BP and LD. Not even sure why MR or AP even accepted those roles... may be some quick money they needed which is better than personal loan, I guess.
Just don't watch it. The image of QT you have will have hard hit and it may even shutter it.",2,1,2,12 January 2020
