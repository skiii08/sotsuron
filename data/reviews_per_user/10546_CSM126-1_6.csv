The Sound of Music," 1 Fanciful Nanny + 7 Mildly Retarded Kids = The Worst Musical Ever Committed to Film
","If you don't already know, let me tell you: I don't like musicals. I find them to be grating, poorly made, horribly uninteresting affairs. I've never quite understood the logic behind someone breaking into a song and dance routine and singing about their deepest, most secret feelings. If you're secretly in love, it might be best not to do a Bollywood number entitled 'I'm in Love!' right in the middle of town. It kind of kills the secret. Also, musicals are always so damn fanciful. Why not do a realistic one? I can just see a musical with a number called 'I Just Had an Abortion, and I Feel Fine'. That, my friends, would be Academy Award gold.But no, musicals are never realistic. They tell stories about inner-city gangs who fight with their words and Plies', or nightclub whores for hire with TB who have hearts of gold. And, somehow, people eat this stuff up like it's going out of style, and fast. Honestly, if you've seen one musical you've seen almost all of them. So why do people go to them in droves? One musical in particular perplexes me most. 'The Sound of Music' tells the tale of a naive nun who leaves her convent to raise seven children with a collected IQ so small that, if brains were gas, they couldn't power a motorcycle around the outside of a penny. Together the nanny and the kids sing and sing and sing pointless songs like 'Do Re Mi' and the titular track, 'The Sound of Music'. There's also, 'My Favorite Things' in which it is revealed that brown paper packages tied with string make people happy. Well, I suppose the brown paper and string couldn't possibly be as boring as this film.'The Sound of Music' is not one of those films that is so bad it's good. It's one of the ones that's so bad it makes me want to burn the theater to the ground. If anything, it's the most offensively numb portrayal of World War II ever made. Here we see World War II as a swirling, candy-colored vortex of happiness. Instead of death and terror, the Nazis bring sunshine and lollipops to the world of Maria and the Von Trapp kids. Even in the middle of being chased by Nazi tanks, the Von Trapp clan have time to stop and sing an ode to their beloved hills. Apparently, Hitler had a soft-spot for musical numbers. Why else would the Nazi's stop chasing them long enough to hear 'The hills are alive...'? Look, it's not like I'm saying I wanted a hard-hitting WWII epic, but I would prefer to not have my intelligence insulted. Even the simplest things in this movie are insultingly stupid. Look at Papa von Trapp. He's an Austrian naval officer. Sincewhen does Austria, a land-locked area, have the need for a Navy? Where is this guy sailing, the Olympic pool at the nearest five-star hotel?The addition of Julie Andrews into this horrific misfire only makes things worse. Of all the movie musical stars, Julie Andrews is the worst by far. She can't sing to save her life and she has the acting range of a less skillful Keanu Reeves. When you're less than Keanu, you know it's time to pack your bags and leave the business. The kids are no better. They're the kind of kid actors who strive way too hard to be cute. They are what I call Lipnickian children, in honor of Jonathan Lipnicki, the world's worst child star.'The Sound of Music' was directed by Robert Wise, the recently deceased director of such films as 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and the original 'The Haunting'. Somewhere in between those two classics, Wise managed to create this steaming turd. How a fine director like Wise got dragged into a project like this is beyond the realm of understanding.I don't know if Wise ever apologized for making this, but he should have because true fans of his other works would never have seen this coming and, if they're like me, they were not happy. Look at it like this: if Michael Bay, crappy action movie virtuoso, were to direct 'Wicked: The Movie Musical', do you think fans of his 'Armageddon' (should they exist) would be pleased?",1,19,65,20 September 2005
Crash," 'You think you know who you are. You have no idea.'
","Paul Haggis has proved that he is a great writer with his adaptation of F.X. O'Tooles works into 'Million Dollar Baby', one of 2004's finest films. Now he proves that not only is he a great writer, but a great director as well, with 'Crash'. Like the 'tapestry' films of Robert Altman, 'Crash' is a complex film, interweaving many different characters and stories to create a portrait of life in a big city.'Crash' takes place in Los Angeles where racism and blind hatred affect everyone's lives, whether they be taking it or dishing it out. What 'Crash' suggests, like Altman's 'Nashville' and 'Short Cuts', is that the problems the characters have derive from a lack of connections with each other. None of these characters take the time to meet each other,or learn about each other. All that matters is the color of their skin and how deep their wallet goes.For example, Sandra Bullock's Jean, the narcissistic wife of the DA. Jean finds it perfectly OK to turn and run from people of other ethnicities, and to treat them all like low-life thugs. She even suspects her Latino locksmith of being a gang member, and wholly believes that he will sell her keys to other gangs. If she had taken the time to meet him she would have known that Daniel is actually a family man and a model citizen. But she doesn't know him, and she doesn't care.Or, how about Matt Dillon's Ryan, a cop who pulls over a black couple and molests the wife, Christine, on the side of the road. Not because he hates them for being black, but because of his frustration in trying to deal with a black HMO agent just minutes earlier. Ryan's father is suffering from a urinary tract infection and can't sleep due to the pain. When he contacts the HMO to see if they'll cover pain medication, Ryan winds up talking to a black woman who tells him the medicine isn't covered. Ryan later visits her office and tells her there are at least five or six white men who should have her job and don't, thanks to affirmative action.There are many other stories and characters in 'Crash', too many to cover in detail here. The black and Latino detectives/lovers with severe racial tension between them; the eloquent, pseudo-existentialist carjackers (my personal favorite characters); the Persian shop owners who are mistaken for Arabs and treated like terrorists; the Asian immigrant couple who wind up in two separate car accidents; the list goes on. There are so many diverse people to meet here, it can seem overwhelming. With so many characters, it is amazing that writer/director Haggis manages to give them all time to become three-dimensional characters in the film's 113 minute running time. What's more amazing is that he manages to tie up every story so well. By allowing the story lines to bleed into each other, Haggis makes the connections they so desperately need.The film's climax gives the audience a chance to see that every bad person can be good, and every good person can go wrong. It all depends on who they meet, and how they connect. It also reminds us that these characters will probably wind up the way they were before they crashed together, but they'll at least be wiser for what they experienced.It's been a long time since a film stood out and demanded attention like 'Crash' does. 'Crash' is a big, bold film that will grab you instantly and won't let go until it takes you on one long, complicated, and powerful journey through the mess we call life. With Oscar-caliber performances, a brilliant screenplay, and a master in the makings at the helm, 'Crash' is a major contender for film of the year. This is a sure-fire best picture nominee in my book, and you can quote me on that.",10,4,13,7 May 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Bitter. Dark. Perfect.
","Were it a chocolate bar, Tim Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' would be dark and bitter. Just the way I like it. Staying closer to the source material than the 1971 version did, 'Charlie' gives Roald Dahl fans reason to rejoice. No longer is Willy Wonka the sunny, cheery twit that Gene Wilder crafted. In the hands of Johnny Depp, Wonka is a twisted, depraved, and sadistic man. He takes great pleasure in the thought of putting spoiled children through pain and suffering, and he doesn't mind admitting that he hates grown-ups of all stripes. This is how Wonka should be.Another improvement over the original is the Oompa Loompas. Their original back story, not told in the first film, is told here. Also they sing the songs from the book, not that garbage from the first film. The musical numbers are inspired, ranging from Bollywood musical to rock and roll to pop ballad. Deep Roy, who plays every Oompa Loompa, does a fantastic job of giving the characters life and making them a little scary even if they are only one foot tall.We also have Tim Burton's stunning vision to bring the quirky tale to life. The factory is a candy-colored den of nightmares with boiling hot rivers of chocolate and torturous uses for seemingly benign candy making machinery. But the interesting thing is that Burton makes the factory as pathetic as it is menacing. Willy's mechanical greeters at the gate explode and his pipes burst and the very mention of the word 'parents' brings everything to a screeching halt.Willy, as it turns out, had a dentist for a father, and thusly never knew the joy of candy until he ran away. And when he tried to return home, Willy found that his father had left and taken the house with him. So Willy locked himself away inside his factory, where he developed a complexion so pale that he actually seems to absorb light like a black hole. He retains the maturity of an infant and the mentality of a candy-addicted twelve-year-old, making him a societal pariah even though everyone adores his confections.No, Willy Wonka is not a pleasant character. He's not meant to be. He's meant to be a depraved freak who learns to grow up with the help of the world's most mature little boy, Charlie Bucket. Freddie Highmore is incredible as Charlie. He gives the character so much emotional weight that he easily blows the previous incarnation of Charlie right out of the water. Depp hand-picked Highmore for the role, and it's obvious why. Highmore shows the potential to be as talented an actor as Depp, with just as glorious a career.'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a film that will put a smile on the face of older fans of the book, and nightmares inside the minds of young newcomers. And that's how Roald Dahl would want it. The story may be bitter and dark, but it will leave a good taste in your mouth. This is one of the year's finest and perhaps Tim Burton's best.PS: Some folks might say Depp fashioned Wonka after Michael Jackson. I say Jackson fashioned himself after Wonka. Either way, they're both kind of sad.",10,4,6,17 August 2005
War of the Worlds," No Wonder Tom Cruise Went Crazy...
","...After this, how could he not? Cruise's PR tour for 'War of the Worlds' has been infamously disastrous. Cruise seemingly went crazier and crazier with each show he appeared on. No movie has had PR this bad since Bill Cosby publicly begged people not to see 'Leonard Part Six', his own personal disasterpiece.Well, there's a reason Cruise is acting the way he is. It's the movie. 'War of the Worlds' is so vapid, shallow, redundant, and pointless that it becomes almost palindromic: it starts out dull, and it ends dull. The middle part isn't just dull, it's insipid too. This film is so full of plot holes, enormous leaps of faith, impossibilities, and continuity mistakes that I wonder if Spielberg even hired a script supervisor.Here's the plot: Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and some other kid I've never heard of (so far as I remember) run away from gigantic alien machines that have been buried under our feet for millions of years. I'm not sure how we never noticed them while laying pipelines and subway tunnels down, but this doesn't matter to Spielberg. Along the way the trio encounter crazed people running for their own lives, a plane crash with no bodies in sight, which is never explained, and other general destruction. This is 'Armageddon' without the giant rock.The movie carries on like this for two hours. I got so bored I was begging for a gun to magically appear in my hand so that I might shoot myself in the face and end the pain by the time Hour One was three-quarters over. You can imagine how desperate I became as the film progressed.I've seen films with mistakes and plot holes, but 'War of the Worlds' seems to be based on them rather than just having them. A plane crashes straight into a house where Cruise and company are hiding out, and yet it doesn't crush the van in the driveway, allowing them to drive away. Mind you, the entire neighborhood was flattened by this crash. The crash has no victims. Dakota Fanning's character remains clueless, despite looking the slimy martian bastards in the face, until the very end of the film. The rest of the time she asks why 'the terrorists' are attacking. Does she think that people who had to steal jet planes to attack us only four years ago could possibly have ten-mile tall machines of mass-destruction, and just neglected to use them previously? Does this film have any right to draw comparisons between itself and the worst attack ever led on US soil? Spielberg apparently thinks he has that right, and for this he should be shunned, fired, and banned from all Hollywood studios. It's a disgusting thing to do. He knows it, and he doesn't care. Steven Spielberg is not only a hack director, but a sick freak as well. I will never ever regret saying that. I'll also never regret vowing to never ever see another of his films ever again. I may just throw out my as yet unwatched copy of 'Schindler's List' in protest.The only good thing about this movie is the special effects. Well, at least for a little bit. The first appearance of a martian machine climbing out of the ground is impressive. But once it started killing people just so Spielberg could use sights of genocide to jerk our tears, I became completely disgusted with the movie as a whole. 'just so Spielberg can use sights of genocide to jerk our tears'. Frankly, this sounds like a possible plot description for 'Schindler's List', so maybe I'm not wrong to throw it out. Anyway, it's not like I can recommend the film based purely on the look of it's effects. That would be like giving Jennifer Lopez an Oscar for 'Enough' just because she's attractive.'War of the Worlds' is a shameful, vile film. Not only does it assault our senses, but it also insults our intelligence and uses allusions to a national tragedy to tug our heart strings. Steven Spielberg is a despicable person for making this, and the cast should be ashamed to have appeared in such a movie. The only people who can be proud are the special effects team, who made the creatures come to life beautifully. It's too bad they're used to progress such an evil plot.",1,5,10,22 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Hide the Bridemaids
","'Wedding Crashers' is an oddity. It's a film I appreciate, but not one I particularly like. It has all the makings of a great comedy: witty dialogue, raunchy humor and Owen Wilson, a genius actor. All these pieces mesh perfectly, and yet I just was not thrilled. By the end I had the odd feeling that my soul was completely drained, and I lurched to my car like a zombie.The film makes good points about the nature of relationships and expertly satirizes guys like it's titular characters, men who go to weddings uninvited to score chicks. There was even a wonderful scene early on featuring costar Vince Vaughn delivering a rapid-fire speech about the 'does she or doesn't she like me' nature of first dates that deserves applause as a short masterpiece.The real failing, I think, is having Owen Wilson's character, John, fall in love. The first portion of the film, showing John and buddy Jeremy actually crashing weddings is hilarious and quick paced. Then John meets Claire Cleary, falls in love, and goes on the worn-out mission of one-upping her secretly evil boyfriend, Sack. The laughs quickly fade in favor of straight-up romance, returning only occasionally to liven things up. Jeremy's story line of being raped by his obsessive wedding date and, later, her gay brother is good stupid fun in the style of 'There's Something About Mary' and other films of its ilk. The main story, which amounts to John making moon-eyes at Claire and Claire returning the sentiment as Sack schemes, would be an average romantic movie on it's own, but it drags down what was a great comedy.The acting is hit-or-miss. Vince Vaughn is superb as the beleaguered Jeremy. His physical comedy is tempered with his verbal wit to perfectly balance the two. Isla Fisher is also great as Jeremy's obsessed wedding crashing victim Gloria, who goes all out to get her man even though he's decidedly done with her.Owen Wilson, one of my favorite actors, is listless and dim as John. Romance is not Owen's thing at all, and it kills me to say he was horribly bad. But that's what it is. Rachael McAdams and Bradley Cooper are stereotypical and mundane as Claire and Sack. They phoned in their performances and, man oh man, it shows and it hurts.Christopher Walken, who is normally hilarious, is forced to check his comedic persona at the door to play the straight-laced Commerce Secretary Cleary. Walken could have saved this film if he'd been allowed to show his zany side.I really do appreciate every aspect of the film. It has great comedy, fair enough romance, and some brilliant acting to cover for all the bad stuff. I just can't bring myself to give it a fresh rating. Maybe romance and comedy just don't belong together (that would explain 'Just Married' and every Julia Roberts film aside from 'Sleeping with the Enemy'). I thought 'this is pretty good', but I didn't feel it.'Wedding Crashers' is what you'd call an 'aborted masterpiece'. It starts strong, and then shoots itself dead half-way through. The second half of this film reminds me of a line from Errol Morris' 'Gates of Heaven': 'There's your dog. Your dog's dead. But where's the thing that made it move? It had to be something...didn't it?' This dog died too soon, and I'm not sure what happened to the thing that made it move in the first place. It's a captivating mystery.",5,1,1,17 August 2005
Downfall," The Last Days of Hitler and the Fall of the Third Reich
","'Please, retain your faith in the final victory! If you lead us, we will follow!' By the time these words are spoken to Adolf Hitler it is far too late for him to be able to reassure the hysteric woman who said them. He knows, as all his Generals know, that World War II is over. And Germany has lost. However, as his mental stability declines Hitler will forget this and try, once again, to win. Moving forces that exist only on his map and calling in strikes by planes that were destroyed months earlier, Hitler fights until his last to protect the crumbled remains of what was once his evil empire. He pores over models that represent the new cities he believes he will build, and no one has the courage to tell him that his Aryan Xanadu will never exist as anything but these models.This is 'Der Untergang (The Downfall)'. The film is inspired by the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary and oblivious follower. Traudl stands at the Fuhrer's side and refuses to move despite lacking all knowledge of him, even his Holocaust. The confused young woman watches in horror as Hitler's Generals turn their backs on him, and she weeps when she finds the remains of her leader's brains scattered across a wall following a fateful gun shot.'Downfall' has a tricky goal: to show the human side of Hitler. No, it's not about making you sympathize with him. It's about showing that he wasn't some superhuman. Bruno Ganz's performance as Hitler, one of the towering performances in cinema history, exposes faults in the Fuhrer. Physically, his hands twitch uncontrollably and his back is hunched as if burdened with a massive load of shame and humiliation. Mentally, he rants about wanting to speak to soldiers he knows are dead and he fabricate stories about Nazi forces hiding in Prussia, waiting to rush in and save Germany from encroaching Russian armies. As he tells these stories to his friends and confidants, you can see he is telling them to reassure himself, and not his friends.Then comes the final collapse. Hitler shoots his wife, Eva Braun, and then himself so as to prevent being captured and forced to face the music. Magda Goebells poisons her children, and then sits down to a game of solitaire before facing her own death. Joseph Goebells tries to salvage the German army, but finally gives in and shoots his wife and himself. Slowly but surely, every one of the Nazi officers in Hitler's bunker commits suicide.Traudl finally accepts that it is over, and joins the German army as it moves to the front lines to surrender. Finally, she passes through the Russian front. While she may have lived in freedom physically, it is doubtful she ever escaped the mental image of what she saw, and the horrible truth she learned about her Fuhrer's crimes.While we may have heard many ex-Nazi's and Nazi sympathizers claim to be oblivious to Hitler's true evil, Traudl Junge is the only one I'd ever believe. When the real Traudl appeared on screen at the end of the film and said she never knew of the Holocaust until the war ended, I felt sympathy for her and I understood the power Hitler had to blind young people and lead them astray.'Downfall' has been surrounded by controversy since it debuted at the Toronto film festival last year. Critics said it sympathized too much with Hitler, which is obviously not true when you watch it. Others said it goes too far in it's depiction of Hitler's last days. Perhaps some people can not handle the sight of exploding heads and severed limbs, but to say this film goes too far is insane. How should this film depict it's subject? With sunshine and lollipops? World War II was brutal and, as such, so should any film depicting it be. Some people won't be able to handle it, but that's why we humans have discretion. We can decide what is okay for ourselves, and we can say no to whatever we think is bad for us. You don't have to watch this film.'Downfall' is a vivid, graphic, firsthand reminder of the depth of Hitler's evil. It's makers are simply spreading the message that trying to forget evil will not change it's affect on us. Why shouldn't we depict Hitler in art the way 'Downfall''s makers have? It might be easier to live without thinking of him and seeing his human traits, but it wouldn't be any better to live that way.This film should become required viewing for history classes.",10,7,10,17 August 2005
