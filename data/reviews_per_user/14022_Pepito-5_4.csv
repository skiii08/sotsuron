Scarface," Period of movie was not immediately after 'The Bay of Pigs'
","Just a correction to one of the comments. This movie was not immediately or about the period just after 'The Bay of Pigs' The Bay of Pigs was in '61 or'62 as I recall. I don't have time to check at the moment. But in any case, it took place in 1980, when Castro let many people from the town of 'Mariel'[ the majority of whom were good people] leave Cuba. But he was slick and opened up the prisons, letting out vicious criminals he could no longer feed, and sent them to the GOOD OLD Old USA. These criminal were called or referred to, particularly by law- enforcement, as 'Marielitos' because they came from Mariel. As Joe Friday in Dragnet would say: 'Just the facts, Mam. Just the facts.'",Null,0,0,26 June 1999
We Were Soldiers," If you did not serve in the military don't bash this movie
","If you did not serve in the military, don't bash this movie as did Boojob.357. Many of us that served in Viet Nam appreciate a movie like this.It shows how the enemy, too, bravely fought, and what war can do to both sides, especially the families. Those that dislike this movie, are those that would never serve to protect America, as did many of our politicians, whom back then were draft dodgers. Don't talk the talk, if you've never walked the walk. Besides, this movie gives us Hispanics [ like Puerto Ricans], credit for serving our country; not like 'Saving Private Ryan', where Hollywood forgot that we Hispanics have proudly served, and many have been awarded the 'Congressional Medal of Honor' I'm proud to say that I served with the 5/7 A Company, and 2/7 D Company, 1966-67, and a combat wounded veteran.",10,20,31,2 November 2002
We Were Soldiers," It's about time....
","It's about time a war movie like 'We were soldiers' was made. Other movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' kept us Latinos and blacks from being seen as we fought for our country [the good old U.S.A.]. Being of Puerto Rican descent, and one who served in Viet Nam '66-'67 with the First Air Cavalry Air Mobile 5/7, 2/7, and wounded with the 2/7 D Company, I felt proud at the end of the movie, knowing every ethnic group that fought in the war was recognized. There are those [very few though] that do not like this movie, and say it was not worth watching. Well, they were either draft dodgers back then or people that are not in support of what America is doing now to protect ourselves from the terrorists who hate everything America stands for. I speak for all Americans that have served and fought for their country. You talked the talk and walked the walk. God Bless America and Garry Owen!",10,2,3,18 March 2002
Saving Private Ryan," 'Hey, what happened to us Blacks and Hispanics?'
","My son rented 'Saving Private Ryan' last night and I watched it even though I had no real interest to do so, because I had heard that Steven Spielberg forgot to include a Black or Hispanic in the movie. If he did his homework he would see that during one of these major invasions, a Black medic was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for treating other wounded soldiers though he himself was constantly being wounded as he kept going from soldier to soldier.One thing, though, in the beginning of the movie while the old man is visiting the grave of his fallen comrade, you can see the real name of a Hispanic soldier by the name of Martinez or Ramirez as I recall, on one of the cross. I guess Steven Spielberg over looked that one. On another note, others have commented about our allies not being in this movie, and I can understand why Spielberg did what he did but, keeping us other Americans out is a disgrace to all those Blacks and Hispanics that fought and died for this great Country of ours. If I was to meet Mr. Movie Maker himself, I would ask him: 'Hey,what happened to us Blacks and Hispanics?' And if anyone else out there feels that what I'm saying is a crock of s***, well, all I have to say is that I'm a Vietnam Combat Wounded Veteran and a Hispanic at that. I know what combat is and the fear that goes through your mind as you look for the enemy in the jungle, and more when you find him. You find yourself doing things you would never have imagined, and how close you become to other soldiers, whether they are black,red,brown, white or green. I must honestly say,though, that I did enjoy the movie and felt sad when ever a soldier was killed, for I've been there. But being that this movie was to Honor The World War Two Veterans,along with all other veterans,we forgive you Spielberg.",Null,0,1,13 June 1999
