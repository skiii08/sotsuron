Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome move, but didn't live up to the hype.
","TPM didn't live up to the hype (but what movie could live up to TPM's hype?).  This movie, like all previous Star Wars flicks, was slow to get started.  If I were going simply because of the hype, I would have been disappointed.  But... I am a Star Wars fan.  This movie added some very interesting things to the story line, and if you are a Star Wars fan it is a very excellent movie.  The saber fights are most impressive, too.",10,0,0,6 June 1999
