Scarface," The World Is Yours
","Everyone knows how good the climatic shootout is but on reflection its amazing how average a film Scarface is. The set-pieces are superb but the bits in between chronicling the rise to power of Tony Montana are either mediocre or downwright boring. It takes three hours to tell the story of the Cuban heel while The Godfather took the same time to present a whole dynasty with even the smallest parts containing more depth than Tony Montana.Technically the film is superb, as you'd expect from De Palma, but the film has dated poorly. The music, which although in parts is great (the opening credits and closing credits) can be embarrassingly eighties and I was nearly blinded by the glare of a thousand white suits.Despite that though the film is entertaining and for some reason that I cant explain I love the scene with the goodyear blimp (The World Is Yours). Its a very cinematic scene, complete with a great piece of music, but its a shame that its ruined by the terrible scene that follows complete with an awful eighties song. Personally I'd recommend Once Upon a Time in America for anyone who wants to see a great gangster film about street level crooks.",7,1,2,2 April 2002
Snatch," A Gimmicky mess of a film
","I've just watched Snatch and I must say that it is one worst films I've seen in quite some time. The dialogue is terribly sub-Tarantino, the story messy and incoherent, the editing headache inducing and the acting is woeful for such a good cast. The film lacks any depth, not that it aims for any, and the humour that it tries to instill instead is puerile and based mostly around swearing. Having said that though, the film does have some merits. The camerawork is excellent (even if it is excessively flashy and OTT), and the climatic boxing scene is well put together, but aside from that it is a gimmicky mess of a film that wastes the talent that it brought together.",3,7,16,1 April 2002
The Usual Suspects," A great thriller
","Most of you reading this have probably seen The Usual Suspects but for those of you that haven't I wont give anything away. All I'll say is that The Usual Suspects is a supremely intelligent film and one of the best thrillers ever made, and although it loses some of its impact on its second viewing, it still deserves to be watched multiple times.",8,0,2,5 April 2002
From Hell," Good, but not great...
","There are many things wrong with this take on the Ripper legend, but many things that are right too. First I'll start with the things that are wrong...The most obvious component of the movie that lets it down is Heather Graham. Her performance is below par at best and downright terrible at worst. Her accent is all over the place and she never seems at ease with the material or her role in the film. She's also far too clean and well scrubbed when compared to the other prostitutes in the film. She doesn't look like a streetwalker. I wish they would have got Samantha Morton to play the role instead...The film's other major problem is another accent; Johhny Depp's. To be honest, I think his performance is pretty good. He certainly conveys the weary, tired emotions that Abberline feels, but the cockney accent is more mockney than anything else. I'm not sure what it's meant to be. However, apart from that, he's excellent in the role...To the film's strengths though. The sense of atmosphere is superb. The production design, costumes and photography give the film tangible quality. It is truly, despite the horrid events that take place, a beautiful film to look at. It's also to the Hughes brothers' credit that the visual stylings that could have ended up as excessive indulgencies really add to the film. Lapse time photography is used, colours are changed, underwater shots are used, short flashes are spliced in, and all of them work. They give the film a vibrancy and energy.The rest of the cast also add greatly to the film. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm in particular are superb. Both give performances that eclipse the leads and both appear to be working effortlessly...The script is also pretty good. It's a fictionalised take on the events, so there's no question of squabbling about authenticity. All that matters is that as a story, in my opinion, it works. It twists, it turns, and it provides a few surprises along the way. It certainly could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse too...All in all, I think From Hell is a pretty decent attempt. It doesn't indulge in the vacuous blood letting of teenage slasher films and provides the viewer with a decent interpretation of the Ripper myth.",Null,1,2,9 December 2002
The Untouchables," Great popcorn entertainment
","The Untouchables dosen't have any pretentions. It knows it's a popcorn film and plays to its strengths superbly. Of course it dosen't hurt that it has an intelligent, witty script, a superb director and a top quality cast, but all of these things would amount to nothing if it didn't come together. I can safely say though, that they do and combine to create a great film.One of the film's most obvious strengths is it's narrative drive. It's simply unrelenting. Great scene follows great scene and several top notch action sequences pepper the film. As you'd expect from DePalma, he handles these with flair and injects real pathos into the film.The performances too are fantastic. Sean Connery gets all the best lines and displays his natural charisma, DeNiro gets to menace people with his inherent intensity, Billy Drago dosen't get to say much but says everything he needs to with his eyes and Kevin Costner's bland drawl suits his naive character perfectly. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith aren't bad either.A film like this also needs the right feel and I can't find any fault with the art direction, the costumes or the photography. It feels like the Thirties and not a collection of people dressed up playing gangsters. Lastly, I must acknowledge the great score by Ennio Morricone. It suits the film like an Armani suit and is certainly one of Morricone's best non Leone scores. His use of the harmonica was only bettered in Once Upon a Time in the West.One to watch and watch again.",Null,0,1,19 April 2002
