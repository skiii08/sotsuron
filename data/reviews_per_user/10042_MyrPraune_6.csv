The Monuments Men," Good, not great
","The subject of the movie is what drew me to it. Very interesting bit of history. If you're into arts, you'll certainly be doing like me throughout the movie, it's like a treasure hunt: Rembrandt here, Van Dyke or Renoir there... That part is really fun. The acting is pretty good in general. The costumes and sets are looking good and realistic. The problem is: against such a backdrop as WWII, where so many people died and such atrocities happened, I couldn't help but wonder, like one character in the movie, if it was worth it to send men to die for pieces of art, be they signed by Rodin or Picasso. This defuses the drama of the movie, although there are a couple of good scenes that will stick to you more. But it's hard to really care in depth about pieces of canvas and marble when you know there were human beings suffering unspeakable things right at the same time. I *have* to set the record straight about Matt Damon's character's awful French speaking 'abilities'...! Somehow his horrendous pronunciation is excused by the fact that he supposedly learnt French in Montreal. Excuse me! I'm Québécoise myself and I could not understand one blessed word he was saying when speaking 'French'. All it was, was really, really bad pronunciation by and English speaking tongue that revolts itself against anything remotely french-sounding. And by the way, Cate Blanchett was not convincing either as a 'French' woman. Why not use wonderful actresses like Marion Cotillard, or Audrey Tautou, or Carole Bouquet, anybody but somebody who would've sounded convincing in French.",Null,0,0,15 February 2014
Hugo," Wow, magical
","Superb, both in its images and its storytelling. Truly magical and touching. It's a bit of a wistful, grave story though, could be hard for some children to get into it, but for the child in the adult, it's amazing. A beautiful way to revisit the history of movie-making. I loved every minute of it. The acting is good, the young actors are excellent, and Ben Kingsley is great. Sacha Baron Cohen strikes the right note and we know from the start that he is the 'villain', but that he won't be that awful. Many references in the images and characters reflect some of the earliest films of history. If you're a buff about movie history, you'll have fun discovering theses references throughout the film; if you're not, you'll get to learn some really cool stuff. Go see it!!!",9,5,10,28 November 2011
Ocean's Eleven," Just plain fun
","This is not a classic, but this is entertainment extremely well-done. It's not deep nor meant to rock your world, but in its own way it's very intelligent and well-written. All the actors have great little characteristics that are just fun to watch. This is the movie that I put on when I just want to escape and not think (along with the 2 others from the series). I know it all and still I enjoy the details of it every time and I notice new things every time. I'm never tired of it. The dialogue is fun and witty and again, the acting is really good. You can tell everybody on the set is having fun and enjoying working together. This is why they all accepted a reduced salary in order to be able to do this, and the 2 sequels - otherwise the movie would have cost an insane amount of money. I never saw the first version, and frankly, I like this one so much, I don't think I want to see the other one, because I'm afraid it'll ruin it for me :-)",8,0,1,10 June 2011
Cars 2," It's not really Pixar anymore
","Cars 2 looks amazing. The sets are just breathtaking, with views from Japan, Italy and England. The animators had fun adding little details that mirror the world of Cars in real places of the world; for example, instead of Big Ben, you have Big Bentley. Clever.Lots of action, races, gadgets, etc. But..... where is the heart? Pixar has always treated us to stories that placed the characters and the relationships at the centre of the story, without compromising on the action and the humour. Here, the concept is interesting - spy cars, with all the gadgets you can imagine, and races around the world - but it's more a pretext than a real story.I remember reading somewhere, back in the good old days of independent Pixar, that they were never going to make sequels just for the sake of sequels. Toys Story 2 and 3 were excellent sequels, with enough meat to be real movies in themselves, so in this way, we can't consider them just mere 'sequels'. Cars 2, on the contrary, feels exactly like the kind of sequel that you make when you have great characters that are going to sell a lot of movie-related stuff - toy cars, lunch bags, pj's for little boys and all that crap. The characters are half developed, a lot more caricatured than what Pixar has ever used us to. The heart of the story - which would be Mater feeling like he is not accepted the way he is I guess - is very superficially treated; in the end, we never really cared.All that being said, it's still better than a whole lot of stupid animated movies that movie studios churn out every year. But it's not Pixar anymore.I felt sad as I walked out; Pixar is finally bowing down to almighty Disney.",Null,0,1,13 July 2011
The Artist," Beautiful, entertaining, but missing on the story
","I wanted to see this movie so bad, because I really liked Dujardin in previous movies I've seen, because of the idea of seeing a silent movie, and the trailer really conquered me. When I sat in the theatre watching the first minutes, I was immediately taken in; the way Hazanavicius plays with the fact that this is a silent movie might be its most interesting and fun aspect. It is well-done, beautifully acted, and superb to watch. My only complaint, but it's still a rather serious one, is that after you've seen the trailer, there's really not a whole not more to learn from the movie. You've seen the whole story, or pretty much. That disappointed me; I was hoping to be more surprised by it. It did not happen. However, I would definitely see it again just to enjoy the cinematography, the acting, the subtle humour, and the whole ambiance of the silent, black and white movie. It's worth seeing, even if at the end the story felt a little thin and cliché.",8,0,1,1 February 2012
Monsters University," Prequel not up to par to original film, but good enough
","Monsters Inc. was a very innovative movie with a very original premise. Ah the golden days of Pixar! The story, the characters, everything was new and surprising. Obviously with this prequel the newness is not there anymore; we already know the world of the monsters and some of the characters. The new ones don't really add anything to this universe but are just new variations on the old theme. The story is relatively cliché, although things turn out a little differently than we would expect for Mike and Sully by the end of the movie. We all know what college/university movies are going to show us, and what's the story line in underdogs movies. But in this movie, I must say there's an undercurrent or realism that's pretty interesting, in the way the story deals with the transformation of its main protagonists. The characters of Mike and Sully start off as big stereotypes, but they get more subtle as the story progresses. I also liked the way the character of the 'mean teacher' was approached. There was a most welcome balance in the portrayal of a tough teacher that has ultimately good motives, if not a lot of compassion or flexibility. All in all this movie is not a bad way to spend an evening, although I must say I much preferred the first one. But it's definitely not as bad as Cars 2 was.",7,1,2,18 February 2014
