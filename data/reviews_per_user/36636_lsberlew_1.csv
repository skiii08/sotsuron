Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better then all three of the sequels
","So I might be a little biased here since this was the first movie I Ever saw in the theater. In my own opinion this movie has the closest feeling to how the original trilogy felt, primarily because of all the practical effects. I also felt it was a worthy start to the prequels which I prefer to the OT, I know the OT are the superior films but I've always enjoyed the prequels more. The acting can get stale at time and some of the concepts are kinda stupid, like Naboo electing a minor as their planetary leader, but for every pick I have like that there are 2 things I like. I like the idea of the political thriller and I think it works especially given the context of the situation",9,3,4,4 May 2020
