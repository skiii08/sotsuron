Hereditary," Overhyped and a big disappointment
","I had high expectations as people claimed this movie to be 'the scariest horror movie of all time'. I think those people have never seen a good horror movie before because this movie was really awful. The plot is super weird and just laughable. The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the way the little girl died was filmed pretty well. But flying decapitated bodies? just no... If you want to see a horror movie that is actually scary with a good storyline I suggest Sinister, Insidious, The conjuring and Gonjiam haunted asylum. But plz skip this one. Do not waste your precious time watching Hereditary.",2,1,3,13 January 2019
