The King's Speech," There wasn't an empty space in the theater.
","People often throw the word ''brilliant'' around, like it's nothing. Truth is, we rarely see a movie that deserves that in front of it's tittle. This one does. This one, really does. While I for one, know, that there is no-one who will actually read this, but getting things off the chest is always good.It's been years since I've seen such good acting. Such witty humor, incorporated at just the right time. The movie... ugh. It's hard to describe. Some will love, some will hate it, but, deep inside, it's not the best movie in 2010, it's one of the best movies in years. I wont go that far as saying in the decade Do yourself a favor. Watch this masterpiece. If not, you will be doing a great disservice to yourself.",10,1,3,28 February 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Jaw-dropping.
","While a 10 seems a bit over the top, a 9 seems underrated. I went to see the movie, but with low expectations. I left the cinema amazed, intrigued, and with a smile on my face. This is an amazing movie, with an Inception vibe to it (even though there is no connection). The acting is great, the shooting locations are great as well, and the story, the story is jaw-dropping.It actually makes you wonder, could it be true. The whole idea of men in suits who control your destiny, in such a cool way is a perfect fit for a film. The best thing, there is not time wasted on fillers and not-important things. It's 100% action and brain storming.Go and see the movie, you will be amazed. As it always turns out, the movie will get mediocre reviews, due to the Inception vibe, but it has nothing in common.",10,4,11,2 March 2011
Rango," Not as good as I hoped.
","The whole movie is unnatural. There are some great parts, the voice acting is great, and the graphics are mind blowing, but it just doesn't cut it. The movie is extremely slow-paced. At times, I, and everyone else almost went to sleep. Some characters just aren't fit.The story itself, for the most part, is not engaging, and fun. In movies like these, there should be a WOW factor present, like in Kung Fu Panda for an example, but there isn't one in Rango.I didn't really like it. My friend was amazed.So, it's a lot up to the viewer. It's not something that can appeal to any viewer. But, if you have time to kill, then I guess this will do just fine.",7,4,7,20 March 2011
