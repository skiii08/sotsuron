Captain Phillips," Great movie with lots of great scenes.
","There are multiple scenes in this film that make you feel good and some that make you feel bad. The hostage scenes look real, and have great affects. The boats also make a great part to the movie. Captain Phillips is a great actor and perfect for the movie. Altogether, this is a very realistic and dramatic movie that I cannot fault. 10/10 Recommend!",10,0,1,28 June 2017
