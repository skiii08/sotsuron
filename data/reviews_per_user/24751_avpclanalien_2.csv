Requiem for a Dream," This movie makes you think...
","How far is a drug addict willing to go for another dose? This movie shows what drugs makes out of people. It shows that drugs brings out the worse in people. This movie illustrates the weakness of humans, and they're lack of will.The 4 characters in the film are drug addicts.Instead of trying to resolve they're problem, they are making it worse, by trying to get more and more drugs. No one is strong enough to give up the drugs and start a new life. It also shows the way most people are. When someone is down, and beaten, nobody tries to help. This is the way most people are. Even the doctors who sell they're patients all kinds of pills just for money. I think this is a good movie, overall. Its sad, depressing, and very REAL. A bit exaggerated in some places but a good movie, and a lesson for all of you addicts out there.",8,0,1,10 March 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Big disappointment
","Compared to the other movies of its kind ( ALIEN series and Predator series) it is a very bad movie. Anyway i loved the special effects and the battles between Alien & Predator. The movie has many mistakes. Its too short (less than 2 hours). I am a big fan of AVP productions, and I've expected much more from this movie. The storyline is boring. I hoped it will be inspired from the 2 video games : AvP1 and AvP2. The movie was made in a hurry, and thats why its a big disappointment. I waited for the movie to apear for a long time, I've been dreaming day and night about it. I just hope the next AVP movie ( if its going to be one) to be much better.",6,4,7,1 September 2005
