The Blair Witch Project," Too Much Hype.
","When I first saw The Blair Witch Project, when it was released at the cinema, like most people out there, I was quite excited to see it. I'm a big movie lover and there was so much hype (Too much, I think.) about this movie, you just had to see it. Critics and audiences, loved it and there were articles about The Blair Witch everywhere. So, when I saw it, it was completely different to what I expected. I thought it was going to be this brilliant movie and it just wasn't. I would say it was original though, but not scary. Maybe, I would of enjoyed it more, if it wasn't so hyped up. Let's just say even the sequel was MUCH better this.",Null,0,1,17 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Star Wars Movie.
","Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace is a great movie. The BRILLIANT Natalie Portman is fantastic here as always and was perfectly cast in the role of Queen Amidala. Little Jake Lloyd is also good as Anakin Skywalker. If you like the Star Wars chain and you haven't seen this movie, then you should. The sequel looks really good too.",Null,1,4,15 November 2001
Ghost," One of the most amazing and touching movies ever made.
","Ghost is definitely a one of a kind movie. It's a total tear-jerker that is just amazing. Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, Tony Goldwyn and Whoopi Goldberg are all absolutely brilliant and the chemistry between Patrick and Demi is great. Ghost is a definite must-see for everyone. 10/10",10,9,14,4 July 2001
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Classic Movie, By The Best Director Of All Time, Steven Spielberg.
","E.T is one of the best movies of all time and will always remain a classic, brought to us by the the best director of all time, the wonderful Steven Spielberg. And, who can forgot the young and adorable Drew Barrymore's performance as Gertie. I'm can't imagine anyone not owning or seeing this movie but if you haven't you really must. It's amazing. I give E.T a 10/10.",10,1,2,8 September 2001
Training Day," Ethan Hawke is the one who gives THE great performance!
","Training Day is a crime, drama movie about Jake, a young cop who wants to be a detective, so with the help of fellow cop and detective, Alonzo, Jake goes on a training day to see if he can make it. Things aren't as they seem though when the good cop turns bad and Jakes training day goes from bad to worse.I didn't think Training Day was brilliant, but it was a different, crime, cop movie and was mostly interesting. It gets a bit slow at times and not all the performances are great, but the performance from Ethan Hawke is great. He's a brilliant actor. I give Training Day a 5/10.",5,1,12,6 February 2002
Erin Brockovich," It has to be said, it is overrated.
","Erin Brokovich is the true story obviously about Erin Brokovich played by Julia Roberts, who of course won as Oscar for this role. She did give a good performance here. I wasn't 100% too keen on the movie and it was different to how I expected it to be. The beginning is good, but then it gets a little tiresome as the movie goes on. And, I do have to say it was just that little bit overrated. Still, I liked the fact that it was a true story and it was quite interesting to watch.",Null,0,1,23 December 2001
Meet the Parents," Brilliant Movie.See It More Than Once!
","Meet the parents is a brilliant film. I'm not surprised it's doing SO well everywhere it's released. From the moment the film starts, you know you'll be laughing all the way. I liked everything about this movie. Jay Roach is a great director and Ben Stiller is god. Such a funny actor - he was the man of the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must. It was very enjoyable and well worth seeing more then once, I can tell you.",10,2,4,30 December 2000
Meet the Parents," Meet The Parents Is One Of The Best Movies Around!
","To sum up Meet The Parents in one word,it would have to be BRILLIANT! I loved everything about this film,the story line,the humor and the characters.It was great to see such a brilliant actor,such as Robert DeNiro in such a good,funny role and Ben Stiller what can i say....VERY talented, VERY funny and VERY cute.The man just rocks and is one of the best,most funniest actors around.Anyway,whatever you want in a movie Meet The Parents has.Go see it NOW!",10,1,2,21 December 2000
Unbreakable," Well, It's No Sixth Sense.....
","Unbreakable was well directed and well acted but it was totally different to what I thought it would be like. The trailer for the film is brilliant but the actual film just wasn't as good. I'm not saying Unbreakable is bad, it's just it could of been much better and not of dragged on so much. Still, I'll give it a 5/10",Null,0,0,25 June 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Beautiful!

Happy Gilmore," A Classic Comedy!
","Happy Gilmore is without a doubt a classic comedy, written by and starring the brilliant Adam Sandler who plays Happy Gilmore.

It's a brilliant movie and I give it a 10/10.",Null,3,7,14 September 2001
That Thing You Do!," The Amazing Tom Hanks Can Do No Wrong.
","Tom Hanks directs, writes and stars in this brilliant rock 'n' roll movie, which features a great soundtrack too. I love the 50's/60's days, so this movie was perfect for me. There was some great acting here too, especially, by the brilliant Tom Hanks. This is a movie, that everyone should see. That Thing You do, definitely deserves a 10/10.",10,24,39,17 September 2001
The Mummy," The Mummy Is So Cool.
","Stephen Sommers directs this brilliant film-The Mummy which includes everything you could want in a film, From a brilliant story to amazing special effects to the great cast off, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz,   Oded Fehr, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah. The Mummy is a really cool film which anyone will surely love. I give The Mummy a 10/10. Brilliant!",10,4,5,26 May 2001
The Others," A chilling movie. One of 2001s best.
","Nicole Kidman plays Grace a retired woman who has two children, Anne and Nicholas, both of whom are allergic to sunlight. It's towards to the end of World War II and they live alone in a quiet mansion in Jersey, waiting for Charles, Graces husband and the children's father to come home after fighting in the war. Grace then hires a couple of servants and a gardener, Bertha Mills, Lydia and Mr. Edmund Tuttle to come and help round the house, look after the children, etc. But, soon after there arrival strange things begin to happen around the house, which leaves horrifying consequences and a dramatic conclusion.Now, I have to say I've never been that keen on Nicole Kidman. I've only really like one movie of her movies (If any.) and that's Practical Magic, but here she's really different from all her other roles and she gives a great performance. As do the rest of the cast including the great Eric Sykes. Great suspenseful directing from Alejandro Amenábar too, who also wrote the wonderful script to the movie.I enjoyed The Others for many reasons. One being I love movies with a supernatural Ghost nature and this movie of course has just that. I also love a good twist at the end of a movie, and The Others features an amazing and  brilliant twist. One of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The Others is it's own right, is original. It really should stop being compared to The Sixth Sense, by certain individuals. Once you see The Others it will really leave you thinking this is a simply great movie. And, once again I have to say the ending to the movie is brilliant. I give The Others a 10/10.",Null,0,0,31 October 2001
X-Men," It's all about Hugh Jackman.
","Well, when you're adapting a comic book classic like X-Men into a movie, you really need a perfect director, a talented cast, a brilliant script, great special effects, etc. and X-Men provides all that and more. My favourite X-Men character is of course, Wolverine who is played by the brilliant Hugh Jackman. With his amazing acting and amazing handsome looks, the guy was always going to be a star and of course he is. (See his other movies Someone Like You And Swordfish. They are both brilliant.) Other favourites of mine were James Marsden (From the brilliant Gossip.) who plays Cyclops, Anna Paquin who plays Rouge and Patrick Stewart does a really great job as Professor X. The rest of the cast are also really good including, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos who is unrecognisable as Mystique. The film is absolutely brilliant and I, like many other are waiting for the sequel, which I hope brings back all the cast and the brilliant directing of Bryan Singer. I give X-Men a 9/10",Null,0,0,28 July 2001

Sleepy Hollow," A good old fashioned horror movie.
","Sleepy Hollow is very mysterious and creative film directed by the brilliant Tim Burton, who always makes good films. The plot in the film is very exciting and Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci portray their characters very well. I liked the musical score here too by Danny Elfman, it went really well with the film. I give Sleepy Hollow a 10/10.",Null,0,0,16 August 2001
The Beach," VERY Exciting!
","I have to say Leonardo Dicaprio was the perfect guy to play Richard. He's a great actor who's absolutely gorgeous. Even though Virginie Ledoyen suited her role as Françoise, I still found her just a little annoying. The Beach is full of excitement, drama and some gorgeous scenes. The Beach is absolutely lovely and the musical score in the film is good too. I have to say the film is just as good as the book but better. I give The Beach a 10/10. Great film!",10,1,3,26 May 2001
Scary Movie 2," Where was Wilson. Did I blink and miss his scene? I have to look out again, next time I see the film.
","Scary Movie 2 wasn't as good I expected. Maybe, because the script seemed a little rushed. That's not to say the movie was bad though. The film did have some very enjoyable moments. For example, The Exorcist scene with the brilliant Natasha Lyonne and James Wood was quite funny and the cast in the film, including: Tori Spelling, (Who was great here and who fell in love with a ghost.) Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, James DeBello and Chris Elliott (Let's just say his hand....) did a good job here, of spoofing the movies, such as, Hannibal, House on the haunted hill, The Haunting, What Lies Beneath, Charlie's Angels and even Dude, where's my car. The scene where Cindy (Anna Faris.) is singing to the Graduation Song (Friends Forever.) by Vitamin C (Colleen Fitzpatrick.) and then Vitamin C interrupts Cindy by telling her to shut up and let her sing, was funny too. The film obviously had it's gross out moments, some were funny, some were not. Still, if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy this good sequel. I give Scary Movie 2, a 7-8/10.",Null,0,1,25 August 2001
Forrest Gump," I never realised a film could be so amazing. Forrest Gump was.
","What can i say, another movie which shines through. A movie which deserved all the awards it got and brought us closer to the wonderful acting of Tom Hanks. Forrest Gump is amazing. Everything you could want in a movie Forrest Gump has, from the laughter to the tears to the brilliant acting and brilliant story-line and MORE. Robert Zemikis is such a wonderful director and Tom Hanks being the brilliant actor that he is, was yet again truly wonderful in this movie. A must see if you haven't seen the fantastic Forrest Gump yet. BRILLIANT! 10/10!",10,1,2,11 February 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Great Animated Movie!
","Monsters, Inc. is a brilliant, fun movie for everyone of all ages and definitely deserved the Oscar nomination it has received. Let's hope it wins too. The voice talents in the movie, include Billy Crystal, Steven Buscemi and John Goodman. They were all great and really funny too. You couldn't ask for anyone better and little Boo was just *so* lovely and cute. Monsters, Inc. is one of the best animated movies I've seen and I'm not surprised that it's doing so well. If you like these type of movies then there is no way you would be disappointed in Monsters, Inc. See it!",9,1,2,13 March 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not worth too much fuss but....
","***Spoiler***Bridget Jones's diary was definitely better than I thought it would be. Renée Zellweger did a really great job as Bridget Jones and Colin Firth did a good job as Mark Darcy. (Thank goodness, Bridget chose him at the end.) As for Hugh Grant, who played Daniel Cleaver he was his usual boring self. The film has a couple of funny moments and the music is good too. I give the film a 6/10",1,3,7,29 June 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," Good Shakespeare Adaptation.
","10 Things I Hate About You is a really good Shakespeare  adaptation made into a cool teen film. Their are some good performance from: Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik and the music in the film is also really good too. I give 10 Things I Hate About You a 7/10.",7,0,0,22 July 2001
Notting Hill," A disappointing and boring movie.
","Notting Jill stars Julia Roberts, she plays an American actress who meets a British book seller, played by Hugh Grant, when she's in  London. Busy Schedules, Fame and an American boyfriend do get in the way, but they try there best to stay together. The story for Notting Hill is interesting and different, but the outcome is very poor and disappointing. Instead, of having a good movie, you just have a plain boring one. Julia Roberts is okay here, Hugh Grant however is not. (He never is though, is he.)",1,1,7,4 December 2001
Léon: The Professional," Really Good Action Movie! Natalie Portman is ABSOLUTELY brilliant as usual.
","Mathilda is a young twelve-year old who lives with her father, brother and sister. When she comes back from shopping one day, she finds her family dead. Her father who stores drugs for a mean guy named Stansfield is the one who kills them. Having no where to go to, Mathilda turns to a neighbour, Léon, a guy who she ends up staying with. When she finds out about Léon killing profession, Mathilda wants him to teach her about the ways of killing, so she can get revenge on her family's (Especially her younger brother, whom she was very close with.) killers. During these times Mathilda and Léon form a loving and close friendship.Léon is a really good action movie, and definitely a must-see movie for action lovers everywhere. There's a good and exciting story to it too. And, the performances here by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are great, especially Natalie Portman who is absolutely brilliant here as usual and is definitely the best actress to come out in a long time.",Null,0,2,4 December 2001
American Pie," An Original Fun Comedy.
","American Pie is an hilariously original fun comedy about sex-craze teens. The film definitely has it's moments and the whole cast are great especially: Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Natasha Lyonne, Seann William Scott and Mena Suvari. I'm really glad that they are all coming for the sequel which I can't wait to see and who knows their may even be a third installment of American Pie. I give the film a 10/10",Null,1,1,10 July 2001
Grease," The best musical off all time.....
","Grease has to be the best musical off all the time. The wonderful actors and actress' give there characters all they've got and bring out a wonderful performance all the way through the movie especially John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing and Didi Conn. And, who can forget the music. Absolutely amazing. It's no wonder that the Grease soundtrack in the best selling musical soundrack ever. (It sure is brilliant.) Grease really is the word. It's fantastic. 10/10",10,79,135,16 April 2001
Footloose," A Truly Magical Film.
","Footloose is a brilliant film. Kevin Bacon gives as usual an amazing performance as he plays Ren MacCormack here. Other great performances come from Lori Singer, John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker. The music is really good and the dance sequences are amazing. Footloose is a must see and it deserves a 10/10",Null,10,16,1 July 2001

I mean the trailer is great, the story-line is different not to mention brilliant, it's directed by a fantastic director and stars one of the best actors around. As soon as the film started i knew it was going to live up to my expectations. It was FANTASTIC. The performances by everyone was great and the special effects were amazing. Wilson the volleyball put in a very nice performance to and Tom Hanks what can i say BRILLIANT as usual. The man is one of the best actors EVER. Cast Away has everything you could want so go see it now. The best movie i have seen this year, not to mention one of the best movies i have ever seen. Go see it NOW. 10/10!",10,0,0,11 February 2001
American Psycho," Woah! This is so weird.
","Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a guy who may seem normal, but is really not. I really like drama/thrillers, usually ones like this too, but this movie is awful and has so many flaws. Christian Bale does give a good performance here though as he manages to pull of the good guy vibe and the bad guy vibe all in one well, but that's not enough to save this movie. I hope the 'sequel', this time with a 'female psycho' will be better.",Null,1,1,16 November 2001
American Beauty," A dark and strange movie.
","I'm not the target audience for American Beauty, so considering that it was better than expected. The acting by Kevin Spacey and Thora Birch in particular was good and the directing in the movie by Sam Mendes was well done. The story line was a little weird though and I think there was way too much hype about the movie. Anyway, If you want to see a dark and strange movie then American Beauty is for you. I give American Beauty a 4-5/10.",6,0,0,15 November 2001
Save the Last Dance," VERY Bad!
","I didn't enjoy this film at all. Maybe, because I expected it to be completely different to what it was.

I'll be nice and give it a 2/10",1,4,8,6 May 2001
Face_Off," One of the best action movies around.
",Face/Off is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's got great action all the way through and a brilliant story-line to go with this exciting original movie. With Nicolas Cage and John Travolta both give fantastic performances all the way through  as the good guy and the bad guy. Face/Off is a movie for everyone and I give it a 10/10.,Null,0,1,21 October 2001
The Fast and the Furious," A Very Exciting Movie.
","The Fast And The Furious is definitely one of the best car/action movies, that I've seen in a long time. It's very exciting and once you see it, it will leave you wanting more. There's a good story to the film too, which is also very interesting. Anyway, if you like car/action movies, like the the brilliant, Gone In 60 Seconds, then you'll definitely enjoy this movie.The cast here is great too, with the likes of the cute Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez all starring here. The movie is directed by the great Rob Cohen (Who also directed the cool movie, The Skulls.) and he does a brilliant job as usual.I would definitely recommend The Fast And The Furious to anyone, so go see it. Not only is it, one of the best car movies of the year but it's one of the best movies of the year and I rate it a well deserving 10/10.",Null,1,2,20 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," An all star cast pull of a great movie.
","I was definitely anticipating Ocean's Eleven, so I knew I would see it straight away. The movie features an all star cast, including, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Elliot Gould, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, James Caan, Casey Affleck and many more. I have to say Elliot Gould was brilliant and really funny. The rest of the cast are good too. This and the reason the movie was a remake of the popular original Ocean's Eleven are just two of the reasons why Ocean's Eleven has been doing really well. Of course, the movie itself is great too and as the movie goes on, it gets more and more interesting. The robbery scenes, especially are always stylish and slick. I would recommend Ocean's Eleven.",Null,0,0,16 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," The biggest blockbuster movie of the year is here and what can I say, it's ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
","Pearl Harbor definitely has to be one of the most amazing films, I have ever seen. It sure does qualify for the best film of the year. (And, one of the best films of all time.) This true tale has everything you could want in a movie, brilliant acting, amazing special effects and much more. The great romance story just adds to this fantastic film. All the actors/actress' involved in the movie are brilliant, especially: Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale who are all *true* stars. Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin did a great job too. I'd advise anyone to go see this movie. I can't imagine anyone disliking it and I give nothing but praise to this movie. I couldn't of asked for better directing, (Michael Bay.) producing (Jerry Bruckheimer.) and writing(Randall Wallace.) to Pearl Harbor. The film is also VERY sad and VERY moving and I had my fair share of tears. Pearl Harbor is a must-see movie for EVERYONE, so go see it now. I give Pearl Harbor a 20/20.

Coyote Ugly," Really Cool!
","Coyote Ugly is a really cool film. Newcomer Piper Perabo puts in a brilliant performance as Violet 'Jersey' Sanford. She was made for the role and Adam Garcia as Kevin O'Donnell is great too. He's a brilliant actor and dancer and looked great as always. He and Piper had such an amazing chemistry on the film, it was great. Melanie Lynskey puts in a small but cute performance as Violets best friend, Gloria and John Goodman is great as Violets dad, William. Maria Bello (Lil.) makes a really cool boss and is obviously the one who hires Violet to work at Coyote Ugly and Izabella Miko, (Cammie.) Bridget Moynahan, (Rachel .) and Del Pentecost (Lou.) make really good co-workers to the bar. With a small performance from Tyra Banks as Zoe. The music in the film is brilliant and it was really cool to see LeAnn Rimes in the film singing the theme tune to Coyote Ugly-'Can't fight the moonlight.' The soundtrack to movie is brilliant too and includes four LeAnn Rimes' songs. Among many other great tunes. Coyote Ugly is a great film. It's one for the guys and girls.

","Girl Interrupted is the true of story of Susanna Kaysen's stay at a mental hospital in the 1960's. The wonderful Winona Ryder who plays Susanna Kaysen did an amazing job playing her. She really did deserve another Oscar nomination for this role. Angelina Jolie gives a good performance too as the strange Lisa Rowe, who becomes friends with Susanna. Brittany Murphy and Clea DuVall are both good here too. Girl Interrupted is a great movie and I recommend the movie and the book of the same name to everyone.",6,0,1,5 October 2001

","Russell Crowe brilliantly plays John Nash in this true story of John Nash, a mathematical genius who is diagnosed with schizophrenia and goes on to receive the prestigious Nobel Prize. Performances from the two leading stars, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are absolutely brilliant. They definitely deserved there Oscar nominations as did the Ron Howard who directed the movie and Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay. Adam Goldberg also gives a good performance here in a supporting role. A Beautiful Mind is a touching and interesting movie which is really great and I give it a 10/10.",Null,0,2,8 March 2002
Scream 2," Good Enough!
","Well, i did prefer the first Scream BUT that's not to say Scream 2  wasn't good.  Yet again it had good performances and the killers in the film turned out to be quite suprising. It was a good sequel anyway. 10/10 Might i just add that Wes Craven is a BRILLIANT director and Kevin Williamson is indeed a great writer.",Null,35,58,21 February 2001
The Green Mile," Yet, another brilliant Stephen King adaptation
","The Green Mile is yet, another brilliant Stephen King adaptation. The movie is absolutely brilliant and the whole cast are AMAZING. Tom Hanks as always gives us another one of his brilliant Oscar-Winning performance and Michael Clarke Duncan is really great too. The movie is sad, nice and very thoughtful and I enjoyed it a lot. I give The Green Mile a 10/10.",Null,0,1,3 June 2001
Jaws," The best shark movie around, from the amazing Steven Spielberg.
","The best director ever Steven Spielberg has made the best shark movie around, Jaws. This movie which created the 'Summer Blockbuster Phase' is absolutely brilliant and quite scary too, as the special effects used here to make the shark are so amazing and realistic. The performances from everyone in the movie are really good too and very believable. Jaws is highly recommended and I give it a 10/10.",10,1,2,25 November 2001
Bring It On," Fun!
",Bring it on is a fun movie. Kirsten Dunst is great as Torrance Shipman and Eliza Dushku is cool as Missy Pantone. Jesse Bradford is also really cute as Missy's brother Cliff Pantone. The music in the film is cool too and the cheers that the teams did were brilliant. Bring it on is a great teen movie. 7/10,Null,4,5,7 May 2001
The Waterboy," Very, Very Funny!
","The Waterboy is a really funny film which stars Adam Sandler who plays Bobby Boucher a guy who has been a waterboy for years and helps give 'good H20' to guys at football games, etc. Until, one day he loses his temper after he gets enough of the bullying from the guys at the football team and discovers he's good football player so Coach Klein decides to put him on the football team. His 'mama' isn't to happy with her son playing 'fooseball' so he doesn't tell her and from then on, Bobby starts winning the games for the team. Along, the way we see him going back to school, getting it on with Vicki Vallencourt, meeting his father and much, much more. Great performances come from Adam Sandler, (Obviously.) Henry Winkler, Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk, Larry Gilliard and Rob Schneider. The Waterboy is brilliant and I of course will give the film a 10/10.",10,1,2,10 July 2001
Scream," A Typical 'Scary Movie' But Still Brilliant!
",Scream is a great film. I'd say one of those films you could see time after time and not really get bored of it. Sure it was just your usual 'scary movie' type film which wasn't actually scary but i enjoyed it all the same. Good performances from the whole cast especially Neve Campbell and of course a very memorable performance from Drew Barrymore. 10/10,Null,0,0,21 February 2001
Halloween," Great Slasher Movie.
","It's Halloween and in a small town called Haddonfield, in Illinois, in 1963, a six year old boy named Michael Myers has murdered his teenage sister. Michael is than sent to a sanitarium under the care of Dr.Sam Loomis, who is the only one who can really see the evil that is Michael Myers. Few years on, it's October 1978 and Michael escapes from the sanitarium to go back to his old town and kill again on Halloween. After witnessing Michaels escape, Dr.Loomis goes back to Haddonfield to find Michael and to try and stop him from killing again. When Michael gets back to Haddonfield he begins to stalk young Laurie Strode and her friends Annie and Linda, with Dr. Loomis and the town sheriff on his case, to get the evil back. Jamie Lee Curtis gives an okay performance here. She's not exactly brilliant, but it's good enough. She's just a little unrealistic.
Halloween is a great slasher movie. This one and Halloween H20 are my favourite 'Halloween' movies. I've seen all the Halloween sequels and whilst they're not the most terrible movies around, they don't compare to the first one or to the most recent Halloween. You even get to see Michaels face in this first movie. I give Halloween a 9/10.",10,0,0,30 October 2001
Carrie," Classic Horror!
","Carrie White is a young, shy, mousy girl who doesn't have any friends. One day, when she is taking a shower in school, she sees that she has her first period. Not knowing anything about periods, he classmates taunt her about it. One of them takes pity on her though and gets her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom. Tommy ends up agreeing and asks Carrie to the prom. Carrie says yes and is obviously very happy and excited about a popular, handsome guy asking her out. Another girl though who has been banned from the prom for her bad behaviour plans a trick to embarrass Carrie in front of the whole school. What she and everyone else don't realise though is that Carrie is a special girl with a gift (She has telekinetic powers.) and you really don't want to mess with her, when she's angry.Carrie is a movie based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. The book is great and the movie is just as brilliant. The special effects used are great and the movie from beginning to end is simply amazing.Director Brian De Palma does a wonderful job directing and Lawrence D. Cohen does a just as brilliant job writing the movie. They are joined by a wonderful cast, including, Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving and a very young John Travolta .",10,0,0,5 October 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Not Bad!
","I didn't think it was brilliant but it was good and quite original too, which is good. The movie is even better with the performances from Jodie Foster and a brilliant performance from Anthony Hopkins who is so very believable in his role, it's amazing. 5-6/10",Null,0,0,16 April 2001
Vanilla Sky," A Real And Interesting Psychological Thriller!
","David Aames is a rich good-looking guy who lives in New York City. When his 'sleeping partner' Julie Gianni gets very jealous after David falls for Spanish beauty Sofia, she gets David into her car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with, but seeing as he's in love with Sofia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, by driving off a bridge. David survives the crash, but is left with a disfigured face. He is then charged with the murder of Julie. The thing is, David doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams (Most of which are actually nightmares.) and flashbacks, some of which just don't make sense to him. Everything will soon come back to him though as he's begins to find out the truth.Well, there's an all star cast here, including Tom Cruise, PenÃ©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all give good performances in the movie. In the movie they all put off different things about there characters, like happiness, sadness, angry, etc. really well. There's also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant, Steven Spielberg.Vanilla Sky is a well made, different, interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it's finished. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the movie is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be. It's been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too. All in all, an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too. They are sure making a lot of 'Are they dead, if not who is dead' movies recently.",10,0,1,25 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," So Amazing!
","The Sixth Sense is an amazing film and is definitely a classic. The directing and screen-play to this movie are brilliant and the whole cast in the movie are great, especially: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. The Sixth Sense is also has one of the best twists a movie could have. If you haven't seen The Sixth Sense then you must, it's truly amazing. I give it a 10/10",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
Final Destination," You can't escape death.
","Final Destination really was one of the most exciting films of 2000. (And still is.) You know straight-away from the trailer that the movie will be good and of course it was. The beginning was especially great as the special effects used for the plain crash were amazing. Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith and Seann William Scott are all great as usual. Final Destination is a very unique film and a must-see for everyone. They should REALLY hurry up and make a sequel already. 10/10",10,1,3,4 July 2001
The Truman Show," See EDTV Instead.
","Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who's life has been watched by the public ever since he was born. His wife and friends are all actors. His home is a studio. Cameras follow him around everywhere. All that and more, so everyone can watch 'his' show The Truman Show. The only thing is, Truman thinks he's an ordinary guy and he doesn't know anything about this. Until one day, he finds out the truth about his so-called life.
I really wanted to like The Truman Show but I just didn't. I mean, yeah the idea for the movie is good and even though I'm not really a Jim Carrey fan, I guess he gives quite a believable performance here. Let's just say EDTV, another movie about a man being watched is much better than this.",1,6,31,2 October 2001
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are BRILLIANT in this GREAT comedy.
","******SPOILERS***** The Wedding Singer stars the brilliant Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore who play Robbie Hart and Julia/Jules Sullivan in this great movie. Adam Sandler plays a wedding singer who hasn't had much luck with women. His girlfriend Linda, (Angela Featherstone.) leaves him at the alter and the woman he ends up falling for, (Julia.) is about to get married herself. He also gets the sack from his wedding singer job. He then finds out that Julia's boyfriend Glen Gulia (Matthew Glave.) which leaves Robbie to make sure Julia knows what he's really like. Robbie and Julia  obviously do get together at the end. :) Christine Taylor also puts in a cute performance as Julia's best friend Holly Sullivan. The Wedding Singer is very funny movie and has some brilliant music in the film including Adam Sandler singing some brilliant tunes and sounding so great. The Wedding Singer is a MUST-SEE. I give it a 20/10. Fantastic!",10,0,1,15 May 2001
Jurassic Park," The best dinosaur movie EVER.
","The best director in the world Steven Spielberg has yet another masterpiece of his hand with Jurassic Park, which has to be the best dinosaur movie around. When I first saw this movie on it's release back in 1993, I thought it was really great and I still do now. The movie is very exciting and has some great special effects. The dinosaurs here are so realistic too, it's amazing. The cast including, Jeff Goldblum, (<-Especially.) Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck and Joseph Mazzello are all fantastic here as usual.Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie, which will always remain a classic. I think it's the best one of all three Jurassic Park movies so far. (Even though the others are fantastic too.) I give this movie a 10/10.",Null,3,5,6 November 2001
High Fidelity," Nothing Special Here!
","High Fidelity stars John Cusack as Rob Gordon a guy who can never find the right woman. When he does find a woman though, the relationship never seems to last. In the movie he tells us about these relationships as we see him working in a record store which he owns with his two strange assistants.
As well as John Cusack starring in High Fidelity, the movie also features performances from Catherine Zeta Jones, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and Lisa Bonet. They all give okay performances. To me, High Fidelity is nothing special. I didn't find it funny or interesting. I haven't read the book to which the movie is based on and I don't think I ever will, but could it be better than this. High Fidelity is not recommended.",Null,0,2,23 December 2001
