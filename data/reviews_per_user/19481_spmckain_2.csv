Miracle," Great Movie
","If you have much negative to say about this movie then you were obviously not born yet or too young to understand that all of the political drama and hockey action displayed in this movie was exactly how it was in February of 1980. If you fail to fall into the category of any of the above then you have no right to comment on the reality that was the world in 1980. As for the historians out there from Sweden and their lack of knowledge... The USA beat USSR in the semi-finals of the medal round and then beat Finland for the Gold. Look it up it is fact. In the medal round the Soviets were the #1 seed, Sweden #2, Findland #3 and US #4. #1 played #4 in one semi and #2 played #3 in the other. We beat the Soviets and Finland beat Sweden which ended up with the US playing Finland for the gold and Sweden playing the USSR for the Silver and Bronze. If the US would have lost to Finland then the US would have won the Bronze and the Soviets the Gold.....based on overall records.",9,1,1,23 February 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," One of the worst movies of all time.
","The folks who actually like this movie are the reason Hollywood makes very few quality movies any more. If you don't care then why should they? This movie is so bad from the beginning. Numerous tornadoes pummeling a West Coast city and there are actually people flying in helicopters to get a closer look. That's a brainy idea. Buildings freezing and crumbling yet the people outside don't seem to be affected so much. The 'walk' from Philadelphia to New York? And in record time no less. I do like the fact that they had the foresight to have Antarctic weather gear handy for just these occasions. What of the tent that was able to withstand the chill but not the Empire State building? Call your local Army Navy store....they really need to stock these tents. I also found it amazing that any lines of communications were not really affected, including the under freezing water pay phone. The only ones who had communications losses were, of course, the main characters.....ah drama!! I know they were in a library but you think they could have possibly tried to burn all the wooden tables and chairs around them? Seems that they would burn warmer and for longer than books. The acting was horrific, the directing was terrible, the script was unbelievably bad and the special effects were anything but special. It certainly rates up there with Godzilla 2000 and Armageddon......it actually makes Independence Day look like one of the all time greats!",1,214,403,20 February 2005
