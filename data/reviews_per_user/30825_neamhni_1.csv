Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Bleh.
","The only thing I found truly offensive about this film was when the man at the dinner party table excused himself when Borat's 'friend' arrived. Maybe that's the point. I don't know. It seems to me that the point, if there is one, is really lost in the boring ridiculousness of this film. I barely made it all the way through... simply because I was so bored.I'd like to agree with a lot of the other comment posts that rated this movie just as low by saying that I'm surprised that so many people *love* this movie and find it entertaining, but I'm really not. I guess I want to be. But, unfortunately, I'm not.",1,8,17,24 November 2006
