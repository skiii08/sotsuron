The Blair Witch Project," I gave it a second chance...Yup, I hate it
","Straight out of the Valencia Community College film lab, it's the most famous home movie not featuring Pamela Anderson. I know I don't need to explain the details of The Blair Witch Project, so I will instead focus upon the polarized opinions about it. I did not like this movie at all, but the wide variance in thoughts about it led me to give it a second chance on my home theater system. The few redeeming qualities I forced myself to find were not nearly enough to compensate for the poor overall experience this movie delivers. I will explain the reasons why I do not like it, but I first must comment on what a lot of the positive comments about Blair Witch have been mentioning. Every person is entitled to an opinion, even if that opinion is grossly uninformed and illogical. We all know this. But DO NOT tell me why I don't like this movie. The basic premise of defending The Blair Witch Project is, 'The only reason you don't like this movie is because there aren't any ILM FX, or blood and gore, or big scary monsters in state-of-the-art rubber suits.' There are a lot of people who don't care about those elements in a film that still did not like this particular movie. And, please, don't tell me this is cutting-edge material. If that were true, I would pull out some of the movies we made as kids out of the closet and advertise them as 'breakthrough filmmaking'. We ran around in the woods with a camcorder...could the right advertising make us millionaires too? Anyway... The main reason I disliked this movie (disregarding the obvious personal economic waste it created) was the horrid acting. You won't be seeing any of these actors on 'Whose Line Is It, Anyway?' anytime soon, unless that show changes it format to screaming and cussing ad nauseum. The motivations behind the character actions were highly questionable at best, which easily transitions into bad dialogue. The movie creates no sympathy for the plight of these whiny, arrogant, silly college students. I was hoping for the visceral thrill of having the Blair Witch appear and stick a bunch of rocks in their mouths, but, alas, no such luck. Sticks and stones...now that I think about, I have solved the mystery of the Blair Witch, right here, sitting on my butt in front of the computer 2000 miles away from Maryland. Sticks tied together. Piles of rocks. Little handprints all over the walls of a house. Middle of the woods. The Blair Witch is (drum roll): Boy Scout Troop 529. You heard it here first.",Null,4,8,27 October 1999
Coyote Ugly," Ugh...
","Zuckheiner delivers another warm pile of expired tripe, and I'm tired of having to sit through these elongated music videos. The only saving grace for me personally is that I didn't have to pay to see it. Still, it's two hours of life I will never get back. What saddens me further are the comments about the plot of this movie being 'real' and (sigh) 'original'. I'm certain comments like these are from people who have never had 'real' jobs or an 'original' thought. Standard girl makes good story with lots of shiny, happy 'actors' to round out the wallpaper. Even the target male pre-pube audience won't get much enjoyment from this  turkey since the girls only reach 'tease'. Look for cut-n-paste Tyra Banks movie stills, coming to an internet near you. By the way, I have structured my comments in the same manner the hacks threw together the, uh, script... for this film: haphazardly and pointlessly. Thankfully, this movie will vanish in two weeks, and no one will care. While the Coyote Not-a-Genius formulates another loser, I'll be waiting here, trying to figure out a way to avoid seeing it. Please, Jerry, STOP.",Null,1,1,10 August 2000
The Matrix," Take a deep breath...now then...
","I liked 'The Matrix'. It is an escapist movie with cutting-edge special effects. Does it deserve to be #20 on the IMDb's Top 250 list? No. Reading the comments made about this film made me wonder if 'The Matrix' really is that good...or is it the fact that Hollywood has been turning out such formulaic garbage recently that anything remotely fresh seems like a classic work. Dwelling on that thought, it's probably a little bit of both. This movie does have the mythological and cultural elements to give it a large cult following (the studios obviously recognize this since this is becoming a three-part series now). But I feel people are too inclined to worship the idea rather than examine the film. The concept of the alternate universe is spectacular, but the actual film is spotty. Anyone with common sense can punch tractor-trailer-sized holes through the plot (my girlfriend made the best point: download as much martial arts into your brain as you like, if your body isn't trained as well, it's not going to do you much good...and why do they shoot that helicopter cannon into the room while Moebius is tied to a chair, helpless???). The acting is adequate, but forgettable. Still, this is a fun movie to watch (I laughed hard when Fishburne whipped out the Duracell). It has a lot of elements going for it, and you won't be sorry you spent 5-10 bucks to see it. But #20? I don't think so.",Null,0,0,25 June 1999
