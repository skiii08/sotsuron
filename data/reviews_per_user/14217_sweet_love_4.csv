Requiem for a Dream," whoa, daddy...
","Man, after I watched this I felt like I'd been in a train wreck. I loved it. I had heard very little about this movie until I caught it on cable, and I immediately had to go out and buy the DVD to show all my friends. I loved seeing them react to it in the same way I did. Simply state, this movie doesn't give you warm and fuzzy feelings.Darren Aronofsky (director and screenwriter) uses a lot of visually stylistic moves in this movie (i.e. the 'hip-hop montages,' split-screens), but they are all done for reason; it isn't style without substance. I don't expect his next movie to use all the same moves. Some have said it doesn't paint a realistic portrait of drug addiction, and I guess I can't really comment on that since I've never experienced it, but after seeing this movie, I can guarantee it'll stay that way. This movie kicked my butt.",10,0,1,29 July 2002
The Big Lebowski," gets funnier every time
","Every time I watch this I catch something new. Like last time I noticed (super-small spoiler) that during the Dude's second acid flashback, the carpenter outfit that he wears is the same thing that Karl Hungus wears as the cable guy in 'Log Jammin'.' That's what I love about this movie. There are so many subtleties, it makes for prime re-viewing action.
Jeff Bridges is awesome. Steve Buscemi is awesome. John Tuturro is awesome. John Goodman really should've been nominated for an Oscar. What the heck the whole movie is awesome. The Coen brothers are excellent filmmakers, to say the least.You can't go wrong with 'The Dude.'But I guess, yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, my opinion, man.",10,0,1,29 July 2002
Memento," very, very cool movie
","Great movie. The first time I saw it, I was totally caught up into trying to figure out what was going to happen next - or what already happened, I guess. It's really fun to watch. I highly recommend it.When it's over, you're probably going to be left scratching your head, trying to figure out what the heck happened. It can be done, but this is a movie you have to pay close attention to; you can't just sit back and relax. This movie involves you and makes you feel just like the main character does, because you pretty much know just as much as he does.If you're still a little confused after it's all done, there's a feature on the DVD that allows you to watch the movie in chronological order... puts a whole new spin on the movie.Based on it's originality and it's 'fun factor,' I think it's deserving of it's place on the IMDB chart.",10,1,2,31 July 2002
Fargo," great writing + great acting = great movie
","The Coen brothers are excellent filmmakers. Their writing here is so precise and so spot on. 'Fargo' was well deserving of it's academy award for best screenplay. And the acting by everyone involved is nothing short of fantastic. I couldn't begin to do justice to everyone's performances, so I won't even try.A lot of people I know don't dig this movie, and I can see why, it's not everyone's bag. It's a pretty normal story, but made great by fantastic writing and acting. I admit I wasn't blown away the first time I saw it, but like most of my favorite movies, I didn't fall in love with it until I watched it a second time.'Maybe it's a subconscious type thing.''Yah, that can happen.'",10,0,0,29 July 2002
