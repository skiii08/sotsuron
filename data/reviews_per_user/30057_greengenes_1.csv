The Hangover," Good Comedy
","The Hangover is a very funny movie with several parts in the movie that made me laugh out loud for quite a while, my friends too and the whole audience also obviously really enjoyed it. This movie is better than most of the new comedies I've seen in the last couple years or so. The performances are good with all of the actors knowing their roles and getting really good laughs with the parts they've been given. On the down side there are a few parts where they go for too easy a joke or a joke you can see coming, or where the movie drags without any laughs for a while, but all things considered this is still well worth seeing if not at the movies then rent it when it comes out on DVD.",7,2,4,26 June 2009
