Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A great form of entertainment for those who are not uptight.
","I loved this movie. The approach was funny along with the direction. I do not understand why people think this movie is horrible. I do have to say I did not like Cohen's HBO show that much. However, this was my favorite character on the show.It's shameful for people to file suit against a film because it portrays them as they really are. That is actually why I thought the movie worked. Anyone who writes in and say that they do not give Cohen credit for a well conceived movie should watch it for what it is. Entertainment (Just as Moore's documentaries are entertainment and informative...even if sometimes exaggerated).If you have not seen this movie, go into it with an open heart and not with a barrier. If the Kaz. gov't can eventually accept it as humor and satire (Irony, sarcasm, or caustic wit used to attack or expose folly, vice, or stupidity).",9,1,52,8 June 2007
