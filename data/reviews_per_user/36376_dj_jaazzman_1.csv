Mission: Impossible III," Just like a 2 hour episode of Alias...not that that's a bad thing!
","The first 5 minutes starts off just like an episode of Alias...which was not unexpected with the same writer / director behind the camera. And I'm not complaining. Alias has always been one of my favorite shows and its nice to finally see JJ Abrams getting his big screen dues. I think Abrams fans with definitely find more enjoyment from this film than the average viewer, but there is lots to love for everyone. Abrams has taken the best of the 'spy stuff' from the first with a lot of 'action stuff' from the second and rolling it all up into a movie that makes a great start to the summer season. By far the best in the series so far...By the way...'Felicity' kicks butt.",7,2,6,28 April 2006
