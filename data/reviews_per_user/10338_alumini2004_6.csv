Iron Man 3," Bad Excuse for a Sequel
","Iron Man 3 is one of the worst comic book movies ever made , i don't know why they had Shane black direct the movie when the Jon Favreau did a great job with the first one and decent with the second one.The main problem with Iron Man 3 lies in its story line , how it deviated from the original comic book story line , they really messed this one up and made a complete mockery out of the Main antagonist, when are they going to realize that in a superhero movie the Anti hero is as and sometimes more important than the Hero itself , the story is awful , and the only reason i gave it 2 is because of Robert Downey Jr,the people who don't know about the comic book storyline they are going to like it but those who have actually read the comics they will hate it.",2,6,12,21 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Brilliant ,Breathtaking and Amazing...!!!
","Saw Star Trek Into Darkness last night and was totally blown away by the movie.Since i was a kid the first series that i fell in love with was the Gene Roddenberry's classic and the characters Captain Kirk and Spock, and since then i have watched all the spin off's and the movies that were made after that , while the original series is still my favourite i like the other spin/offs as well and when they rebooted the franchise like any other trekkie i was exited and when i watched the movie in 2009 i really liked it and it was the best movie of that year and the new one Into darkness is going to be one of the best if not the best movie of this year , the beauty of Into Darkness lies in its Spectacular Visuals , Story line and the characters , what i like the most about it JJ Abrams did not deviate from the original idea he still kept it very much alive unlike other directors nowadays and the credit must go to him for making such a brilliant and spectacular movie , i liked the new additions Cumberbatch and Alice eve , cumberbatch portrayal as the main antagonist in the movie was truly superb and no one could have done it better than him ,so folks forget all the B grade movies that have released in the past week or so and watch the Star Trek Into Darkness even if you are not a trekki you will be amazed by the movie.

Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life-forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before'",10,8,23,10 May 2013
American Sniper," The Legend
","American Sniper : I remember the same time last year i was watching the lone survivor and it was one of the best movies of the year and this year i have started with the American Sniper one of the best movies of this year so far , American sniper is true story of the deadliest sniper in the US Army Chris kyle , Bradley cooper was the right choice for the role as he delivers a power packed performance and arguably his best performance till date and what can i say about Clint 'The Great' Eastwood he has once gain delivered an intense action movie which will have you at the edge of your seat ,I am not sure why there is lot of hatred around this movie as i don't know what people expect a sniper to do or why so much discussion about the moral compass of Chris has been made , you don't go a war to make friends and whatever Chris kyle did for his country was commendable to say the very least and he did save a lot of his fellow seals and marine's , he was a true national hero , the one who didn't get the recognition he deserved. In reality there are no Avengers or Xmen to save the day it is people like Chris kyle who are true heroes and who lay there lives everyday in the battlefield.

Southpaw," Excellent Movie !!!
","Southpaw : Ever since i watched October Sky close to a decade ago became a big fan of Jake Gyllenhal , over the years Jake has done some amazing roles be it Donnie Darko or playing the creepy Journalist in Nightcrawler, In southpaw Jake gives a memorable if not one of the best performances this year so far , he literally carried the entire movie on his shoulders and if it was not for him the movie would have been pretty ordinary , In a complete turnaround from his skeletal look in last year's Nightcrawler, he's practically unrecognizable as the beefed-up, Billy, burying his own slim frame and fine bone structure beneath layers of weight and muscle.This is one of the best Boxing movies i have seen.The only thing that was little bit disappointing was the background score which at times felt was kind of dull, but other than that the movie is very good , will recommend to go watch the movie.'This is about my family. I give you my everything'-- Billy Hope",10,1,4,2 August 2015
Man of Steel," Spectacular , Grand and Amazing 10/10
","This is the best Superman movie that has been made,Zack Snyder finally did justice to his talent by directing this wonderful movie and his version of Superman is by far the best among others ,Henry Cavill was the perfect casting for the Superman the way he portrayed the role as a humble superhero ,he really portrayed Superman as an Idol to strive towards ,he was born to play this role .The Beauty of Man of Steel lies in its Storyline , The Spectacular Visual effects ,its stellar cast and of course the amazing Soundtrack by Hans Zimmer .I have been reading Comic books since i was a kid and Superman is my Favorite Super Hero of them all .Michael Shannon really needs a much needed appreciation for his amazing role as General Zod the arch enemy to Superman. This is by far the best super hero movie of this year and i can say even if i watch it 10 times it will still be not enough.'You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders'.",10,7,15,16 June 2013
The Imitation Game," Brilliant
","The Imitation Game :The best movie of 2015 so far and morten tyldom does a fantastic job after headhunters , The Imitation game is true story of the brilliant Mathematician Alan Turing , benedict cumberbatch delivers a mesmerizing performance and i doubt anyone else could have done Justice to the role apart from him, I don't think any movie this year will be able to surpass the creativity of this one, I am sure many of us not even know who Alan turing was , for once he was the man who was responsible to break enigma the unbreakable German cryptographic machine because of which Europe and allied forces were able to win the war not the war the ended two years ago but Alan saved close to 14 million live's and many more he was a true war hero who was treated very badly by the British authorities post war, i believe we owe a debt of gratitude to people like Alan turing , so go watch the movie , benedict cumberbatch has delivered his best performance so far and all the supporting cast have done commendable job as well.'Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine'",10,3,9,1 February 2015
