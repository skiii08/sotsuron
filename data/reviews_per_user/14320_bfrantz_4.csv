Raiders of the Lost Ark," George Lucas + Harrison Ford = Greatness!
","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is yet another example of what a great screenwriter George Lucas is, what a great director Spielburg is, and what a great actor Harrison Ford is. Lucas and Ford are a recipe for greatness, as we have seen in the Indiana Jones movies and in the Star Wars trilogy.Review: The movie takes place around WWII when the Nazis are gathering up all the worlds treasure and artifacts. This time, it's the Ark of the Covenant from the Bible. Indy's job is to recover that from them...and stay alive in the process.Objectionable content: Amounts to gore. In the beginning of the movie, Indy's greedy helper tries to take an idol that has been booby trapped, and ends up suffering a gruesome and gory death. Other scenes include skulls inside a cave filled with snakes (Indy hates snakes) and, probably the nastiest part in the whole movie, at the end when the main bad guys open up the Ark, a white light comes out and their flesh melts away. It looks pretty fake and kinda looks like wax melting, but it's still pretty nasty. Other OC is the main bad guy (who dies a grisly death in the end) is a really bad guy who sends chills down your spine. There is a little suggestive content when Indy's girl friend (not girlfriend) is changing and one of the main bad guys looks at her back when she is in a bra (not anything much). There are lots of scary moments, and some really nasty parts, but it's still a great movie.Conclusion: I would recommend this to a fan of thrillers, Harrison Ford, or anyone who is interested in ancient artifacts. A great movie starring a great actor and a great storyline written by a great screenwriter and directed by a great director. Not recommended for children under the age of 13.",9,0,0,21 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Wow. Lucas is back!
","Star Wars. The name is practically a mandatory addition to modern man's vocabulary. After the huge breakthroughs the original Trilogy made in sci-fi movies, fans have been screaming for more. It wasn't until Episode I came out that their appetite has been whetted. And while it was a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga, there were a lot of people who were disgruntled with the less-than-great acting on the part of Anakin, and the ok-at-first-but-quickly-becoming-annoying Jar Jar Binks. It undeniably didn't do for movies today what the original Star Wars did back in 1977. Personally, however, I enjoyed the movie and wasn't too disappointed. Well, Episode II has come out and it is clear to me that George Lucas has learned from some of his mistakes in Phantom Menace and turned out an amazing and very entertaining movie that should please both die-hard Star Wars fans and the casual movie-goer. While it certainly has a different feel than did the originals, since hardly a frame goes by that isn't 95% computer generated, it is still Star Wars and a movie that is not to be missed.I'm assuming you have seen the other four Star Wars movies before you read this and see AOTC. If not, climb out of the rock you've been living under and head to Blockbuster before you see this movie. Ok, with that said, let me now say *SPOILER ALERT*. The next couple paragraphs will talk about the storyline, so I recommend you skip over this if you haven't seen it yet. Ok, after Episode I where the Trade Federation has been almost completely taken down and Naboo is freed from Federation control, in Episode II the Trade Federation leaders and some other solar systems have left the Republic and are building for themselves a massive droid army on the planet Geonosis. Geonosis is one of the several new locales to AOTC and is a bug-filled rock where the dissidents are hiding out. Count Dooku who was on the Jedi Council is in league with all these guys and knows the truth about Palpatine while being in league with Sidious. Oh yeah, and Jango Fett is kind of Dooku's bodyguard (and we see that his Slave 1 is an awesome, tricked-out ship capable of taking anybody but a Jedi out). Anyway, Obi-Wan and Anakin get chosen to protect Senator Amidala (she's not Queen anymore), something that Anakin is more than happy to do. Eventually, they get leads on a bounty hunter who's been making attempts at taking Padme Amidala's life, so Obi-Wan tries to find out more about him while Anakin and Padme head off to Naboo to go into hiding until the threats are eliminated. Obi-Wan eventually goes off to a hidden planet called Kamino (very awesome) and finds a Clone army being made, with the clones being modeled after the very bounty hunter that's been trying to kill Amidala - Jango Fett. Obi-Wan follows Jango to Geonosis and finds out about Dooku and everybody else. Unfortunately, he gets captured.Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme are getting to know each other while in hiding on Naboo. Both are obviously getting to really like each other, but then Anakin has a dream about his mother in pain. He and Padme go off to Tatooine to find Shmi. This takes us back to the ever-amusing junk dealer Watto. He tells Anakin that Shmi was bought by a guy named Cliegg Lars, who freed her and married her. Anakin visits his new step-Dad to find him a very nice guy who just lost his wife to the sand people. Anakin meets his step-brother Owen, who is dating Beru (now where have we heard those names before...?). Anakin finds the sand people and his captive mother. After some parting words, Anakin's mother dies and Anakin gets enraged at the sand people. He kills their entire camp and returns to his new family's house. They bury Shmi and Anakin goes back to his ship. There he finds out that Obi-Wan's in trouble and together he and Padme go to rescue Obi-Wan. Things don't go so smoothly and between Padme almost getting roasted and Anakin nearly being turned into a droid, the two are finally captured and they meet Obi-Wan in a gladiator-type arena where they are about to be executed, Roman style (with an outer-space twist). Some amusing and exciting parts follow (with our friends C-3P0 and R2-D2 in the mix), as well as an epic battle scene complete with the early incarnation of Storm Troopers and quite a few light saber-wielding Jedi. Finally, a really impressive scene where we get to really respect (and ooh and aah) at the capabilities of the limping little green guy (Yoda) follows, which pretty much finishes the movie off. Of course Ian McDiarmid is there as Palpatine, and his descent into evil is made more apparent in this movie. *SPOILER END*.Ok, enough about the plot. If you thought Episode I was full of CG scenes and locales, Episode II is even fuller. From the sweet CG ocean and rain of Kamino to the waterfalls of Naboo to the bustling city on Coruscant, AOTC is full of 'wow' factor. If you thought the podrace of Phantom Menace was cool, wait until you see Anakin fly the hover car on Coruscant. Or Obi-Wan's personal ship, complete with long range hookup for traveling from star system to star system. Or the Slave 1, or... you get the idea. Your jaw will drop at the amazing climactic battle, as well as the fully computer generated bug-like creatures from Geonosis. And the alien chef who Obi-Wan talks to is awesome and quite amusing. Add to all this the fact that AOTC is (I think) the first mainstream made-for-theater feature to be filmed completely with digital cameras, instead of the analog film ones that have been used ever since the beginning of movies. This fact plus all the just plain awesome computer work on Episode II means one thing...absolutely top quality of production. Ok, now to acting. Now, first remember that people don't go to see Star Wars to see incredible emotional performances on the part of the cast (that's what movies like Cast Away are for). First and foremost it's for the awesome spaceships, planets, and aliens. The new Star Wars episodes are clearly more effect and less impressive acting performances (no more Harrison Ford to make us laugh), but that's not to say the acting is bad. I'm no professional critic, but I thought the performances were just fine, on the whole. No butchered lines like in the last movie (remember 'this is tense', 'sand storms are very, very dangerous', and 'lets try spinning, that's a good trick'). The characters this time around are older and more mature and aren't quite so laughable (ok, I know Jake Lloyd was a little kid, so I'll cut him some slack, but what about Jar Jar?). Jar Jar was the thorn in many Star Wars fans' side for the duration of Episode I. Personally, I didn't mind him too much. But this time he's been given a much smaller part, reminding you that he's still there and important, but not filling the movie with his antics. A good thing to be sure. Hayden Christensen does a surprisingly good job, as does Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman (and pretty much everybody else, for that matter). All in all, George Lucas certainly doesn't have the budget problem he did for Star Wars: A New Hope, and he's produced a very impressive and amazing sci-fi film.As for content acceptability, Mr. Lucas has been thankfully keeping his movies PG. I don't mind so much PG-13 violence, but once the Star Wars universe starts getting 'mature themes' included is when it's no longer Star Wars and I'll no longer be much of a fan. Thankfully, this is not the case and Lucas clearly aims to keep the PG rating universal for all his movies. Thank you, Mr. Lucas! Ok, as you know there's laser battles, light saber duals (a couple people lose various limbs, and one guy loses his head in a very non-gory manner...the fact that light sabers burn you makes it possible for saber wounds to be very clean), etc. As is expected, Star Wars is full of mild and non-bloody violence. Lots of it, but what's there isn't a big deal. This movie has Natalie Portman wearing a bit less, but nothing to be worried about. The romance between Amidala and Anakin is kept non-physical, and is limited to occasional kissing scenes. There are a few skimpily dressed women at a Coruscant club, but nothing much is shown and it shouldn't be an issue. The gladiator scene might be a bit scary for younger kids, as there are some big, possibly scary creatures as well as Amidala gets her back slashed. Finally, the Geonosis bugs are a bit on the nasty side. Nothing serious, but maybe a few issues for parents of small children, not to mention the overall suspenseful nature of the movie.In conclusion, I thought Lucas did a much better job this time around. The kiddish characters are gone, and the movie takes itself more seriously. There is probably the most 'wow' factor in this movie as in any of the Star Wars movies (and any movie for that matter except perhaps the Matrix or something). The CG is absolutely incredible, and the new ships and locales are very awesome. It's not the same as the original Trilogy, but nothing ever will be. That doesn't mean it's not a great movie in its own right, however. Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is the coolest movie I've seen in a long time, and a downright great continuation of the Star Wars saga. See it today. Oh, and one more thing... Yoda rocks!Entertainment Value: 9.5. Awesome locales and unforgettable battles make this movie the first of the prequels to really show that Lucas is still a great writer/director and that Star Wars is still as cool as ever. Edge-of-your-seat, entertaining, and very, very cool.Quality of Production & Acting: 9.5. That same 'wow' factor I was talking about earlier. Incredible CG all the way. Acting is perfectly fine, not necessarily stellar, but it certainly gets the job done. All-in-all, great.Storyline: 9.0. The continuing saga of Star Wars, how can you go wrong? Though everybody pretty much knows what's gonna happen, it's still cool to see everything fit together to set the stage for the Trilogy we all know and love.Content Acceptability: 8.75. Star Wars non-gory and non-bloody violence. Very minor female immodesty in a club, but nothing to worry about. Of course absolutely no bad language - this is a long time ago in a galaxy far away for crying out loud!Final Critique (not an average): 9.5. Lucas is back! Much better than Episode I, a great romp through the Star Wars universe. Very cool, entertaining, and there's a little something for everybody. Politics, romance, and of course awesome sci-fi battles and ships. It's Star Wars!!!",7,0,0,20 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Nothing will ever replace the books, but this is still a great movie!
","Before starting on the review, I'm going to assume that you've read at least The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. If not, I do not recommend that you see this movie until you have done so. Still, I'll give a brief overview of the story...Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit (basically a race of small humans), is the uncle of Frodo. In reading The Hobbit you can learn of Bilbo's adventure where he found the Ring. In Fellowship, Bilbo is old and is going to leave to go somewhere to retire. He leaves the Ring with Frodo. Frodo knows the Ring is powerful and possibly dangerous, but he doesn't know how dangerous until Gandalf (a wise wizard) tells him the history of the Ring, that it was forged in the fires of Mt. Doom by Sauron (an evil wizard trying to take control of the land - Middle Earth). It has the power to strengthen it's bearer, and make them invisible. However, it makes the bearer even more visible to Sauron's evil forces, and thus must not be worn. It also has other dangerous powers and will eventually control its bearer and lead them to doing evil. It has ruined many already, Gollum being the most obvious example. Anyway, Frodo must go on a journey to destroy the Ring, but the only place it can be destroyed is in the same fires where it was forged - Mt. Doom. But Mt. Doom, as its name implies, is in the midst of a land completely filled with evil. However, in order to keep Sauron's powers from taking over all Middle Earth, it is imperative that the Ring be destroyed. So Frodo heads out. On his way he stops at the home of Elrond where he joins a Fellowship, and together they set off toward Mordor (the evil lands from which Sauron works). Along the way they see evil spreading out, in the form of orcs and dark Riders. Many battles take place against the ghastly orcs, and a lot of non-gory hacking takes place. Two other important characters are Aragorn, a man who is part of the Fellowship, and Sam, who is Frodo's loyal companion.Whenever a book is made into a movie, the movie version rarely lives up to the standard of the book, or the expectations of the fans. Fellowship is no exception. I don't think it's possible to really improve on Tolkien's masterpiece. However, that's not to say that Fellowship is a bad movie. In fact, it's one of the better movies I've seen! Making a movie from a book, especially one that has such a fan base as LOTR, is very difficult. You not only have to stay true to the original story, but you have to keep in mind that everyone has a different opinion of what the characters look like, and it is impossible to fit everyone's description. They also have to severely edit the original story in order to fit it into the time constraints, usually taking out scenes that some fans will be angry were removed. So making a movie from a popular book is a risky business. But Peter Jackson and the screen writers did do an admirable job on Fellowship.I'll start with the positives. Personally, I thought they chose a great cast of actors, and the costumers and makeup artists also did a great job of depicting the orcs and other creatures in Middle Earth. The only characters that didn't quite look their part were the elves. They were basically wrinkle-free humans, and didn't look all that different. Still, they looked fine and I can't really complain. The acting was excellent, and I don't remember there being any 'butchered lines'. The battles were fast paced and got your heart pumping. The caves of Moria were also well done, if laid out differently than in the book. Every scene in the caves kept you at the edge of your seat. I also thought the intro that summarized how the Ring came to be found was well-done and informative for those who hadn't read The Hobbit. All in all, the movie was very entertaining and, though long, kept moving fast enough to hold your attention.Ok, the negatives. The positives do outweigh the negatives, but there were some (I thought) unnecessary liberties taken with the story. I understand the need to leave out certain scenes, so I wasn't really bothered by the deletion of the Tom Bombadil scene. I also wasn't terribly bothered by how they had Pippin and Merry join Frodo's journey, though it was certainly different than in the book. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to deletions in the script of movies, but I have a problem with unnecessary insertions. My biggest gripe with the story in the movie is the insertion of Arwen taking Frodo across the river and then her calling the flood in and sweeping away the riders. That was not at all how it happened in the book and I think they inserted her in order to get a female character into the movie earlier! I wasn't too bothered by the kissing scene between her and Aragorn, though, because they do get married later. It was a short scene and didn't really detract from the movie (and it was not anything more than kissing, so it didn't hurt the content). Anyway, there are some inconsistencies in the story, but only one of them I thought was terribly unnecessary.The objectionable content in Fellowship is purely violence. There was no bad language or suggestive sexual themes in the book, and there weren't any added into the movie. However, the book was filled with battles between the good guys and orcs, so naturally the movie was filled with them as well. The orcs, which are very hideous looking, are hacked, slashed, shot with arrows, etc. There is not gore and the battles are not bloody, but it's probably not appropriate for younger kids, especially those who might be bothered by the nasty looking orcs. Also, the scene with Saruman could be unsettling to younger kids, as would the orc-camp at Saruman's place. Finally, like in the book, magic and wizardry does play a role. However, it is usually shown being used for evil (except in the case of Gandalf) and does not glorify witchcraft in any way.Fellowship is a great movie. Though it ends somewhat abruptly, it does so less than the book does, and they obviously did their best to end it in a way so that the next movie does not start with a battle (like the book The Two Towers does). And while they did take liberties with the story, the end product does stay true enough to the book in my opinion to still be satisfying. As movies from books go, Fellowship is one of the best. It is very well done, and I'd recommend it to fans of Tolkien who are mature enough to handle the violence.Entertainment Value: 9.0. Edge-of-your-seat suspense and lots of fast-paced action in battle. Though the movie is very long, it does not lose your attention. Great movie.Quality of Production & Acting: 9.5. Top. Excellent acting by Wood, McKellen, Mortensen, Astin, and the rest. Special effects as well as costume design are also very professionally done.Storyline: 8.0. Not original in any way since it's from a book. However, the book has one of the best and most original stories ever crafted, and this drastically helps the rating. Understandably, many deletions to the original story were made. Too bad about the insertion of Arwen calling down the flood, though.Content Acceptability: 7.0. Fighting, fighting, fighting. Lots of non-gory hacking and shooting. Arrows go into orcs' heads. Orcs are decapitated. Also, orcs and various other characters are very ghastly in appearance. Probably not appropriate for children under 13. Minor magical themes. No language or anything else.Final Critique (not an average): 9.2. Great movie in its own right. Does take liberties with Tolkien's story, but most of them are understandable. Very entertaining and recommended to mature (at least 13 and up) audiences.",9,0,0,20 May 2002
Gladiator," Excellent movie that even got some of the history right!
","Gladiator is one of my favorite movies to date.Review: While the storyline is fictional, the emperors and their character traits are historical. In both the movie and in history, Marcus Aurelius was a good emperor who cared about Rome but who had a very cruel son (Commodus). The addition of Maximus is not necessarily historical, though Commodus was (SPOILER) assassinated (END SPOILER) by someone. Also, in history Marcus Aurelius allowed Commodus to be his successor, where in the movie, that was not his intent. I thought the storyline was excellent. Extremely gripping and intense. An excellent battle of good vs. evil.Objectionable Content: This IS an R rated movie! Actually though, it really wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. I started watching the movie with expectations of gory battles with blood everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised. It still had some really nasty parts, but as a whole the gory parts were very short and the camera quickly moved on. It is definitely too gory for a PG-13 movie, but it really isn't terrible. As for other objectionable content, profanity is limited to only a few words that are in most PG-13 movies and sex/nudity is practically non-existent. The princess seems to try a couple times to make moves on the married Maximus, but he ignores her and moves on. Commodus also is a bit 'too' loving and close to his sister (the princess), but nothing is further hinted or shown. Maximus also prays to Roman gods and frequently talks about how he will go into the after-life and be with his family. If that were true, the movie's ending would be much more triumphant. All in all though, objectionable content is fairly minor for an R rated movie.Conclusion: This is a great movie, especially for being rated R. My main problem with it is that Maximus doesn't seem to mind killing the other gladiators much. He voices his thoughts that it is a sick and disgusting form of entertainment, but he still does it. Not that he had a choice, but he only spoke out against it once in the whole movie. Also, the whole movie is about his rise to recognition so that he makes it to the Roman Colliseum, where he can kill Commodus, the evil emperor who killed his family. I don't blame him one bit, as I was furious at Commodus after he told Maximus how he killed his family (probably one of the most sad parts in the whole movie), but from a moral standpoint, it would have been better for Maximus to not take the law into his own hands (although that wouldn't have made a very entertaining movie). My point is that not everything the protagonist does is good and worthy of being a role-model. He is loyal to his family and country however, and he does value life (even though he valued his own life more than the other gladiators he was fighting). All in all, there are some things to be concerned about morally, but all these things are historical. In conclusion though, an excellent movie. Amazing acting (Russel Crowe was awesome!), emotional storyline, awesome CG graphics and scenery, cool battle scenes (even though they can be pretty nasty), and an epic battle of good vs. evil. I loved it. Excellent, very entertaining, and not all that gross. I would recommend this for people who want a serious but awesome movie, and who are above the age of 13. It also has fairly good history, so for Roman history fans this would also be a great look. A definite 9 rating.Extras: DVD - 2 discs, movie in widescreen format, running audio commentary, 11 deleted scenes with or without commentary, as well as unused shots and leftover sequences, the making of Gladiator, a 50 minute feature on gladiators and their contests, a feature about the musical score for Gladiator, a gladiator journal, original storylines for key sequences and deleted sequences (also has conceptual art), a still gallery of portraits, Rome, Germania, the Collosseum, Zucchabar, and behind the scenes, and theatrical teaser and trailer, cast bios, and production notes.",9,0,0,21 May 2002
