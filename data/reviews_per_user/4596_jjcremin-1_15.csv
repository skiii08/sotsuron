Changeling," Well done period piece of police corruption in the 1920's
","Last night, October 29, 2008, I was one of the lucky ones who got in to see this movie that quickly followed with a q and a with Scott Foundas with the director/producer/composer Clint Eastwood, who gave quite an astute answers and even joked with the audience before making his undisturbed exit.The movie itself plays with colors that has been seen before in Eastwood's pictures. The names of the crew are quite familiar to those who've seen other Eastwood' movies. The first shot is actually in black and white and very much in the period in terms of building and cars when the first caption reads out: 1928.Slowly but surely, from an aerial shot to ground level, the black and white changes into color. We are introduced to Christine Collins who brilliantly played by Angelina Jolie. Collins is a single mom who's also a telephone operator supervisor required to use roller skates to fix little emergencies and handle supplies. Her first scene firmly establishes her as a loving mother.After returning from work to take her son to the latest Chaplin movie, she finds her son is nowhere to be found. Captain J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) reassures her that the LAPD will find her son. A child is brought forth from Illinois and the press are present to record the mother child reunion. However, the first words out of Collin's mouth is 'He is not my son.' Pictures are taken anyway.Later, she comes back to complain to Jones that the child is not hers, he actually gets angry as far that he's concerned, the LAPD did its job. Just prior to this, she meets with Rev. Gustave Brieleb, (John Malkovich) who has his own radio broadcast program denouncing the very corrupt LAPD, whose tie-ins with organized crime he knows about.Jones actually has her committed. She's listed as a Code 12, one who has had trouble with the police and where electric shock therapy is used. Meanwhile, Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) follows a tip and captures an illegal alien from Canada. This boy tells a shocking story of boys being hacked up to bits that he was forced to help and among the boy s identified is Michael Collins as among the dead.Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Hamer) gets thrown in jail for committing those hideous acts. In one powerful screen, he calls Christine to give her closure which he never does. There's cross cutting between the police cover-up trail and Northcott's trial and both get the right verdicts with thunderous applause, one dramatic taken out of Capra, who has been criticized for same and the movie ends with Collins winning a bet that 'It Happened One Night' would win at the Academy Awards.When Eastwood came out, he was chewing on some popcorn. This took place two years before he was born. He recalled his years growing up in the Pacific Palisades and remembers the Red Car, electric rail trolleys that were replaced by diesel buses, not so bright idea in retrospect.The script by J. Michael Straczynski was presented to him by Paul Glazer's company and he liked it very much. He offered the lead role to Jolie as both have expressed interest in working together. Clippings of transcripts were taped on the other side of the script pages really sold him.He praised Anthony Mann, Howard Hawks and John Ford when pressed what was his favorite Western. He rarely uses playback because those old pros didn't and even gave a passable impersonation of John Wayne while acknowledging other great actors who played cowboy parts.He even talked about making the Piano Blues doc for Scorsese when prompted. All in all, he was quite respectful in his responses to his audience who accorded him the respect when he left. A true living legend.",9,9,15,30 October 2008
Stop-Loss," The President needs to see this film
","Director-writer Kimberly Peirce has proved she can make a film of high intensity and great conflict while still showing the human side when she made 'Boys Don't Cry.' That movie was based on an actual murder of butch lesbian, not a mainstream topic, and Hilary Swank won her first Oscar playing the lead.Not one to shy away from controversial subjects,Peirce has recently released 'Stop Loss'. On the movie's web site, there's a section entitled'Comments' and there's a brief video of her encouraging visitors to ask questions with an opportunity to view all previous posts.As I write this on March 29, 2008, recent news has broadcasted escalated violence in Basra with theShi'ities and Sunnies with no end in sight. However,slang for both is Hajji,a derogatory term used by the American military supposedly there to protect them.What makes this film stand out from 'Re.Acted' is that its screenplay does not portray them as simple minded grunts. The opening starts off with a quite realistic ambush actually filmed in Morocco, of which there will be many flashbacks beginning with the ceremony of the survivors coming back home to Texas to the end of the picture.There actually is a reverence for the military and even a 'lest we forget' to those Americans who lost their lives in this single episode of which no other is needed. But the flashbacks also shows the deaths of Iraqis that include women and children that haunts the platoon leader in charge, played by Ryan Phillipe.Others in that patrol aren't doing so well either. Both Joseph Gordon Levitt and Channing Tatum get on mean drunks. In facts, Tatum beats his girlfriend,beating not shown, Abie Cornish, who will join Phillipe in his Odyssey to prevent getting stop lossed.I have never heard of the expression of 'Stop Loss' before and when Peirce heard it, it inspired her to create a story of someone coming back in high esteem and purple heart and getting just that, being forced to return to Iraq completely disillusioned.Phillipe shows the same kind of quiet intensity he displayed in 'Flags of Our Fathers', which also has disillusionment as one of its main themes. It's been hours since I've seen it and I'm still recalling it which for me means I was very much impressed with this film.",10,9,19,29 March 2008
I'm Not There," Intriguing concept but somewhat problematic
","A good part of this movie is very influenced with Fellini's '8 1/2'. one of the best surrealistic movie ever made loosely about a director in inner turmoil about what his movie is supposed to be about.Unfortunately, it doesn't stay with that visceral theme and the process of songwriting is never explored. In fact, Marcus Carl Franklin, the young black actor playing Woody Guthrie, plays the songs complete. His best segment is jamming with Richie Havens, obviously having a lot fun.Christian Bale actually plays the Guthrie folk singer which for me remains Dylan's best work. He actually returns as Paster John, making a somewhat confused Christian preacher. Might as well add here, very little of Dylan's later songs are done, the focus is mainly the sixties and early seventies. somewhat establishing how irrelevant Dylan became except for his most die hard fans.The most dead on impersonation as remarked by other reviewers is that of Cate Blanchett. Very telling here is how mean she plays it, yelling and ridiculing reporters who actually just respectfully doing their jobs and purposely vomiting in someone's lap was part of Dylan's insane behavior during this time period. There's a fun moment when one reporter becomes Mr. Jones to the tune of Dylan's 'Ballad of a Thin Man' done quite well. The garden party scene is straight out of '8 1/2' Heath Ledger plays a more unlikable Dylan though it's this version that has Dylan with a wife, sensitively played by Charlotte Gainsbourough. The male superiority tirade that Ledger gets into has been confirmed that Dylan actually spoke those words at a restaurant.Much criticized and I agree it's the weakest part of the movie is Richard Gere as Billy the Kid. However, it's the most aligned with Basement Tapes period, though the bulk of the songs were done in the sixties. The town Riddle, MO, is influenced by the 1975 album cover which is turn is influenced by Fellini. Even Kris Kristofenson's narration does little to tie the Gere character to 'Pat Garret and Billy the Kid' My overall analysis is that Haynes bit off more than he could chew and the dark side of celebrity really could have gone darker as Dylan himself was famous for being furious at the hype he received.That's what 'Ray' succeeded in doing as well as the more recent 'La Vie En Rose', both had the singer (Ray Charles, Edith Piaf) portrayed by one actor.",6,2,5,6 January 2008
Juno," Good zingers but not as deep as it could have been
","Ellen Page plays this somewhat tomboyish sixteen year old who gets bored one night with her really passive boyfriend Michael Cera and decides to have sex. Her pretty best girl friend has a thing about seducing teachers (Oh, I just love Woody Allen.) There's new language the two girls speak and it doesn't matter if you don't understand it.What really matters is the ability of Page being this geeky girl finding out she's pregnant. From time to time she has voice overs but she has no inclination to be the baby's mother. As that is never explored, right off the bat she just wants to have it and give it to some deserving couple she found in the Pennysaver.She does have supporting parents and her father, T.K. Simmons,takes her to see Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner who seem to be the most perfect couple. I must add her that the scene where Allison Janey and the x-ray technician just doesn't work for me and even comes off as racist.Except for the scene where students gets out of the way, there's really not much interaction between her and classmates. Characters were introduced but nothing much was done with them.Instead, Page visits and revisits Bateman who find they have a shared love of music. In fact, he stays at home to do precisely that. Garner is more prim and proper but actually becomes very sympathetic due to her need to become a mother.The soundtrack is good and keeps the flow going. In fact, the movie ends with Cera and Page singing a cute song and trading off leads.I just it had more what a sixteen year old pregnant girl would go through. Pretending she's a super hero is not enough.",7,2,8,9 February 2008
I Am Legend," Almost solo Will Smith performance
","I just saw an advanced screening last night. Will Smith is a name that can pull crowds as evidenced by the huge turnout. Generally the audience's response is positive and even Smith's pull ups on a handlebar got applause.With only a dog as his real companion for most of this movie, Smith walks around the ruins of New York. Deer are the only real traffic now. Smith almost shoots one but stands awed as he allows a lion to kill it and take it away. A video show a glorious doctor, whose cure for cancer has backfired and billions of people have died. Many who haven't have become stark raving lunatics who are afraid of the light, with ravenous appetites to devour anything on site.When not hunting down this vermin, he checks out DVD's out at a video store that has standing mannequins in it. Was Smith losing it when working up the courage to talk to one of them? Or was he just so lonely that he's playing a game with himself. Meanwhile, he records notes as a medical researcher, working with laboratory rats to find a cure. Most are dead or crazy but one, though weak, shows positive response.He captures a human to try the serum on but the baddies are not going to let him get away with it. About this time, a woman and boy show up, eventually giving the movie the bittersweet ending it has.If you enjoyed 'The Pursuit of Happiness' like I did, Smith does have the charisma to root for him even when his logic is at times suspect. Very entertaining.",8,1,6,13 December 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A bit long but a great date movie
","I'll start off by recalling my favorite moment on the screen. Cate Blanchett dances to a moon lit gazebo as the young dancer while the somewhat elderly Brad Pitt looks on. She's talking a mile a minute as the blossom just ready to be picked up. But Pitt decides not to pick, the time is not right. Very bittersweet.There's lot of bittersweet moments in this movie and it does run too long. For too long, we see Pitt as the aged kid. Best moment here for me is getting his first drink and first lay on the same night.The set of circumstances that accumulate to Cat getting hit by a car and he sees her in the hospital. The two of them about the same age making love in a sail boat and pausing to watch the Beatles on TV while setting up house.For me, the Benjamin Button character could have waited a few years and foregone the backpacking in India which made me feel less sympathetic to him. By the way, Pitt as an actor is called upon to be passive throughout. With less screen time, Cate is able to to display a wider display of emotions.Eric Roth came up with a very haunting screenplay. I just wish Fincher cut some of it to make a stronger movie. It's still quite good and a great date movie.",8,6,16,18 December 2008
There Will Be Blood," Very Montrous Daniel Day Lewis
","I just saw an advanced screening in Santa Monica. PT Anderson shows quite driven Lewis digging for gold. Years show 1896, 1903, 1911 and 1927. Day Lewis got richer next passing decade and he wasn't very nice getting there.He works the work. He gets just as dirty as anyone else. Upton Sinclair was a socialist and though I haven't read his novel Oil I could feel his way of saying and seeing things throughout this picture.It's almost a black and white movie. Black oil is definitely the color of the faces, the clothes and the demeanor of Lewis. We witness him commit murder. One who lied about being his brother and was willing to just walk away and disappear falls on deaf ears.During one accidental explosion, Lewis's son goes deaf, never to fully regain it again. He beats up the minister of the Church of the Third Transfiguration for not being able to heal his son. He can hear but refuses to hear pleas from anybody.Meanwhile he threatens, he cheats and he kills again and just gets away with it. This is worthy of Nicholson, Pacino or De Niro who have played quite demonic characters in their careers.Anti-religion movie? It most certainly is and showing an oil man getting away with just about anything makes it a political one as well. Afterall, showing stories of the past is a great way to compare to the present and many other film makers have done this to make their points.Tensions stays throughout. PT Anderson has made the darkest movie in his career.",7,5,19,13 December 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Some problems with the dealings of race
","I'll start off by saying that I'm an Irish-English-German-French descendant American. That David Lean was an excellent director shows very well here.Sessue Hayakawa actually had my sympathy. He could have just let Guiness die in the hole and forced labor under the threat of death. Instead, he liberates him and the English man is victorious and the Japaneses cries by himself. By the way, I didn't see much Japanese or even much Asians in an area that's supposed to be Asis. Hayakawa even gets stabbed by death to show a young English recruit to prove courage.Guiness played the stiff upper lip Englishman who pridefully supervises the buildin of the bridge for the Japanese. It turns out to be his downfall as Willian Holden and Jack Hawkins come to destroy it.Holden is definitely the most likable of the group but then I did start by saying I'm an American. Odd scene where the white guys get muddied up by the yellow girls as if the whites were gods.But the dialogue is thoughtful and brings up interesting issues. Made prior to James Bond, the training camps of the British must have been influential for those films.The palaces where the English plan their strategies are something to behold. In fact, all locations used for this film are quite outstanding.And it nary a boring moment in the film. It moves fairly quickly and the showdown one of best I've seen in war films.Willian Holden managed to star in many important films of the 1950's and this is definitely one of his best.",8,3,7,3 January 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not a bad Dracula
","Back in 1992, Coppola was having troubles with Zoetrope Studios and this picture put him into the black, no small part thanks to the then property name of Wyoma Rider.There are great performances and even very atmospheric direction of Mr. Coppola. Gary Oldman made a great Dracula and Ryder played the heroine well. Just after his success in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Anthony Hopkins actually plays the hero Van Helzing in a very astute acting style.There are homages that actually quite recognizable in other, better known films. The vomiting of the blood in the THE EXORCIST, the immediate slayings similar to THE OMEN and even a nod to the 1930's Dracula.All in all, a good work by Coppola and gang. It's a little distant and Keanu Reeves isn't given a lot to do but that's not unusual. Fourth billed, still not yet the major star he would become.I have read the book and Bram Stoker has a very melodramatic style as was it was with the Victorians. This movie generally does follow the book's part though I believe some liberties were taken in the end to give Ryder a really good scene as well as being cinematic.",8,2,4,13 January 2009
The Wrestler," Good but Aronosky has done better
","There's not a lot of special efforts here so a lot rests of Mickey Rouke's shoulders. Is he a bit pathetic? Yes. Is he a mess of a human being? Yes. But that's exactly what's part of the charm who goes out with the risk of having another heart attack.After all, it's his own fault that his daughter can't stand him. It's his own fault he lands just about the most pathetic job at a supermarket he could find.The one bright light he has is Marissa Tomei's character who's worried about crossing the line about making friends with customers. She works as a stripper in a low class strip joint. She does change her mind but is she too late?This movie is not for the squeamish. We see Rouke to staple guns, self inflicted razor cuts, unexpected shots to the head as well as snorting coke, unprotected sex in the bathroom and going through a heart attack.But for me, this doesn't completely ring true. There are moments of levity in this that's much needed. Problem I see here is where does Rouke go from here?",6,2,11,18 December 2008
Iron Man," A surprisingly great super hero movie
","Iron Man was one of the first super heroes that Stan Lee came up in the early sixties. He also was one of the original Avengers, Marvel's answer to DC's Justice League which of itself updated version of the Justice Society that began in the forties. He never was a particular favorite of mine. He seemed too much like a robot. In that, his suit contained all the super powers he could have. His alter ego, Tony Stark, stripped of his suit, had no super powers of his own except for his genius for making such a suit. With a weakened heart, he couldn't even be match for his counterpart in DC, Bruce Wayne. a.k.a. Batman. There's actually a precursor of Iron Man in cinema though in comics, he came first. That precursor was RoboCap, a supercop who became for robot than man. In fact, there's a least two scenes that directly the earlier superhero but done differently enough. John Favreau has made successes in making comedies. He does show a great comedic touch is directing the script written by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the later who's from India, assuring the Aghanistan are treated as people and their plight of villagers shown. But it's the casting that really works here. Robert Downey, Jr., plays Tony Stark as a spoiled playboy millionaire who's able to deadpan the most chauvinistic lines with a straight face. Gyneth Paltrow is also very good as Pepper Potts (what a name!) who plays his assistant, which includes taking out the trash, meaning some beautiful woman that Stark beds then instantly forgets. Actually, why she would any interest in him at all is a problem with the script, not her performance as she does come across as very smart even when she's playing the damsel in distress. The main antagonist is played by Jeff Bridges, who's obviously enjoying himself and even looking a bit like Bruce Willis with his shaved head and goatee. The BBF (Black Best Friend) falls on Terrance Howard's shoulders who at one point sees an outfit and says to himself 'Not this time.' Well, there's no secret as of this writing that there is going to be an Iron Man 2. What was really unexpected was if one said a few years ago that Downey would helm one of the best super heros made, that would have seemed impossible. He has the rare quality to be likable when he's doing the most rude things. How he ends the movie almost makes one stand up and cheer. The movie also gives an interesting question. Can peace be achieved by using the military correctly? As this is 2008, creating war weapons is big business and that is actually the business Tony Stark is in to make his billions. Will he find the heart to do what's right? To even have such a question come up is not bad for a comic book movie.",9,1,2,14 May 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Who was the third musketeer? I don't know either.
","Before I did, I must admit the only Danny Boyle film I have seen before this is TRAINSPOTTING, desperate youths whose getting high is the thing. It's practically a slapstick comedy compared to what the slumdog kids aka the three musketeers go through. It doesn't matter that the happy ending is improbable. Dramatically it works.The basic storytelling structure is a series of flashbacks. Jamal (Dev Patel) is about to be given the 20,000,000 Rupee question on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.' The host Kumar (Anil Kappor) strongly suspects Jamal, this slumdog, India English slang for gutter trash, is cheating. He turns him over to the cops who torture him. In fact, it's this torture that launches this narrative.However, when no confession comes out, the Police Inspectoer (Irfan Khan) listens to Jamal's story. It turns out that just about all events that has happened to Jamal's life has been key to all the questions being answered on the show. Also in these images is the smiling Latika (Freida Pinto) whose story gets revealed.In fact, both Jamal's and Latika's characters get played by younger actors along with Jamal's older brother Salim (adult played by Madhal Pattal) who saves Jamal from blindness but who also takes Latika away from him. That these kids survived into adulthood is a miracle onto itself.However, there is humor interspersed. Would you fall into a pile of human excrement just to get an autograph? But mostly, it's the underbelly of child predators, street gangs and even prostitution of barely legal virgins that gets exposed here.I already gave too much away but will close what clinched my like of this movie for me. One of my favorite books growing up was 'The Three Muskateers' by Alexandre Dumas. I'm glad the last question pertained to that.",9,1,3,17 November 2008
From Here to Eternity," I've found parts of this very odd
","This is the film that won an Oscar for Frank Sinatra. It would win seven others, including picture, director Zinneman, screenwriter and fellow supporting player Donna Reed, who's really has as much screen time as Deborah Kerr. One of Sinatra's problems was a merciless beating he gave to a reporter few years earlier and he gets beaten to death here. Well, this was made when my parents' generation was young and they loved Sinatra. That's why I started my first sentence the way I did.The real stars are Burt Lancaster, who doesn't want to be an officer though he definitely acts like one even when doing work he disagrees with. Actually, a more conflicted and less likable character than Montgomery Clift's, who gets the treatment for refusing to box because he blinded somebody.To get back at his commanding officer, Lancaster romances Deborah Kerr, who's at the top of her game here as is he. But I found myself more involved with Cliff getting the treatment. His one friend is Sinatra who at times shares in getting the treatment too.Cliff falls for one of the girls, actually a prostitute but this is 1953, sensitively played by Donna Reed which pretty mush throws logic out the window. Frankie boy gets drunk and tangles with Ernest Borginine which will eventfully lead to fatal results.However, I can't help liking this film. Zimmerman made his actors all act earnestly and I believed them even when I knew I shouldn't.Unspoken but it's there in the last Lancaster-Kerr scenes, is that he really does want to an officer in the army but in his terms not hers. Then the Japanese strike and Lancaster takes command.Cliff gets cut down from friendly fire hiding out with Reed after killing Borgnine out of revenge for Sinatra. The movie ends with two female leads on a boat to San Francisco with their tossed leis showing that neither will return to Hawaii.Contary to urban legend, George Reeves is in this. It's a small part but he's there showing what charm he did posses.",8,2,2,5 January 2008
Atonement," It's Hard to Forgive Yourself
","Probably the best romantic movie of 2007, this is very much Brimley's story as portrayed by three actresses, child, young adult and elderly women. Even the scenes where she's not in it, it's her imagination as what transgressed between James McAvoy's and Keira Knightly's characters. Brimley is a writer, established immediately in the first scene. Even the opening credits are in courier font and the 'music' is typewriter noises. Brimley has written a play that her guests, a red head and twins are very reluctant to participate in. She looks out the window and sees her older sister disrobe herself in front of a handsome man and jump in the deep fountain. Moments later, she comes out and puts her outer garments on over her wet undergarments and Brimley's curiosity is completely buzzed as to what actually happened.With a nod to Kurosawa, the action is repeated but this time with only McAvoy and Knightly present. This must be said here that they make a very lovely couple. There are other characters, a brother who's hardly in the movie and his friend who does the nasty with the red-hair that McAvoy will be falsely accused of. That fact doesn't get revealed right away because the second act is not told chronologically.Just when you thought everything is all explained, fast forward to when Brimley is an established novelist, being interviewed for her twenty-first novel that she reveals whose atonement this really is. Because the main character is a third person seeing the love story, there's a bit disengagement to the doomed couple. We know McAvoy couldn't have done the rape because he simply did not have the time. He was too busy bringing back the twins. He must have had a lousy lawyer because to jail he went and the redhead remained silent.But overall, a very enjoyable movie. Great dialog, scenery and performances all around.",8,0,1,2 February 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not everything works in this guilty pleasure but a fun ride
","I had to rent this because I have a friend who has two girls and he quoted the joke that the mama said about her two boys. They were named Walker and Texas Ranger because if she wanted them to be girls she'd call them Dr. Quinn and Medicine Woman. Not an exact quote so I could clean up the language.Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly make a great comedy duo. Add Sacha Cohen as the French race car rival and you have enough a fun ride, pun included.One scene that went on for way too long was the bit where Farrell thought he was on fire. Also, the vulgarity that came out of the boys' mouths did come across at times as being too mean. But I have to admit, a lot of what they said was also very funny.A lot has been said about all the product placement, which of course, can't be avoided with NASCAR, especially when making a spoof of it. Thus, the joke sponsors to no sponsor was right on the money.Gary Cole gave a great dead pan performance. Jane Lynch, Admy Adams and Leslie Bibb as the women in the great all had their own moments in this.It's easy to see how this became one of Will Ferrell's biggest hits.",7,0,0,9 January 2008
