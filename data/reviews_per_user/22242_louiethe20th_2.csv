The Hangover," Highly overrated
","The most overrated film since Pulp Fiction. A bunch of morons running around dropping F-bombs is not funny to me. Total waste of film and resources. I found myself saying to myself,'This has to get better soon.' The script could have been written by any foul mouthed 10 year old, there was very little plot originality whatsoever in this movie. If it were not for the 17 to 30 year old crowd, this film would not have made it past its third weekend.Movies like this one are an example of the downfall and/or decline of Hollywood. It seems like they throw these types of movies together and hype them to death and the young crowd always falls for it. I am sorry I wasted my valuable time on this garbage.",Null,6,13,17 May 2010
Elf," Go see it
",I really enjoyed this film!  Will Ferrell was very funny and kept me interested the whole time.  I highly recommend this movie for one and all. I left the theater feeling really good.  The writing was fresh and very original.,Null,0,2,16 November 2003
