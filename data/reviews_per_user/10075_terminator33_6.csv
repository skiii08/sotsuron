Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than it gets credit for
","I think that this film is a misunderstood one, it is the begining to legendary series of films, people were expecting more out of this movie than they should of. No, this film is not as good as the originial trilogy, but it does hold up against them. I think that this film has more to offer than some of the other films in the trilogy do. It has more to offer in the action department than the other films do, I especially enjoyed the pod race and the lightsaber battles.",10,0,1,7 May 2000
The Terminator," Still great after all these years
","I just realized it has been nearly 16 years since 'The Terminator' was released and it is still as great as it ever was. This is the movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger who he is today. He was perfectly cast in this movie nobody could have been better. While I still prefer the sequel over this movie, this is still a great movie.",Null,0,0,11 May 2000
Predator," A film that gets better with age
","I love 'Predator', it has been 13 years since this film was released and it still holds up extremely well. Behind a few other films this is Schwarzenegger's best. This film is well cast, and very well directed by John McTiernan, this is one classic film that will probably never be dated. This one is a classic, don't miss it.",9,1,2,18 May 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," My Favorite Movie
","'Terminator 2' is my favorite movie. I think this is a great movie, without a doubt the best thing that either Schwarzenegger or Cameron has done. James Cameron is an expert director, he can make movies that are thrilling to watch and yet can be touching at the same time. The visual effects in this film are still outstanding despite being 9 years old. The performamces in this film are very good also, even from Schwarzenegger. This is just a great movie.",10,2,2,7 May 2000
Pulp Fiction," One of the best and most influential movies of the 90's
","To be honest 'Pulp Fiction' was the most influential movie of the 1990's. It has been endlessly copied by endless people. This film is like nothing else, it has a flawlessly told story, great direction, superb acting. Of all the films that copied this movie none of them even came close to equaling this movie. This is a movie not to be missed.",10,1,2,11 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," A well acted and directed thriller
","'The Sixth Sense' is not scary by any means, but it is well acted and directed. Young Haley Joel Osment turns in a very strong performance as a kid who sees ghosts. Bruce Willis is somewhat subdued in this movie he doesn't seem as lively in this movie as he has been in other movies. This film is directed with skill by M. Knight Shalmayan, he tries to get the best out of his actors even Bruce Willis. But overall this is a well acted and directed thriller.",8,0,0,11 May 2000
