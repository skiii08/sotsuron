The Blair Witch Project," My thoughts on the Blair Witch
","I felt that the movie seemed real for a couple of reasons. One that the actors were my age.  The second was the setting, and the fact that they waited on a day to day basis alone in the woods waiting for a milk jug with instructions in it.  This made the movie not seem like a movie at all.  We all know that the movie isn't real, but it is interesting that the concept is so clear of what actually happens. To those who thought the movie seemed not so real, will you be taking a trip to the woods alone any time soon?",10,1,3,11 January 2000
