The Rock," Accurate and to the point
",I don't care what the critics say. I don't care what anyone says. This movie really rocks. Pure entertainment! I don't need to watch Citizen Kane all the time! Oysters and snails!,10,2,2,8 September 2002
In the Name of the Father," Great movie, no more no less.
","Great movie, great acting, edge of your seat suspense, a complete slam dunk. My favorite prison and police corruption movie. Now, I know that movies are made to make money. They have to be entertaining in order to do so. Sometimes, some 'higher concept' can be infused without violating the 'make money' rule. However, anyone looking for historical accuracy in ANY movie, would be as well looking for gold at the end of a rainbow. Just pick your favorite 'accurate' movie and do a little digging. You quickly get into fantasy land. The answer? Stop looking for history in the movies. They are not real - even when 'based on a true story' - whoever's reality that is! No. Just accept it for what it is. A fictionalized account of someones perception of reality twisted into good plot. That said: Great movie, great acting, edge of your seat suspense, a complete slam dunk. Look for a history lesson elsewhere.",9,0,0,5 January 2003
Django Unchained," Awesome
","Saw this yesterday. A modern classic. Up there with the best. Loved every frame and every word. Not since The Wild Bunch have we seen such bloody violence. Grim, funny, thought provoking and every cast member just right. Downright sick in places. This and Killer Joe have given me hope that American Cinema is not only not dead but alive and kicking!!!!! QT is getting closer to Stanley Kubrick in that he makes few movies, but when they appear they are masterful. For my money, I really look forward to a QT movie and didn't know what to expect from Django. Of course, I'd seen the good original (Nice to see Franco Nero pop up) and a few of the tawdry follow ons. What we got was a pierce of cinematic art. Truly a must see and begs to be seen often. Definitely not for kids or those who seek out political correctness.",10,3,11,31 December 2012
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Extremely important masterpiece but often difficult to watch
","Unless you have seen this movie, it may be impossible to understand just how important this movie is from what you may have read. Most reviewers focus in on the unbelievably realistic depictions of torture, rape, humiliation and murder. What makes it even more shocking and ultimately disturbing is that the victims are vulnerable young adolescents and the fact the perpetrators look like regular people. It is extremely hard to get past the horrors presented on the screen. However, this movie shows what happens (and did happen under fascist regimes) when there is no accountability for wrongdoing. The strong prey on the weak. However, the movie suggests that things degenerate beyond preying on the weak to the using, abusing and disposing of them without remorse. Pasolini clearly had very strong, and as history has proven, accurate views on mans inhumanity to man. Nazi Germany provided ample examples covering the full spectrum of atrocities of the weak being disposed of by the strong. Suffice to say that while the movie depicts all kinds of horrors, it does not stray from the reality that history teaches. In fact, to tone down the scenes would actually give a distorted view. Making the unthinkable thinkable. The realism forces the viewer to become repulsed by what is on the screen. Some scenes are almost unwatchable. You are almost forced to the conclusion that this cannot be allowed to happen again. Sadly, I think Pasolini believed that this was the normal state for humans without laws. He might be right.I watched this movie on DVD. The disc is part of the Criterion Collection and unfortunately no longer in print. The movie was widescreen with English subtitles. Quality was excellent. The movie is well directed and photographed. I got the feeling I was looking at the events unfolding as a voyeur. The actors do not act to the camera. In fact, they seem almost oblivious to the camera. Instead, they act to themselves and the scene giving the strong impression to the viewer that they are not a part of what's going on but are outside observers. This movie is a very important piece. Unfortunately, the warning it carries will not get a wide audience because of censorship and lack of availability. Also, it may disturb many who do see it. It reminds me of the reaction people have to the horrors filmed in the concentration camps of WWII. It is important for people to see but very hard to watch. Salo is a reminder of what can happen and why vigilance is always necessary.So if you do get the chance to see the movie, grab it. It is definitely not a family movie or a date movie or any kind of movie really. It is in a class of it's own. Some have written that it is the most depraved, disgusting and distressing movie ever made. One reviewer said it was the only movie he wished he could unsee'. While I would not go quite that far, you have been warned.",10,5,11,11 March 2000
Braveheart," Wonderful epic.
","I went to see this movie and expected to be disappointed. However, Mel Gibson did an exceptional job. The action sequences are very impressive. The scenery is wonderfully photographed.  Truly a marvelous movie. Can't wait for its release on DVD.",10,2,3,27 January 2000
Gladiator," Very Good movie
","Great battle scenes. Great photography. Visually stunning. Ridley knows how to make a movie that looks outstanding. CGI at it's best. Thought all the cast were perfect except....the bad guy. Sure he was mean - said and did bad things, but I couldn't see him in quite the same light as the bad guy in the Patriot. He WAS bad.",10,0,0,7 July 2000
