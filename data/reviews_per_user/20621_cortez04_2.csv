Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie is Great
","This is actually a great film, the first Star Wars I ever saw and the one that made me fall in love whole thing. Older people may try and claim that it's not as good as the originals, but then older people are rubbishThe above is all I would have like to say on the subject but it seems I have to drone on for at least 10 line (Hey that two away already)This film features the most amazing lightsaber battle and while not as complex a the sequence in ROTS it is still my favourite.As those who claim there is no story, well there is. This film expands greatly on the highly enjoyable planet-hopping featured in ROTJ and is worth watching just for that.",10,0,2,6 September 2006
Hostel," The Single Worst Film I Have Ever Seen
","I think that is all I could really say. This film is terrible; truly, truly terrible.The tagline to this film; Welcome to your worst nightmare', is fitting. Everything about Hostel was ludicrous and for lack of a better word; RubbishIt is my personal belief that those behind this film set out with the sole intention of making as much money as the could with as little effort as possible, and that goes for producer to director to actor, all involved have a lot to answer for.It has no redeeming features whatsoever.The plot is absolutely ridiculous and both the performances and direction were lacklustre at best.The amount of gore is simply sickening and there is no justification for it at all.This film isn't even really a horror film; you could get the exact same experience from visiting a slaughter house,(or poking yourself in the eye) there's no fear or suspense involved, it's just disgusting.Avoid it like the plague.",1,2,4,29 September 2006
