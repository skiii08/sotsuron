The Lobster," Hit or Miss: No In between
","I really liked this movie. My wife really did not, and I think that sums up how most viewers will respond to this off-beat, very dark comedy. You'll either be into it or very turned off by it. As others have written, this quirky film is reminiscent of Wes Anderson's work, but without the sweet center at its core. I won't recap the plot. But I will say that I loved the deadpan dialogue that reminds us just how absurd life really is. And despite the laughs falling off in the second half of the film, that part is also important to the underlying thesis: human beings are mostly conformists to systems that they lock into place, for what start off as good reasons but are at odds with the complexity of human nature, at heart. That's why the second half is crucial here. The loners' group extremism is just as bizarre and unyielding as the City dwellers they battle.",8,0,2,14 December 2016
Lion," Better Storytelling: Fact V. Fiction
","I really like the basic story here and the actors are all top-notch. But, honestly, I was not as wrapped up in the narrative as I should have been. I think the script meanders and stalls too much in getting to the core mission animating the film: finding Saroo's mother. That's what we want to see. Instead, we get lots of up/down melodrama in Australia while I felt 'come on, get on with it.' When the grown Saroo finally makes the trip. His reunification is so easy and coincidental that it comes as a let down (Note: This may have been the way it happened in real life, but real life does not always make good fiction) I see most people give this film high marks. I wanted to like it more but too many times, it zigged where I thought it should zag, leaving me impatient, bored and frustrated.",6,3,5,24 May 2017
Jackie," Not What You expect from a Bio Pic
","Without repeating what others have noted, this is not a sweeping nor insightful biography into Jackie O's life (no pre-First Lady debutante nightlife or Aristotle Onassis aftermath). Instead, we are dropped into an impressionistic swirl of events right before, during and after JFK's Nov '63 assassination. The moodiness and weight of the tragedy are palpable, but the story drags and teases--giving us glimpses of other historical context, then pulling us back to Jackie's chain smoking grief.Today, Natalie Portman was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance here. And a great performance it is. But be warned that she has a good 60 - 70% of the lines and the ponderous pace makes this one a challenge to stay awake for during a late night showing. However, I'm giving this film a 7 because to his credit, the director does pick up the pace somewhat in the last 15 minutes and tries to tie this emotional endurance test into some kind of meaningful, memorable package.",7,0,3,5 January 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," Another Bomb for the Coen Bros.
","I'm glad this one was on HBO because if I paid for it at a theater I'd be really unhappy (and, once again, disappointed at a Coen Bros. film). I'm not saying that a film cannot have a variety of tones and multi-layered themes. But at the end of the day, it must know what it wants to be overall: a comedy, a message movie, a thriller, a historical film, etc.Hail, Caesar is crammed full of A-list actors stuck in a failed concept of a movie. I can't say that the Coen Brothers are afraid to go for it, whatever 'it' is. Sometimes their off-beat approach strikes gold as in Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo or O' Brother Where Art Thou. Then again, they have more than their fair share of black comedy (?) bombs such as Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading and The Lady Killers. Well, sorry to say, add this Hail, Caesar to the bomb list and hope their next project is another gem like No Country for Good Men or True Grit.",6,3,4,2 January 2017
Arrival," OK, but not an 8.5
","Being a sci-fi guy who loves serious, well-conceived sci-fi (e.g. Interstellar, Battlestar Galactica (new one), Inception, The Martian, 2001, 2010, etc.) I saw this the first week out. And given the 8.5 rating and the director's previous work (Sicario, Prisoners) I fastened my seat belt for an intense ride, but alas, I almost needed a seat belt to keep from sliding out of my seat during the late evening showing. In fact, my wife did go to sleep on it. OK, so does that mean Arrival is a boring movie? For me, no, I appreciate elaborate, fairly plausible detail to create a story with authenticity that increases its impact.But, given my expectations going in (Sicario was a very intense, wild ride and Prisoners was also a white-knuckler) so I was surprised at the deliberate and ponderous pacing, which mixed with the disjointed narrative, never create any real narrative momentum--even at the end when it's time for a climax/crisis. By then, we're trying to get our bearings and decide if we care enough about the story and the protagonists.So, I would definitely classify this one as for sci-fi nerds only. Not bragging, but I also earned an MA in linguistics, so I was familiar with the overarching concept undergirding the story, which makes it intellectually interesting but ... Still, I found it to be a movie that needs some re-editing and more oomph!",7,2,8,22 November 2016
Alien: Covenant," Time to stop
","The first Alien film was basically a horror movie in space (no one can hear you scream) while the second was a kick ass war movie (in 1986 a Vietnam redo/underestimating one enemy parable. The late Bill Paxton stole the show). But after that the Alien movies that have followed have been unnecessary money grabs (Ok, that might be an oxymoron to Hollywood execs).The final death spiral of the franchise has to be the beautiful and utterly nonsensical Prometheus and this Prometheus sequel. Again, like Prometheus, there are some very well done set pieces in the film, especially the fights. But the overarching God creator nonsense falls apart in so many different ways (what about other primates?) and once again the crew is so clueless that I found myself in the theater asking' Why am I sitting here?' Well, I won't be sitting there five years from now when Hollywood attempts to cash in again.",6,0,6,28 May 2017
