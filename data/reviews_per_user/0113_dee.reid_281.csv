The Rock," 'The Rock' rocks!
","Every time I see 'The Rock,' I'm reminded of why I love action movies. They just can't seem to get any better than this. I may get slammed by others for proclaiming such strong admirations for such a movie, but it's squarely my opinion. But to remove myself from opinion and move in the direction toward known fact, 'The Rock' is an essential action film for any action-film fan.Three years ago I bought the last remaining Criterion Collection DVD at my local video store and I can see now beyond the horizon that another edition of this masterpiece probably isn't coming any time soon. It is squarely the best film ever done by music video champ-turned-big-budget-Hollywood-music-video-director Michael Bay and the last film ever produced by the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer duo (Simpson died shortly before 'The Rock' was released and the film is dedicated in his memory).But 'The Rock' is all about one thing: entertainment, and nothing else. It's a hell of a ride from start to finish with plenty 'o explosions, humor, car chases, and one-liners supplied in a dynamite script by Douglas Cook, Mark Rosner, and David Weisberg (that also contains un-credited work from Quentin Tarantino). Even after this praise, you are, naah, you're not, still interested in seeing why 'The Rock' is so essential, are you?To put it like this, the action begins with General Francis 'Frank' R. Hummel (Ed Harris) having a vigil at his wife's grave and tells her that he is about to make a haste decision in the name of the many men who have died under his command and were consequently forgotten by the American government.So he and his men stage a daring heist at a military depot and make off with 16 rockets loaded with deadly V-X gas, which in the words of one of the film's characters, 'Is one of the deadliest substances known to man.' Their next move is to make a point that they aren't to be toyed with anymore. So Frank stages a hostage takeover at Alcatraz prison in San Francisco Bay. He tells the kids that are part of a tour group to head back to the boats while the 88 hostages are held in the prison's cells.Hummel demands the government make restitutions to the surviving family members of every man who has given his life for this country and if they aren't met, San Francisco will be reduced to nothing but a giant cloud of poison gas. The Pentagon and assorted officials know the score: they know that Hummel knows he isn't to be messed with and they take his demands seriously.A plan is put into effect: a SEAL team is dispatched to try to retake the island, but there is one catch. No one alive knows the inner workings of Alcatraz prison. No one knows, except John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man known to have escaped the infamous island and lived to tell about it. But he's under maximum security incarceration because in the eyes of one F.B.I. Director John Womack (the late John Spencer), he knows all of America's most 'intimate' secrets (including who really shot JFK) and allowing Mason to be on the loose would be a pretty bad idea.There is a third prong: an F.B.I. lab rat with no field experience, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is also assigned, and with Mason in tow, they'll accompany the SEALs to Alcatraz to try to dismantle the rockets and Hummel. Of course Goodspeed is reluctant but because a baby is on the way with his longtime girlfriend, he decides he has no choice but to go.From then on, you know the game since any attempt to further describe the plot would be an exercise in futility: lots of people get shot, firefights, and breakneck pacing that's trademark of one Mr. Bay and any film produced by a certain Mr. Bruckheimer. What keeps this boat afloat is the dynamic and unlikely partnering of Connery and Cage, who both know their roles well and play off one another, add to the other's performance like old friends as they navigate through Alcatraz's labyrinth of dark tunnels and sewers. Ed Harris is even given a third dimension in his villain role that elevates him above the typical action-movie bad guy. He's a soldier with a chip on his shoulder and his argument is quite convincing (I almost bought into myself). But his true motives later become the subject of a rather colorful and inventive plot twist late in the film.'The Rock' is why we go to theaters for action in the first place. My view: 'The Rock' rocks, big time.Just check it out to see.10/10",10,9,14,30 June 2006
Whip It," 'Whip It' Good!
","This was not a bad movie in the slightest. In fact, it was very good. I guess Drew Barrymore (in her directorial debut) has been around movies along enough that she could eventually try her hand at directing and be pretty good at it. 'Whip It' is a pretty fun movie, even if you know where it's all going to go in the end.Bliss Cavendar ('Juno' Ellen Page) is searching for direction in her life, stuck in a dead-end job as a waitress in Bodeen, Texas, and living under the misdirected beauty-pageant guidance of her loving but dominating mother (Marcia Gay Harden). By chance, Bliss discovers a flier for the roller derby league in nearby Austin and tries out. Much to her surprise (but not to ours), her speed on the track earns her a spot on the Hurl Scouts, who have a reputation for playing hard but also for not having won a single derby match in the entire time that they've been a team. Playing under the derby name 'Babe Ruthless,' she comes under the guidance of fellow player Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) and Coach Razor (Andrew Wilson), and makes mortal enemies out of star, and rival player, Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis).'Whip It' was wicked fun at the movies, made even more fun by its mix of comedy, drama and teen romance, plus its girl-power attitude and proto-feminist undertones. While I'm a guy, some of this stuff may seem lost on me, but I did enjoy myself.Drew Barrymore proves that she's been in show business long enough that she knows her way both in front of the camera and behind the camera; she plays Bliss's roughhousing teammate Smashley Simpson, and I must say that Barrymore certainly knows how to poke fun at herself at great personal expense and take a few for the team. As far as her directing talents go, she could have made 'Whip It' some kind of little artsy indie flick, but no. Instead, she goes for the gold and makes a fun little sports chick-flick that is confident, assured, emotional and above all, fun.Page is also quite good, playing almost the exact opposite of her 'Juno' character, because this time her Bliss Cavendar/'Babe Ruthless' is somewhat of a dork, quiet, and doesn't give off as much sass. I was able to better relate to her character here than I did in 'Juno,' even though I really like 'Juno'; I just had a little bit more fun with Bliss than I did with her character three years ago.'Whip It,' which was adapted from the 2007 book 'Derby Girl' by Shauna Cross (also the film's screenwriter), is an astoundingly fun and well-made little feature from Drew Barrymore, one of the industry's most seasoned pros under the age of 40. Since she's been in show business pretty much all of her life, you can guarantee that if she gives up acting, that directing is something that is right up her alley.8/10",8,4,10,20 February 2010
The Avengers," 'The Avengers' (2012)
","As you well know by now, 'The Avengers' is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss 'Firefly' Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets 'The Avengers' many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!10/10P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before 'The Avengers #4' when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)? This was my only real complaint about 'The Avengers.'",10,27,51,9 July 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Conclusion
","With the two-volume series of films that come to be known as 'Kill Bill,' Quentin Tarantino has achieved a level of creativity lacking in most modern films that will take years to surpass.  'Kill Bill' is, in fact, an amalgam of all the grindhouse cinema outings that Tarantino made during the 70s.When you think real hard about it, the plot to 'Kill Bill' is absolutely ludicrous, and under the direction of a normal filmmaker, wouldn't make it past the 50-minute mark.  But under Tarantino's careful guidance, that ludicrous plot remains ludicrous, but he injects his requited love of cinema into the material and the plot suddenly takes a life and a whole new spin.'Kill Bill' is by far Tarantino's most accomplished work as a director, considering that I typically favor his non-directorial efforts ('True Romance,' 'Natural Born Killers,' 'From Dusk Till Dawn') over his own directorial outings ('Reservoir Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Jackie Brown').I certainly look forward to more from Quentin Tarantino in the future being that with 'Kill Bill,' he has created a cinematic epic of one man's love of movies and then seeing it realized on the screen.",10,0,1,10 August 2004
Black Swan," Nina, the Crazy-Crazy Ballerina, in 'Black Swan'
","This is certainly one of the better films I've seen of an actor who becomes a character who becomes another character. (Whoa.) This is the case with Nina Sayers (Academy Award-Winner Natalie Portman), a perfectionist New York ballet dancer who is cast in a stage production of 'Swan Lake' as the lead Odette, the pure, delicate, innocent 'White Swan.' The overbearing creep of a theater director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), who is the one behind the production, thinks that Nina has the White Swan part of her character down perfectly, but the greater part of the seductive, evil Odile, 'Black Swan' is causing her great difficulty because she is not 'losing herself' in the part. Greater difficulty comes from Nina's overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), who is a failed dancer now an amateur artist. Pretty soon, Nina begins to display a number of frighteningly psychotic symptoms, representing itself in a number of disturbing hallucinations and paranoia, the latter brought on by her belief that a fellow cast-mate who has just flown in from San Francisco, Lily (Mila Kunis), is out to steal her part away from her. 'Black Swan' is one of the better films I've seen in which an actor (or actress, in this case), really comes to transform themselves into someone (or something) else entirely, in which by the end they are totally unrecognizable from the person that they were before; that is one of the most significant things actors and actresses can do in their film roles, and Natalie Portman's Oscar-winning performance here is one recent, pristine example of this. She starts out as pure and simple and innocent - like her White Swan 'Swan Lake' character Odette - but soon she finds herself treading deeper, darker waters as Odile, and the film tracks her gradual descent into madness and despair. The film makes no attempt to cover up the physically demanding arena of the ballet world; just look at some of the injuries Portman's character endures in her quest to become the best. Darren Aronofsky directed the film, which is a dark meditation on perfectionism and psychosis in the ballet world - since many people may have a hard time associating mental illness with the art. Aronofsky isn't one of my favorite filmmakers, but he did direct 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000), which is one of my favorite movies of all time and one of the best anti-drug pictures ever made. Because 'Black Swan' deals somewhat with the notion of doppelgangers and being haunted by an evil double, I make a brief nod to the Japanese animation (Anime') film 'Perfect Blue' (1998), a psychological thriller that Aronofsky paid homage to in a famous scene in 'Requiem for a Dream' with actress Jennifer Connelly. Just something to think about if you get the time to see either film.10/10",10,0,1,29 March 2011
Scarface," Probably THE best gangster movie ever made
","Tony Montana(the never-better Al Pacino) along side his best friend Manny Ray(Steven Bauer) come to America from Cuba.  They quickly rise to power and become two of the most powerful gangsters in all of Miami. 
This is probably my favorite gangster movie with the underrated 'Hoodlum' being my first.  Al Pacino should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his awesome performance as Tony Montana.  His portrayal is that of a person who simply wants to succeed in his life and escape his horrid past under communism.  The only problem with that is that he's going about all the wrong ways of doing it.  Viewers should also be warned about the excessive violence in this movie.  I mean the famous chainsaw scene certainly is something.  Brian De Palma really should have gotten an Oscar for Best Director for direction in this movie is slick.  I would also like to point out that a lot of gangster rappers love this movie.  Most notably rapper Scarface.   This movie also has some of the best quotes in movie history like:Tony Montana -'say hello to lil' friend!'Tony Montana -'this country is just like a giant p***y, it's just waiting to get f****d.'The 'f' word is used quite a lot to.  10/10",10,0,1,10 December 2001
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Americans, stupid
","(Now here is improv comedy at its best, or worst, depending on your point-of-view. On a dreary, rain-soaked day in Virginia, this flick eased my Election Day jitters.)In 'Borat!: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,' the new film from director Larry Charles and starring 'Da Ali G Show' Sacha Baron Cohen of Britain as his Kazakhstan-born alter-ego Borat Sagdiyev, the U.S. and A gets a hilarious dose of its own medicine in showing the world our ignorance of places we only see on the news. (How many of us can point out the Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan on a map? Hint: It's NOT a part of the Middle East, as its Middle Eastern-sounding name might imply.) In recent weeks, 'Borat!' has received the scorn of not only folks here at home (who claim the film is pure propaganda - overlooking the fact it's a satire, not a political piece), but of officials high up in the Kazakhstan government, who have denounced his portrayal of their country as a bunch of backward hicks, as well as his false representation of Kazakhstan. In 'Borat!,' a quasi-documentary/movie, Borat is sent by his government to the United States to learn the economic, racial, and social traits that could be adopted on his native soil. On a hilarious whirlwind tour through New York, Washington, D.C., North Carolina, Georgia, Texas and finally California, we get to see that we are not so perfect ourselves. During these Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, Borat and his pudgy sidekick Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) try America on for size. Borat learns to drive an automobile, is coached on humor and etiquette, purchases an ice cream truck, crashes a rodeo (which seems to get the worst of the skewering when Borat eviscerates the National Anthem), buy a bear (for protection, and also rides along in the back of their truck, and scares the daylights out of passing children), stay overnight at a bed & breakfast run by an elderly Jewish couple, ransack a hotel room in a naked brawl (that climaxes when the two barge in on a mortgage meeting), hangs out with drunken frat boys, gets 'saved' by Pentecostal Christians, and Borat lusts for former 'Baywatch' babe Pamela Anderson. Borat's love affair with Anderson culminates in a cross-country journey to California to marry her, which has disastrous results. 'Borat!' is as funny as it is offensive. Anyone with a weak stomach should definitely stay away. Already, 'Borat!' is picking up nods as one of the funniest movies of all time, if not the funniest movie of all time; I'll have a hard time disputing that. As his anti-Semitic, woman-bashing alter-ego, Cohen is a natural, playing quite excellently on American ignorance and stupidity, and ransacking our politics in the process. In short, he loves playing both sides of the coin for fools - you'll either love him, hate him, or want to watch him be executed (which his government allegedly threatened to do if his movie was not a success). Few, if any, of Borat's subjects know they're being had. He takes great pride in establishing his country's glorious awkwardness, and then counter-balancing that against our own, backwards nation. I do suspect that we haven't seen the last of talking head Borat Sagdiyev, or his Cultural Learnings of America. Maybe Britain is next?10/10",10,3,15,7 November 2006
Alien 3," Best of the series after Aliens, of course
","I don't understand why people hated on this film so much.  I mean Alien 3 should be a classic of the series.  The first Alien was alright, Aliens rocked, and Alien: Resurrection Rocked x2.  Alien 3 is great.  I liked it because it has a suspenseful atmosphere provided by David Fincher who also directed Seven and Fight Club.  The tone of atmosphere in Alien 3 could only have been pulled off by him.  10/10",10,0,4,9 October 2000
Gremlins," Remember that old Bugs Bunny 'Looney Tunes' short? 'Gremlins'
","1984's 'Gremlins' is really one of the best-known of holiday-themed horror and fantasy films that also double as darkly-humored comedies. That's what 'Gremlins' is, essentially: a Christmas-themed horror-/fantasy-comedy. In that regard, the film has become a perennial Christmas-holiday classic, along the lines of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993) and the more-recent 'Krampus' (2015).'Gremlins' is a movie that I grew up watching throughout my childhood, but I don't think that I've ever really sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. But I do know that I've always liked this movie and gotten a real kick out of it.Executively produced by master cinematic craftsman Steven Spielberg, expertly directed by Joe Dante ('The Howling') and written by future Hollywood hot-shot Chris Columbus ('Home Alone,' 'Mrs. Doubtfire'), 'Gremlins' is set a few days before Christmas in the fictional Midwestern town of Kingston Falls. As an early Christmas present, Billy (Zach Galligan) receives a mysterious, cute little creature known only as a 'mogwai' from his inventor father to keep as a pet; Billy names the adorable critter 'Gizmo.' But taking care of a mogwai is a huge responsibility, we learn, and come with three rules that must be obeyed at all times: keep them away from sunlight, don't let get them wet, and don't let them eat anything after midnight. Seems simple, right?Wrong.Gizmo accidentally gets wet, and he spawns five more mogwai creatures, but these are different from Gizmo. These newly-spawned mogwai are curiously more malevolent and voracious than Gizmo is, and a series of plot machinations result in them transforming into the true 'Gremlins' of the film's title, and soon the small Midwestern town of Kingston Falls is overrun with little, reptilian-looking, mischief-making Gremlins. It's up to Billy and his new crush Kate (Phoebe Cates) to put a stop to these creatures before they have a chance to spread beyond Kingston Falls' borders.'Gremlins' was one of several films released in 1984 that led the MPAA to revise its rating system because the film may not have been suitable for small children - despite its 'PG' rating. It might have been too scary for some young tastes, according to parental groups who complained about the film's violent content. This led to the 'PG-13' rating, which is now the go-to rating for most big-budget Hollywood films released today. If 'Gremlins' were released in 2016, there's no question it would get a 'PG-13' rating from the MPAA.But nonetheless, 'Gremlins' is a thrilling, cackling funny little holiday-themed fantasy-comedy film. The creatures in the film, designed by future Oscar-winner Chris Walas (who won an Oscar for David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' in 1986), are wonderful special effects creations - brought to life by a combination of state-of-the-art animatronics, puppetry, miniatures, and stop-motion effects. Gizmo, as the only 'good' Gremlin, is adorable - but we see what he can become, after witnessing the transformation of his brethren and the havoc they're capable of causing around town. They're dangerous and cause a lot of epic property damage, but Dante and Walas are able to get some incredible laughs out of them later on in the film.'Gremlins' is a delightful little holiday hoot that you won't see anything like for a very, very long time.10/10",10,3,4,22 December 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Green means 'go' - This 'Hulk' was indeed, 'Incredible'
","'The Incredible Hulk.'Believe it or not, I'm one of the few who liked ('liked' is italicized) Ang Lee's 2003 film version 'Hulk,' which saw the first major screen adaptation of the famed Marvel Comics character co-created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1962. Lee co-created a number of characters for Marvel Comics that defied traditional superheroes before them who were perfect and idealized, and instead were flawed and imperfect, and had much more dramatic potential than any other comic book superheroes at that time.Of course the Incredible Hulk has severe anger-management issues, which has set him apart from his Marvel Comics superhero brethren; Bruce Banner (played here superbly by Edward Norton, although I do miss Eric Bana) is a genius, but sensitive and emotionally withdrawn physicist who is exposed to a lethal dose of gamma radiation and that while showing no outward physical damage to his body, forces him to transform into the monstrous green brute the Hulk when enraged - 'don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry/Hulk Smash!' - giving rise to a Marvel Comics version of a Jekyll/Hyde relationship.This character first saw light in Ang Lee's film five years ago, but that film was much-maligned by many fans of the comics and critics. I'm proud to say that I wasn't on the 'hate 'Hulk'' bandwagon in '03. But now, Lee is gone. Replacing him is an entirely new cast and crew that draws much of its inspiration in 'The Incredible Hulk' directly from the Marvel Comics Stan Lee/Jack Kirby source material. Like 'Iron Man,' this film marks the second time Marvel is calling all the shots on a movie production.In the director's seat this time, is the French Louis Leterrier, who directed martial arts sensation Jet Li in the utterly spectacular 'Unleashed' in 2005. To their credit, Norton and Leterrier have sold their film well to this eager movie-going public. While I'll admit that Lee's 2003 film had many faults, it was not entirely unwatchable, and was brilliantly acted and directed and really explored the many troubled layers of its troubled protagonist Bruce Banner.Like many superhero films of late, 'The Incredible Hulk' is a sequel/reboot of Lee's earlier film - replacing the entire cast and crew of the first movie - and takes place five years afterward: Banner is on the run in South America, and is now a day-laborer at a bottling plant in Brazil. On the run from the U.S. military and General Ross (William Hurt) and having to leave behind his beloved Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) - General Ross's daughter - Banner spends his days trying to rid himself of his curse, meditating, and desperately e-mailing an anonymous American scientist back home information about his condition.Meanwhile, General Ross is stepping up his efforts to capture Banner at all costs and use his blood to create an army of super-soldiers. To this end, he's hired a Russian-born mercenary named Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help him. When a confrontation between Banner and Blonsky's men forces Banner to reveal his Big Green alter-ego, that's when Blonsky takes it upon himself to be ready for round-two. Ross has Blonsky injected with an experimental super-soldier serum to be able to fight the Hulk on his terms next time the two meet face to face. But Blonsky craves more power, and eventually is able to get hold of Banner's gamma radiation-contaminated blood to transform himself into Abomination, and then get ready for a mutant-powered, Japanese monster movie-style CGI showdown in Harlem.'The Incredible Hulk' does the incredible and is a massively superior second installment to a franchise that up until its release this year seemed to be at a stalemate. Maybe the reason I was not so disappointed with 'Hulk' in 2003 is because I'm not a reader of The Incredible Hulk comics (those who have read my reviews of superhero movies know that Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero). But Leterrier and his crew have sealed the deal here. Leterrier has made 'The Incredible Hulk' the cinematic equivalent of a well-oiled machine: a masterful, well-paced, and action-packed superhero film that doesn't play dumb to its characters or audience. This is not your typical comic book superhero film: it's dark, it's thematic, and it's much more intense in its action and special effects. Speaking of special effects, this CGI Hulk (voiced by '70s television Hulk Lou Ferrigno, who also shares a cameo credit as a security guard), is much more streamlined and fluid and three-dimensional, a true force to be reckoned with this time out. Norton is the film's emotional centerpiece. He proves to be an unlikely but certainly trustworthy Bruce Banner.What I liked especially about this film was its emotional content. It's clear that Bruce Banner and his CGI alter-ego Hulk have anger management issues. He's cursed. He has some of the worst luck of any superhero in the entire Marvel Comics Universe. Don't make him angry, because, you wouldn't like him when he's angry. Because of that, he's his own worst enemy. Of all superheroes out there saving the world, he's always trying to get rid of his 'gift' (or curse), and failing miserably every time. (Who said that superheroes had to be perfect, all the time?) There are a number of well-acted moments between Norton and Tyler, as they both try to rekindle a doomed love affair that makes up the film's emotional core. I haven't been drawn into one such love affair since 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), my favorite superhero film of all time and my #2 favorite movie of all time.This movie isn't perfect, of course. It has many attributes that make it much stronger than 'Hulk.' The cast could from that film could have been reused here, but it's Hollywood; they always win. Still, 'The Incredible Hulk' does the 'incredible' and then some.9/10",9,6,10,1 July 2008
Mission: Impossible III," 'Mission' does the impossible
","For those walking into the new Tom Cruise movie 'Mission: Impossible III,' a question should be floating around on their mind: Is it too soon? After Cruise's fiasco of a public relations affair last year, his Church of Scientology, and the whole couch-hopping incident and the suspicious May-December TomKat romance with actress Katie Holmes, is 'Mission: Impossible III' too soon for actor Tom Cruise? Can his career be saved by one more measly feature film?The answer: Yes.This is quite simply the best Cruise movie I've seen in years and the actor has never been better. In top form as IMF Secret Agent Ethan Hunt, there's no hint of 'Cruise-control' here and there's plenty of explosions and scenery-jumping to keep even the most skeptical movie-goers on edge.You should be surprised that 'Mission: Impossible III' will include the usual difficult story, special effects gadgetry, at least one moment of intense suspense, and jaw-dropping stunt-work present in the first two films; 'Mission: Impossible' came out in 1996 and was directed by Brian De Palma, while 'Mission: Impossible II' was directed by John Woo in 2000. None of the films share the characteristics of the Bruce Geller television series from which they've lifted their names; only the title and spruced-up theme music remain. Now we're at part 3.Critics have already slated the lack of plot, endless explosions and shoot-outs, and twisting storyline. I guarantee you that those who criticize the plot are only ticked off because they couldn't wind through the turns themselves. It's not even worth describing in any detail, really, since any attempt is an exercise in futility. In fact, it could be summed up like this in one sentence: Ethan Hunt is apparently out of the IMF business and is about to be wed to fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who has domesticated the adventurer, but before he can start the celebrations, he must track down cold-blooded arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the mysterious 'Rabbit's Foot,' and that's all you need to know.Directed, quite competently, I might add, by 'Alias' J.J. Abrams, the film opens with fresh 'Capote' Oscar-winner Hoffman's Davian interrogating Hunt about the whereabouts of 'Rabbit's Foot' while holding a gun to Julia's head. From there on in and after the credits, the movie just kicks into overdrive in delivering twisting and turning (whatever there is) plot and a globe-trotting odyssey from Berlin to the Vatican to Shanghai. Abrams and 'Alias' fans should not be displeased with such break-neck pacing.There is a supporting cast that includes Ving Rhames as 'M:I' regular Luther Strickell (the only actor other than Cruise to appear in all three films), Laurence Fishburne as Hunt's boss Brassel, Billy Crudup as Hunt's supervisor Musgrave, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, and Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg as Hunt's fellow IMF allies. But as Owen Davian, Hoffman is the most surprising and is quite intense, if not somewhat underused, as he eats up the scenery whenever he appears on screen. He's the yang to Cruise's ying and the two play off each other throughout. I really liked him and he's simply the best 'Mission: Impossible' villain yet.But what about the rest of the movie, you ask? Well, like the story it's not worth describing though there are a number of genius action sequences including a helicopter chase through a windmill field, a shootout on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (which brings back memories of another spy caper, 1994's Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle 'True Lies,' which featured a similar bridge-destruction scene), and Cruise having to break into a top-secret medical facility by swinging from one building to another because the rooftops are guarded. These action scenes could be regarded as typical of the genre or artificial, since everything here seems to be a special effect, but I dismiss that criticism since it's a summer movie and it can't possibly get any deeper.And lastly, what about newbie father Tom Cruise? Is he good? Yes, he is. It's been 20 years since he flew with the best of the best in 'Top Gun' (1986) and it's easy to see how far he's progressed since those reckless fly-boy days. Cruise is not on 'Cruise-control' at all; he's on full automatic. He goes where the action goes and we can leave it at that. So what's next, Mr. Cruise, the anti-God weapon in 'Mission: Impossible IV?' Cool. See you at the theater then.Third time's a charm, ain't it?10/10",10,1,3,8 May 2006
Requiem for a Dream," This film is brutal
","In my opinion, very few movies whose subject matter surrounds drugs, are actually able to paint an accurate look at the people who live them. Don't watch 'Requiem for a Dream' thinking that everybody will live happily ever after.  No.  'Requiem for a Dream' shows us when there is no hope or a chance to start over.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans all give superb performances.  Ellen Burstyn's character, Sara Goldfarb, goes by just about everyday of her life watching Tabby Tibbons(Christopher McDonald) on her favorite television show and imagining herself as a contestant.  She sees that the only way she can do it by taking these dietary pills just so she can fit into her red dress.  It isn't long before the diet pills and television start to consume her life and she soon enough takes a hike down the road to addiction.  She has a slowly fading relationship with her son Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto).  It seems to me that the only time they talk is when she is trying to convince him to not pawn the television so he can get drug money.  Harry's drug-induced fantasies on the boardwalk are some of the more disturbing parts of the film.  Harry's best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans), is trying to expand into the drug trade. This is probably the most disturbing part of the film for me because I have never seen Marlon Wayans(nor any of his brothers for that matter) in a really serious film role.  He plays Tyrone so convincingly, that you can pretty much forget about 'Scary Movie'.  The ending scene with Tyrone is probably one of the best parts about this movie.  Jennifer Connelly however, who plays Harry's girlfriend, Marion, is probably the shining light of this movie.  Her Golden Globe for best supporting actress and her Oscar-nomination for the same category in the much recent 'A Beautiful Mind' prove she is a very good actress.  I will not forget the scene where she is at the party.To sum it up, 'Requiem for a Dream' scores a 10 in my book and is now one of my favorite movies.  I am looking to buy the Director's Cut DVD so I can experience this movie to its fullest.",10,0,1,16 February 2002
10 Cloverfield Lane," A lot of secrecy made it worth the wait
","The best thing that can be said about the 2016 J.J. Abrams-produced, Dan Trachtenberg-directed '10 Cloverfield Lane,' is that it keeps you guessing. Abrams has described the film as a 'blood relative' to the 2008 Abrams-produced, Matt Reeves-directed found-footage monster movie 'Cloverfield'; I thought that 'Cloverfield' was one of the best, and most innovative, monster movies ever made, and I think its found-footage approach helped to give the film a perspective unique to giant monster movies.Of course, the only things that '10 Cloverfield Lane' and 'Cloverfield' really have in common is the shared name 'Cloverfield,' and the fact that J.J. Abrams served as a producer on both of the films. But unlike its predecessor, '10 Cloverfield Lane' was not the subject of a huge viral marketing campaign, and in fact very little was done for this film in the way of mass promotion beyond simple film trailers and advertisements and some random Internet chatter. This served to actually benefit the film, in that while 'Cloverfield's' intentions became quite clear (both before the film was released, and during the course of the movie itself), '10 Cloverfield Lane' was shrouded in almost complete mystery from the get-go.That's good, not bad.The best thing that can be said about '10 Cloverfield Lane,' a so-called follow-up to 'Cloverfield' and the second in what appears to be a loosely connected anthology, is that the film keeps you guessing about what it's really about for three-fourths of the entire picture. This film is 104 minutes in length, and yet you don't know what's really going on until around 80 minutes in.That's also very good, not bad.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an interesting mix of thriller and post-apocalyptic science fiction and horror. Like in 'Cloverfield,' the film begins in earnest fashion, opening without a single word of dialogue for about the first four or five minutes. We're introduced to Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who has just left her fiancé following an argument. While driving through the rural back-roads of New Orleans, she gets into a serious car accident when she's distracted by a phone call from her distraught fiancé Ben (voiced by Bradley Cooper, who never actually appears in the film).She wakes up a time later, handcuffed to a bed in the underground bunker of a paranoid conspiracy theorist and survivalist named Howard (John Goodman). Also there is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.), the young man who helped Howard to build the bunker on & off over the years. Howard explains he rescued Michelle from the accident and allowed Emmett to stay after he forced his way into the bunker. Howard also explains their situation: the country, if not the rest of the world (he isn't sure, as he makes clear), has fallen under chemical or nuclear attack from forces unknown - it could be the Russians, the North Koreans, or it could be Martians. He just doesn't know, and neither do we. The three are forced to live together in his underground bunker if they are to survive - even as it becomes clear that Howard is not who he appears to be and that there is a lot more going on than he seems to be letting known to them.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is certainly one of the more original sci-fi/thrillers in recent memory. Unlike 'Cloverfield,' this is a movie that is shot in a third-person narrative, rather than the first film's found-footage hand-held camera style. (At least when watching this film, you won't have to hear people's incessant complaints about the movie inducing vertigo in viewers.) This film is stunningly acted and executed, with John Goodman delivering the most effective performance (and one of his best acting performances ever) of the three leads. John Gallagher, Jr. is also quite sympathetic as Emmett, who is not as dim-witted as he seems and even once had a promising college athletic career ahead of him - but gave it up due to his myopic view of his life and environment. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead - who's no stranger to this genre ('Final Destination 3,' 'Black Christmas,' 'The Thing') - as the film's most significant female presence, is very resourceful and quick to think on her feet, which isn't bad since she explains that she often runs away when things get too tough (like after her argument with Ben). But still, she's no helpless screamer; she'll fight like hell and do anything to survive, which becomes clear as time goes along.All three form an interesting dynamic that makes up the film's emotional core.It would be unfair to really talk about this film's last 20 minutes, since that is the biggest surprise of all and what people will probably go to '10 Cloverfield Lane' wanting to see the most. The question of whether or not this film has a definitive connection to 'Cloverfield' - without giving away any spoilers - also cannot be answered in this review. Trust me, I know. I tried asking the same question to friends who had seen the film already, and they told me what I'm telling anyone who reads anything written here. It's that simple. Sorry.'10 Cloverfield Lane' was an excellent exercise in tension, atmosphere, and performances.I wonder what J.J. Abrams has in store for us next in a few years in the 'Cloverfield' franchise...8/10",8,1,2,22 July 2016
Ali," A beautiful man, a beautiful film
","Michael Mann's 2001 biopic of 'The Greatest' heavyweight boxer that ever lived, Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali (expertly played here by Will Smith, in a rightfully Oscar-nominated performance) is a beautiful film biopic about a beautiful man and a wonderful human being. A controversial and polarizing figure at the peak of his fame, he has earned his spot in sports history and as one of the greatest icons of the Civil Rights Movement. Set over the course of 1964 to 1974 - his peak years - the film covers Muhammad Ali's historic win against Sonny Liston on February 25th 1964, to become the new heavyweight champion of the world; their equally historic rematch a little over a year later on May 25th, 1965 (just as an aside, I found a colorized version of Neil Leifer's famous photograph of Ali standing over the downed Sonny Liston and I have it saved on my computer as a wallpaper); Clay's joining the Nation of Islam and changing his name to 'Muhammad Ali'; his friendships with devoted corner-man Drew 'Bundini' Brown (Jamie Foxx), Howard Cosell (Jon Voight), trainer Angelo Dundee (the late Ron Silver), photographer Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) and especially, Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles); his numerous affairs; to his refusal to be drafted into the Armed Services for the growing U.S. war in Vietnam; his comeback in the early 1970s and the slew of historic matches he fought then; and concluding with his historic match in Zaire with George Foreman on October 30th, 1974 ('The Rumble in the Jungle'), to reclaim the title of world heavyweight champion (which he had been stripped of seven years earlier in 1967 over his anti-war stance). And thus we witness a legend being born. Look at me using the word 'historic' so many times; that's the feeling that Mann's film, and Smith's brilliant portrayal, gets out of the viewer. You're watching history being meticulously recreated by a skilled team of actors and filmmakers. There's a reason why Muhammad Ali's bouts are considered some of the greatest fights the sport of boxing has ever seen: Ali brought a brashness and confidence (some might call it arrogance), and a bravado, and beauty and grace - not to mention a poetic lyricism - to the ring that the sport had never seen before. And the sport of boxing is never likely to ever see a figure as larger-than-life and amazing as the one and only, Muhammad Ali, a.k.a., 'The Greatest.'10/10",10,0,3,4 February 2014
The Expendables 2," You definitely won't be disappointed this time around!
","When I reviewed 'The Expendables' back in 2010, I cited it as proof that Sylvester Stallone is truly getting better with age - just like that old saying about aged wine - because it seems (in my opinion, at least), that some of the films he's made in the last seven years are much better than anything he did at the height of his fame in the '80s and '90s. 'The Expendables' is setting out to be a full-fledged all-star action series, featuring pros young and old - mostly old - sharing major screen-time together.Stallone has bowed out of directing 2012's 'The Expendables 2' - turning things over to 'Con Air' Simon West - though he still remains the star and co-screenwriter. This sequel, as I expected, is bigger and better than the first film, with a bigger cast of pros young and old. The story here is pretty simple and can be summed up as follows. It basically concerns old-school mercenary Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team looking to take down an international arms dealer named Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme, turning in one of the most menacing villain performances in recent memory) and his small private army as they look for weapons-grade plutonium in Albania left over from the Cold War by the former Soviet Union.The whole gang is here, too - Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jansen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and newcomers Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan); plus there's Church (Bruce Willis), Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), and Booker (the almighty Chuck Norris!).The action scenes are incredibly intense and bloody and over-the-top, but are almost comical. The real show, here (for me, at least), was watching Jean-Claude Van Damme playing a bad guy for once, and a truly vile villain at that. He does, by far, turn in the film's best performance and gets into a truly brutal, if anti-climatic, showdown against Stallone's Barney Ross in the film's explosive finale.'The Expendables 2' was a long time coming, but it is one of the most worthwhile action films in recent years, from a group of old-school action pros who know their way around how to make a truly a**-kicking action film.8/10",8,2,3,3 September 2013
Catch Me If You Can," Excellent film
","I just got home after seeing 'Catch Me If You Can' at the movie theater.  I must say that it is a truly amazing film that is funny, sad, and adventurous all at the same time.  The performances are excellent and Steven Spielberg definitely has a winner on his hands.10/10",10,1,2,1 January 2003
Ghost," 'Ghost' - Do you believe?
","The best thing that can be said about 'Ghost' is that it's starkly earnest in the portrayal of two people whose love for one another is boundless, not even by death. So when Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) coos to her yuppie boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) that she loves him, to which he dimly replies 'Ditto,' it's genuine romance - it's the real McCoy.'Ghost' was the romantic hit of 1990 and was directed amiably by Jerry Zucker (of 'Airplane!' infamy) and written by Bruce Joel Rubin, who also scripted 'Jacob's Ladder' that same year, which was another film that questioned the paranormal activity that is life after death. 'Ghost' contains many of the comedic elements on display in Zucker's earlier 'Airplane!' hit but remains pretty loyal to the seriousness of its subject matter.Sam has led a pretty charmed life: he has a beautiful girlfriend, a trustworthy friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn), a well-paying job as a Wall Street banker, and a brand-spanking new apartment with the woman he loves. But Sam's charmed life comes to an abrupt end one night when he's gunned down during an attempted robbery by Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) - 'he's Puerto Rican.'But the movie's not over, as Sam is left to roam the streets of New York City alone and without any way to communicate with the living. He can't be seen or heard by living people, so he spends his days walking the streets and watching carefully over the grieving Molly as she attempts to piece together her life without him. Between doing this and that, Sam eventually learns the identity of his assailant and where he lives but cannot do anything about it.But when all hope seems lost, Sam wanders into a shop run by a storefront psychic named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), who likes to swindle grieving people out of their money by convincing them that she can talk with the dead. It's from their dynamic interactions that much of the film's comedic elements are derived.Oda Mae is shocked when she finds that she really can hear Sam (but can't see him) and he uses her as a medium so that he can communicate with Molly and inform her that she's in danger. (He's able to convince Oda Mae to help him by singing 'Henry the Eight I Am.') Sam, with Oda Mae's help, gradually learns that his death was no random street mugging, and that he was murdered: Willie had been instructed by a mysterious third party to kill Sam and then retrieve his wallet, as he was on the verge of uncovering a money laundering scheme involving drug dealers.'Ghost' does boast one of the most compelling and moving love stories ever told. The story is effective and is certainly a revealing and engaging look at the afterlife. The acting is powerful and profound, as each of the performers fill out their roles with perfect glee and believable emotions. The special effects are dated, but are also quite effective as well in showing us the processes in the afterlife, as it turns out that spirits can interact with the living and doesn't even attempt to spare us the darker sides of death.Since Sam lacks a physical human body, he cannot move objects. But with the help of the tragic ghost (Vincent Schiavelli) that haunts the New York subway, Sam is able to physically interact with the living. He learns that by controlling one's emotions and then letting them erupt like a reactor, he can physically move an animate or inanimate object.Do you believe in ghosts? I believe in karma, and I do believe in life after death. These are all elements in the story that are fleshed out well in Rubin's imaginative script, brought to life by the actors and the guidance of Zucker's direction. I do believe that the ladies might need tissues to wipe away the tears too, as the film's ending would prove.'Ghost,' I believe, is one of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's funny, it's heartwarming, and it's all done in a believable fashion. Love is grand, and it's forever; 'Ghost' will make you believe.8/10",8,4,6,10 July 2005
Iron Man 3," Marvel's Man of Steel, I mean, Iron, returns for part-three
","No one will doubt the fact that since 2008, the superhero movie genre has just simply exploded into a big-budget Hollywood money-making machine. I still remember the days when just this time 20 years ago, superhero movies were still a burgeoning - if not seriously overlooked (by the mainstream) - film genre, and Tim Burton's 1989 'Batman,' or the first two 'Superman' movies starring the late Christopher Reeve, were relegated as the best the genre had to offer.Not anymore.Superhero movies are a dime a dozen now, it would seem. While this was unheard-of in 1994, 20 years later, they're everywhere. It seems that on average, Hollywood is releasing at least two big-budget superhero films a year. This is good for comic book superhero fans who are finally seeing their (modern-day) versions of the ancient Greek gods get the big-screen treatments they deserve. And therein, for this viewer, lies the biggest problem with the latest crop of superhero movies.In past reviews, I've made no attempt to hide the deep love and respect I have for comic books and superheroes. 10 years ago, I got the opportunity to see what I still consider to be the greatest superhero film of all time - 'Spider-Man 2' (2004) - in the theater. Of course, at that time, the superhero movie genre was still gaining wider prominence and acceptance in Hollywood (and by extension, the rest of the mainstream as a whole), and was not the commercial fad that it is now.My problem with the latest crop of superhero movies - meaning most of the films made since 2008 - is that the genre has become formulaic and commercialized. The earlier films made in the second wave of superhero films 10 years ago, and even the films made earlier than that, whether good or bad, were clearly driven by passionate filmmakers who understood the medium and at least tried to give their films some deeper meaning or dramatic/thematic complexity; Donner, Burton, Proyas, Raimi, Singer, and others knew what they were doing back then. I don't really see this type of cinematic artistry, and craft, much anymore; most films are just big, empty, glossy-looking blockbuster spectacles with no greater depth to them than any other major Hollywood film.What I'm saying is that Hollywood has effectively hijacked what was once the most novel and original of film genres and turned it into formula. There have been occasional flashes of brilliance or originality - 'Chronicle' (2012) has so far been the biggest 'original' (meaning not based on pre-existing material) movie made during this time, and I'm sure we were all over-joyed with James Gunn's smart-alecky 'Guardians of the Galaxy' earlier this year.But I got way off-track here, and I must go back to what we were talking about originally, which is 2013's 'Iron Man 3.' 'Iron Man 3' is perhaps the darkest 'Iron Man' to come out yet. One of the biggest regrets I've ever had of this particular Marvel Comics cinematic franchise, is that Marvel's Man of Iron, Tony Stark, has had some of the most harrowing and dramatic personal battles of any superhero since Peter Parker/Spider-Man. While Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired, pitch-perfect casting as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the films have regretfully avoided the deeper dramatic possibilities that made the original comic book character so fascinating: of course, Tony Stark is arguably the most famous superhero to have ever struggled with the perils of drug addiction (alcoholism).While a great inventor and superhero in his own right, underneath the armor, Stark was still a normal human being, and he was vulnerable to the same personal afflictions that could affect any one of us. That was what drew readers to his adventures, both personal and societal, and it was always this dynamic that made it interesting in seeing how he overcame it all. The 'Iron Man' films have largely taken the 'safer' (commercial) route.In this third cinematic outing, set just before the Christmas holidays, Stark is still his big old arrogant self, though for some reason he's suffering the effects of PTSD as a result of the events of 'The Avengers' (2012). This time out, he's battling a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who may or may not also be connected to yet another corporate rival named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). In the meantime, Stark must also try to rebuild his crumbling relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and maintain his friendship with Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who also moonlights as War Machine (who has since been renamed as the more politically-correct 'Iron Patriot' by his government sponsors); regretfully, Cheadle's War Machine is pretty much nothing more than a cameo here.The first two 'Iron Man' pictures were directed by Jon Favreau (who also returns as Happy Hogan, though he's also been pretty much reduced to nothing more than a cameo here), while this latest effort is co-written and directed by 'Lethal Weapon' scribe Shane Black. Anyone who remembers Black knows that he was pretty much the screen-writing master behind several witty dialogue-driven action blockbusters - think 'The Last Boy Scout' (1991) - back in the '80s and early '90s (before the arrival of Quentin Tarantino), so it's no surprise that virtually every bit of dialogue written here is a one-liner with an exclamation point at the end.I already stated my ambivalence toward this film series, but I can take pleasure in the fact that this might be the last, and that at least Iron Man seems to fare better when paired up with other superheroes. Robert Downey, Jr. is his usual appealing self, but the movie itself is also a disappointment, if not a completely enjoyable disappointment.7/10",7,0,3,21 December 2014

Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of Steven Spielberg's best films
","For me, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' will always be Steven Spielberg's second best pre-'Schindler's List' film.  His first will always be 'The Color Purple'.  From beginning to end, 'Raiders' keeps you on the edge of your seat as Indiana Jones (played by Harrison Ford) jumps from adventure to adventure.  Throughout 'Raiders' we see Indy dodge giant rocks, poison darts, bullets, getting attacked by tarantulas and deadly snakes and other countless hazards.  The acting is great.  The special effects are marvelous, for their time, that is.    10/10",10,0,0,19 January 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Why I Love 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'
","In 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit,' which exists in an alternate 1947 Hollywood in which human beings coexist with cartoon characters (referred to throughout as 'Toons'), alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is put on the case of clearing a long-eared fugitive of the law, the titular Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer), of murder charges. Roger, the fun-loving Toon star of Maroon Cartoons, is married to a beautiful Toon woman, Jessica Rabbit, and Roger had become distraught that she may have been having an affair with his boss Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), and Acme himself later turns up dead, with Roger as the #1 suspect. As Eddie digs deeper and deeper into his investigation, he soon finds himself on the run and having to journey to Toontown (the home of all the Toons in Hollywood), one of the last places on Earth he wants to be for reasons I'll explain later. This was one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I was three when it was originally released), and it still is after happening upon a recent viewing of the picture, and I only recently discovered that it was not an original piece as I once believed, but it's adapted from the novel 'Who Censored Roger Rabbit?' by Gary K. Wolf. Does that mean I love it any less? Of course not. It just gives me more room to appreciate what director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were able to do with the story. This movie is fantastic, especially with its mix of comedy, detective-noir, and good old-fashioned murder-mystery whodunit. It's also brilliant for its Oscar-winning special effects, which combine live-action with animation. That's been done before, but I've never seen it done with the care and precision as it's done in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.' The whole movie is like a dream, a dream where people can happily coexist with their favorite cartoon characters, rather than go to the theater for the on-screen antics. Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd from Zemeckis's earlier 'Back to the Future') is a classic movie villain, with his all-black fatigues, snarl, and typical bad-guy demeanor; there's also a unique twist with his character that you have to see to believe. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, in what is arguably his best-known American film role; growing up, I of course had no idea that he was actually British, but he pulls off his American accent perfectly. One of the things I really like about his character is the resentment he has toward Toons, since one killed his brother several years before this film's story takes place, and his attempts to clear Roger Rabbit of murder charges provides a foundation for him to overcome his hatred. (Am I the only one who spots the obvious parallels to racism here?) 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a classic comedy/fantasy, and undoubtedly one of my favorite movies. As I stated earlier, a recent viewing allowed me to really see this movie's greatness all over again. I'm glad I'm still in love with it after all these years.10/10",10,1,1,23 January 2010
Minority Report," 'Minority Report' - 10/10
","'Minority Report', I think is about as realistic as a future science-fiction thriller could possibly get. It has a very realistic setting, characters and a police system that sometime, not too far down the road, is eerily possible. The whole 'pre-crime' issue is what is at this film's heart. Suppose a person was to get arrested before they are able to commit a crime.Even today, this is possible, but only through the most careful of planning. But we cannot rely on careful planning forever, though. So in 'Minority Report', we have the Pre-Cognitives (pre-cogs), three psychic human beings who are suspended in a flotation tank and are able to sense future crimes that are going to be committed. We learn that they are never wrong. (The actual details of a crime can be a little fuzzy, but it usually is nothing serious that will detract from making an arrest.) But they can sometimes disagree. So a 'minority report' is filed whenever there is a disagreement amongst the pre-cogs. This sets up the film's plot which involves pre-crime cop Tom Cruise going on the run to prove his innocence when the pre-cogs name him as a future murderer.This is by far Steven Spielberg's most complex film to date. Though this is not Spielberg's first venture into science-fiction, it is his best. Tom Cruise makes a very believable protagonist here. The entire issue of 'Pre-Crime' is treated as something of a flawed advance in law enforcement. It raises questions of how the police can be truly certain that a person is going to commit a crime or is it inevitable that the future can be altered. You see, it is all just too complex to really put into words here, you just have to watch the movie and form your own thoughts.",10,2,4,22 December 2002
Training Day," All hail Denzel Washington
","'Training Day' which stars Denzel Washington in an Oscar-winning performance and Ethan Hawke in an Oscar-nominated performance, is one hell of a movie. Denzel stars as L.A. narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who is probably the most brutal cop working in the city.  Ethan is his young trainee, Jake Hoyt, who wants to become a narc so he can move himself and his wife into a better home.  Throughout the day, we see Denzel battle crime with such hostility, that Jake cannot help but think that what Alonzo is doing is wrong.  At this point this is where the battle starts...Alonzo Harris is not evil in the usual sense of the word, but he is simply a person who has become corrupted by his own means of justice.  The story of 'Training Day' is that he has developed a sort of God-like persona and uses this image to put fear into the hearts of those who are against him. Despite all of this, there are higher forces who oppose his power.  This inevitably leads to his downfall.  Alonzo is a tyrant plain and simple.  He has people who do his bidding for him, but not for long now that Hoyt is on the streets.  Hoyt will lead the battle to oust Alonzo out of power.10/10",10,3,14,30 July 2002
Se7en," Chilling some spoilers
","I must admit that when this film came out, I totally ignored it, probably because I was only 9 nears old and I didn't care much for movies when back then.  Now, after reading several reviews, I finally decided to take a chance with it.The story is set from what I understand is supposed to be New York City.  It is always dark and it is always raining.  Detective William Somerset(Morgan Freeman) is an elderly, burned out homicide detective who is about to retire.  Detective David Mills(Brad Pitt) is the brash, young detective who is set to replace Somerset at the end of the week.  But before Somerset can retire, he must tackle one last important case.  The two detectives arrive at the house of a obese man who was found with his face in a bowl of spaghetti. The second victim they find, a defense attorney, was forced to cut off a pound of his flesh. As further investigation into the murders continues, they soon learn that they were the first and second in a series of ritualistic killings in which the victims will be killed in accordance with the Seven Deadly Sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Wrath and Envy. I won't go any further than that.  Kevin Spacey, of American Beauty fame, plays John Doe with perfection.  I didn't even know who he was until I saw this film.  His role as John Doe is probably one of the creepiest I have ever seen.  Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play their roles to perfection also.  Seven's ending really surprised me because it was very unexpected and there were no clues to hint it. 
I also like this film because it was directed by David Fincher.  I liked because he succeeds in always creating dark and suspenseful atmospheres in his films like Alien 3, Fight Club, and The Game.Now I'm a very big fan of serial killer films.  I've seen most of the major ones The Silence of the Lambs, The Bone Collector, and this film. **Spoilers**  There is one something that I want to make very clear. Resurrection, another serial killer film starring Christopher Lambert is not a Seven rip-off.  Although the two films do share the same qualities, they are two totally different films.Now that is cleared up Seven a very chilling film and has a terrifying ending.9/10",10,0,0,21 January 2001
Star Trek," This was really good!
","Admittedly, I'm not a fan of 'Star Trek,' an important cornerstone of modern science fiction. Admittedly, I never watched Gene Roddenberry's original television series, but I did like the two movies 'Star Trek Generations' (1994) and 'Star Trek: First Contact' (1996), which as I remember were generated from 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' television series.Like so many Hollywood epics of late, 'Star Trek' directed by J.J. Abrams ('Alias,' 'Lost'), is a reboot of the original 'Star Trek' television series and movies. The movie takes us all the way back to the beginning, with James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) rising through the Starfleet Academy and soon on his way to fulfilling his destiny as the captain of the USS Enterprise. We also see the early beginnings of the Vulcan savant Spock ('Heroes' Zachary Quinto). Plot-wise, the crew of the Enterprise encounters its first major adversaries in the alien warrior Romulans, led by Captain Nero (Eric Bana), seeking vengeance against Spock and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet.'Star Trek' is probably the first major blockbuster of the summer 2009 movie season. It's a visual feast boasting top-of-the-line special effects and acting from/for the next generation of Trekkies. The movie got off to a bit of a slow start, but soon finds its own footing and succeeds in becoming its own entity.I don't know if hardcore Trekkies will appreciate Abrams's new take on old material, or even if his 'Star Trek' will hold up in the long run, if it is in for the long run. Abrams has had some choice words for Trekkies in the weeks leading up to the film's release, but seemed to have quieted some fears by at least casting Leonard Nimoy in a brilliant (not to mention highly welcome) cameo in his immortal role as original Spock.This 'Star Trek' boldly goes where no man has gone before, and that is a great summer at the movies.9/10",9,3,12,12 May 2009
Fight Club," A movie about fighting, cool!
","That's what I thought at when I first saw the previews of this film back in 1999.  At first, I didn't pay much attention to these previews and and completely ignored it when came out on tape.  I didn't really get a chance to watch it until my cousin bought the tape and I watched it then.
It's about a guy who from what we know is simply referred to as The Narrator (played by Edward Norton.)  He's an insomniac(for those of you who don't what an insomniac is, it's someone who has trouble sleeping.)  So he come up with a cure, which is to attend group meetings.  Which almost immediately cures his insomnia.  That is however, until he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) another 'faker' whose just there for unexplained reasons.  So his insomnia starts up again.  While attending one of his usual business trips, The Narrator meets up with a rather unusual fellow named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) who is also a very bad dresser.  The two quickly become friends and set up 'Fight Club.'  It's where men pummel each other to bloody pulps.  Soon however, it gets a little out hand and the it quickly becomes 'Project Mayhem' which is basically a terrorist organization that quickly begins popping up cities across the country.  I really liked Fight Club.  It's dark, violent, and very funny.  It also contains some of the funniest moments I've ever seen in a movie that isn't really a comedy.  I should also say that some people may get the wrong idea about this movie and might set up their own fight clubs.Anyway, Fight Club is a great movie full of violence, darkness, and some very funny moments.10/10",10,1,4,18 May 2001
Akira," Simply Stunning
","I remember that when I first rented the video tape of Akira, I didn't like it, most likely because I didn't understand it.  But after waiting 2 months for the special edition DVD of Akira, I gave it a second chance.  The second time, I loved it!  What probably drew me into it was the stunning and beautiful animation.  A second factor that probably drew in even deeper, was the musical score.  It is definitely the best I've ever heard.  The violence here isn't really as graphic as some people have made it out to be.  Yes, people get shot, yes there are bodies exploding, yes when people get punched or hit by foreign objects, blood does flow, but all the blood and gore here is sustained.  I won't lie.  I DID rent this movie expecting a gratuitous bloodbath, but to my surprise there isn't really all that much violence as in terms of graphic violence.  Akira gets a 10/10",10,4,7,10 August 2001
Underworld," Should be a comic book
","For all I know, there could already be a comic book in the works for the vampire-werewolf fantasy, 'Underworld.'  I just got back from seeing it and I must say that this movie should stand up pretty well in the face of all the ridiculous (read: pointless, useless) 'Matrix; Crow; Blade' comparisons. I've heard that this movie is based on some RPG game I have never heard of and if that's true, I don't really care; this movie could probably beat the hell out of it.  'Underworld' really has a unique feel to it.  The story doesn't stand up well under a whole lot of thought, but that doesn't really matter.  What should really capture some people, are the special effects and the sets. There are some pretty nifty werewolf transformation scenes that certainly deserve Oscar attention.  The sets, highly Victorian as they are, also should get some props.  This movie is going to be a comic book; I can tell. It certainly has the look, feel, and story of one, yet that still doesn't make it bad.  Speaking of the story, though it isn't strong, it gets to you.  The thought that vampires and werewolves have been duking it out for thousands of years right under our noses is intriguing, even if it hasn't been fleshed out that well in the film.  Even still, it gets you thinking about everything that war means to them and us.As for the action scenes, they are certainly well shot and violent. Surprisingly, there isn't that much gore here either.  But what is really surprising is that the movie doesn't offer us pointless action scenes to fill in for lack of story; there's actually meaning behind it all.'Underworld' is a pretty well-done fantasy that deserves to be immortalized in the comics.9/10",9,29,55,20 September 2003
Kickboxer," Jean-Claude Van Damme goes Muay Thai-style!
","Nah, you're not interested in 'Kickboxer,' the Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie set in the exotic and mysterious Thailand and focuses in on the brutal sport of Muay Thai, are you? You're not going to miss Van Damme's hammy acting, his trademark splits, or his harsh (although according to some sources, inaccurate) training and portrayal in and of the Thai sport of Muay Thai, are you?Of course you do. The Muscles From Brussels goes Thai in this 1989 adventure, with the Belgian actor exploring the martial arts fundamentals of Muay Thai, the national sport of Thailand, which has gained wider recognition in the West because it's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts and Thai-native newcomer Tony Jaa seeks to promote his tiny country's greatest commodity for a worldwide audience. But this is a Van Damme movie, first and foremost. True he's no great actor, but there's something about his work here that makes me want to watch 'Kickboxer' again and again.First things first, what is Muay Thai? As already stated, it's the national sport of Thailand, where the fighter will condition his body so that his arms and legs become weapons capable of delivering blows, kicks in particular, that are three times as powerful as that of any ordinary martial artist. He'll also use his feet, fists, shins, and elbows too. If one wants to go all out, two guys will get in a ring and have themselves a rope-fist fight, where the fighters' wrists are bound in rope and covered with broken glass. Isn't that mean and nasty?To begin 'Kickboxer,' Van Damme is Kurt Sloane, brother of Eric (Dennis Alexio), the top kickboxer in the United States. Tiring of the generic competition of his native soil, he travels with brother Kurt to Bangkok, where he hopes to dethrone the current champ Tong Po (Michel Qissi), who has a reputation for fighting dirty. Kurt first sees this towering mountain of flesh and muscle kicking the hell out of a support beam in the locker room; that's the first clue to Kurt that Eric shouldn't get in the ring, but he's not listening.And Eric fights anyway, against baby brother's warnings.To make long stories short, Eric takes quite a beating in the ring but a series of illegal blows delivered after Kurt throws in the towel cripple Eric for life. So what went wrong? According to some sources, American Kickboxing is a watered-down form of Muay Thai, so it's no wonder Tong Po got the upper hand so quickly on Eric, who despite his excellent training and peak physical condition, only landed a few lucky punches on the towering fighter. Apparently, Muay Thai is strictly for street fighting, not something for refined martial artists like Kurt and Eric.To teach Tong Po a lesson in humility, Kurt contacts American Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III) to seek out a venerated Thai master, Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), to learn the art of Muay Thai, and so the training begins. Kurt first puts aside his already-planted Karate training and strengthens his body, kicks tree stumps until the scar tissue prevents any kind of feeling aside from invincibility, learns a little about Asian spirituality, and even flirts with Chow's niece Mylee (Rochelle Ashana). What it all culminates in, of course, is a no-holds-barred 'Rocky IV'-style showdown using the ancient rope-fists between Kurt and Tong Po.As someone who knows next to nothing about Muay Thai (in fact, much of what I know comes from Wikipedia and the special features section of the 'Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior' DVD), I found 'Kickboxer' to still be quite entertaining. It's brutal stuff, really, so it's no wonder Muay Thai is gaining such greater notoriety in the United States. As Kurt Sloane, Van Damme is good (despite his acting limitations in showing emotions), his performance notwithstanding, and none of the other performers are really worth speaking of either, but Tong Po is a nasty villain and his one speaking line 'You bleed like Mylee; Mylee good f**k' sends chills down the spine.The fights are another thing and are what this feature co-directed by Mark DiSalle and David Worth seems to specialize in. The fights are spectacular (as with any martial arts movie that features Van Damme doing his trademark splits and 360-degree flying spin-kick), which does include one sequence where Kurt gets drunk, starts dancing, and takes on the patrons at a bar.This 'Kickboxer' - it's a kick, just don't let it 'kick' you in the head too much with its lackadaisical script and lame-brain plotting.7/10",7,14,19,9 May 2006
Dawn of the Dead," 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004)
","Zack Snyder's 2004 revision of the 1978 action epic of zombie mayhem, 'Dawn of the Dead,' is less a remake of George A. Romero's classic of the same title than it is its own individual vision of zombies and the survivors who band together to keep them out of the huge shopping mall they've barricaded themselves in.The new 'Dawn' is not a better film than the original, but is better made and is more streamlined and fluid. The zombies in the revision run, instead of merely lurching up and down escalators or are otherwise slow to capture victims. These zombies are quite vicious and relentless in their pursuit of potential victims.I'm hesitant to call 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004) a remake because in my opinion, what allows the new 'Dawn' to surpass the 1978 version is that the new version doesn't try to outdo the original; it instead builds on that film's reputation. The original's idea of humans barricading themselves in a mall to avoid the hordes of flesh-hungry zombies that run rampant outside is only a template for the new version's more nefarious agenda of scaring the daylights out of the audience.The new 'Dawn of the Dead' treads in places where Romero's film didn't  it delivers genuine shocks  not satire and is heavy on gore (which is extended in the director's cut) and characters you come to know and care about. Yet, you can't completely dismiss Romero's original. And whereas the mall in the original was a haven for the four main characters to keep the hording masses of zombies outside at bay, the mall in 'Dawn' (2004) is merely a rest stop; the survivors here in 2004 aim to escape from the living dead as soon as possible.As a fan of George A. Romero's highly praised and daring 'Living Dead' trilogy, it only seemed natural that a remake of the most popular film was reasonable. Already 'Night of the Living Dead' was remade in 1990 and was directed by Romero's right-hand special effects man Tom Savini. As far as I can see, a remake of 1985's 'Day of the Dead' is not that far off, as well as a FOURTH 'Living Dead' film.And several 1978 'Dawn' alumni make cameo appearances: Ken Foree ('Peter' in the original) plays a priest who delivers 'Dawn's' most famous punch line ('When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth'), Scott H. Reiniger ('Roger' in the original) as a military general, and special effects wizard Tom Savini ('Blades' in the original) as a sheriff leading an operation to eradicate the zombies.'When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth' has a greater relevance in the new 'Dawn' because here, the zombies walking around and consuming the flesh of the living is seen to be a worldwide epidemic  the Apocalypse. In the original, the zombies were simply seen as more of a nuisance, not the end of the world.10/10",10,0,0,30 October 2004
Iron Man 2," Marvel Comics' 'Man of Steel,' um, 'Iron,' is back
","One of the many great pleasures of watching 2008's 'Iron Man' was that it allowed to some degree for star Robert Downey, Jr., playing billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who moonlighted and eventually revealed to the world his secret identity as the armored superhero Iron Man, to exorcise the many demons from his lonely, drug-fueled days in the annals of Hollywood Hell. Stark, of course, has in the past dealt with debilitating bouts of alcoholism, so this role would have allowed Robert Downey, Jr. to face any remaining demons from his past. It is this deep personal struggle that has made Tony Stark/Iron Man one of the more fascinatingly introspective characters in the Marvel Comics Universe of superheroes.But whatever meditations these movies could have had in dealing with the harrowing perils of drug addiction gets lost in the bang-bang pacing, action and special effects of the latest Hollywood superhero blockbuster to boast spectacular visuals and top-notch performances but lacking any real depth or content. Actor/director Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a favorite in Hollywood, especially with the way he's handling his work on the 'Iron Man' movies, and he proves his mettle, regardless of the lack of thematic complexity or depth that they could have had, with this sequel 'Iron Man 2.' And while I would have personally much more enjoyed the subject of Stark's internal struggles with alcoholism rather than his external struggles with the U.S. government, I guess what we get here will have to do for now.While less skillful and entertaining than its 2008 predecessor, I personally feel that I somehow enjoyed this one a lot more, perhaps because it features a more-fleshed-out supporting role from Stark's best friend Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, having fully replaced Terrence Howard from the previous film), who of course later dawns a powered armor suit of his own to become the awesomely bad-ass War Machine. And the movie has a killer soundtrack by those Aussie bad boys AC/DC.This time out, Stark has really let his arrogance get to his head, and this is something that Downey, Jr. really pushes past its limits to become cinematic gold. He has effectively saved the world from certain doom so many times in the past that he has also effectively 'privatized world peace,' and the government wants a piece of his technology because he has so quickly and so suddenly made them look incompetent.All that's about to change when the villainous Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) shows up on Tony's home turf one day and challenges him to a duel. Vanko is especially miffed at Stark because he believes that Stark's father stole the technology that he developed with Vanko's father and had him deported back to Russia to cover his tracks. So Ivan, possessing blueprints for Stark's technology to exact his revenge, develops some nifty little weapons of his own to become the whip-wielding super-villain Whiplash.On the home front, meanwhile, Stark's ticker is deathly ill and feels that his time is running out, and he hands over control of Stark Industries to his would-be love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). And just as he does this, another character is introduced, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), who also hides a few secrets of her own since she is also the lethal spy/secret agent Black Widow.A lot of stuff goes on in 'Iron Man 2' and there's the main problem (other than that other issue I mentioned earlier about Stark's battles with alcoholism getting the shaft here): a lot goes on and the movie kind of feels crammed as a result. Rourke is a fascinating presence whenever he's on the screen, which unfortunately is not very much, but I enjoyed his scenes the most, especially since he comes under the yoke of Stark's rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Johannson's Black Widow also gets shafted as well, since she doesn't really become a big player in all this superhero stuff until the film's action-packed, 20-minute climax. And at least Cheadle's War Machine is made useful in the film before (note that I said 'before') he and Iron Man have to go to work as a team to defeat a newly powered-up Whiplash (which is a little anti-climatic and a bit short, to say the least).Am I nit-picking some things? Probably. But the reason we keep coming back is because of the action, special effects, and Robert Downey, Jr. as Marvel Comics' Man of Steel... Iron. He's utterly perfect for this role: he's arrogant, greedy, narcissistic, and drops more biting one-liners here than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever did in his prime (not knocking the great Schwarzenegger here, but you get my point). But he's a hero, and that all that matters in 'Iron Man 2.'9/10",9,5,8,15 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," The resurrection of a popular series
","Let's recap.The first alien film, which was directed by Ridley Scott is the film that started it all.  Scott's direction was sharp and 'Alien' had the most tension-filled setting of the series and it brought to life a truly horrifying creature.  But that was twenty-three years ago.  'Alien' since it was released in 1979, has become seriously dated and seems to have lost some of its potency.'Aliens', which was directed by James Cameron, is the most well-known film in the series and the most successful.  This time instead of Ripley going up against one alien, she must now go up against an entire nest of the deadly creatures, but with the help of a few good marines added to the bunch.  The ultimate question was of course, would excellent firepower be enough to combat the aliens?  Cameron focused a lot on action and tension, which transformed 'Aliens' into a war movie of sorts.  I liked 'Aliens' the most and hasn't lost any of its ability to still shock its audience.'Alien 3', directed by David Fincher, is the most underrated of the series. Fincher changed the series by doing something new with it by adding his trademark dark settings to the film.  Instead of continuing the trend that was pioneered by James Cameron, he went back to step one, while still taking the series in a new direction.  He created one of the most dark and depressing horror films ever brought to life.  Though for some odd reason, audiences missed that entirely.  Fincher had originally intended the film to be much longer and with more character development, but executives at Fox had cheated him out of his own vision by removing most of said footage.Now we have 'Alien: Resurrection', released in 1997 and directed by acclaimed French film maker Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Set two-hundred years after the events of 'Alien 3', Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned from a sample of her DNA and must continue her ongoing fight with the deadly alien this time with the help of a group of futuristic space pirates and a mysterious woman named Call (Winona Ryder).  It goes without saying that Jeunet is a visual genius.  He has a real sense of bringing life into his scenes and giving the movie a fantastic look.  The gore here is pretty extreme and some scenes will certainly make your skin crawl, turning the movie into a freak show of sorts.  But that could ultimately be what Jeunet was trying to do, I'm not quite sure.  That is no reason to hate this film however.  An excellent addition to the series that is not to be missed.",10,57,101,4 December 2002
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is way easier said than done!
","In 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is way easier said than done! As the film opens, Sarah, a famous television actress, has just dumped her boyfriend of five years, struggling musician Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, also the film's screenwriter). Heartbroken and unable to Forget Sarah Marshall and after having slept with almost every woman in town in an attempt to dull the pain, he takes the advice of his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hager) to go on vacation to Hawaii, to try to get over his former love.Just to get this out of the way, the early scenes featuring Peter trying to get through the break-up are pretty painful, but also demonstrate that Segel, in a truly breakout performance, is a truly great actor capable of dramatic depth, as well as brilliant comedic timing. You really feel sorry for Peter and truly sympathize with his plight, which makes our connection with him genuine. Like most features that comedic impresario Judd Apatow has been behind ('The 40-Year-Old Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad' and my personal favorite, 'Pineapple Express'), 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' has those elements/themes of love & companionship, boys being dragged kicking & screaming into adulthood, friendship, romance, and 'bro-mance' that has made his films so popular, and returning some sense of dignity to the comedy genre.When Peter arrives in Hawaii, he finds that his ex-girlfriend Sarah Marshall is also vacationing at the same hotel on the same island he is staying at it. And not only that, Sarah is there with her new boyfriend, self-absorbed rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Love or chance, take your pick, it seems that everywhere Peter goes, he also runs into Sarah and Aldous. So he goes to about trying extra hard to forget his ex, and so he begins hanging out with Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), the cute hotel desk clerk who knows how to show him a good time during her off-hours with some of the other oddball characters on the island.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a brilliant, touching, and heartfelt romantic comedy. Director Nicholas Stoller finds a lot in the layers of Segel's screenplay, which as is true for all of Apatow's productions, rides a fine line between raunchiness and comedic excess. Boys will be boys, as is also true of all Apatow productions. But these boys, and girls, are given a lot of emotion and compassion and sensitivity, and are indeed flawed individuals (in other words, they're real people, just like us), something usually lacking in these sorts of movies. The acting is fantastic from the cast, especially Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russell Brand.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' you got to love this movie!10/10",10,1,6,7 May 2009
12 Monkeys," Gilliam's 'Twelve'
","It's been a while since I've seen 'Twelve Monkeys,' but I still remember that it is most definitely one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, perhaps one of the best of the 1990s. 'Twelve Monkeys' is a fascinating piece of science fiction, with 'elements' thrown into the mix that can only be the work of director Terry Gilliam. The script by David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, inspired by the original French film 'La Jette' by Chris Marker, tells the tale of a future planet Earth in the year 2035, after a deadly virus has decimated mankind and humans are forced to live underground. Of course, there are criminal elements, and one of these outcasts, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is offered a chance at a clean slate if he volunteers for a mission that is literally out-of-this-world: travel back in time to the year 1996 to gather up information on the virus so scientists in the future can develop a cure. But a mishap occurs and he's sent too far back to the year 1990. Once there, he is hospitalized as insane and meets a wacky fellow inmate named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) and is cared for by a disbelieving doctor (Madeleine Stowe), who eventually grows to realize Cole's telling the truth. Cole is bounced back and forth between the future and the past so much that he eventually grows disillusioned by his own perception of reality, unsure what time he's in or where. Like Cole's ordeal, the film 'Twelve Monkeys' packs a mental punch; we too become unsure of our surroundings and great effort was made by the filmmakers to create such confusion. The performances are pretty astounding, especially from Willis (whose 'acting' ranks as some of his finest) and Pitt, who's an absolute blast and provides some gallows humor, but to be perfectly clear he's totally loony, and may or may not be linked to the group of young, radical animal-rights activists responsible for the unleashing of the virus. Gilliam's imagination again runs rampant in another 'future' tale, like his earlier 'Brazil' (1985). 'Twelve Monkeys,' to be sure, is one wild trip that is definitely worth taking.10/10",10,2,3,31 January 2007
Mississippi Burning," Yeah, Where Does Hated Come From?
","'1964.  When America was at war with itself.'What a tagline.  It signifies perfectly what was going on in the south during the 1960's.  The story to Mississippi Burning is simple.  Three civil rights workers are killed.  An investigation is launched to find the culprits.  Two FBI agents(Gene Hackman in an Oscar-nominated role and Willem Dafoe) are put on the case.  They encounter the hatred and violence that was associated with the investigation which included the usual burning crosses, lynchings, and Klan rallies.  I enjoyed this movie very much and just so you know, an African-American is writing this review.  I'm not going to go get all preachy now, but I will say this, racism SUCKS!  In my opinion, some people just can't grasp the concept that people will always be different and that's why some people feel more superior over another race.  It's just sickening to know that this stuff still goes on in America today, in 2001.  The acting here is great.  Gene Hackman is great as usual, and so is Willem Dafoe.  Frances McDormand is good too in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. I think two of the most over-looked performances ,however, come from Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell(who by the way is secretly a Klansman) and Michael Rooker who plays Frank Bailey, another Klansman.  Rooker's Bailey is definitely the nastiest, racist person ever brought to screen.  The scene where a group of Klansmen burn down a Black church is just terrifying.  When I saw him kick that young boy in the face, I saw just how hateful Bailey really is.  I felt like screaming to that boy to fight back even if it did mean certain death for him. Like the author of the review 'Where Does Hatred Come From?', I think that the rally scene in the park was a very haunting scene especially with the little 3-year old kids smiling and cheering along with there parents. 
Lastly, I would just like to say that this movie reminds me a lot of Norman Jewison's film 'In The Heat Of The Night' because both films have similar issues regarding racism in America.Mississippi Burning is a great film that shouldn't be missed.10/10",10,3,6,26 October 2001
Shaun of the Dead," When there is no more room in hell, Shaun will walk the earth and...
","...He'll kill some zombies too! Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horror-comedy 'Shaun of the Dead.'Armed with a cricket bat, razor-sharp wit, and an attitude, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is perhaps the last guy that you'd want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the London neighborhood where he lives. It could be stated, as this is a running gag here, that we're all dying slow deaths, so it's no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living, Shaun couldn't be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of London.Shaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night's drinking, goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.Straight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, 'Shaun of the Dead' is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.You may remember the character of 'Ash' (Bruce Campbell of 'Evil Dead' fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with 'Shaun of the Dead,' the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.It's pretty obvious that 'SOTD' was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie action-mayhem 'Dawn of the Dead') and 2002's '28 Days Later' (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.Granted 'Shaun of the Dead' is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized Romero's 'Living Dead' trilogy, but it's also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream. I guarantee any viewers out there that you'll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened.10/10",10,182,236,26 September 2004
Beauty and the Beast," An exceptional, beautiful animated film
","Anyone can tell you that 1991's 'Beauty and the Beast,' the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed animated film from that year, is a modern-day classic. 'Beauty and the Beast' is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, 'Beauty and the Beast' is an animated Disney fairy tale, but it's an animated Disney fairy tale like no other. The film came out during a time that is often regarded in film history as the Disney Renaissance period, when the company was putting out top-of-the-line animated features that were of the highest degree of excellence after a nearly-30-year decline in quality, had stellar production values and animation, stellar star/no-name voice talent, and the films were just of overall better quality than in times past. As a result, Disney was beginning to see critical acclaim and box office profits that at the time were unprecedented in the company's history, or animated-film history, for that matter.It supposedly began with 'The Little Mermaid' (1989) and ended with 'Tarzan' in 1999 (and I also don't want to forget about 1992's 'Aladdin' or 1994's 'The Lion King'; 'Beauty and the Beast' is easily the best film from this time.'Beauty and the Beast' is of course an adaptation of the classic French fairy tale, and the animation screenplay here (ultimately penned by Linda Woolverton and co-directed by Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise) is credited to no less than 11 writers. In the film, an unnamed and selfish young prince (Robby Benson) is transformed into a Beast by a beautiful young enchantress who had disguised herself as an old hag. This curse has not only transformed him into a monster closely resembling a humanoid lion, but it has affected his entire castle - turning it into a darkly ominous and Gothic house of horrors (that is obviously meant to match his inner turmoil, hatred, and contempt for the world) and turned his servants and everyone else in it into everyday household items like silverware, furniture, and other decorations.In the nearby town, Belle (Paige O'Hara), the town beauty who is regarded as somewhat of an oddball and a goof - due to her love of books and gaining knowledge (my kind of woman, personally!) - is growing tired of her assigned lot in life and wonders if there's anything better out there. Still, she is generally pleased with what she already has, living with her eccentric inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart). When Maurice leaves town to attend a nearby science exhibition, he gets lost and winds up at the Beast's castle. The angry Beast takes him prisoner, but agrees to let him go in exchange for letting Belle remain in his castle forever.Although Belle is initially repulsed by the Beast, not so much by his looks but by his violent temper, she gradually begins to warm up to him and his kindly staff who begin tending to her every need. Underneath his horrid exterior, she begins to see that he is indeed a kind and gentle soul, and a very lonely one at that, and predictably begins to fall in love with him and vice-versa. Meanwhile back in town, forces led by the town's ultra-vain hot-shot alpha-male, Gaston (Richard White), are conspiring to get Belle to marry him at any cost, while also masterminding the Beast's downfall.'Beauty and the Beast' is an extraordinary motion picture event, which had the distinction of being the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (that was until Pixar's 'Up' in 2010). It was also one of the earliest pictures to make use of hand-drawn imagery that was seamless integrated with computer-generated special effects. To me, while I usually detest musicals and even though 'Beauty and the Beast' has some musical numbers in it, by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, the songs don't slow the film down at all. In fact, they actually enhance the film by actually continuing to tell the story (and they are in fact pretty catchy, which is a rarity in films like this - I might actually go out and by the soundtrack pretty soon).Another aspect of the film that makes it so extraordinary is how dark it is, and also worth mentioning is the fleeting violence of the film's climax (which does include a slapstick showdown at the Beast's castle between the household staff and Gaston's goons, but I'm specifically referring to the climatic fight between the Beast and Gaston on the roof of his castle). And the Beast himself is actually quite scary, especially in the film's earliest moments. I'm quite surprised that 'Beauty and the Beast' didn't receive at least a 'PG' rating considering how dark this picture is, both in its subject matter and presentation. Notice how ugly and how drenched in darkness the Beast's castle is when the story begins. But the story is also about beauty, specifically the love of inner beauty. The film and Beast's castle begin to brighten up and come back to life once Belle arrives and begins falling for the Beast.It may be rated 'G,' but it's still a mature-minded animated feature that doesn't play dumb to its audience and spoon-feed them crappy, sugar-coated moralistic messages about the true ugliness that is sometimes referred to as life.'Beauty and the Beast' is very easily one of my favorite Disney animated films, very easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, for sure. I especially appreciated its message about inner beauty, a theme that has always been particularly of interest to me in the few love stories I actually like but has never been realized so brilliantly as it has been here.A true Disney classic.10/10",10,6,7,15 August 2011
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," 10/10
","It's been well over a decade since I last saw 'South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut.' Of course, being a fan of TV's 'South Park' since almost the beginning, this movie just had to be seen by me in the theaters in 1999. Well, obviously, since I was just 14 that year, I couldn't see this movie in the theaters, but I WAS able to see it when it came out on VHS. The show, created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, was thus expanded into feature-length territory, and it will not disappoint fans of the show (since both Parker and Stone had a hand in writing and directing the film). 'South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut' came out at the perfect time at the end of the cynical, politically correct '90s. Parker and Stone are both equal-opportunity offenders, and nothing is sacred in their view - religion, race, politics, free speech, etc. But despite the rampant toilet humor, they do seem to be saying things about free speech, racism, censorship, homosexuality, the nature of war and of course, political correctness. These themes are laced in a story in which potty-mouthed third-graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into the movie theater to go see 'Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire' at the theater. When their parents discover the truth, they launch a campaign to wage war against Canada, with the boys the only hope of averting World War III - and - the apocalypse (because Satan and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein are in on the fun, also). If you were a teenager in 1999 like I was, this movie will have you in stitches; also, if you were a teenager in 1999, you most likely had parents who forbade you from seeing this movie at all costs (yet you probably got away with a few private viewings anyway). I managed to catch a few viewings with my mom (who could stomach the proceedings, while my father obviously couldn't). 14 years later, 'South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut' has not really lost its power to offend, and captured that chaotic atmosphere amazingly well.See it, and be offended.10/10",10,0,0,2 January 2013
The Girl Next Door," Not as clever as 'Risky Business,' but more daring than 'American Pie'
","It wasn't long before and after the release of 'The Girl Next Door' that the inevitable comparisons to the teen sex comedies of yesteryear began.  But I begin with rock-solid reassurances that those comparisons are unnecessary and uncalled for.  It's not as clever as the 1983 comedy starring Tom Cruise, but it's more daring in its exploits than 'American Pie.''Risky Business' was released in 1983 amidst a blossoming season of raunchy teen movies (and so was 'The Girl Next Door') and both films featured a young man (Tom Cruise then, Emile Hirsch here) who are on their way to bright futures but get caught up in the mess they've made following a brief walk on the wild side.  Their stepping into the wild side is initiated by a chance meeting with a beautiful girl who captures their hearts (Rebecca De Mornay then, Elisha Cuthbert here).It is right then that the differences first begin to appear.  Back in good old 1983, when Tom Cruise was just becoming the heartthrob that he is today in 2004, he was a more picturesque definition of a ladies man - being that he had charisma, confidence and sex appeal.  Fast forward to 2004, with rising actor Emile Hirsch, who is more of a flake, definitely less attractive than someone like Tom Cruise, and therefore that makes Hirsch easier to relate to.'The Girl Next Door' is more daring than 'American Pie' in its delivery of the raunch.  Guys have dreamed for ages about meeting the 'girl next door,' who is played perfectly by '24' star Elisha Cuthbert and who most definitely looks like the woman of some lonely guy's sex fantasies.  But the thing is, she's a porn star, as Hirsch finds out; this is where 'Pie' is surpassed. In 'Pie,' the most a man could do was just dream about being in the same room as Shannon Elizabeth and not screwing up; consequently, that's about as far as poor Jim (Jason Biggs) got in that movie.Did I like 'The Girl Next Door' when I saw it for the first time on DVD today?  Most definitely, as it is one of the most touching romantic-sex comedies that I've ever seen.  There is not nearly as much raunch here as the previews might lead one to believe.  Sexhounds will be sorely disappointed that sexy Elisha Cuthbert doesn't bare it all in this movie, but several real life porn stars do!The romance between the two leads is sweet and touching; above all, I found it to be more believable than I find most teen sex comedies to be nowadays.10/10",10,0,1,24 August 2004
Spider-Man 2," A second, exhilarating spin
","'Spider-Man 2' is a perfectly realized and personal vision of the Marvel Comics superhero played by Tobey Maguire, who is given his extraordinary powers by a bite from a genetically-modified spider.The sequel to 2002's mega-blockbuster is heavy on wall-to-wall special effects and action sequences, but surprisingly there's a strong human element within all of the chaos.Peter's life is more harried and frustrating this time around: he's in college (but is late for his classes), is fired from a job as a pizza delivery boy, is on shaky grounds with his friend Harry (James Franco), Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to be evicted, and he still burns with unrequited love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who's about to be married.These might all seem to be a terrible burden on Peter's life, however, that is until a new villain arises to challenge Spider-Man, the once brilliant and benevolent Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina, perfectly cast; equal times pitiable and loathsome), who becomes 'Dr. Octopus' ('Doc Ock' to the press) when an accident fuses four mechanical tentacles to his body.Director Sam Raimi knew what he was going for when he decided to take on the task of bringing 'Spider-Man 2' to the big screen.  He's come a long way from his days as 'that guy' who made the 'Evil Dead' to become a well-respected filmmaker.  His direction is much more focused and has polished the faults of the first film (I don't think there were as many as some have claimed).As Roger Ebert states in his review, 'Spider-Man 2' is more like a 'film' as opposed to a 'blockbuster' or a 'superhero' or 'comic book' movie.  It has the qualities of a dramatic action flick, a rarity in Hollywood these days.As for the story and characters, it's well-balanced and less hectic than the first film.  Also, the ending is a lot more satisfactory, especially for hopeless romantics like myself.  The performances are great, especially from Maguire, who reacts with the right amount of grief, frustration, and anger over dawning the suit of Spider-Man.  The most truly great performance, I think, comes from Alfred Molina.  Molina, who is pretty familiar to most audiences, comes off as quite understanding as Dr. Octopus.  When we first meet him, which is when he first meets our hero Peter, we can only wonder how does this nice man become one of the most popular and brilliant Spidey villains ever envisioned? Octopus is sadistic and quite terrifying, not menacing and psychopathic like Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin from the first film.I don't believe that 'Spider-Man 2' is better than the first film, but is better-made, more streamlined and fluid, with a big touch of realism.  This film is more human than most superhero flicks as of late and for that reason it gets a '10,' just as I rated 'Spider-Man' a '10' two years ago when I saw that film.Can't wait for '3' in a few years.",10,0,0,1 July 2004
The Fifth Element," 'The Fifth Element' - Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, and FUN!
","In 'The Fifth Element,' we learn that every 5000 years evil returns from the deepest reaches of outer space to try to wipe out all life in the universe. Only the Four Classic Greek Elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind) plus a 'fifth' element - the 'supreme being' - can ward off this evil presence.And so begins 'The Fifth Element,' French filmmaker Luc Besson's ('La Femme Nikita,' 'The Professional') lavish nod to the sci-fi genre. I contend that not a whole lot of science fiction is high on intelligence, but Besson's film is not only high on intelligence, but imagination. With plenty of beautiful special effects, sights, sounds, story, perfectly chosen actors and Eric Serra's fitting score, 'The Fifth Element' is pure sci-fi fun at the movies, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time.'The Fifth Element' is simply an extravagant tale of good vs. evil in the realm of the science fiction genre. Besson began work on the screenplay while in high school, and the self-contained universe he creates is brought to life here flawlessly. Most filmmakers when trying to bring an outrageous fantasy to life on the screen tend to get lost in the fantasy, short-changing actors and story for special effects. For the most part, the actors chosen - Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and others - are alive & kicking, and not cardboard cut-outs. I'm not saying that they're contenders for the Oscars, but you get my assertion that they are far better (and smarter) than most of the characters you typically find in most science fiction adventure fantasies, and are not stock or background to special effects and pulse-pounding action sequences.As I stated earlier, in New York City 300 years into the future (the 23rd century, I believe), evil - a great, big fireball named (named!) 'Mr. Shadow' - is on its way to wipe out all life in the universe. So it's up to his Earthbound lackey Zorg (Oldman, over-the-top, as usual) and his alien-warrior minions to track down and obtain four stones representing the elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind). But before that happens, we learn that cab driver Korben Dallas (Willis) has obtained the fare of a lifetime - the perfectly beautiful and perfectly dangerous redhead Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) - who literally crash-lands in the back of his cab after she was first regenerated from a scratch of alien DNA in a laboratory. It's love at first sight, but their relationship troubles are hampered by the fact that she's wanted by the police after escaping from said lab and the fact that she speaks an unknown extraterrestrial language.After eluding the cops, Dallas, a former soldier-of-fortune, takes Leeloo to Priest Cornelius (Holm), who realizes exactly who (and what) Leeloo is and what her role in saving the world is - she's the supreme being, the fifth element. So now Korben, under the guise of winning a contest to the outer-world Phloston Paradise, along with Cornelius and Leeloo, sets out to - what else is there to do? - save the world, with Zorg and his minions in hot pursuit.'The Fifth Element,' considering its production and the outrageousness of the story, should not be as good as it is. This is a beautiful-looking picture, eschewing the usual post-apocalyptic gloominess that's associated with futuristic science fiction movies for a marvelously shiny (and remarkably clean!) future-world New York. But Besson is a great storyteller, and knows what he wants on his picture. His script (co-authored with Robert Mark Kamen) is intelligently and expertly written, with strong, believable characters and perfectly composed dialogue that doesn't lose itself in meaningless diatribe and ludicrous explanations of trying to figure out what's going on. And it also contains enough action, humor (provided mostly in the second half by comedian Chris Tucker as flamboyant radio personality Ruby Rhod), intelligence, a performance by a blue-skinned alien opera singer named Diva Plavalaguna, and romance (yes, romance, and you thought it was just another brainless sci-fi picture) to ensure that it remains accessible even to those who don't care much for this science fiction/fantasy stuff.The film flies through its plot, arriving at a climax that is action-packed and shows off the same European action-chic that made Besson a household name with his earlier 'Nikita' and 'Professional.' In these action sequences on-board the Phloston Paradise cruise ship, there are explosions, gunfights with alien beasts, martial arts, and a special effects finale that has to be seen to be believed, but at the same time may be a little bit of a disappointment for those expecting a bigger payoff. And while the humor can draw in those uninterested in this sci-fi/fantasy stuff, it can at times be a little silly and inappropriate and take away from the adventure.'The Fifth Element' is certainly one of the best and most imaginative pieces of original science fiction fanfare produced in a long time. That a sharp director such as Luc Besson was able to get behind the camera of his own little world and not lose himself in it shows that he's a capable filmmaker who's perfectly in control of his film-making elements.9/10",9,6,11,30 November 2007
127 Hours," '127 Hours' - An hour-and-a-half of a true-life experience
","Director Danny Boyle is quickly becoming the talk of Hollywood big-wigs. He made the excellent Scottish anti-drug import 'Trainspotting' in 1996 (my personal favorite film of his so far) before re-inventing the zombie sub-genre of horror with '28 Days Later...' (2002) and hitting a Hollywood home-run with 'Slumdog Millionaire' in 2008. He returns to the big screen triumphant with '127 Hours.' The film was also produced by Christian Colson, who won the Oscar for 'Slumdog' and was also behind the production of my favorite horror film of the new millennium so far, 'The Descent' (2005).'127 Hours' is based on the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco) - based on Ralston's autobiography 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' - an avid and passionate rock climber/outdoors-man whose will and determination to survive is tested when he becomes trapped under a boulder for five days during the summer of 2003 and the film charts his initial horror at his circumstances, his repeated failures at trying to free himself, his attempts to survive in the harsh Utah desert with dwindling food and water, his desperation, his acceptance and denial of his presumed fate, and the ultimate sacrifice he makes in order to free himself from his confines at all costs and then finally make it back to civilization all right to tell his tale.What makes this film so spectacular is the amazing performance of James Franco in the lead as Aron Ralston. For a good chunk of this film's 94-minute running time, it's the James Franco show live & uncut (even though Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara drop in early on as two female hikers named Megan and Kristi, respectively, whom he accompanies briefly); we saw something similar to this when Tom Hanks was trapped alone on a desert island in the Pacific by a plane crash 11 years ago in 'Cast Away' (2000). Ralston's ordeal, his experiences, his memories, his hallucinations, his premonitions, his suffering - everything that he feels here, we feel as audience members. In that cramped little space with Ralston, his suffering becomes our suffering to bear witness to. With dry humor, daring athleticism and unmistakable acting skill, this is probably James Franco's career performance - after his superb work as Harry Osborn in the 'Spider-Man' movies.A lesser film would have dragged under the singular location and the fact that we're often staring directly into Franco's face most of the time. But his performance here is what keeps this film alive and moving, and dryly humorous. I'm glad Boyle's initial pick of Cillian Murphy (his alumni from '28 Days Later...') as Aron Ralston ultimately failed to pan out the way he wanted it to. If it did, I doubt we would have been able to see how truly amazing a performer Franco was in this film.It's clear from the very start that Ralston has a love and a passion for living life to its fullest, love and passion for the outdoors and extreme sports, and not having any regrets about any of it. But it also shows that he is somewhat vain and arrogant; we also see that he is somewhat selfish and solitary and unappreciative of some of the things he has in his life, like his parents, his friends, and his ex-girlfriend. Because of his apparent denial of the importance of such simple but essential things to his daily existence, his arrogance at failing to even tell anyone about what he was doing or where he was going is probably what ultimately leads to his 127-Hour predicament here.And he even speculates throughout the film that perhaps his life has led up to this moment, that from his childhood up until now, events have slowly built up to him being pinned under a massive boulder and questioning about whether or not he has the will to survive or die out here all alone in this canyon, with only those two women played by Tamblyn and Mara as probably the last people he will ever meet during his final moments on Earth. Danny Boyle makes great use of the outdoors location and the unusual but creative use of cinematography and camera-work: it's interesting to note the juxtaposition between the vast expanse of Utah desert in the early scenes and the confined canyon later on in the film that Ralston was initially prepared to call his tomb.'127 Hours' is not a 94-minute preach-fest about valuing your life and living life to its fullest, and one man's ultimate struggle to survive under extreme conditions. It's also not overly melodramatic in its bold dramatization of Ralston's harrowing true-life experiences. Those who have read about what actually happened to him back in 2003 in that Utah canyon undoubtedly know the story by now and the much-talked-about sequences later on in the film about how he ultimately freed himself that have reportedly led to audience members passing out at the shock of the extreme measures he takes to triumphantly regain his freedom.Danny Boyle doesn't deny any of this to the viewer and it wouldn't seem right to do so if he did. As stated earlier, the point of this movie is to plunge the audience into Aron Ralston's true-life experiences back in 2003, to make his story more widely known, and to remind viewers that it's always a good idea to leave a note about where you're going and what you're going to be doing.10/10P.S.: The rousing score by A.R.

Batman Returns," It was the night before Christmas in Gotham City...
","On a cold, snowy night one time in Gotham City, a rich couple gave birth to their first and (presumably) last child. The child is deformed and is assumed a safety risk. A few nights or weeks later, on a nightly stroll through the park, the couple has decided to toss the baby and its carriage over a bridge, where it is gently taken by the still waters into the sewer.It was on this same night in 1992, that director Tim Burton gave rise to the dynamic, multi-layered sequel to his 1989 blockbuster with 'Batman Returns.' It's darker, moodier, sexier and more vibrant than 'Batman,' and maybe even the Dark Knight's creator Bob Kane might be happy with Burton's vision. Or maybe not. It isn't better than its predecessor, but is at least on a certain level of creativity, if nothing else is ever as spectacular this time around.Burton's specialty is freaks, and they wear their hearts on all sleeves, if they wore sleeves. Burton has surrounded himself with freakish visual delights, circus outcasts and three figures struggling with 'dual identities' this time in Gotham City as the Christmas holidays are rapidly approaching, and so the criminals are also out raising hell and who do the scared innocents call: Batman.The Penguin (Danny DeVito, perfectly hideous under a ton of Oscar-nominated Stan Winston prosthetics) is largely responsible for this new crime wave, as he aspires to rise to power in Gotham City's government, with the reluctant aid of corrupt business mogul Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), whose proposed power plant will drain the city of power once brought online. The Penguin's devious plot is shrouded in mystery from the masses, however, by his desire to find his identity and make peace with his now deceased parents, adopting the birth name 'Oswald Cobblepot.' More on this later.Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is onto Cobblepot and Shreck's plans, but his DUAL IDENTITY as Batman will have to be put on hold when Shreck's mousy secretary... uh, executive assistant... uh, secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) adopts her DUAL IDENTITY as the S & M-leather-bondage Catwoman after taking a swan dive out of a top-floor window, is resurrected by friendly felines, and becomes the object of Bruce's desires. Will they let their DUAL INDENTITIES as the Bat and the Cat get in the way of their passion, or will they live happily ever after?It could be stated 'Batman Returns' is probably the sexiest and introspective (but does not reach the level of sophistication found in the first 'Batman') of Burton's Gothic vehicles. Pfeiffer seems to be having the most fun as Catwoman - sexy, delicious, vicious - a role many felt was lacking with Halle Berry's continuation of the character 12 years later in the 'Batman Returns' spin off, 'Catwoman.' Keaton is fulfilling once again as the Dark Knight, as his relationship this time with a romantic interest has a little more steam, much to the surprise of faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough).But as usual (and aside from Pfeiffer's sexy curvatures), Burton indulges in the visuals (which are beautiful, but so is Catwoman), but it could also be argued he leaves his players out in the cold in favor of the former. The romance between Bruce and Selina is almost non-existent by the time the credits roll, but Burton makes the effort to really explore the dark depths of his characters in the sequel and their struggles with alternate lives, giving reason to their troubling ways of causing mischief in Gotham City.Speaking of mischief, again, The Penguin's plans to run for mayor are overshadowed by his current two-fold operation of systematically murdering Gotham's first-born children, biblical-style, by drowning them in the sewers from where he has risen, and framing Batman for the kidnapping of the Ice Princess (Cristi Conaway).Action is plentiful, as the three main characters are given enough screen time to live out their roles. Danny Elfman's score is there this time too, in order to back its frequent scenes of action and mayhem. Director Burton may have outdone himself on this sequel, as it was his last chance at the Dark Knight, as was also Keaton's.It will be a darker, stormier night in Gotham City when Batman, The Penguin, and Catwoman decide to get together and have themselves a Christmas party.9/10",9,0,0,9 December 2005

","and they deliver once again another great animated movie: 'Finding Nemo'.  I really like this movie and the animation.  The animation almost made it feel like you really in the ocean with all the different types of fish and wildlife there.  The story is well-told and quite funny and touching too.

Blade," Fantastic thanks to Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff
","Blade is a great adaptation of the famous comic book series of the same name.  I'm actually surprised Entertainment Weekly gave it a D+.  Wesley Snipes is one of my favorite actors and is perfect for the role of the tortured half man, half vampire Blade.  Stephen Dorff is totally cool as Blade's young and psychotic arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost.  Blade's tight looking weapons too.  They range from a double-bladed boomerang to little capsules loaded with stuff that will blow up vampires.  Blade is a great film with two great stars, perfectly executed fight scenes, and lots of cool shots of vampires heads exploding. 10/10",10,6,7,10 October 2000
Superbad," I had the theater all to myself today...
","...Which is quite good, otherwise I might not have enjoyed 'Superbad' as much as I did. Director Greg Mottola's new film 'Superbad' is super-funny and super-good in a number of ways that I didn't think were possible. Part of it, I think, lies in the writing. 'Superbad' is a well-written film, if nothing else. That praise should go to screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Sure, their screenplay is vulgar and profane, but the actors carry it off in such a way that it becomes not only funny, but moving. It's two weeks before graduation and two high school seniors and lifelong best friends who are presumably named after the film's screenwriters - the foul-mouthed, out-going, and sex-crazed Seth (Jonah Hill) and the somewhat introverted, stalwart, and more cautious Evan (Michael Cera) - are facing the possibility of never seeing each other again when Evan and a third named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) get accepted to Dartmouth while Seth's college plans are an uncertainty because he didn't get accepted. To make long stories short, Evan and Fogell are going to be rooming together at Dartmouth, which certainly makes Seth feel a little left out, like his best bud is bailing out on him. But 'Superbad's' story gets underway when the two get invited to a party, where two girls - the cute Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and Jules (Emma Stone) - both of whom Evan and Seth are smitten with, respectively, are going to be. So, Seth and Evan are put on alcohol duty. Since, obviously, they're underage, they have to get Fogell (who has a fake ID) to go get the booze at a liquor store. Sounds easy enough, right? (If he doesn't get carded at the cash register first.) But a series of unusually comic events throw their plan into chaos, and wondering how they're going to get the booze for the girls they like, and save the party. On a side note, Fogell gets swept up with two police officers (Rogen himself and Bill Hader) who also proceed to show him the night of his life and recapture some youthful shenanigans themselves. 'Superbad' is definitely not a movie children should see. With enough adult humor, profanity, and alcohol - all involving teenagers - you can bet this is a show for mature adults. Like I stated earlier, the film's greatest strength lies in the intelligence of its screenplay. From seeing the actors' performances, you understand the frustration the kids go through to simply have a good time before facing life's uncertainties as college freshmen and then later, as adults. Rogen and Goldberg's writing captures all of this perfectly, and the comic timing of the two lead actors in a number of comic scenes is nothing short of brilliant. The jokes fly fast, so does the adult humor and profanity, but 'Superbad' is a super-cool teen flick, and bound to be yet another fun entry into the teen market.10/10",10,3,8,19 September 2007
Creed," 'Creed' - Passing the torch
","2015's Ryan Coogler-directed 'Creed' is a worthy successor to the legendary 'Rocky' sports-drama film series. Like the overall message of the film, it's competently acted and directed well enough that it will surely build its own legacy in time. (I just found out that a sequel is already tentatively set for next year, in the Fall of 2017.)I had remember hearing a few years after the release of 'Rocky Balboa' (2006) that a sequel was in the works, and it turned out the next 'Rocky' film would not only be a sequel, but a spin-off, of that legendary film franchise.'Creed' centers around Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of famed boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who was killed in a boxing match by Soviet fighter Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) in 'Rocky IV' (1985). Adonis never knew his legendary father, and had lived much of his early life not knowing of the great legacy - and potential greatness - that awaited him. He learns of his legacy when Creed's widow Mary Ann Creed (Phylicia Rashad) gets him released from a juvenile detention center when he's a young teenager.Years later as an adult and talented underground fighter, he then figures that he's ready for his shot at the title. So he quits his job in Los Angeles and heads to Philadelphia to track down his father's rival-turned-close friend Rocky Balboa (Best Supporting Actor-nominee Sylvester Stallone, who rightfully hands over the porch to his much-younger co-star). The aging Balboa is long past his glory days in the ring and has outlived both his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) and best friend Paulie (Burt Young), but reluctantly agrees to train the young Adonis for a title shot against the current undefeated champion, 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (real-life boxer Tony Bellew), an English boxer who stands at 36-0 and has a number of significant physical advantages over the younger Creed.'Creed' is an excellent film, no question about it. It's a film that got a lot of praise, but was significantly overlooked by the Academy Awards, in my opinion, but let's not get into that. The film is stunningly well-acted and directed. Michael B. Jordan may have just found his signature role in this film. His star has been steadily rising over the years and this may be the film to carry him over the top. He obviously put in a lot of work to get himself into top physical fighting form to be able to carry this film and it shows - he does not disappoint. He knew he that, just like his character in the film, he had a phenomenal legacy to live up to, and he does. His training scenes with Stallone are reminiscent of the training scenes between Stallone and the late Burgess Meredith in the earlier 'Rocky' series; and there's also a great supporting character in Johnson's love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a talented nightclub singer who's progressively losing her hearing.Ryan Coogler - who first broke out on the movie scene with 'Fruitvale Station' (2013), which Jordan also starred in, and who also co-wrote the screenplay to 'Creed' with Aaron Covington (while sharing a sole story credit) - is another rising star in Hollywood. He certainly has the makings of a young director with a bright future ahead of him; if anyone was to make a movie centering around the character of Apollo Creed (or, more specifically, his descendants), than Coogler was certainly the right choice for the job.It would be unfair to chide this film for repeating many of the same plot devices that made 'Rocky' (1976) such a brilliant underdog story 40 years ago, and whose influence in popular culture is still being felt to this day. That is why we now have 'Creed' to carry on the torch.9/10",9,1,2,4 September 2016
Hot Fuzz," The 'Fuzz' is 'Hot!'
","Here we are again, reviewing yet another movie about cops & robbers. But 'Hot Fuzz' isn't the usual cops & robbers stuff that we're used to seeing here in the United States. Instead, 'Hot Fuzz' comes fresh off the boat from good old Great Britain, and satirizes American action movies with joyful glee.Perhaps the reason the project is so successful is because it comes to us from the same happy-go-lucky British comedians who brought us the delightful 'Shaun of the Dead' back in 2004 during what as an apparent peak in a craze for zombie movies at the cinemas. Yet, 'Hot Fuzz' is being released in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, so some might say the filmmakers are being insensitive when it's all really just bad timing. Now we shouldn't let the actions of one individual allow us to put judgment upon one little action movie, should we?'Hot Fuzz' was directed by 'Shaun of the Dead' Edgar Wright, and features Sergeant Nicholas Angel (co-screenwriter 'Shaun' Simon Pegg), a dedicated London police officer who is suddenly reassigned to a quiet little village called Sandford because he's making his fellow policemen look bad with his ridiculously high arrest record. Once there, he is slightly miffed by the lack of criminal activity that was apparent back in his native London (his biggest arrest happens to be on a bunch of underage drinkers), but later events threaten to change that.A series of suspicious and grisly accidents has been rocking the Sandford area for some time now, and Angel and his bumbling new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) are hot on the case. Butterman's an adrenalin junkie, a young live-wire eager for some action reminiscent of his favorite American action movies like 'Point Break' (1991), 'Bad Boys II' (2003), and the 'Lethal Weapon' films. Angel's deeper investigation into Sandford's public records shows a low crime rate, but an incredibly high accident rate. He suspects that these 'accidents' are homicides made to conceal something greater.'Hot Fuzz' isn't necessarily better than 'Shaun of the Dead' but is smarter than it. 'Hot Fuzz' is too self-conscious to be an out-right parody of American action movies but works best as a satire. The movie takes a look at America's obsession with gun culture and satirizes the hell out of it in several adrenalin-pumping action scenes. Though of course, not much happens during the course of the first hour as Angel and Butterman go through the usual buddy-cop movie motions and endure tedious non-action-related police-work, but things begin to pick up in the second hour once Angel and Butterman embark on their investigation to uncover the truth behind the strange events plaguing Sandford.The film is hilarious in a lot of ways, and extremely deadpan in others. The humor is of the satirical variety apparent in 'Shaun of the Dead,' but 'Hot Fuzz,' at least on a technical level, is somewhat edgier and better-written and better-acted (could a sadistic movie villain played by Timothy Dalton possibly be any more over-the-top?). The action scenes are extremely violent and bloody, but is hardly ever really shocking in any way. Action movie fans will have a ball picking out the prods at American action films, which shows to us that the filmmakers certainly know their material quite well.In the wake of the endlessly maddening cycle of violence plaguing the world at the present, 'Hot Fuzz' could easily be accused of being insensitive to current events. But we're forgetting that it's just a movie released at an inconvenient time.It's just a movie, folks.10/10",10,1,2,31 July 2007
Constantine," 'Constantine'
","In the tradition of comic book-to-film translations, 'Constantine' (no, not THAT Constantine) offers very little in the way of plot and just focuses squarely on special effects and such. Also in line with such tradition, it all but completely discards the source material, which in this case are the DC/Vertigo 'Hellblazer' comics. Though I'm not big on the 'Hellblazer' series, which have seen their most popular arcs through comic book artist Garth Ennis, I do realize that much is different from the source material, including the fact that morose hard-a** anti-hero John Constantine is British and most of the action of the comics takes place in Liverpool, England.But I'm not here to make comparisons; I'm here to judge a movie. The best thing to be said about 'Constantine' is that it keeps you watching, not just for the effects and strong visual delight but because it's fantasy - interesting fantasy.In 'Constantine,' we learn that John Constantine (the effectively wooden Keanu Reeves), is dying of cancer, forbidden from entering Heaven as a result of an attempted suicide (he was clinically dead for two minutes), has a bad attitude, and can see demons yet no one else can. To think that a normal person could see demons you'd have no choice but to declare that person insane, right? Demons and angels, we learn, cannot enter into the human plane of existence but strange occurrences in Los Angeles force Constantine to search for answers after he's attacked in public view by a demon.The plot to 'Constantine' bears more than a passing resemblance to a past Reeves vehicle ('The Matrix,' anyone?), in that as human beings, we are completely oblivious to the truth about our reality. As the film opens, two scavengers in Mexico discover the Spear of Destiny, the weapon rumored to have been used to kill Jesus Christ during the Crucifixion.One of them high-tails it to Los Angeles where the main plot of the film is revealed. Isabel Dodson, the twin sister of Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), commits suicide. Angela, the dogged detective she is, disbelieves the official story because she knows her sister was a devout Catholic and would never commit suicide, as such an act would require eternal damnation in Hell.The special effects are nonstop, and there is one effective and horrific sequence where Constantine ventures to Hell, which is in all respects, a darker vision of Los Angeles except it's a place where demons and the damned roam. With the help of his legion of otherworldly allies, who include normal human Chas (Shia LaBeouf), a half-breed named Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), appropriately named Father Hennessey (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton), Constantine and Angela race against time to stop a nefarious plot waged by the forces of Hell that could bring about the apocalypse.The plot, if you want to call it that, is pretty non-existent and Reeves is pretty wooden as usual but let's face it, nobody in this cast is going to get Oscars come next spring. The film drags for about the first 20 minutes or so but becomes more engaging as it goes through its motions. Director Francis Lawrence (of music video infamy, which accounts for the dizzying camera-work) does his best, but somehow or another the film can't really seem to get it together when it comes to certain parts of the script.For example, it's not really sure what it wants to be: a horror movie, fantasy, thriller, what? It's not really sure and I'm not really sure of what it wants to do. Such items shouldn't plague the viewer but it does, to me, play out a lot like a mish-mash of all three.As the anti-hero chain smoker John Constantine, Reeves' wooden acting is effective (is there any other way to play such a character?) and as the film progresses you can tell he's really suffering inside, as he grows sicker and sicker from cancer. And we also believe his desperation as he tries to send half-breeds to Hell in order to get back on God's good side so he can enter Heaven when he dies. In his character, we also get our fair share of Pentagrams and demonic spells and chanting and such. The opening sequence alone brings back uncomfortable memories of 'The Exorcist' (1973).'Constantine' may win over die-hards of the 'Hellblazer' and people may or may not get a kick out of Peter Stormare as an Armani-wearing Satan. Like Neo says, 'Whoa.'6/10",6,0,2,23 July 2005
Brokeback Mountain," 'Brokeback' - Between the two horizons, the greatest love story ever told
","'Old Brokeback got us good and it sure ain't over.'<ul><li>Jack Twist, 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005)</li></ul>Brokeback Mountain 'Brokeback Mountain' gets us good too.As a straight African-American male, I never thought I'd be showering praise over a movie about two cowboys in love with one another. Regardless of one's political leanings or religious convictions, it's hard to not find 'Brokeback Mountain' to be a dark, painful journey of love and affection. It's been billed as a 'gay cowboy movie' but that's just a 'cruel simplification' - Roger Ebert. To me, they aren't gay but are in fact very much straight, and hopelessly, desperately in love with each other.Most would think Hollywood has lost its mind by electing Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee to adapt E. Annie Proulx's short story, which first appeared in The New Yorker in 1997 and has won dozens of awards including the prestigious O. Henry Prize, to the big screen. But upon closer inspection, Lee is perhaps the most qualified person for the job since his career has been made by showcasing people trying to function outside the norms of their society.Beginning in the summer of 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the two ranch hands hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd sheep on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain range. Both men seem to be opposites, though the only thing they really share in common is the fact that they're both around the ripe age of 20. Ennis has lived with a troubling memory since boyhood in which one of two men living in an old shack was found beaten to death. Ennis's father had conditioned him and his brother to hate homosexuals; the irony is, to hate gays, he would be forced hate himself. Still for all he knows, his father did it.Ennis is of so few words that Jack is able brag that when he relates the story of how he was raised by his brother and sister and when they went off to get married, he was left by himself. Jack is a rodeo rider with little or no family ties, and seems more able to face the fact that he may be inescapably gay and in love with Ennis. For Ennis, it's more difficult.While on old Brokeback, the two go about their chores, herding the sheep, eating cans of beans on end, and spending lonely nights on opposite ends of the range. So when the two get pissy drunk one night, they passionately, almost violently have sex. The next morning, they're frank: Ennis says, 'You know I ain't queer' to which Jack replies, 'Me neither.' Of course in the big picture, that's exactly what they are.At the end of the summer, they part ways and the most they can get out of one another are generic send-offs like 'Like what are you doing later?' and such. Before arriving on Brokeback, Ennis was already engaged to Alma (Michelle Williams) and upon his return they get married and have children. Jack continues rodeo riding and meets the pretty Lureen (Anne Hathaway), who's the daughter of a rich farm equipment salesman and they have children of their own.I don't need to hint upon the controversy surrounding 'Brokeback Mountain' and its suspicious loss of Best Picture at the Oscars earlier this year. Watching this, I got the strong feeling that somehow that neither man is 'gay' in the sense we know - they don't know themselves, and I don't either really (so excuse my earlier presumptions) - and the movie makes it abundantly clear to us the audience.Take away the two men in love theme, you're stuck with just two people sharing a forbidden relationship over the course of a lifetime, but don't know why they're in love. I recall last year about some of the marketing strategies for theatrical posters and Ang Lee and his team suggested riffing on 'Titanic' (1997) and other classic romances - just with Ledger and Gyllenhaal sharing the title. Had the story been about a heterosexual couple from a different cultural, ethnic or religious background, I doubt the film would have received as much praise or controversy.The cinematography really makes the wide, open area of Brokeback Mountain shine and glisten and provide the characters and us with an overwhelming sense of freedom, as Ennis and Jack sometimes retreat there on 'fishing trips,' reliving that special summer from '63. Both Alma and Lureen get suspicious that neither of their husbands bring back any fish on these 'trips.' But both men embrace passionately after long absences from each other's company, and that makes this love much more powerful.The script by Larry McCurtry and Diana Ossana puts Proulx's short story under a microscope and highlights the love, pain, and despair of this great forbidden love between these two fellows who are in love and don't know what to do with it, much less try to remain happy in their separate marriages to kind and caring wives.There is something about one of the film's closing scenes, where Ennis retreats to Jack's family's house and goes up to his bedroom. We get to see Ennis reclaim a piece of their time together and 'Brokeback Mountain' seems to end on a note of optimism, something I really think the E. Annie Proulx short story opted out of. But between the two horizons, 'Brokeback Mountain' may very well be the greatest love story ever told to a mass audience.10/10",10,27,31,4 April 2006
Orphan," Movie of the day: 'Orphan'
","OK, so I'll admit that I didn't go into 'Orphan' expecting much. I originally didn't want to see the film, I had absolutely zero interest in seeing it, but I had the opportunity to see it with a girl I liked, so what the hell? I'll take a chance, and $10.25 at the local theater. I don't think 'Orphan' is nearly as bad as it could have been, or as bad as people are making it out to be.Yes, the film does concern Esther (Isabelle Furhman), a cute 9-year-old Russian girl who is adopted by the Colemans, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), who already have a young son and deaf-mute daughter. But pretty soon, the new addition to the family reveals a much darker and twisted side to her personality as a murderous psychopath that has been well-advertised in the commercials.The movie has caused some controversy in the weeks leading up to its release, stemming from the 'myths' about people adopting older children. My response is that 'Orphan' is just a movie; it's a work of fiction and I don't think this movie will put people off from adopting older children.The movie brings back memories of such 'evil child' movies such as 'The Omen' and 'The Bad Seed,' so we know where the plot is going to take us before it has a chance to waste our time and patience arriving at that moment. The film's big 'plot twist' revealing the truth about Esther's murderous dark side two-thirds of the way through 'Orphan' will not be a surprise to more thoughtful viewers, but at least it's made believable within the context of the film.There are also some funny parts in the movie as well, though I'm unsure if they were intentional or not on the part of the filmmakers, particularly director Jaume Collet-Serra and screenwriter David Johnson. Maybe it was intentional or not, but maybe it's because the laughs were aimed at the people who were two rows in front of us and who were whooping and hollering and screaming at the screen every time something scary happened...6/10",6,2,6,24 July 2009
Home Alone," A Classic Holiday Movie
","Home Alone is probably by far the best holiday comedy movie since Peter Billingsly in A Christmas Story, another holiday classic.The story of Home Alone is about a kid named Kevin McCallister(Macauly Culkin) who with his entire family are, going to France for the holidays. Kevin who is the youngest out of everyone in the house is often called by his brothers and sisters a 'disease.'  Anyway, one night, after his mom orders some pizza, he asks, 'Did anyone order a plain cheese?'  His older brother, Buz replies, 'Yeah, but if you want any, somebody's going to have barf it all up, now it's gone.'  Kevin his angry after discovering that Buz had purposely ate all the cheese pizza and gets into a fight with him.  When it's all over, everyone is mad at Kevin and sent to his room on the top floor for the night.  Later that night before going to sleep he says, 'I wish they would all just disappear.'Predictably, he wakes up the next morning to find everybody gone, not knowing that they had just left for the trip to France.  So this means party time for Kevin.  However, they're have been a string of burglaries by two partners in crime Harry(Joe Pesci) and Marv(Daniel Stern) (by the way are the best comic pair on screen) have set their sights on Kevin's house.  So this ultimately leads to their final showdown with Kevin setting his house full of traps so they can't get in.  As I said before Home Alone is a must see holiday classic.  I'm 15 now.  I first saw it when I was 5 in the theater.  I must have laughed myself silly at Kevin's pranks.  Home Alone was followed by a less successful, but just as entertaining sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost In New York and a horrible third entry, Home Alone 3.  10/10",10,0,1,22 December 2000
Terminator Salvation," Dark 'Salvation,' bright future
","'Terminator Salvation' is nowhere near the disaster it could have been, and I say that as a hardcore fan of the 'Terminator' franchise. I had never seen the two 'Charlie's Angels' movies that 'Terminator Salvation' director McG was behind, but I was aware of his history as a music video director and the trouble that could rain down upon 'Terminator Salvation.'The verdict is that McG pulls through, even though his music video sensibilities worked their way into the film's numerous action sequences. That also being said, this movie is very well-made and looks fantastic. While this is certainly a 'Terminator' for the MTV generation (fans of the movies made in the '80s and '90s may suffer some vertigo while watching this), McG's faults don't really show that much, even while his movie is a crystal-clear example of how low Hollywood's standards have fallen in recent years.I'm not bashing 'Terminator Salvation'; I'm simply proving a point about how well-made it is, considering the fact that any movie that is well-made nowadays can still be complete crap. And the movie is also well-acted and damn thrilling. Lastly, it's also pretty smart (with the way it handles the various time travel paradoxes present in the series, that make the impossible seem possible with enough thought). McG has also played down the significance of conversations he had with 'The Terminator' (1984) co-writer and director James Cameron, in which it was widely rumored that Cameron had given the film his blessing, and that turned out not to be true. The real truth is, Cameron has never seen the movie, so he can't comment on it.'The Terminator' is my favorite sci-fi movie of all time. While 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) was a vastly superior sequel, I personally felt that it repeated many of the plot devices from the first movie, and the injection of light-hearted humor tended to take away from the sense of urgency pervading the movie. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' (2003) was good, but in a brain-dead way that while it continued the story, it was just a big dumb movie with little redeeming value.'Terminator Salvation' returns some of the darkness and grit from the first 'Terminator' and gives it a big, 2009 MTV gloss-over. While I am certain that a director's cut is on the way that will give some sense of continuity to the series (all the previous movies were rated 'R,' while this one is 'PG-13'), I think that any restored footage will give this picture even more darkness and grit, that will further give it a sense of continuity in the greatest sci-fi series I've ever come across.This film is set in 2018 (11 years before the future that we knew in the first movie), 15 years after killer machines controlled by Skynet, a rogue computer system, will wage a war to exterminate mankind. It sent human-looking cyborgs, called Terminators, back in time to eliminate the future leader of the human resistance against them, John Connor. First they tried to kill his mother Sarah Connor, and then him as a child and teenager. Now, John Connor (Christian Bale, still doing his one-note Bruce Wayne/Batman thing) is a low-ranking member of the TechCom resistance, serving under the gung-ho General Ashdown (Michael Ironside).Elsewhere, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) awakes in a Skynet computer outpost and somehow or another crosses paths with John Connor later in the movie. Connor, meanwhile, is leading a search to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), the teenager who will eventually become his best friend and - get ready for it - his father; only through those time travel paradoxes is this possible - see 'T1' for reference. Marcus Wright is a peculiar specimen: the last thing he remembers is that he was on death row in the year 2003 awaiting execution when he was approached by a cancer-stricken Dr. Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), who wanted his body donated to science. Needless to say, Wright meets Reese first, leading to events that are already well-known to fans of the series everywhere.This is the first movie I've seen this year that I've felt my money was well-spent. I really liked 'Star Trek,' but I thought it was instantly forgettable. 'Terminator Salvation' is memorable, but I don't think it will be memorable in the same way the first movie was. This is a great, great movie; if a director's cut ever comes out, it will be even better. The great thing I always loved about the 'Terminator' series was its anti-Cold War subtext and commentary on a society that is rapidly becoming more and more mechanical at an alarming rate. Conspiracy nuts fearful about a cybernetic revolution should look no further than the 'Terminator' series.Like most people have said, the best thing about 'Terminator Salvation' is Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright; sadly, Bale's one-note performance makes the most important character in the movie the least interesting character. His performance is great because rather than him becoming an object of fear and horror, he's an object of sympathy. (You'll see halfway through the movie, if the previews haven't already given away his big secret.) The other revelation is Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese; this is the first time Reese has appeared in a movie since 'T2' (the extended version, at least). Reese has always been my favorite character, so it was nice to see someone else besides Michael Biehn play the role; Biehn's role was successfully passed to young Yelchin.'Terminator Salvation' proved to be the 'salvation' of a series some had thought was done for good, even after 'T3' was not so good. It's not a classic, but it is a worthy entry into this great, great sci-fi series that I love so dearly.P.S.: Look out for an artificial 'cameo' by the original Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with Scharzengger's face digitally added onto the body of Roland Kickinger.9/10",9,5,9,25 May 2009
Aquaman," I enjoyed it, even if it's really nothing special.
","I enjoyed seeing James Wan's latest, 'Aquaman,' the 2018 live-action film adaptation of the famed DC Comics character. 'Aquaman' tells a story that's actually quite similar to 'The Legend of King Arthur,' and revolves around half-human/half-Atlantean Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) becoming Aquaman in order to prevent war between the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and the human world. 'Aquaman' is much different from James Wan's previous films - of course, 'Saw.' The film (especially in its underwater sequences) looks fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but that's really all I got out of it. (I'm not a fan of Aquaman and perhaps if I was, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.) It's really no different from many other big-budget superhero films of late, especially those produced by rival Marvel. But I went with my father (who really wanted to see it) and he paid for our tickets - since I paid when we went to go see 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' (2018) a few days ago.7/10",7,3,5,3 January 2019
Juno," You'll be pleasant surprised by 'Juno'
","It's a scenario that's been the fodder for countless romantic comedies, teen comedies, and made-for-TV dramas on Lifetime: a young woman gets pregnant, usually unexpectedly, and has to deal with the pressures of becoming a reluctant mother. While 'Juno' does indeed present itself as such, the film quickly and ingeniously shows a slightly comical fluffy side that allows the film to not only deal with sensitive material intelligently and maturely, but we can also have a little fun and a good laugh along the way, too.Juno MacGuff (played with wonderful wit and sass by Ellen Page), is the 16-year-old title character who gets pregnant following an impromptu liaison with her would-be boyfriend and high school track runner Paulie Bleeker (the fragile Michael Cera, still riding the 'Superbad' wave). Juno at first decides to 'nip this thing in the bud' and get an abortion. But right away, 'Juno' removes itself from the morally black & white abortion area when she does go to the clinic, and decides not to go through with it because 'babies have fingernails.' Fingernails!Juno ultimately decides that she's going to have the baby and then give it up for adoption to a loving childless couple - Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) - after seeing their ad in a flier. But first she has to break the news to her pop (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom (Allison Janney) who are just thankful she's not on drugs or didn't get expelled from school. (Fundamentals will ask, 'Where are the parents?') But they're not absent or irresponsible parents, they're just along for the ride. Surely enough, Juno gets big (and I mean, big!) as she takes this pregnancy thing in stride. She gets mocked at school by her classmates and ugly looks from her teachers. All the while, we get to see Juno deal with her pregnancy in some greatly comic and offbeat fashions.'Juno' is a breath of fresh air in the tried and tired 'unplanned mommy' genre. It's coming to us with a smart-alecky script written by the provocative Diablo Cody that was directed by Jason Reitman (son of Ivan). Cody's screen writing goes to all the most unusual places and doesn't play games with a teenage girl's fragile predicament. Even though the film may initially come off as some lame drama (there are plenty of heartfelt moments here), it's easy to lose sight of the fact that first and foremost, this is a comedy - a comedy about growing up, the bumps along the way, and the choices we also make along the way. I found myself laughing along with plenty of other theater-goers at some of the witty dialogue and laugh-out-loud funny moments, all planted firmly in Cody's expertly written screenplay.But 'Juno' belongs squarely to Ellen Page, if this is her breakout performance. Already a shining young actress on the rise (I best remember her as Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat from 'X-Men: The Last Stand' back in 2006; I never saw 'Hard Candy'), she plays Juno as a decisive, clear-headed, sharp-tongued young woman who makes decisions as she sees fit, as they come her way, because it's clear to her that she's not ready to become a mother. I already stated that she's a sassy young woman here, and that sass also gets her some of the movie's best and funniest lines. I also mentioned the 'fingernails' line, but after she aborts her abortion, there's a sharply-written sequence of dialogue where she says to the Lorings if they've ever considered adoption from China, because 'they give babies away like free iPods.' I laughed out loud at that one, even if it sounds a little too politically-incorrect.'Juno' - it's the little movie that could, the little-movie-that-could that you least expected to love.10/10",10,2,9,5 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Well, I'm still here after 'The Day After Tomorrow'
","First off, I'm going to make this short and simple: I'm not an environmentalist, don't know any, nor do I care to get swept up in their crusade to save our planet. BUT, I do respect what they try to do (not to mention the lengths), and that is in that they try to change the course of the grim direction that our world is headed, especially in today's times. I try to not get caught up in politics, but 'The Day After Tomorrow' has already stirred up so much heated debate in the weeks before its release, I might as well speak out on some of them. I didn't go to this film to judge it on its 'science'; that would basically defeat the purpose of going to the theater and watching it. What I will say, even though I'm no climatologist, is that it isn't the science that's important, it's the effect.Believe it or not, many will flock to this film just to see Lady Liberty (not to mention most of New York) get trashed by a massive tidal wave, but will be surprised by the human element of the film. Though much of the first half of the film is dedicated to special effects, the second half is made up mostly of characters; that's an achievement in film-making. A special effects bonanza that actually takes time to let us get to know and feel for the characters. I'm not saying that the performances were bad, but they were all in fact, pretty convincing.Roland Emmerich, the director of 'The Day After Tomorrow,' has a long resume of special effects blockbusters listed as his achievements. This is the same man that brought us 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla' and who can now add this movie to his list as his next great film. Much of the debate surrounding 'The Day After Tomorrow' has been centered on him, and that is wrong. He set out to make a movie about global warming and the onset of another ice age, not to convert the audience into environmentalists.Now here I come. I had originally wanted to see this film just to try to make sense of the controversy, and I did, more or less. People will judge this movie, not just for its credibility, but because of who and what it's supposedly aimed at: our government, which is said by some to be quite lax on the environment, especially under President George W. Bush. Indeed, I believe he hasn't done much for the environment, but I'm not here to rip him to shreds.I've read a number of articles judging this film's science and whilst they all say it's hogwash, the scenario that it depicts is not that far from the truth, and it's for that reason I gave 'The Day After Tomorrow' a '10.' I'm more likely to believe men and women who have written books on the possibility of a new ice age than the people who say that this movie is total bull****, and most likely haven't seen it yet. Whether or not people will use 'The Day After Tomorrow' as a model for environmental change and awareness, I say let them use it; it probably won't do them that much good anyway. If people want to bash it because they say, 'That's not going to happen,' let them say it. But for those, like me, who went to this movie with an open mind about its message, don't ruin it for us; since we're most likely in the minority, we could laugh at those who use this movie as some kind of tool or gimmick for their causes.P.S.: This film's final closing shots of New York City with a frozen Statue of Liberty, and a half-frozen North America are both sure to start debate on those startling images alone.",10,1,3,29 May 2004
X-Men," Movie review
","'X-Men' is the long-awaited film adaptation of the highly popular Marvel Comics characters about two rivaling groups of mutants. The first group is led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). He is a sort of humanitarian as he believes that there is a way for mutants to coexist peacefully with normal humans without the threat of violence, who have since come to fear them. He runs an academy where mutants come to learn and control their extraordinary powers. The other group of mutants is led by Erik Magnus Lensharr a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellan). Magneto, who is a survivor of the World War II holocaust, believes that mutants should rise up against the oppressive and fearful human population who resent him and other mutants like him. The films main plot revolves around two new mutants: the first is Logan, better known as 'Wolverine' (Hugh Jackman) who carries a long-burning hate for the world, as he is also the font of intense anger and his primary weapons are razor-sharp claws that come out of his hands; the other is Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can absorb the powers of other mutants and has run away from home after a particularly disturbing incident with her boyfriend. Some of the other mutants include Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who has the ability to read minds; Storm (Halle Berry), who can control the weather; Cyclops (James Marsden) who wears a visor to control the powerful beam of energy that is emitted from his eyes; Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) who has highly feral instincts; Toad (Ray Park) who gets his name from his abnormally long tongue and green skin color; and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who can alter her shape at will.'X-Men' remains to be an astonishing adaptation of the comic book. Though I have never read the comic books, I grew up on the animated t.v. series, video games and memorabilia such as trading cards and action figures. Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) shows here that he is a truly great film maker and I am looking forward to the sequel that is going to be released on May 2.9/10",9,0,0,22 April 2003
Spider-Man 3," 'Spider-Man 3' - You wanna talk about a 'tangled web'?
","Director Sam Raimi returns for a third time to direct another 'Spider-Man' movie, 'Spider-Man 3,' which promises to not only be an excellent summer movie, but a spectacular closer to a marvelous superhero saga. Darker than its predecessors, it asks the question that has plagued us for three years now: How will 'Spider-Man 3' condense so many Marvel Comics' story lines and sub-plots into a 140-minute feature-length running time?I had my own reservations about such notions when it was first announced that Spider-Man would be facing not one, not two, but THREE super-villains, each with long, drawn-out back-stories (and many comic book issues) of their own. As a lifelong fan of Spidey, the creation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics, I was glad to hear that my favorite character (aside from Spider-Man himself) would be making a big-screen appearance now. After viewing the movie, another character becomes a favorite (more on this later).The 'Spider-Man' title is well-known in the comics industry for being one of the best examples of a superhero whose problems outside of saving the world were given times and places in print to be properly fleshed out. Peter Parker (played superbly in the movies by Tobey Maguire, who's unsure if he'll return for part IV, if one ever manifests itself) was a geek, a loner, in grade and financial trouble, and had romantic woes; a bite from a genetically altered spider only compounded his problems. So this is why so many average Joes, like me, could relate to Spider-Man so easily. Although DC Comics had Batman and Superman, who both had great story lines, adventures and romantic entanglements of their own, it was Spidey's persistent personal problems that won over readers. The first two movies have addressed these perfectly.In 'Spider-Man 3,' things seem to be looking up for our hero, both as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, though they won't be that way for long. It seems he's finally gotten his life together and everything is going his way: Spider-Man has saved New York City from certain danger so many times he's finally getting the respect he so richly deserves (including the Key to the City). At school, he's at the top of his class, and he's about to pop the question to girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).However, he is still haunted by his inability to patch up his friendship with best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spider-Man and Peter for his father Norman Osborn's/Green Goblin's (played in the first film by Willem Dafoe, who also shows up here posthumously) death, although much is still unknown to the son, who eventually transforms himself into the notorious Green Goblin II, the first villain. And even though Mary Jane is a great Broadway actress and Peter tries to reassure her of that fact, she earns terrible reviews for her performance and is painfully distressed by the news. But because Peter is letting his newfound fame go to his head, it's difficult for her to express her real feelings to him.The meat of the story gets underway when a mysterious black ooze bonds with Peter, and the alien symbiote brings about a darker side of his personality that threatens to destroy him. Once in the new 'black suit,' he comes to add revenge to his list of to-do items when he discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was involved in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, in flashback). Marko, on the other hand, while fleeing the cops, falls into an experimental vat and has his molecules zapped away, later reconstituting himself with the sand to become the Sandman. The Sandman becomes villain #2.Meanwhile, a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), wants Peter's job of peddling photographs of Spider-Man to editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). Brock is also dating Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who may or may not be flirting with Peter. Needless to say, when the two share a kiss and Mary Jane sees it, she doesn't take it lightly. The Black Suit continues an assault on Peter, who becomes increasingly hostile and once realizing what it's done to him, separates from it, the symbiote later bonding with a vengeful Eddie Brock to become Venom, villain #3. Can Peter Parker/Spider-Man overcome Green Goblin II, The Sandman and Venom (favorite), his inner demons, and get back Mary Jane and save the world within the allotted 140 minutes?Co-screenwriter Raimi returns to his love-labor project triumphant. While some things could have been better fleshed out, the 140-minute running time was really pushing it in terms of story. Still, he and brother Ivan's screenplay manages to play itself out reasonably, although I still believe much was left on the cutting room floor. It's also obvious Raimi's taken cues from the 'Superman' movies on how to craft an epic story. It is true that 'Spider-Man 3' seems to do a lot, but you have to give Raimi credit for doing what he was able to do, combing the pages of Marvel Comics and combining basically 40 years worth of storyline into 2 1/2 hours.While I doubt Tobey Maguire will probably return for another sequel, this is undoubtedly the actor's finest performance. It's amazing how well he was able to balance the tangled emotions of his tormented character. Although he has to be the least expressive good actor out there, I really liked him here, especially in his 'darker' scenes. The other actors were good, including the great Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and especially Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman, who, like Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) from 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), earns our hearts as a sympathetic villain.For this fan, 'Spider-Man 3' is a bit of a mixed triumph, but it's a valiant effort from actors and filmmakers that know the heart of their material well.10/10",10,26,43,4 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," A review of 'Resident Evil: Extinction'
","'Resident Evil: Extinction,' the latest (and certainly not the last) in a series of video game-to-movie adaptations based on the popular Capcom video game series about an out-of-control virus that transforms its victims into zombies and other ghastly mutations, may very well be the most explosive, trigger-happy film this series has seen yet, though it is by no means the best.This latest comes to us from 'Highlander' Russell Mulcahy, the music video director-turned 'B'-movie filmmaker who's been on the underground 'B'-movie circuit since that 1986 film and has never quite been able to repeat its cult success. 'Resident Evil: Extinction' was written by none other than first 'Resident Evil' director Paul W.S. Anderson, and he takes his cues from the material to build yet another apocalyptic bang-bang, shoot-'em-up zombie-horror flick.One could possibly deduce that this movie's success lies on one principal factor: the rise in the popularity of zombie movies within the last five years or so. If you remember back in 2004, this film's predecessor 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' was a reigning box office champ, and other zombie flicks of that year (the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake, 'Shaun of the Dead') were also packing them in. So this film's success seems assured, or so it would appear.This time out, in 'Extinction,' six months after 'Apocalypse,' the only way to stay alive is to be out on the open road, and a few remaining survivors of the Raccoon City outbreak are part of a heavily armored convoy in the American Southwest, searching for any sort of a safe haven as the out-of-control experimental 'T' Virus has decimated the world's population, and turned much of the planet's surface into a barren wasteland. With plot devices a la 'The Road Warrior' and 'Day of the Dead,' Alice (soon-to-be Mrs. Paul W.S. Anderson Milla Jovovich, returning for a third time out), joins this convoy with Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. officer Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), L.J. (Mike Epps) and newcomers medic Betty (Ashanti), radio operator Mikey (Christopher Egan), and convoy leader Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Somehow or another, Alice gets wind of a possible safe haven up north in Alaska, presumably isolated from 'T' Virus infection.Meanwhile, at an outpost in the middle of the desert, the last remaining American branch Umbrella Corporation scientists are hard at work 'domesticating' test-subject zombies, under the leadership of the mad scientist Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen). It's cute that even he has a 'Day of the Dead'-like zombie, though his name isn't Bub and he's not saluting to any Captain Rhoads look-a-likes here. Isaacs has also been conducting experiments in trying to replicate Alice because her blood possibly holds a cure that will reverse the 'T' Virus's effects. (In another plot device, a la 'Alien: Resurrection,' it's taken him 86 Alice clones so far to try to get things right.)To get this out of the way, 'Resident Evil: Extinction' is not a very intelligent film, though the one thing it manages to truly get by on is atmosphere. There are plenty of moments when you feel there's no hope and you're with some of the characters in their desperation, and that's one element of the film that Mulcahy gets right. Another thing done correctly are the film's special effects, since gore and Tom Savini-wannabe zombie effects have been a no-show or poorly done in both previous 'Resident Evil' movies. And the sweeping cinematography captures the barren desert landscape perfectly, giving it an eerie life of its own.What 'Resident Evil: Extinction' suffers from are a lack of well-developed characters. (For the record, I've never seen so many of the main characters die off so quickly within say, a 20-minute time-span. Even the 'Alien' movies weren't that cold-hearted.) But then, since so many of those characters are underdeveloped anyway, there's no real connection to them in the first place. In terms of story, you can tell the film series seems to be running on empty, since, after all, the 'T' Virus has almost completely decimated the world's population, so it can only go so much further. Perhaps Anderson jumped the gun a little bit here but then again, he's never been much of a screenwriter to begin with.'Resident Evil: Extinction' is, if nothing else, a worthy closer to a series that's had its run. At least if another movie is made, you can tell it's going to be pretty short. And if another movie is made, what's it going to be called? 'Extinction' is out; 'Doomsday,' maybe?6/10",6,1,3,1 October 2007
The Terminator," Question: Why Is This Movie So Popular?
","Answer: Because The Terminator is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.  That's why.The story is familiar to countless fans, so I won't go too deep into it. In the not-to-distant future, a war is being fought between humans and killer machines.  The machines are on the verge of losing the war.  So they desperately send a killer cyborg called a T-800 or a Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill a woman named Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) who is destined to give birth to the leader of the human resistance, John Connor.  The humans however, send a brave soldier back in time to intercept the Terminator.  His name is Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn).  Now only one question is left.  Who will reach Sarah first: Reese or the Terminator?This has to be one of the greatest sci-fi films to come out during the 1980's.  It is also director James Cameron's second best film behind Aliens.This movie has so many good action scenes, my favorite being the police massacre scene because it shows just how cold and relentless the Terminator is in pursuit of something it wants.This is definitely Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role yet.  He has yet been able to top it off.  His performance in T2 was alright but it wasn't typical Schwarzenegger.  Michael Biehn probably gives his best performance here also.  His role in Aliens was pretty awesome, too.  He did take a turn in The Abyss by playing a bad guy.  Linda Hamilton, an extremely underused actress plays probably her most convincing role of her career.  Her performance in T2 was great, but it's sad that she won't be appearing in the T3.One final note about the Special Edition DVD.  The many special features it has like the 'Terminated' scenes and stuff is cool, but the sound quality of the remastered version is poor.  The reason why I probably hate the remastered version so much is probably because I'm used to watching an old unmastered version of the movie that my dad taped off of Cinemax or HBO or something like that.The Terminator gets a 10/10.",10,0,0,7 November 2001
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A 'Golden' Hellboy
","Guillermo del Toro directed 'Hellboy' in 2004, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of that year. Now four years later, del Toro is behind the camera again to direct (and screen-write) its superior sequel, 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army.' This 'Hellboy' is more true to the director's visionary style, which saw its best realization in 'Pan's Labyrinth' in 2006, with its lush, bizarre, and striking visuals that brought the famed Mexican director's wild imagination to life in an effective and brilliant manner.I'm a fan of Mike Mignola's Dark Horse Comics superhero staple, so I eagerly looked to this sequel with joyful anticipation. Demon Prince Nuada (Luke Goss, from del Toro's 'Blade II') has grown resentful of a centuries-old truce that allows the mythical world to live peacefully alongside their human counterparts. He kills his father and steals the crown that will allow him to awaken the dreaded Golden Army so that he will then be able to lead the Golden Army to conquer all of the known world. To stop him, is Hellboy a.k.a. 'Red' (the perfectly cast Ron Perlman), his girlfriend, the pyro-kinetic Liz Sherman (the strangely attractive Selma Blair), and amphibious mutant Abe Sapien (Doug Jones).This movie gets rip-roaring along from the get-go, with its freakish visuals, special effects and witty humor, assuring fans of the original film (and comics) that this will not be a tepid affair. There's really no need to reintroduce the characters here, since del Toro did that in the first movie. Here, he really gets to have fun and lets loose with 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army.' Perlman again proves why he is the perfect actor to play Mignola's Nazi-spawned, wise-cracking, cigar-chomping red demon-superhero. He's simply the best actor for the job, even though he's only recognizable by his voice. More so, his troublesome relationship with Liz Sherman is also put to the test, since she harbors a secret that will either make or break their romantic relationship. And it's this freak/freak drama that makes up the film's emotional core.Readers know that 'Spider-Man 2' (2004) is my favorite superhero film (my #2 all-time favorite film) and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero of all time, but Hellboy is one of my best guilty pleasures. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' certainly ranks as one of the most visually appealing superhero films ever, and one of the best superhero films to come out this year.9/10",9,2,3,11 November 2008
Cloverfield," The 'Cloverfield' review
","(Before I start this, I just want to say I'm 22, going on 23, and that I grew up watching Japanese monster movies, or 'kaiju-eiga,' and I consider Godzilla to be the ultimate movie monster. I've also come to love Gamera and Ultraman, and I was gosh-wowed last year by South Korea's contribution to the genre, 'The Host.' Now here we are at 'Cloverfield,' what I will refer to as 'the first great American monster movie of the 21st century.')It makes no sense to describe the plot to the 'Alias' J.J. Abrams-produced, Drew-Goddard-written, Matt Reeves-directed flick 'Cloverfield' in any real detail because therein lies the problem: there is no real detail, only raw, on-the-scene, up close & personal action. In a hype campaign the likes of which haven't been seen in a movie of this type for quite some time now, 'Cloverfield' remarkably lives up to expectations. Ever since the first trailer appeared during the previews for 'Transformers' last year, a three-syllable word has come to describe a movie to be released on January 18, 2008, and it was called 'Cloverfield,' even though early press releases said that wasn't the movie's real title.So what's all the hoopla about? Some suspected a war movie, others a viral outbreak, or a terrorist attack. As you know, the plot has been kept real hush-hush, though sordid details have been allowed to leak on the Internet.Rumor control, these are the facts -All you need to know is this: in an inventively bizarre hybrid that combines elements of both 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'The War of the Worlds' with 'Godzilla,' a monster is laying waste to New York City. Buildings crumble, the Brooklyn Bridge is snapped in two like a twig, the military strikes back, mass hysteria as thousands try to flee the city, and a giant reptilian beast of unknown origin is causing mass destruction. The chaos is captured through the hand-held lens of a couple of terrified New Yorkers as they give a first-hand account of the devastation while trying to reach safety.And that's all you really need to know. First of all, because this is a first-person account of a New York City monster attack, we never get to see a really good picture of the monster until somewhere close to the very end, since it decides to make its debut at nighttime in the City That Never Sleeps, and up until then all we get are brief flashes and glimpses of 'it.' (To get an idea of this creepy critter, imagine a reptile, like a shell-less turtle, combined with a slug and a sea crustacean. And then imagine its nastier, creepy-crawly subordinates that come to chow down on many unsuspecting New Yorkers.) To get this out of the way, this beast is a force to be reckoned with. It's certainly an impressive CGI creature creation, like all the classic Japanese monsters I grew up with - Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Gamera. But what's paramount here, is that this flick, despite any misgivings I'll probably have in the future, is way better than the 1998 American adaptation of 'Godzilla.''Cloverfield' does have some pretty wicked special effects sequences, including some genuinely intense moments of peril and a few particularly chilling sights and sounds. Some have panned the shaky and frenetic camera-work; if you were in the middle of all this chaos, would your camera be perfect and composed? The guy's right there, in the thick of it, scared to death with his closest friends; does anyone really think he's going to get the Oscar for Best Cinematography or something, if he makes it out of the city alive? I don't think so.New York has seen some pretty wild sights over the decades. In the post-9/11 world, you would think that 'Cloverfield' is the last thing Americans would want to see right now, and Abrams will be accused in the future of being insensitive to the feelings of Americans. But it seems that every so often filmmakers need to vent some unstated/unwritten frustration/aggression and this is what we occasionally get sometimes.And as for those poor New Yorkers I was telling about? Well, their footage was found.10/10",10,12,27,18 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Excellent
","Sleepy Hollow is an excellent piece of film.  I for some reason missed it when it came out in November of 1999.  I finally didn't get a chance to see it until it came out on tape earlier this year.  I thought Sleepy Hollow was going to be based on the book, instead it is more of a horror-mystery. Anyway, Sleepy Hollow is a good film.  It's actually Tim Burton's best film since Batman.  10/10",10,0,1,20 October 2000
Silent Hill," Welcom to Silent Hill - the seventh layer of hell!
","My biggest problem with 'Silent Hill' is that I never played the Konami video game the film is based on. Perhaps if I had, then this review wouldn't sound so clueless, and I might have enjoyed myself much more. But to clear one thing up about the above sentences, I did play the very first 'Silent Hill' game when it came out in 1999 on the Sony Playstation, but for only about 10 minutes before I took the disc out because I was so terrified of it... and nothing had happened yet!Flipping through the pages of my March '99 issue of Official Playstation Magazine, I'm reminded of my first frightful moments playing that game, even though nothing had happened. There's a wonderful interview with the game's Japanese developers, and the review's author Joe Rybicki obviously seems pleased with the game - its twisted story, atmosphere, scary touches, and disturbing music and sound effects.But I have to look at the movie a little bit different. It's directed by a capable Frenchman, Christophe Gans (of 2001's 'Brotherhood of the Wolf'), who keeps a strong bit of tension in the opening 45 minutes but lets it go when more characters pop out of nowhere and the story could have used some more polishing. Dread, fear, and paranoia grip Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) when her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) mysteriously disappears in the ash-tainted, fog-drenched ghost town of Silent Hill, West Virginia.Hot on her trail is cop Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), and so is husband Christopher (Sean Bean), who seeks to stop Rose by any means possible. See, daughter Sharon has a problem with sleepwalking at night, and is always whispering into her mother's ear the eerie name 'Silent Hill,' the haunted West Virginia town abandoned 30 years earlier where the fires in the underground mines still burn. So Rose searches, but even as the sirens blare, the town goes dark, and she quickly learns that this town may not be abandoned.For a movie based on a video game, this is good despite my objections to the story and pacing. I think Roger Ebert has a bit of a problem with movies based on video games, since he rated 'Doom' (2005) and 'Resident Evil' (2002) both with one star. I do tend to equate 'Silent Hill' with those two films, in addition to 'Mortal Kombat' (1995), the best video game adaptation, since they are all decent efforts.But with 'Silent Hill,' if you could stand those aforementioned efforts without gagging too much, then 'Silent Hill' should grow on you, terrify you (somewhat), and make you edge and squirm in your seat. There's a strong visual sense going about and in remaining faithful to the overall tone of the games, there are some genuinely shocking and gruesome sights and very few cheap scares. And it might just become the second best video game adaptation that this viewer has seen. Having to go on Rybicki's review, I'd say that 'Silent Hill' is probably the most faithful game-to-film adaptation ever made.That's the 'Silent Hill' treatment; just don't let the 'darkness' get you.8/10",8,2,4,24 April 2006
Crash," 'Crash' - head-on
","'Crash,' the new film by Paul Haggis would play out even more like a slice-of-life urban drama if it weren't for the realities of the O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King beating and the subsequent Los Angeles riots of 1992. That all these events took place in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and that Haggis' film too is set within the City of Angels over the course of 36 hours, it's not without the blinding in-your-face irony of the reality it attempts to convey to the audience that we're looking into ourselves. Haggis has assembled one of the most dynamic casts for this multi-character drama that includes Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, and Thandie Newton. In several poignant vignettes, the sensitive race issue is explored in deep, painful, and resentful fashions - no sides taken - and the people in the audience are left to ponder the film's message, as well as examine their own innermost prejudices. If it weren't for the realities depicted in 'Crash,' we would not have such an in-depth look into the near-complete absence of human compassion and emotion. One of the best films of the year, 'Crash' goes head-on into becoming a sure winner.10/10",10,6,15,10 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'There's only one return, you f*****g morons, and it's not 'of the King,' it's 'of the Jedi!'' - Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), in 'Clerks II' (2006)
","As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one 'Return' that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's 'Return of the Jedi,' directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch 'Star Wars' loyalist, so I won't fault him there.I honestly have nothing personal against the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long 'Star Wars' geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. 'Star Wars' creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get 'Star Wars' (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity.And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally 'get' the significance of 'Star Wars' and what Lucas achieved in 1977.'Return of the Jedi,' for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) is my favorite 'Star Wars' film all around (2005's 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a 'favorite,' but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was 'The Empire Strikes Back.'Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that 'Return of the Jedi' is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason 'Return' suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in 'Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes Back.' A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with 'The Empire Strikes Back.'The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. 'Return of the Jedi' is still a first-degree special effects spectacle.10/10",10,0,2,19 July 2013
The Expendables," 'The Expendables' - Not so 'Expendable'
","Sylvester Stallone, star/co-writer/director of the 2010 all-star action romp 'The Expendables,' is living proof that some guys do get better with age. Stallone, who is pushing 65, is still in remarkably well-kept shape in 'The Expendables,' in which he is the leader of a gang of mercenaries hired by mysterious government forces - a guy named 'Church' (Bruce Willis) - to overthrow General Garza (David Zayas), a South American dictator who is actually a puppet for a rogue CIA agent named James Munroe (Eric Roberts). That's pretty much all there is to the plot and is really all that we need to know as audience members.Stallone is Barney Ross, their fearless leader; aging action stars from the '80s and more current action heroes are his comrades. They all have ridiculous names (or aliases? I'm not sure) like Ross's right-hand man and second-in-command Lee Christmas (Jason Statham, who by far turns in the film's most enthusiastic performance); Yin Yang (Jet Li); Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren); Toll Road (Randy Couture); and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). Helping them out from the sidelines, is Tool (Mickey Rourke).These guys are all aging old dogs and they know it, but that doesn't mean you should count them out because many of them are all either pushing 50 (Statham, Li, Couture, Crews), or 60 (Stallone, Lundgren, Rourke); they know how to get the job done and have a ball doing it. What we get in 'The Expendables,' is machismo, explosions, old-dog camaraderie, and more machismo. And the film's two lone females, Lee's main squeeze Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) and a South American peasant girl named Sandra (Giselle Itie), are pretty much left out in the cold although Itie's Sandra does get to exchange some hesitant romantic glances with Barney.Stallone is proving to be a highly capable director in his own right; like I said earlier, he's getting better with age, rather than worse. (But let's just get this out of the way: each of his films within the last four years are way better than anything he directed while still at the height of his career in the '80s and early '90s.). His legendary comeback film 'Rocky Balboa' in 2006 is the best film of his so far (and it's my personal favorite 'Rocky' picture), and 'Rambo' (2008) was a blood-soaked throwback to his other trademark character. 'The Expendables' is a throwback to the good old days gone by of the no-holds-barred blow-'em-up action pictures of the '80s and early '90s from which Stallone and many of his other co-stars in the film sprang.What 'The Expendables' does best, other than blowing lots of stuff up without a conscience, is getting all these guys together and having a lot of fun doing it. Some of them (namely Lundgren), haven't appeared in a mainstream Hollywood action flick since the early '90s, and that makes seeing them in action here worth the price of the admission alone. And each star has their time to shine on-screen; Lee Christmas beats up a romantic rival on a basketball court; UFC Champ Randy Couture gets a chance to go toe-to-toe with Munroe's right-hand man Paine (WWF star 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin); Lundgren, a black belt in Shotokan Karate, has his big action scene chewed face-to-face with Wushu champ Li; and lastly, we also get to see the famous scene where Austin actually broke Stallone's neck during a fight sequence.'The Expendables' is living proof that the days of no-holds-barred blow-'em-ups are not yet gone. Age is nothing but a number, that is true, and it's good to be schooled in how to make a no-conscience action flick from guys who know how to make such shameless action pictures. Stallone is miles ahead of most modern-day action over-directors who have no clue about how to properly direct a shamelessly violent action picture. The biggest gripe here is that Stallone often has way too much going on on-screen, and the chaotic MTV-style editing makes it hard to tell what's going on and is the main thing that goes wrong in an otherwise flawed but bold and shamelessly entertaining and bloody action picture.And keep your eyes open for a three-way ego-stroking match in a church between Stallone, Willis, and one other action star from the '80s who will have to be seen to be believed.8/10",8,4,8,25 November 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Inside Pan's Labyrinth
","'Pan's Labyrinth' marks the second feature from outside the United States that I've seen within the last two days that I have proudly slapped '10' ratings upon. Without question, 'Pan's Labyrinth' is probably one of the most original movies I've seen since the start of the millennium, and I've seen a lot of movies.My positive response to 'Pan's Labyrinth,' from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro ('Blade II,' 'Hellboy') probably comes from the fact that the fantasy genre, like horror and sci-fi, is not a genre that is usually up to par in the area of intelligence. But alas, one of the best visionary talents in the business ventures into a world that is entirely of his own creation and for once, he gets it right.del Toro made his mark on audiences in 1993 with the acclaimed vampire flick 'Cronos,' a film I'll admit I have not seen but have heard much about, including the praise for the uniquely original vision of the director and its eight wins at the Ariel Awards in Mexico. He made his American feature-film debut with the horror film 'Mimic' (1997), and then returned to Mexico with 'The Devil's Backbone' (2001), which I have also not seen. del Toro has won over legions of comic book fans for his work on the aforementioned 'Blade II' (2002), an adaptation of the Marvel Comics character and 'Hellboy' (2004), which is an adaptation of the Dark Horse comic created by artist Mike Mignola. Now we're at 'Pan's Labyrinth.'A film with roots in well-known fairy tales such as 'Alice in Wonderland,' 'Through the Looking Glass,' 'The Chronicles of Narnia,' Roman mythology but sources chiefly from del Toro's own twisted imagination, the Spanish-language 'Pan's Labyrinth' is set in post-Civil War Spain in 1944 during World War II. The chaotic Civil War and WWII are only a backdrop for the meat of the story, which centers around 11-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is driven with her widowed, very-pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to the Spanish countryside where her husband, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), and his men have been ordered to eliminate the remaining pockets of the Republican Resistance.One night while sleeping, Ofelia meets a strange insect-like creature (which looks like a combination of a walking stick and praying mantis) that later morphs into a kind of fairy. It later introduces her to Pan (Doug Jones, an American talent in two roles under incredible amounts of makeup), who gives her three tasks to complete to ensure that her 'essence remains intact.' What this means, is that Pan recognizes Ofelia to be a long-lost princess, and these three tasks are a means for her to re-enter the kingdom where her father, the king, awaits.But these little tasks of Pan grow to be increasingly dangerous, as Ofelia is also hounded by the realities of her surroundings, including her ailing mother, the Resistance in the woods, and the sadistic Vidal's increasingly brutal methods of dealing with the Resistance. The only other person in her real world who really cares for her is Vidal's faithful servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu).'Pan's Labyrinth,' despite the fact it's a fairy tale, is certainly not a picture for children. Heed the 'R' rating, parents, because you'll be shocked by some of what you see here. Its graphic violence (the most gruesome of which seems to be kept off-screen, for the most part) and disturbing fantasy imagery is what you have to beware of. Beyond that, this is one of the most starkly original fantasy pieces in a long time.When looking at a picture like this, especially a foreign-language picture, you'll have to cast aside any hesitant thoughts you may have, such as refusing to read subtitles. Really, I watch martial arts movies and Anime' and occasionally I have to deal with reading subtitles; it's not a big deal. It just ensures that you have to pay more attention to what's going on. With that said, I feel that the fact 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a Spanish-language feature only adds to its alien appeal, to remind us that we're watching something that is far removed from our reality. That's another plus on the part of del Toro.The actors are well-chosen (del Toro himself apparently hand-picked many of his principals). The bravest is the 12-year-old Ivana Baquero as young Ofelia. Bookish and seemingly unable (or unwilling) to grasp the harsh realities of the world around her, her escape into the world of Pan's Labyrinth seems almost expected of her by the more thoughtful members of the audience, given her circumstances. The aesthetic appeal of 'Pan's Labyrinth' is what has surely gotten this film most of its greatest accolades around the world. From del Toro's own unlimited imagination, a whole new world springs to life almost effortlessly. His camera catches this fantasy universe perfectly, and his story is simply fantastic and otherworldly. As an aspiring author myself, this is what drew me in the most. Like Lewis Carroll or C.S. Lewis and their respective fantasy visions, 'Pan's Labyrinth' is all the more likely to join them as cherished classics.'Pan's Labyrinth' is a dark, uniquely original experience from a great director, Guillermo del Toro. He is truly one of the most original talents working in the film industry today. I can only hope he keeps it up.10/10",10,6,13,16 May 2007
Final Destination 2," A trip that's still worth taking. 9/10
","In a number of ways, the sequel to 2000's surprise hit is a better-made, not necessarily better film than the first one.  It takes the ideas from the first film and builds on them.  While the first movie actually scared you, this one is more in it for shock value.  Yet that doesn't make it bad because you admire the craft that's gone into it.  'Final Destination 2' is unique amongst horror films in being that it has a unique villain (or hero?)  Death.  The movies are philosophical in being that they ask an ages old question: Is there any way to beat death?  Of course there is no way to beat death but according to the movies, if you recognize the signs or patterns that Death is willing to show you, it can be beaten.  The real truth is that Death has a really sadistic sense of humor in that it likes to toy with its victims before finally taking them.  It likes to trick its victims into thinking that it can be beaten, but the truth is that in the end, no one escapes Death; the only thing you can do really is delay it.  I think the 'Final Destination' films are not really horror movies, but really dark satires that show how people react under extreme distress. 'FD2' is also unique in its portrayal of the characters.  In my opinion, Death is not the villain, but it's the characters themselves.  The characters go to these absurd lengths to try to cheat Death, knowing that they can't.  They and Death go to extreme lengths to outwit one another, but Death always comes out on top.  The people need to just learn you can't cheat Death, because when your number's up, it's up.",9,0,0,18 September 2003
Blade II," Y'all know the name...BLADE
","'Blade II', the highly anticipated sequel to the 1998 action thriller of the same name, met every single one of my expectations.  I expected 'Blade II' to surpass 'Blade' in almost every way and it did.  This meant more weapons, more action, more vampires, and the best part of about this movie of course, Blade himself.  There is a lot of shots of vampires being dismembered, blown up, and fried by sunlight. 'Blade II' takes place two years after the events of the first film. Blade(Wesley Snipes) is continuing his search for his long-dead friend Whistler(Kris Kristofferson), who has since become a vampire.  Blade eventually finds his quarry with the help of another chain-smoking human, Scud(Norman Reedus).  It isn't long before Scud and Whistler begin to go at one another for who is better at inventing vampire-killing weapons.   Soon after, Blade is later informed of a truce that is being called between him and the Vampire Nation.  The entire reason for the truce is that a rare mutation has occurred within the vampire strain.  It seems that a new breed of vampire called a 'reaper' has resulted from the mutant strain.  These 'reapers' are a kind of super-vampire.  They have an insatiable thirst for blood, needing to feed every few hours.  In turn they will feed on anything, even other vampires.  They have intense strength, are immune to silver and garlic, but are still vulnerable to sunlight.  They are led by Nomak(Luke Goss), the originator of the mutant strain.  The Vampire Nation needs Blade's help in eliminating the reapers before they wipe out everything on Earth.  To do this, the Vampire Nation allies Blade with the Bloodpack, a team of specially trained vampires who were originally training to kill him. The Bloodpack, which consists of Reinhardt(Ron Perlman), Chupa(Matt Schulze), Snowman(Donnie Yen), Lighthammer(Daz Crawford), Verlaine(Marit Velle Kile), and Priest(Tony Curran), are a very tough bunch.  The group is headed by the vampire leader's own daughter, Nyssa(Leonor Varela).  So together Blade, Scud, Whistler, and the Bloodpack set off to eliminate the reaper threat.  Make no mistake, this movie rules.  It is far superior to 'Blade' in almost every way.  The reapers are very cool looking.  You should also be on the lookout for one feature of the reapers that was not shown in the previews. 'Blade II' is actually scary too.  'Blade II' is also less dark in tone than the first film.  'Blade II' also has a bit of humor, which is provided mostly by Norman Reedus and Ron Perlman.  The acting here is great too. Wesley Snipes does a fantastic job in this movie.  I had previously never heard of Luke Goss until I saw this movie.  He is fantastic as the evil and twisted Nomak.  I almost hate to say it, but he's even better than Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost in the first film.As I said before, 'Blade II' is one exciting, scary and exhilarating action film.  I can already see that this movie is going to be a smash at the box office, so don't be surprised.",10,2,4,23 March 2002
Knocked Up," Pleasantly surprised, yet again, by Apatow and friends
","I think like most people who saw 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' back in 2005, I walked into 'Knocked Up' expecting a cheap sex comedy but was pleasantly surprised by something that was indeed funny with a lot of sexual humor and jokes but found something else as well: intelligence. 'Knocked Up' is a miracle, a rare comedy with intelligence, written with respect for the characters by writer/director Judd Apatow (who was also behind the camera for 'Virgin' two years ago). Apatow takes the time to let these characters grow on you, and to let them do a little growing themselves. Ben Stone ('Virgin' alumni Seth Rogen) is a pot-smoking 20-something slacker who shares a hip bachelor pad with four other 20-something slackers who are hoping to begin raking in the dough with an Internet website that details your favorite actresses in their best movie nude scenes. Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a career-driven celebrity newswoman who gets a promotion and is next seen interviewing big stars such as Steve Carell, James Franco, and Jessica Simpson with chatty 'Entertainment Tonight'-style patter. To celebrate, she goes with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) to a club where Ben and his buddies happen to be getting their grooves on. One thing leads to another and in a drunken romp back at her pad, the two hit it off in the sack. Eight weeks later, after Allison has put the somewhat boorish Ben behind her, she is shocked to discover she's pregnant - with Ben's child. Needless to say, neither takes the news lightly. Well, Ben and Allison decide they're going to try to make it work, for the baby's sake. 'Knocked Up' is an intelligent comedy; I know I already said that but I'm going to say it again. What I found most appealing about this movie is that the two leads are real people, treated with dignity and respect by Apatow's writing, who in their own separate ways are really forced to grow up, fast, within a nine-month time-frame. And that's what this comedy is about - growing up. Before Allison came into his life, Ben was likely to remain an aimless slacker living with his best buds, smoking weed, boozing, and living off an insurance settlement from a few years earlier. Now with a baby on the way, he now knows that he has to take some responsibility and be a man. It's a transformation that is difficult for him but guaranteed that because 'Knocked Up' is a Hollywood romantic comedy, he, Allison, and their new bundle of joy will turn out okay. The only problem I have (which I think is more personal than anything else) is that I would have liked to see a little bit of Ben and Allison in their new life together with their baby, married, and in a brand-new house.10/10",10,0,3,25 September 2007
Alien," A brief re-evaluation
","Just yesterday, I re-watched Ridley Scott's classic 1979 science-fiction epic 'Alien.'  I haven't watched 'Alien' in about two years and in that time, I've felt that the movie now seems dated and has lost its impact. Really, not so as I found out yesterday.  I watched the director's cut that was part of the 9-disc quadrilogy set and I have to say that this movie really got to me this time, which has never before happened when I've watched this.  I have always liked James Cameron's 'Aliens' as my favorite movie in the series (and it still is) but I feel I have to rethink a number of thoughts I have towards the original.First, Ridley Scott is an amazing filmmaker and his work in this film has only been matched by David Fincher's direction in 'Alien 3.'  What I mean by that comment is that Fincher matched it in atmosphere, not like James Cameron or Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director of 'Alien: Resurrection'), both of whose visions were more action-oriented, much rather than suspense.  Just three years after making 'Alien,' Scott would go to direct Harrison Ford in 'Blade Runner.'Second, the production design.  Everything just looks so dark and eerily beautiful.  The space scenes are almost hypnotic; we've gotten so used to seeing space in the movies that it rarely surprises us anymore.  With the production here, the space scenes are really stand out and show us that we really aren't alone in the universe.  The scenes on the alien planet are truly scary too.Third, the acting especially by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.  She looks so young in this movie (she was only about 24 when this was made).  I liked her character a lot in this movie in that we see shades of her future role in 'Aliens.'  The rest of the cast is pretty sufficient too, especially from Veronica Cartwright as Lambert.  We see in later scenes the fear in her character.  I somehow got the feeling that she was really on the verge of a nervous breakdown.Fourth, the movie itself.  'Alien' is a downright scary and effective science-fiction film.  It's a landmark film and has spawned an incredible afterlife in not only comic books and three highly successful sequels, but also a rival series ('Predator').'Alien' - 10/10",10,1,3,15 December 2003
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Bloody magnificent!
","Director Tim Burton's latest, 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,' an adaptation of the hit 1979 Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim, ranks as yet another imaginative working from the man behind the camera of 'Beetlejuice' (1988), the first two 'Batman' movies, 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), and 'Sleepy Hollow' (1999). 'Sweeney Todd' has many marvelous sights and sounds, and a production design that's Burton's best and most imaginative since 'Batman' (1989). In Britain in the 19th century, the story concerns Benjamin Parker a.k.a. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp, perfectly pale-faced), a barber who was once convicted on trumped-up charges and sent to prison and tortured for 15 years by the hard-nosed Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and has now returned to avenge himself. He later involves his lowly neighbor, the baker Mrs. Lovett (Mrs. Tim Burton Helena Bonham Carter, equally pale-faced), in his bloody scheme to exact vengeance. Of course, she is no angel herself, since she is something of a loon. And later on the in the story, is in fact revealed to be something of a cannibal, serving the cooked corpses of Britain's lowliest to unsuspecting customers as a way of disposing of Todd's victims. A young boy named Toby (Ed Sanders) also takes up residence with Todd and Mrs. Lovett, and becomes an unwitting accomplice in their bloody scheme. It's safe to say that even with the plentiful musical numbers and weirdo acting styles, 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' doesn't mess around. Blood flows copiously in over half a dozen graphic throat-cuttings that are surely going to put a drain on Hollywood's blood-pellet supply. Although I'm not really that big a fan of his work, leading this sure-fire cast of course is Johnny Depp, a brilliantly skilled performer who does indeed project his voice nicely and thoroughly for the audience, even though his performance does contain shades of ye old Cpt. Jack Sparrow. We've never quite seen Depp like this, as a would-be Psycho-type slasher whose thirst for revenge extends far beyond his target, and into the brutal aristocratic society that keeps working-class people like him and Mrs. Lovett in almost constant poverty. This is Burton's second most marvelous-looking film to date. His production design invokes a strong sense of the time and brings back memories of his earlier 'Batman' movies. I could say that 'Sweeney Todd' is better-looking than those films, but I'd be lying to myself; I'd never be able to top my love of Burton's 'Batman.' But then, 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' wouldn't be so bloody magnificent, now would it?10/10",10,2,8,22 December 2007
The Polar Express," 'The Polar Express' is a fun, magical ride into your childhood imagination
","It was December 24th, 1994; I was 9 years-old. I lay awake anxiously in bed, as the waking hours of Christmas Day slowly approached. My parents were sound asleep two doors down from my bedroom. A bunch of fans we had were still on (the slow setting), but in the otherwise calm darkness, I could pretty much hear everything downstairs.Now I'm still not quite sure of it, because maybe I was dreaming or my imagination was in overdrive, but I thought I heard the fireplace door in our living room open and close, and the shuffling around of a large, heavy sack. Was that what I think it was? Could be, or could it have been my over-active imagination at its most deceitful?That's kind of the dilemma that some children face around that age, when the question of whether or not there really is a Santa Claus is open for question. I'm sure lots of children have laid anxiously awake at night in bed for some sort of sign that the jolly fat guy with a beard and a bunch of flying reindeer and presents is flying around in a sleigh out there somewhere. Some may even leave milk and cookies on Christmas Eve and be surprised to find them all gone the next morning. Santa, were you here?'The Polar Express' stretches beyond the limits of the imagination and goes out of its dear way to prove to children that seeing is always believing. Robert Zemeckis, who directed the film, which is an adaptation of the award-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, believes in the story the same way that young children do: the ideas presented match their own beliefs that there really is life at the North Pole and that Santa is always keeping a watchful eye on kids all across the globe.Even though I'm 19 now, this film reawakened my long-dormant curiosity in the subject, and I'm sure that any adult that views this movie with an open mind might feel the same. But again, the notion that there is a Santa Claus and life at the North Pole is just a childhood fantasy; I know this, and most other adults do too, but there's nothing stopping them from rekindling their youth.Still, however, this film almost brought tears to my eyes on a few occasions because it was a brilliant realization of something that I thought had been lost to me forever. This film does bring back the magic of Christmas, especially during the dark times of the 2004 world we live in today. We'd need something like this to escape into, to realize our dreams and long-forgotten fantasies about a time when innocence still ruled the world.Van Allsburg's 'The Polar Express' is one of the best known books in children's literature, and one of the most daring in exploring a child's fantasy. In the late-night hours of Christmas Eve, Hero Boy (we never actually learn his name in the movie) lies awake in his bed, anxiously waiting for a sign - Santa Claus.And then his father says, who thinks that Hero Boy is sound asleep, 'Only an express could wake him up.' Sure enough, what at first feels like an earthquake only proves to be a massive locomotive called the 'Polar Express,' which roars down the snowbound street where Hero Boy lives.Not believing his eyes, he ventures out into the cold night to see what's what. The Conductor (played and voiced by Tom Hanks, in just one of six roles throughout the film, including Hero Boy), ushers him on board, where he's introduced to the other children, including Hero Girl, Know-It-All, and Lonely Boy, who is the last child they pick up on their journey.From there on, it's a rough, fast-paced journey to the North Pole, a place that Hero Boy once thought only existed in his youthful imagination. Upon arrival, the quartet of children embark on a wondrous path of excitement, fun, and belief as they explore their innermost feelings about a beloved character in their dreams.Christmas is the most beloved holiday of the year, especially for children, who wait excitedly for the morning hours to see what a year of patience has brought them underneath their heavily decorated trees; I know I used to, and still do.Whether you're 90, or 9, Christmas has a magic that never goes away because that little kid in you will always be there, eagerly waiting for that sign - that special little detail that's overlooked by others but is caught in your ever-watchful attention - that maybe, the big fat guy you've always dreamed of, is out there delivering gifts to children all over the world.10/10",10,6,9,29 December 2004
Malcolm X," Don't Listen To Yevgeny Bazarov
","For he/she is nothing but a hate monger himself/herself and doesn't realize that Malcolm X is probably one of the most misunderstood, but influential black leaders in history.  Throughout the course of the movie, we see Malcolm go through a transformation from street hustler, to convict, to positive black leader.  Malcolm X was only violent and hateful towards white people until he made his pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam. When he got there he never saw so many people of many different races worshiping Allah.  It was then that he decided to change his views of race. After that, it was then that he realized the mistakes that he had made and decided to break off his relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the rest of the Muslims, who in fact were the real hate mongers and that's why they later killed him, because he didn't feed on hate anymore.Another thing about director Spike Lee.  Spike Lee is in fact, probably one of the most under-appreciated African-American directors in Hollywood.  His movies have many underlying messages about race in America.  It's a shame that his movies are so under-appreciated.  Sure his movies are 'critically acclaimed', but that doesn't mean that people are actually getting the messages he is trying to send.  The same goes for John Singleton and The Hughes Brothers.",10,10,22,15 October 2001
Underworld Awakening," It was okay, I guess...
","2012's 'Underworld: Awakening' is probably the most underwhelming entry in the decade-old-and-counting horror/fantasy 'Underworld' franchise. The first 'Underworld' (2003) had an interesting premise that played on long-established werewolf and vampire mythology, and 'Underworld: Evolution' (2006) was a worthy continuation of the first film's story. The prequel 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' (2009) has so far been unseen by me, and tonight I finally got the chance to see the fourth film in the series, 'Underworld: Awakening.'When I say that this film is underwhelming, I mean that it really doesn't offer anything new, except for really big action sequences and questionable special effects - which says a lot for a movie that cost an estimated $70 million to make (and that should probably make it the best movie in the series thus far). And Kate Beckinsale, as vampire 'death dealer' Selene, is fantastic to look at in black leather and kicking a** all over the screen.The film's plot is really all over the place, and posits that baseline humanity has since learned of the existence of rival vampire and werewolf clans, and has enacted campaigns to exterminate both species. Selene is caught in the middle of all this, and she is captured and cryogenically frozen for 12 years. She soon escapes to go and find her vampire/werewolf-hybrid lover Michael (Scott Speedman, in archive footage). But Selene isn't alone: she has a human cop named Sebastian (Michael Ealy) and a fellow vampire named David (Theo James) helping her out, and the mysterious child Eve (India Eisley) who also holds a secret that may have the future of both the vampire and werewolf clans at her disposal.'Underworld: Awakening' is very clearly the low point in the series, as directed by Marlind & Stein, who pump up the action and gory violence but also leave out the plot and characterization - which is really what made the first two movies in the series so great.Best to just watch this one once to see what it's about, and then leave it at that.6/10",6,1,1,26 November 2016
Taxi Driver," Robert De Niro is one messed up 'Taxi Driver'
","There are so few films as intense and cinematically powerful, and relevant, as Martin Scorcese's 1976 hit 'Taxi Driver.' The film is powerful, provocative, intense, disturbing, and violent. At the center of it, is a powerful, landmark performance by Robert De Niro as a mentally disturbed ex-Vietnam vet-turned-nighttime New York City taxicab driver named Travis Bickle.In a city of well over four million people (and counting), De Niro's Travis Bickle character is so lonely, so unable to relate to other human beings, and so isolated from the rest of society that he might as well as not even exist. He takes to driving around a cab a night in an attempt to deal with an intense bout of insomnia. He also seeks a cure for his loneliness by attempting to date the pretty Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for an aspiring presidential candidate who's running on a platform of radical social change. But his plan goes sour when he takes her to a porno theater and she refuses to speak to him afterward.This tiny mishap pushes Bickle over the edge.He's taken a radical dislike to what he sees as the 'scum of the earth': the crime, the violence, drug distribution, decadence, sleaze, perversion, prostitution and general amorality that is causing the city to decay from the inside-out, both morally and spiritually. And it doesn't take long for him to begin to act on his violent impulses, since he now has an outlet for his rage. He embarks on an intense physical fitness regimen and eventually purchases a series of illegal firearms to aid him in his mission of ridding New York City of society's undesirables. That's why he's currently gunning for Sport (Harvey Keitel), the slick-talking pimp of teenage runaway-turned-prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), which ultimately culminates in a bloodbath ending that truly has to be seen to believed.'Taxi Driver' was widely acclaimed upon its release in 1976, especially after claiming the prized Palme d'Or at Cannes. But it was also heavily criticized for its controversial subject matter that included its ruminations on the violent thoughts of its mentally disturbed lead character and gore-laden climax. It is also not enough that Paul Schrader's screenplay was reportedly inspired by the private diaries of Arthur Bremer, the gunman behind the attempted assassination of George Wallace in 1972. It is also not enough that the screenplay is semi-autobiographical in more ways than one - not just because of its relation to a real-life would-be assassin, but also because the anger, rage, frustration, and isolation behind the life of screenwriter Paul Schrader also feeds into the film's pervasive anger, grittiness, paranoia, and oft-violent mind-set.'Taxi Driver' may have reached the peak of its controversy - more like, infamy - when John Hinckley, Jr., a noted obsessive of the film, attempted to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981, in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he had an obsessive romantic infatuation with. Talk about life imitating art, since in the film, Bickle makes an attempt on the life of the politician Betsy is working for (like Hinckley would try to do for Jodie Foster in just five years' time). Whether or not Bickle did this to get her attention in the film, is not totally clear.'Taxi Driver' is my favorite picture by Martin Scorsese, who also appears in a not-so-self-serving-and-actually-pretty-effective cameo in the middle of the film as a man on the trail of his adulterous wife, whom he plans to kill when he gets the chance. After this film, I would consider Scorsese's next great pictures (in order) to be 'The Last Temptation of Christ' (1988) and 'Goodfellas' (1990). I would put 'Raging Bull' (1980) in there somewhere but I haven't seen it yet.10/10",10,0,1,11 July 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A well done 'Soldier'
","I guess I should admit up front that I'm not a fan of Captain America, or patriotic superheroes in general. Which is why I have been extremely hesitant about approaching Marvel's 'Captain America' film series. I've just never been a fan of the character, that's all.So, I approach Captain America the same way I approached DC Comics' Superman, in which while I never read the original comics that inspired the character, I entertain myself with the big-budget cinematic depictions, and go from there - like reading the comics if I chose to.I haven't seen 2011's 'Captain America: The First Avenger,' but I was eager - however - to see its 2014 sequel, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.' Part of the problem I was even more hesitant to see these movies was the casting of Chris Evans. I remember Chris Evans from the two 'Fantastic Four' movies where he played Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and as one of the few people to like that two-film series, I thought he was perfect there. I have a personal rule about Hollywood actors playing more than one superhero (I'm looking at you, Ben Affleck) - since the superhero bandwagon is one ride it seems that everybody wants to hop onto. But, Evans's golden-boy good looks and straight-forward attitude make him an ideal pick for the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America.The first 'Captain America' was set during World War II. The sequel, 'The Winter Soldier,' is set in the present (2014), and features Steve Rogers trying to embrace his role in the modern world - since the patriotic ideals and values about freedom and democracy that he fought for 70 years earlier have given way to a shadier, morally gray outlook for the future of humanity. In other words, he doesn't feel he's fighting for the same good reasons now, that he was during World War II.Part of the problem stems from his immediate superior, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who stresses that things have changed drastically since Cap's WWII heyday. As the film begins, Rogers and his chief associate Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) uncover a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. that refers to the ghosts of the World War II era - namely the rogue Nazi science division HYDRA, which apparently did not die out with the surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allies in May 1945. So Captain America and The Black Widow are forced to go on the run as enemies of the government, and the pair are forced to confront the 'Winter Soldier,' a Russian heavyweight who has a frightening connection to Rogers's past.Also along the for the ride is newcomer Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), an Iraq War veteran with a secret of his own - he possesses an experimental flight harness that reveals him to be the superhero The Falcon, who in comics history was the first black-American superhero and who was also one of Captain America's closest allies in the comics. I partially wanted to see 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to see the Anthony Mackie debut as The Falcon.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a big, loud superhero-fest. The co-directing team of the Russo Brothers - Anthony and Joe - is one of the more interesting brotherly cinematic pairings in recent memory; the script - by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely - is also quite inspired (it draws heavily from a critically acclaimed comic book story arc called 'The Winter Soldier' by Ed Brubaker, which I haven't read). The Russo Brothers and Markus & McFeely do pay particular attention to the fact that Steve Rogers is now a man out of his time, fighting for reasons that are vastly different from what he originally became Captain America for. Another thing the movie also does well is how it pays attention to how much the world has changed since the beginning of the 21st century, or more particularly, after 9/11, and how some people believe that some freedoms must be sacrificed in order to ensure security (and how some will surely exploit the loss of those freedoms for their own purposes). The movie also plays up some of the more recent conspiracy theories that have cropped up as a result of this - and having film legend Robert Redford (as Alexander Pierce, Nick Fury's close friend and colleague), who appeared in a number of conspiracy films back in the 1970s (which resulted from Vietnam and Watergate), is just the icing on the cake here.In some ways, this is one of the more 'mature' superhero films produced since the beginning of the 21st century (I would argue that honor goes to 'Spider-Man 2,' which came out all the way back in 2004, but I know for a fact that I'm surely outnumbered on this assertion). But as can be expected, some of the attempts at slowing things down to get a grasp on the characters and story and some of the underlying conflicts between the beliefs and ideals of the past (and how they relate to the present day) get drowned out by the special effects and explosions. That's not a fault of the Russo Brothers, really, but just the fact that Hollywood has come to expect so little from some of those in the audience that DO want more, and not less.8/10",8,1,2,1 June 2015
Full Metal Jacket," First half hilarious, second half, some serious war
","I first saw Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket about a year ago.  When I sat down and watched the drill instructor torment his 'maggots'. I just sat there and died laughing because it was so funny. The end of the first half left me stunned due to the unexpected tragedy in the end.  Now second half. The second half of Full Metal Jacket is some serious war.  When they finally go out into the field it does get kind of gruesome once the fighting starts. To sum it up, Full Metal Jacket is hilarious and serious.  Stanley Kubrick has directed himself a war masterpiece.  Not to be missed.",10,1,2,9 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A mixed bag, but overall, a fitting end to the 'Skywalker Saga'...
","To my tired eyes, I think 'Star Wars' is showing its age (for a film series that began all the way back in 1977), even though 'Star Wars' is essentially timeless and aside from superficial trappings (like the quality of the special effects, which still hold up in the face of today's overblown CGI), there is nothing that truly dates these films. But it does seem that all the best and most original and compelling storytelling for the 'Star Wars' series went out with the original trilogy from 1977-1983. That's why the long-awaited sequel series seems like kind of a rehash, and a fan-boy tribute, to the grand legacy of films past. J.J. Abrams's 2019 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' is not immune to this dreaded weakness that has hounded the sequel series since it began in 2015 with 'The Force Awakens.' But the first hour or so, I was quite involved in the story here, despite a few hiccups and missed opportunities to make the story even more deeper and make it stand out from the past two entries, which to my tired eyes, were somewhat lackluster and didn't reach the high expectations that accompanied their releases. But overall, I felt that the film ended on a fitting note, right where it began. 'The Rise of Skywalker,' was the one film in the sequel trilogy that I was most impressed with, and that's why I felt it brought the series to a decent closure.8/10",8,3,23,24 January 2020
Pacific Rim," The Kaiju shall rise again!
","For 'kaiju-eiga' (Japanese monster movie) fan-boys, 'Pacific Rim' has been one of the most eagerly anticipated summer blockbusters for several years now, and for good reason. Due to the passing of legendary special effects artist Ray Harryhausen earlier this year (the film is dedicated to his memory and that of famous Japanese movie director Ishiro Honda - who passed away 20 years ago in 1993), the failure of 'Godzilla' in 1998, and the reasonable successes of the American found footage/monster flick 'Cloverfield' in 2008 and South Korea's 'The Host' in 2006, the monster-on-the-rampage genre has seen some increased relevancy, and legitimacy, in the last decade.As someone who grew up with, and idolized, Godzilla and other famed Japanese movie monsters - Ishiro Honda's 'Gojira' (1954), Godzilla's dark, gloomy black & white debut, remains the greatest monster movie ever - 'Pacific Rim' was the first movie I've seen in the movie theater this year, and it was a choice that was well-worth my hard-earned $7.50. I also belong to a Godzilla fan-boy group on Facebook. Upon the release of 'Pacific Rim' on July 12, 2013, the page ignited with impassioned fan-boy discussions of what could easily be considered the greatest giant monster movie so far this millennium (if ever, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here - 'Gojira' is still the best this genre has to offer). I'm inclined to agree.I greatly admired J.J. Abrams's take on the monster movie genre with 'Cloverfield,' and I thought that 'The Host' was a welcome surprise from one of the last places to pop up on the world cinema market. Now with 'Pacific Rim,' famed Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's big-budget take on the genre (as well as serving as a delightful homage to his childhood fan-boy obsessions in comic books, Godzilla, Japanese Anime', pop culture, and fantasy) has arrived.Equal parts 'Avatar' (2009), 'District 9' (2009), 1998 'Godzilla,' Iron Man, 'Top Gun' (1986), 'Transformers,' and del Toro's own fervent imagination (together with co-screenwriter Travis Beacham), and featuring an epic score by Ramin Djawadi (which comes close to rivaling the best of the famous Japanese film composer Akira Ifukube), 'Pacific Rim' begins sometime in the near-future, when mankind is at war with giant, other-worldly sea monsters called 'Kaiju' (the Japanese word for 'monster') bent on our destruction. To combat them, we have the Jaegers (the German word for 'hunter'), 250-foot-tall heavily armed, heavily armored giant robots that are piloted by two people who mind meld to form a single unified consciousness - the better to operate them and fight the Kaiju, we're told.The film's strongest visual appeal comes from the giant monster-robot battles that dominate the film's loudest moments (and pretty much the entire second half of the picture). In today's times, special effects no longer serve to simply enhance movie scenery - as they did in time's past - but essentially to create them. There are some movies in recent years where special effects - namely CGI - are used to create an entire movie and actors seem almost like an after-thought. In recalling the movie, I found it to be a relief that there seems to be a more intricate balance between the battle sequences and the scenes with the flesh & blood human characters.And we get some truly likable, flesh & blood human characters in the form of a jaded former ace Jaeger pilot named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who is called back into the line of duty to once again combat the Kaiju threat; also on-board is his former chief, the hard-nosed Stacker Pentecoast (Idris Elba), who lends the movie sex appeal and scenery-chewing military command presence; and lastly, there's the beautiful, ambitious Jaeger pilot-trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi).Backing them up, is their loyal, wise-cracking systems administrator Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.), and a pair of goofy, bumbling Jaeger research scientists - Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - who make several fundamental discoveries about the Kaiju that may just turn the tide of the war in favor of humanity. And, it'll be impossible to miss him, but del Toro's regular go-to guy Ron Perlman (best known from del Toro's earlier 'Hellboy' superhero movies and 'Blade II') also shows up as a leather-skinned, back-alley Hong Kong black marketer named Hannibal Chau.As a director and screenwriter, del Toro has always given his films rich character and thematic depth, and philosophical complexity (and not to mention a fine sense of humor, which many big-budget blockbusters these days often tend to lack); 'Pacific Rim' does not rank up there with his most famous picture to date, 'Pan's Labyrinth' (2006), but it's actually much closer to his aforementioned 'Hellboy' films and 'Blade II' (2002). It's a blockbuster movie, but one that is not without some degree of humanistic depth and merit. The film's core theme revolves around the benefits of working together - 'two heads are better than one,' as they say - and this is taken to a somewhat literal degree here, in which empathy (the ability to understand another person's feelings) is seen as a bona-fide superpower in and of itself that is capable of allowing just two people to power towering robots to effectively battle an unspeakable threat to humanity.It is this purely humanistic touch that takes the spectacle away from the many dazzling special effects-driven action sequences that 'Pacific Rim' has to offer and instead places it on the human characters at the center of it all. This is something that is purely at the center of much of Guillermo del Toro's best work.10/10",10,25,41,22 July 2013
Empire of the Sun," 'Empire of the Sun'
","Before he was chopping up prostitutes on Wall Street, Christian Bale was the boy standing on top of an air-traffic control tower, cheering as American bombers laid waste to the airstrip of the Japanese POW camp he was currently a resident of. As a pampered British boy named Jim 'Jamie' Graham who is separated from his parents following the fall of Shanghai before American involvement in World War II, Bale is simply astounding. A young performer at 12, he is forced to grow up fast as a prisoner of the ruling Japanese forces, making friends wherever he can, including American Basie (John Malkovich), his pal Frank (Joe Pantoliano), and even the young Kamikaze pilot who lives in the barracks on the other side of the fence. 'Empire of the Sun,' an adaptation of the novel by J.G. Ballard, is often cited as one of director Steven Spielberg's weakest films, but I beg to differ. It is well known that he has a special place in his heart for WWII, and it's something he loves and loathes. It's a coming-of-age tale that really understands the grueling nature of the reality it depicts, and despite its 'PG' rating, is still something for a mature audience. We're with Jamie the entire way, who is only 12, remember, yet he has already seen enough to last a lifetime. The only major gripe with this picture is its running time, and some scenes do tend to drag on for far too long, but that's only a minor grievance in a tale that is truly epic.10/10",10,8,18,31 January 2007
Glory," Glorious
","I'll make this short and to the point:'Glory' is the most beautiful war movie ever made, carried from beginning to end by a faultless cast and rousing sequences that really gives more depth and meaning to a comment made by a Union soldier close to the film's end, 'Give 'em hell, 54th!' The 54th Regiment is one of history's most underrated and under-appreciated moments, and 1989's 'Glory' follows its beginnings with a largely volunteer army of Freedmen and former slaves (who faced certain death from the Confederacy if they were ever caught), to its intense scrutiny by the supporting white brigades, and up until its final 'glorious' moment when they were ushered into history when the 54th laid siege to Fort Wagner. Not many films have made me cry before, but the 54th, when they officially become a part of history, allowed me to ball my eyes out. Knowing that my brothers in the 'glorious' 54th gave their lives really makes me appreciate the sacrifices they made and the significance of those sacrifices.Glorious is 'Glory,' and the 54th gave 'em hell, all right - 10/10",10,4,7,18 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A 9 of 10 on the account it's better than 'The Phantom Menace'
","'Attack of the Clones', which is the second film in the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy, is about ten times better than 'The Phantom Menace'.  The hype surrounding 'The Phantom Menace' was phenomenal.  When 'The Phantom Menace' was first released, it disappointed a lot of people for reasons that are really to numerous mention.'Attack of the Clones' is a lot better than 'The Phantom Menace' for several reasons.  First off, it is simply more impressive than 'The Phantom Menace'. 'The Phantom Menace' seemed to rely a lot on action and special effects, rather than characters and story.  'Attack of the Clones' has a lot more focus on story and characters, which is good.  The romance between Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker is right on target.  Luckily, the romance between these two does not get in the way of the films story, which if not handled correctly, would have almost certainly happened.  The story is impressive as well.  We get a lot of background information surrounding events that would occur in the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.  One example, which I believe to be the most important, is that we learn Anakin Skywalker's motives for becoming Darth Vader.  Another would be is that we learn about the rise of the Empire and the formation of the Stormtroopers. Probably the coolest, not the most important, is that we learn some background information about feared bounty hunter, Boba Fett.As I said before, 'Attack of the Clones' may prove to be the best film in the prequel trilogy.  It gives us a lot of information on upcoming events in the original trilogy.",9,1,3,25 May 2002
Corpse Bride," Tim Burton's lovely 'Corpse Bride'
","Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' bills itself as a supernatural romantic comedy (much in the same avenue as his own 1993 effort 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'), but upon closer inspection is revealed to be something much more touching. Co-directed by Burton himself and Mike Johnson, it's a tale of lost love and what is truly meant to be, and, as usual, Burton takes a macabre spin on the material, in this case it's the phrase 'It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.'The Corpse Bride of the title does have a name, and it's Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). Yes, she is dead, dead as a doorknob. She's a walking, talking, rotting corpse, with bones falling from her body, her wedding gown is torn and faded, and a friendly maggot has taken up residence in her right eye socket and from time to time offers her advice much in the same vein as a conscience.As the film opens in some unspecified time in what is presumably a Victorian-age England, Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is about to be wed to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) in an arranged marriage. The two of course have never met, and both have the wedding-day jitters. Victor comes from a rich family, and his parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) are supportive their son is getting married. Victoria and her parents (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), however, come from a poor background. For the two to get married, Victor would have family and Victoria would find her way into money. The two are happy to be getting married, but is it meant to be?However, Victor is such a nervous wreck he can't even remember his vows at the rehearsal ceremony. The priest gets fed up with his ineptitude to even recite a simple marriage vow and sends him out to memorize them. He wanders into the forest, practices and finally gets them right, even going so far as to use a tree limb as a woman's ring finger. But when he does slide the ring onto what he thinks is a branch sticking up from the ground, what emerges from underneath the dirt is the Corpse Bride.It turns out that in the Land of the Dead (which is populated by those that look like they didn't make the cut to appear in Halloweentown), and because he was able to successfully recite his vows and place the ring on the bride's finger, Victor's marriage to Emily is legitimate. So Victor and Emily are in an unlikely but legal binding. The idea of the story is not to make Emily an object of horror, but of sympathy: she was murdered the night before her own wedding, so by being with Victor, she is given a second chance for wedded bliss that she could not obtain while alive.If you know Burton, you know he specializes in freaks, and their acceptance more or less into normal society. Very often, said freaks are the heroes while 'normal' individuals are evil. If you've seen 'Batman' (1989), 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990) and 'Ed Wood' (1994), you'd know this. Here, in 'Corpse Bride,' it's no different as romance and tragedy become the centerpieces of Burton's tale.The previews may mislead people into thinking 'Corpse Bride' is a comedy, which is a stretch considering there are a few laughs but most are spare and have a macabre tone to them. The focal point is the theme of lost love, which is what should stick with viewers. The music and songs, by frequent Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, sometimes also help to drive home these points and even partially expresses Victor's newfound predicament: How can he be married to two different women at the same time? Mistakes happen, misunderstandings arise and hearts are broken in 'Corpse Bride,' but that's love, isn't it?In a time when CGI rules everything around us, it's good to see a film take advantage of the old cinematic stop-motion techniques. I've seen enough computer-enhanced blockbusters this year to last a lifetime, and 'Corspe Bride' comes as a lively, refreshing change from what is quickly becoming the norm. Tim Burton's imagination was obviously on overdrive here but in the right spot, and 'Corpse Bride' may very well be his most touching film yet.8/10",8,4,8,26 September 2005
Romeo + Juliet," Beautiful
","I just want to start by saying that I am a boy and I AM NOT A LEONARDO DICAPRIO FAN!Now on with the review.I'm 15.  For my ninth grade english class, I am currently studying William Shakespeare's tragic play Romeo + Juliet in both modern and old english versions.  Now I first heard about Romeo + Juliet back in fourth grade when I was 10 years old.I didn't know what it was about at the time, so I asked my cousin (who was in ninth grade, but graduated in 1999) what it was about.  She told me it was about two teenagers from two feuding families who meet and fall in love. They soon enough get married, but all that ends tragically when they commit suicide.  As a result of their deaths, the two feuding families agree to peace.Now I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater, so I patiently waited until it debuted on Cinemax a few months after it was released.  Let me just say it was amazing!  I had never seen a more beautiful film.Baz Luhrmann's updated version of the play is absolutely stunning.  What really surprised me about it was that it was set in present day Verona Beach, California.  They drove around in cars, instead of riding on horses and instead of fighting with swords, they fight with guns.  All of this was good.  One thing surprised me though, it contained it's original dialogue. Now many films that are updates of the play, don't contain the original dialogue.  10/10",10,14,23,19 December 2000
Forrest Gump," Simplicity at its best
","'Forrest Gump,' 1994's controversial and acclaimed Best Picture Oscar winner and is itself adapted from the novel by Winston Groom, is the simple story of a simple man and the not-so-simple world he is born into. Tom Hanks is the title character, a Southerner with an IQ of 75, who as a boy is handicapped by a crooked back and forced to wear leg braces. Raised by his mother (Sally Field) to not let the world hold him back, she does the regrettable and sleeps with a school's principal to get him enrolled. His first days are hard-luck, but that changes when he lays eyes on the beautiful Jenny, and the two become close friends, even through high school, when she is now played by Robin Wright Penn. Once graduating high school, Forrest is encouraged to go to college, where he becomes a football star and is drafted into the United States Army upon graduation. Forrest's limited intelligence to the situation renders him blind to the Vietnam conflict, where his service is guaranteed. He's unaware of the growing resentment towards the war, but his heroic actions to save comrades including hardened veteran Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) and best friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) during an ambush by the VC one day encourage a Medal of Honor award. Thus, the world as we know it is seen through the eyes of this simple man who leads an extraordinary journey through some of America's roughest periods: the 1960s through the late '70s. All of this is fickle to him, as his one true love Jenny continues to evade him (even though they see one another sporadically over the years, and their encounters are often very brief) and her life becomes increasing less than pleasant. 'Forrest Gump' is one of the best movies for a reason: when all hell was breaking loose during radical times of change, one man saw it as a little more than nothing. His unwitting triumphs over the years - football star, war hero, Medal of Honor recipient, White House honorary guest, millionaire businessman, international Ping Pong champion, and ultimately, father - are extraordinary to everybody else except him, simply because he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, everything about 'Forrest Gump' is classic and beautiful. From Hanks's brilliant and nuanced performance, to the Oscar-winning special effects (the insertion of Hanks into archival media footage; the digital erasure of Sinise's legs to make the audience believe he's a real amputee) to the closing credits, it shines and will forever remain shining as a modern American classic piece of cinema. Though Forrest himself may not know it, he's found one of the greatest fans in this writer. He's a true inspiration that nothing is impossible regardless of one's intelligence. His message is that nothing can hold you back except you. It's a dream come true from anyone's perspective.10/10",10,1,4,2 June 2006
Ant-Man," 'Mission: Impossible' + 'Ocean's Eleven' + the MCU = 'Ant-Man' (2015)
","2015's 'Ant-Man' is a superhero movie with a complicated production history that also manages to be an odd mix of superhero action, heist movies, and high-tech spy-thrillers.Edgar 'Shaun of the Dead' Wright and Joe 'Attack the Block' Cornish had labored for several years on trying to bring Marvel Comics' size-changing superhero/genius scientist Ant-Man (co-created by Stan Lee, his younger brother Larry Lieber, and the legendary Jack Kirby) to the big screen. They eventually parted ways with Marvel, and Peyton Reed ended directing the final version of the film, with Adam McKay writing the screenplay (that was taken over from Wright and Cornish) that was released theatrically in 2015.'Ant-Man' is the 12th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and while it's connected to the MCU, it still feels separated from it in some way (sort of like how 2016's 'Deadpool' is). And even if 'Ant-Man' still feels like an MCU superhero movie, it doesn't exactly follow the typical superhero movie formula that's become so familiar over the years.Perhaps the biggest change from type is the fact that this movie has a much heavier emphasis on the use of humor (though the film itself is not necessarily parody - but it certainly doesn't take itself very seriously), and the fact that its hero, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, who also worked on McKay's script), is a criminal who's desperately trying to go straight after doing three years in San Quentin for burglary.Yes, in the original comics, Lang (who was created by David Michelinie, who wrote my favorite Iron Man story 'Iron Man: Demon in a Bottle,' and John Byrne), who became the second Ant-Man, was a burglar who pulled off a heist to save his sick daughter and in the process crossed paths with Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym, the first Ant-Man - who then passed off the mantle to Lang.In the big-budget film adaptation, the aging Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas) has already had his time in the spotlight as the first Ant-Man, who possessed technology that allowed him to change his size and communicate with insects (i.e., ants), and passes the mantle onto Scott Lang after Lang is released from prison. Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), need Lang's help to pull off yet another daring heist. But this heist is not some simple criminal scheme to get rich off of stolen goods, but is to save the world. (And there is even an appearance from MCU regular Sam Wilson/The Falcon - played by Anthony Mackie - in the middle of the film.)It turns out that Pym's former protégé Darren Scott (Corey Stoll) is close to replicating Pym's technology, but has militarized it and plans to sell it on the black market in the hopes of making billions off of it. So Lang becomes the second Ant-Man in order to stop Scott, who eventually becomes the super-villain Yellowjacket and who possesses many of the same powers that Lang does.'Ant-Man' is a movie that I was initially very wary of seeing, based largely on what I was reading in the news about its production history (usually not a good sign, especially when you consider the fact that Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish were once involved), and the fact that it wasn't really focusing on the original Ant-Man. To their credit, Paul Rudd was a suitable lead as Scott Lang. I liked how they portrayed Lang as a criminal trying to go straight, but keeps getting lured back into old habits. I also just liked how the naturally comedic Rudd doesn't take the role all that seriously, which makes him stand out from other notable superhero characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; just watch him in this year's 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) for details.To my surprise, 'Ant-Man' is a surprisingly entertaining superhero entry into the MCU about a zero who becomes an unlikely hero, saves the world, and manages to get the girl in the end.8/10",8,0,0,17 June 2016
Predator," Arnold VS. The Predator
","Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of commandoes go off into the South American jungle to rescue some hostages.  His team includes Dillon(Carl Weathers), Mac(Bill Duke), Blaine(Jesse Ventura), Billy(Sonny Landham), Poncho(Richard Chavez) and Hawkins(Shane Black).  They go in and encounter their enemies but soon discover something more terrifying: the Predator.This is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger films to come out during the 1980's.  The action is tight and director John McTiernan's direction is slick.  The Oscar nominated special effects are cool.  One should take into consideration about the violence in this movie.  The violence hear is quite gory, yet hardly of the supergraphic kind.  The skinless bodies of two men are found hanging from a tree, a man's arm is blown off, another man has a hole the size of a basketball blown into his chest, and another man's brains are blown out.  Last, but not least, a lot of praise should go to the towering, late Kevin Peter Hall for his excellent portrayal of the Predator; the silent, invisible hunter from another planet.  He literally has all kinds of weapons up his sleave which include a shoulder blaster, a blade, and a powerful self-destruct weapon.  Kevin Peter Hall returned to do the highly underrated sequel Predator 2 with Danny Glover and Gary Busey.  10/10",10,2,2,10 November 2001
Léon: The Professional," An action lover's action movie
","'Leon,' or 'The Professional' as it is known as here in America, is very easily one of the best human dramas ever made. It tells a story of two desperate souls and their search for meaning in their separate hopeless existences. It's also one hell of an intense action movie. Its star, a hit-man known as Leon (Jean Reno), lives in a world that is entirely of his own making, a world that is devoid of life, of meaning, and most importantly, love. Strange that by film's end, these are the very things he discovers in his fleeting final moments with the person who gave him these emotions, a 12 year-old girl named Mathilda (Natalie Portman), whose parents were murdered by a corrupt DEA agent named Stansfield (Gary Oldman). The acting here is brilliant, especially from Portman, who's a little too convincing, and Oldman is a little more unhinged here than usual. 'The Professional' is skillfully directed by Luc Besson, who's also making his American debut here. This is a true action lover's action movie, so sit back, relax, and enjoy.10/10",10,1,3,8 March 2005
American Pie," There is a lot more purpose to this movie than some people think
","'American Pie' doesn't sound like much because of its simple premise: four guys(Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) enter into a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  Now it's only natural that this movie would be immediately dismissed as another dumb sex comedy, but I believe that 'American Pie' is much more than that.  Now I'm no expert, but I believe that there is a lot of hidden subtext here.  One of the scenes that I want to focus on, is the scene where Jim(Biggs) and Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth) are in his bedroom.  Now since Jim had walked in Nadia, she probably felt embarrassed and wanted to see the opposite effect on him.  When it's finally time to get down to 'business', Jim by this time is so nervous that he n**s his boxers.  Nadia is then about ready to leave. Jim desperate and realizing that this may be the only chance he has with Nadia, starts to bring out the porn.  Nadia forgives him and they start to go at it again but then Jim blows his second chance.  I believe that this is probably the most important scene in this whole movie.  I say this because I think it was meant to show how nervous some people may get about first-time sex.  Now just because Jim had blown his big chance with Nadia, does not mean that she will think any lesser of him.  I mean after all, it was their first time doing anything together.  Now another part, which is the case of Sherman(Chris Owen) a.k.a. 'The Sherminator'.  Sherman is so sure of himself, that many people including our four heroes, think that he can score with any girl he meets.  This is wrong and this ultimately leads to his timely humiliation at the prom.  Strangely enough, his whole 'Sherminator' act is only able to successfully attract the attention of one lucky lady(try to guess who).  Third is the case with Stifler(Seann William Scott).  Now I'm sure we've all known of at least one Stifler in our lives.  My definition of someone who is a 'Stifler', is a person who only lives to party, have sex, and makes fun of those who can't; Stifler-'see you guys in the 'NO F*****G' section'.  What girls see in him or how he's even able to get girls is beyond me.  Fourth is the rapidly evolving dating relationship with Kevin(Nicholas) and his girlfriend, Vicky(Tara Reid).  We know that these two have been going out for quite some time.  Kevin is quite anxious to move to another base.  As he says, 'enough of this b-job bulls**t'. Vicky, feeling unappreciated that she probably can't please her boyfriend enough, dumps him.  Kevin then has to resort to 'Kama Sutra: The Book of Love'.  He begins reading the stuff in the book is eventually able to win back Vicky.  Fifth, how many of you have ever tried to change the way you act just to win a girl's heart?  I'm sure some of you have and Oz(Klein) is doing just that.  After the fiasco with Oz's first date, he begins to see things in a different light.  'You can't try to win a girl over by repeating cheese-ball lines' says his date.  Oz then takes this into account and after entering into the pact, he spots a young choir girl(Mena Suvari).  So Oz signs up for chorus just to win her heart.  At first he's just doing to get to her but then true love comes into play he finds himself vying for her affections.  He is eventually able to win her over but not by his physique or duty to the pact, but by his determination to find true love.  Sixth, is the minor situation with Jim and Michelle, the band geek(played by Alyson Hannigan).  Michelle- 'this one time at band camp...' you know the rest. This relationship here is probably one of the higher aspects of 'American Pie' because it goes to show you that you can't just put a label on anybody no matter how weird they appear to be.  Sure Jim ends up regretting his decision to sleep with her, but in the end, he'll really thank her for it and he will be glad he did.  Lastly, dear old Finch(Thomas).  Isn't it strange the things that we do out of desperation?   Now are you beginning to see what I've been getting at?  This movie is showing us how our sex lives have or may turn out to be like.  Not all of our encounters will turn out to be total disasters and we won't end up doing it with baked goods(hopefully).  Some of us may turn out to be a 'Sherman' or a 'Stifler' or maybe some us won't turn out to be anything at all.  Some of us may have to change our personalities completely to just to win a girl's affections.  Some of us may end up having to resort to extreme measures to get what we want.",10,0,2,17 February 2002
Watchmen," Watching 'Watchmen'...
","I felt that a near-impossible feat had been achieved: that director Zack 'Dawn of the Dead remake/'300'' Snyder had been behind the camera of an adaptation of the 'Watchmen' graphic novel series co-created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, and ran for 12 issues between 1986 and 1987. That Snyder was even able to bring the comic book series to the big screen was an achievement in and of itself, since many have felt that a 'Watchmen' movie would be, for lack of a better word, impossible; I'm inclined to agree. So read on.As a comic book reader, and 'Watchmen' fan, 'Watchmen' has the distinction of being the only comic book to appear on 'Time Magazine's' 100 Best Novels List, and likewise, it's been hailed by comic book fans as a milestone in comic book fanfare, while philosophers, writers, and essayists have taken it upon themselves to dissect this epic tome of graphic literature for their pleasure, education, and amusement - all for our sake. The series is world-renowned for its incredibly and crudely realistic (and sometimes satirical) portrayal of superheroes in the real world - many of the main characters were sexually and emotionally frustrated/confused, while others were psychotic and socio-pathic - how they perceived themselves and each other, how they were perceived by the world at large, and the futility of vigilantism in an out-of-control world, as well as building up a chilling expose of Cold War-era fears and paranoia in a world that lay on the brink of nuclear war.Does all this translate well into Snyder's film? Yes. But there-in potentially lies the film's greatest flaw: that's all it is, a translation, nothing more. It brings nothing new to the table in terms of characters or story, or the series' deeply engrossing subtext. Don't get me wrong. I liked 'Watchmen'; on one hand, the movie is a visual splendor filled with terrific special effects and portrayals of the main characters that are faithful to the series. The dialogue, for the most part, is well-written and equally well-delivered by the actors. And the length (162 min.) didn't bother me the way that it should have. It kept me interested throughout (like the comic book), unlike the problem I had sitting through 'The Dark Knight' (2008), which was only about 10 minutes shorter than this film.On the other hand, as I stated earlier, the movie brings nothing new to the table as a means of trying to draw in new viewers (e.g., people who don't read comic books). It seems as if Snyder and company looked at Moore and Gibbons's graphic novel, put it under a magnifying glass, and just directly translated what was on the page to the screen (specific frames from the comic were replicated almost exactly in the film - right down to the littlest, finest detail - you'll know which ones they are when you see them). Moore has been against the idea of a 'Watchmen' film from the get-go (I've been largely skeptical myself since first hearing about an adaptation), and his name didn't appear in the opening credits, just as I had somewhat expected.Set in an 'alternate' 1985 in New York City in which Richard Nixon is about to be elected to a third term, the story gets underway when disgraced former superhero Edward Blake/The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is thrown out of his apartment window and makes a big red stain on the sidewalk below. Investigating his murder, is the socio-pathic masked vigilante - and my personal favorite Watchman - Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (the perfectly cast Jackie Earle Haley). As the mystery deepens, he begins to suspect a conspiracy to off 'masks' (superheroes), which leads him into something even more terrifying, something in which the fate of the world is at stake, and he takes his findings to megalomaniac and former colleague and fellow superhero Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), now the most respected scientific mind on the planet.Calling upon old allies such as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) and Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Carla Gugino) is out of the question because they're currently involved in their own troublesome issues at the moment, a love triangle, to be specific. Sally begins an affair with Dreiberg because her current lover, the almost god-like Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), is unable to satisfy her either emotionally or sexually. So Rorschach is forced to go it alone most of the time, until circumstances force both Dreiberg and Sally to dawn their costumes one more time to save the world from certain doom.'Watchmen' is an astounding visual feast; it's a live-action comic book. This is probably the best-looking new feature I've seen this year (in fact, it's the first movie I've seen in the theater this year, period). The special effects, as you would expect, are top-notch, and the makeup and costumes for the actors are first-rate (Rorschach's mask!!!). The problem is with the script. David Hayter ('X2') co-wrote this vehicle, which takes a few nods in the direction of the thematic complexities of the graphic novel by playing up some of the satire and establishing the main characters and their back-stories rather faithfully. In doing so, a number of the smaller sub-plots (the earlier Minutemen and 'Tales of the Black Freighter' were engrossing favorites) have been excised, presumably for timing, but the movie's already 2 1/2 hours long; how could a little bit more story hurt? In the larger scheme of things, this might seem like needless nit-picking, so that's all I'll say about that.'Watchmen' is not a failure in any real sense, but I did expect something more from a comic book film as eagerly anticipated as this one. Rorschach was awesome beyond words, but I wish the filmmakers had been watching these Watchmen just a little closer, but not so much that they wouldn't have the real room they needed to grow off the page and into our imaginations.9/10",9,1,3,7 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," From the beginning...
","...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the 'goriest movie ever made' (1992's 'Dead Alive'), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of 'The Lord of the Rings' saga, which include 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001), 'The Two Towers' (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner 'The Return of the King' (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since 'Star Wars' has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing 'The Lord of the Rings' films. 'The Lord of the Rings' is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the 'PG-13' rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get 'into' Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and 'The Enemy,' who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live ('live' is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a 'fellowship of the ring.' There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called 'The Lord of the Rings' the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10",10,15,18,3 August 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," 'Revolutions'  It goes on and on and then ends, at least with a bang.
","'My admiration for 'The Matrix Revolutions' is limited only by the awkward fact that I don't much give a damn what happens to any of the characters. If I cared more about Neo, Morpheus, Niobe and the others, there'd be more fire in my heart. But my regard is more for the technical triumph of the movie, less for the emotions it evokes. Neo is no more intended to have deep psychological realism than Indiana Jones, but the thing is, I liked Indy and hoped he got out in one piece -- while my concern about Neo has been jerked around by so many layers of whether he's real or not, and whether he's really doing what he seems to be doing, that finally I measure my concern for him not in affection but more like the score in a video game.'OK, so again I use the words of critic Roger Ebert to help express the feelings I have towards the groundbreaking 'The Matrix' (1999) and its two lackluster sequels 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'The Matrix Revolutions' (both films released in 2003).The first 'Matrix' was (obviously) the best film in the series, with its wild and kinetic action scenes, and gravity-defying special effects. This film ushered in a new era of action film that would quickly wear out its welcome just two years (and about 20 imitators) later.It came to us amidst a very welcoming public, dazzling us and puzzling us with that catch phrase  'No one can be told what the matrix is  you have to see it for yourself'; I myself was put into complete awe by its magnificence and brilliant storytelling. Then came 'Reloaded' in May of last year and its sequel later in November. 'Reloaded' came to us amidst hostilely mixed reviews from both fans and critics and the same situation occurred with the release of 'Revolutions.'Add to that my feelings are the same. 'Reloaded' was mediocre at best and the main criticism I had with that film was that it was simply too much, and tried too hard to be deep and meaningful but failed miserably at winning my interest and convincing me of what its supposed goal was.It was full of semi-meaningful and pseudo-philosophical dialogue about free will and choice; it just didn't matter. It was a lot like just get to the action scenes already, and believe me, I never pray for action scenes but 'Reloaded' just wore me out with its boredom. I rated that film a '6' and believe me, I haven't changed my mind yet on that rating.Now we're at the third film  'Revolutions.' Though 'Revolutions' is, as a whole, a much, much better film than 'Reloaded,' I got the feeling that it was only making up for the problems that plagued its predecessor, and I'm positive that was what it did. That kind of killed the experience knowing that is what was most likely the intention behind this film; but at least it kept you watching through the special effects and breathtaking action scenes that were reminiscent of the sequences in the first 'Matrix' film.Indeed 'Revolutions' was much more tolerable to watch, and it did go out with a bang as was expected by the 'holy' crowds that view these films as some sort of new religious experience.Another scene would be the attack on Zion, which, forgive me, reminded me a little too much of the battle sequence from Michael Bay's 'Pearl Harbor' (2001) because of the style and the way it was presented to the audience. Believe me, when I saw this scene for the first time, it reminded me so much of seeing Zeroes dropping bombs on Battleship Row, and then sitting there and watching the Sentinels in this film slay humans mercilessly in their never-ending assault on Zion. The trilogy certainly ended the way I predicted that it would (I will not disclose the details) but it ends up being worth it (much more satisfying than the abrupt conclusion of the previous film), especially for the all-too symbolic, apocalyptic 'Burly Brawl' action sequence between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) at the end of the film. The scene itself is a masterstroke of genius and technological mechanics, and you're immediately put in awe by the effort and skill that went into engineering it. If the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry) ever did something right with the sequels, it would easily be this one scene.Anyways, to conclude, 'The Matrix Revolutions' ended the series on a good note and I enjoyed it a lot.I give it a solid '7.'",7,9,17,7 June 2004
28 Weeks Later," Rage strikes back
","OK, so yeah, do you want to talk about a scary-a** fright flick? As an American, I'm beginning to pay more attention to British horror. We've seen it plenty of times within the last seven years. Anything fresh off the boat from our closest European allies, people here eat it up. We saw it with 'The Descent' (2005), 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004), '28 Days Later...' (2002), and its sequel '28 Weeks Later' (2007).British director Danny Boyle (of 1996's 'Trainspotting') and screenwriter Alex Garland were behind '28 Days Later...' where radical animal-rights activists broke into a laboratory and freed monkeys that were infected with the experimental 'rage virus.' If you remember from that film, you remember that the rage virus only takes 30 seconds to infect (critic Roger Ebert noted that a virus that only takes seconds to infect will not make an efficient survivor in the long run because the host population will soon be dead - as will too, the virus, at least according to Darwinian evolution) and once infected, the 'infected' person becomes a wild, salivating homicidal maniac. The virus completely decimated the British Isles, leaving them to be shut down, quarantined, and we were left to ponder the fates of that film's only survivors.'28 Weeks Later' only leaves that up to our imaginations...Anyway, 28 Weeks Later after the initial infection, the initial infected have begun to slowly die of starvation. American NATO forces move in to remove the deceased infected, eliminate any surviving infected, look for human survivors, and begin reconstruction. In the film's opening moments we're introduced to a handful survivors who are eventually wiped out, leaving only one to escape the carnage, Don (Boyle's 'Trainspotting' alumni Robert Carlyle).Don makes it to a military checkpoint, where he is reunited with his two children Andy (Macintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) and they attempt to start over along with a thousand others in the 'Green Zone' (sound familiar? Plenty of other terms abound, such as 'Code Red,' 'Extreme prejudice,' among others), a U.S. military-controlled section of London with scanning cameras and rooftop snipers. Well, as you know, the calm before the storm passes and the rage virus strikes back with a wicked vengeance, and mass chaos begins once again.I was surprised to find '28 Weeks Later' working from the very first opening scene. The film opens with a bloody bang, with the maddening infected banging down doors, chewing on flesh, and massacring any living thing they come into contact with. '28 Weeks Later' builds on the militaristic paranoia of modern times to present us with a chaotic scenario that is all too familiar. Down comes society in one fell swoop and everything they worked so hard to achieve is gone. Also, purists will note that the infected ARE NOT zombies. The infected are technically still alive and can be killed as such; they're just... infected, clawing, gouging out eyes, and vomiting bloody innards all over the place.'28 Weeks Later' does something even more incredible. While one can easily find fault with '28 Weeks Later' repeating some of the same plot devices of the first film, it quickly becomes a moot point. In the tradition of some movie sequels, this one surpasses its predecessor in many ways, the least of which is sheer terror and chaos. Make no mistake: this is one intense experience that you're not likely to forget anytime soon. And even as events in '28 Weeks Later' prove, surviving the madness is not a sure thing any more than most of us are promised tomorrow.There's a fine cast of brave performers here, the best of which is Robert Carlyle, who doesn't run through the motions of the typical action-horror hero. There are also some fine American performers as well (while American talents were a no-show in the first film). There's Doyle (Jeremy Renner), an American sniper who is forced to abandon his post once the s**t hits the fan, his buddy Flynn (Harold Perrineau) who's a helicopter pilot and then there's also Scarlet (Rose Byrne), a military scientist who makes a startling discovery about the rage virus.The man behind this production is the Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who obviously watched the first film carefully and saw all the areas needing improvement. He skillfully crafts his picture so that everything goes downhill (in a good way) from the start. His hand-held camera really gets into the terror and gives it a slight documentary feel, thus putting the audience right in the middle of the action. It also gets up close & personal into the furious, crimson-dyed eyes of the infected from time to time. The special effects Fresnadillo chose to employ here are as gruesome as they could possibly get, with many disturbing images, violence, and gore that are surely miles ahead of '28 Days Later...' There is one moment where fighters fire-bomb a mass section of the Green Zone after the infected have taken over that is particularly affecting. On a lighter note, the best of these special effects sequences has to be when a helicopter goes blades-first into a wall of oncoming infected and... I don't want to spoil the effect.In summation, '28 Weeks Later' is one horror flick that takes a look at our modern times and ups the fear and paranoia to almost unbearable levels. Anyone who watches the film will surely be startled by the comparisons but as this film's ending also proves, 28 Days Later... you might as well be prepared.10/10",10,3,7,14 May 2007
The Thing," Great horror remake with one minor flaw
","I remember when I first saw John Carpenter's The Thing back in 1994.  It was scary because it was the first time I saw it and i was only 8 years old. Now I'm 15 and I sat down and watched it and promised myself that I'd sit through it.  When I finally watched it, I realized it wasn't so scary, except for the dog kennel scene.  I give The Thing a 4 out of 5 because you have to give Carpenter credit for the grotesque special effects. Everything in The Thing is perfect. SPOILER ALERT My only major complaint about it is Death of Nauls scene.  When MacReady, Nauls and Garry are setting the charges, Garry's headlight dies and Blair comes out of nowhere and kills Garry.  When Nauls realizes Garry is missing, he doesn't bother to alert MacReady that Garry is missing.  Then Nauls is attacked by the thing.  This is the one aspect of the film that I am disappointed with.  Other than this flaw, The Thing is a great horror film with a great cast.",10,1,3,9 October 2000
Lilo & Stitch," I love, love this movie!
","'Lilo & Stitch' is now 10 years old. It's hard to believe this movie came out in 2002. I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still love it even now. 'Lilo & Stitch' is a cute little picture, but not so cute, really, that it treads sappy over-sentimentality territory. Quite simply, you won't find a simpler better animated feature from Disney in the early 21st century.The story begins when the mad scientist Dr. Jumba (voice of David Ogden Stiers) goes on trial for illegally creating a dangerous extraterrestrial life-form, 'Experiment 626' (voice of co-director Chris Sanders, who shares directing duties with Dean DeBlois). Jumba receives life imprisonment, while 'Experiment 626' is to be exiled to another planet. As would be expected, the crafty, cunning little blue-skinned bugger that is 'Experiment 626' masterminds an escape mid-flight, and manages to high-tail it in a space cruiser to Earth, where his ship crash-lands in the woods on the island of Hawaii.The obnoxious and highly destructive little extraterrestrial is mistaken for a mutated dog and is later adopted by Lilo (voice of Daveigh Chase), a lonely, misunderstood young Hawaiian girl, who later renames 'Experiment 626' as 'Stitch.' Lilo's living with her older sister Nani (voice of Tia Carrere), who is struggling to make ends meet to support them both in the aftermath of their parents' deaths in a devastating car accident. Pretty soon a little family is born - however marginalized - despite the interference of an imposing social worker, Cobra Bubbles (voice of Ving Rhames); and Jumba and alien-government bureaucrat Pleakly (voice of Kevin McDonald), who have been dispatched to Earth to retrieve Stitch at all costs.I have to say 'Lilo & Stitch' somehow feels different from other animated Disney features. Obviously, it's still very much aimed at a general family audience (kids), but it also feels very mature; I don't like being preached to by movies - especially kids movies - but 'Lilo & Stitch' makes the case for family (however bizarre they may sometimes seem, especially when you throw alien fugitives in the mix) and not leaving one behind. We also get a little bit of culture-shock as well, since a great deal of time & effort is spent showcasing Hawaiian native cultures and tradition.The movie itself is great to look at it, with its excellent use of water-based paintings mixed with minimal CGI. Lastly, Stitch is just so cute! I'm a guy, but Stitch is just crazy! Even though Dr. Jumba designed Stitch with only one purpose in life - to destroy anything and everything he comes into contact with - he soon realizes the truth about his own loneliness and isolation and how to come to terms with finding his own place in the universe.This is a fantastic and original Disney animation. I loved it, and you'll love it, too!10/10",10,0,1,18 August 2012
Armageddon," 'Armageddon' rocks!
","Love him or loathe him, you have to give director Michael Bay the thumbs up for the enormous craft and ingenuity that goes into his films. It may be that his films are overblown yet are entertaining, have horrendous yet amusing dialogue, and have wooden yet colorful characters. But you seriously have to ask yourself, what great action movie does not have those qualities? OK, OK, some may not, but we're not talking about other action pictures, we're talking about the films of Michael Bay. Those who say that his films are crap seriously bother me because I have found it extremely difficult to believe that they were not at all entertained when they have paid good money to see his latest action flick.He obviously likes to blow stuff up (see 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' to see what I mean), but you have to give him the praise that he richly deserves  for that he has an eye for detail, in fact such an eye for detail, that he may just be the best modern action filmmaker alive today. He lavishes in detail and great camera shots of one single frame around a character or object. To make this story short, his films make for captivating, if not necessary viewing for any true action fan. His films are never boring; he keeps dialogue to a minimum and he just keep you entertained for the running time.Bay was an accomplished music video director before scoring his first hit in 1995 with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in the buddy-cop action film 'Bad Boys,' and would later re-team with them both for 'Bad Boys 2' last year. However it wouldn't be until the following year that people really knew who Michael Bay was when he directed the Alcatraz thriller 'The Rock' with Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris as the leads.Now we're at 'Armageddon,' which was released amidst hostile reviews and received quite a tongue lashing from critics in the summer of 1998. Its story about an asteroid (dubbed a 'global killer' by NASA) and the team of civilian oil drillers who are recruited to land on it and drop a nuke down a hole in its surface took a backseat to some really inventive special effects.Even if you don't buy the story or its characters, you could at least lavish in the special effects and the production. The antagonist of the film, a jagged, almost hellish goliath of a rock that's hurling towards planet Earth at millions of miles per hour, takes a terrifying life of its own once we see its surface. This is where our director Michael Bay comes in. He wants to show us his vision of Hell, which is his vision of this asteroid that's intent on wiping out everything on the planet; this also gives the 'Armageddon' tagline a little deeper meaning: 'It's closer than you think.' 'Nothing would survive, not even bacteria,' so says Billy Bob Thornton after briefing Bruce Willis and company at NASA in one of the films early scenes.As Jeanine Basinger, a professor of film studies at Wesleyan University, comments in her review of the film on the Criterion Collection DVD (Bay is a former student of hers), 'Yes, it [Armageddon] gives audiences a lot to absorb. Yes, it cuts quickly from place to place, person to person, event to event. But it is never boring, and never less than a brilliant mixture of what movies are supposed to do: tell a good story, depict characters through active events, invoke an emotional response, and entertain simply and directly, without pretense.'If you are a die-hard action fan (I'm not, though my movie collection would probably suggest otherwise), don't pass up Michael Bay, because in the end, he's just giving the audience what it wants.10/10",10,1,3,19 June 2004
The Village," A most complex and troublesome film
","'The Village,' M. Night Shyamalan's latest twisting thriller, is full of ideas and creepy moments, but is hurt by much subtle complexity and very troubling storytelling.  Since he hit it big in 1999 with 'The Sixth Sense,' he has become one of Hollywood's last truly innovative filmmakers, and therein lies the problem (I think).We've come to expect so much from him lately, that we may flock to his latest flick and then comes a big letdown after a most wonderful buildup. But that doesn't automatically make 'The Village' any less thoughtful; at least he tries.  Most other directors wouldn't have lasted past the first hour.Shyamalan has been on a wild streak since 'The Sixth Sense,' and most people would agree (though I don't) that 'Unbreakable' was a letdown and the masses are pretty much divided on 'Signs.'  Die-hards will unanimously agree that 'The Village' is a monumental letdown and should never have seen the light of day.Superstition is the latest topic up for discussion with 'The Village.' Shyamalan seems to have an interest in exploiting certain aspects of our culture and using them to full effect.  In 'The Sixth Sense,' it was childhood fears and ghost stories.  In 'Unbreakable,' we learned about superheroes and that they may be ordinary people like you or me.  In 'Signs,' we got a lesson about faith and an alien invasion.'The Village' plays with the popular superstitions of a Puritan-like community and uses those to set up a story about deadly creatures that live in the woods outside the town.  And one of its citizens is questioning those beliefs and is eager to see what truly lies outside the town's borders. Shyamalan plays with these beliefs, getting us to accept them like the people of this community and terrorize us at the same time.He has a way with endings and 'The Village' is no different from any of his previous three blockbusters.  To me, it did come as a big shock and was totally un-hinted on earlier in the film.  In 'The Village' however and unlike the previous three, Shyamalan has created an atmosphere that is deliberately misleading and that is something I didn't find in 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable,' or 'Signs.'All in all, 'The Village' is still a valiant, if somewhat lacking effort from one of our last and most innovative directors.",7,0,0,18 August 2004
He Got Game," 'He Got Game' - The Father, the Son, the Holy Game
","The Spike Lee joint 'He Got Game' is one of the director's most passionate films because it's about his own personal passion for the love of basketball, one of the richest and most mythic of sports. But to Lee, it's also the most holy and with that said, 'He Got Game' has no shortage of religious undertones, symbolism, and imagery.Now, as a sometime fan of the game and occasional player of the game (though I was never really any good, and former Chicago Bulls player Michael Jordan ranks as my greatest athlete), I can see why Lee feels the way he does about the game and his film. 'He Got Game' looks at the sport, the behind-the-scenes corruption and capitalism, greed, temptations, the relationship between father and son, and the Holy Game.But 'He Got Game' is mostly about the relationship between the father and the son. Denzel Washington (in one of his best performances, and the third time he has worked with Lee) is Jake Shuttlesworth, a convict doing time for the manslaughter of his wife. Looking for a chance at redemption, he gets it when the governor, an adamant basketball fan, hears that Jake's son is the number-one basketball prospect in the country. In a once-in-a-lifetime chance, the governor, using the warden (Ned Beatty) as his go-to guy, agrees to reduce Jake's sentence if he can get his son to attend the governor's alma mater, Big State University.In order to do this, Jake is given a one-week temporary release from prison, with two parole officers (Jim Brown and Joseph Lyle Taylor) watching his every move. The deal is easier said done. Jake's son, Jesus (Ray Allen, of the Milwaukee Bucks), has nothing but contempt for him and while his younger sister Mary (Zelda Harris) and cousin Booger (Hill Harper) have forgiven him for his sins, Jesus's heart is still filled with hatred and resentment for his father. It just becomes a question of whether or not the son will forgive the sins of the father, and whether or not the father and the son can come together as one.'He Got Game' is a powerful movie, rich in performances, imagery, and story. It is true that Lee has never made a 'bad' film in his 20+ years as a filmmaker. Every film he makes is a new experience and will always keep you watching. While suffering from an overly long running time, a few under-developed characters (like Milla Jovovich's Dakota) and occasionally uneven storytelling, 'He Got Game,' like all of Lee's work, keeps you watching.It's mostly the father/son angle of the story that kept me watching. Washington is one of the strongest actors working in the industry today (some of his best moments are flashbacks to Jesus's childhood and why Jake pushed him so hard to be the best ballplayer that he could be, and the reasons behind Jake's incarceration, which are revealed to be far more complicated than first thought); while it is true that Allen is no great actor (he is an athlete, after all), he is at his best during his scenes with Washington. On his own, it's a bit of mixed effort. Lee's composer has frequently been Terence Blanchard, but replacing him this time is the emotive, driving score by Aaron Copland, blaring up during many of the film's strongest moments. Rap group Public Enemy also composed many of the songs appearing on the soundtrack; it marked their triumphant return to the rap game after a few disappointing albums.While I don't consider myself much of a religious person (despite a Baptist Christian upbringing), there is a lot of religious allegory in 'He Got Game.' Like his biblical namesake, Jesus is seen as the savior, the second coming and the resurrection of the game, and there are a number of temptations, many of which are of the flesh, that he has to overcome - from the dangers of being a young black man on Coney Island (where so many other promising talents have become victims), to the cash hand-outs, promises of fame by bypassing college altogether and going straight to the NBA, and finally to the young women luring him to the big universities with questionable 'recruiting' practices, and there is also the sultry, Delilah-like girlfriend Lala (Rosario Dawson), who states point-blank that she's out to get hers too because once Jesus goes pro, she'll be forgotten. The only person capable of steering the son clear of these dangers is the guidance of the father, who's seeking his own redemption as well as the forgiveness and love of the son.'He Got Game' remains one of Spike Lee's most passionate and cinematically mature efforts, despite a few missteps along the way. The ending is a great step from the usual 'reality' of most traditional Hollywood endings, yet a further sign that Lee is maturing as a filmmaker. It's powerful, it's moving, and it has game. 'He Got Game' proves once and for all, that the man behind the camera also has game.9/10",9,1,2,22 February 2008
Pitch Black," Time for a switch
","'Pitch Black' is a visually-dazzling sci-fi thriller that pretends to be the same as most 'Alien' knockoffs, but is instead something else altogether. It dares to be excellent in the face of intense criticism - those who contend that the film owes a lot to its predecessors, which indeed it does - may eat their own words when they see what an excellent job was done with the story.Though 'Pitch Black' surprised many audiences in 2000, it was met with a lot of mixed praise; I didn't pay much attention to it and the hype surrounding the movie had soon faded from my attention. When the 'Pitch Black - Unrated Director's Cut' DVD was released just a few months ago as to rake in pennies from the inevitable hype for 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' my interest was renewed.'Chronicles' chronicled the downfall of summer movies (I wasn't going to see it anyway, but the free ticket that came with the 'Pitch Black' DVD burned a whole in my wallet; plus the movie was dumbed down to 'PG-13' from an original 'R' rating, meaning that more scenes of character development and graphic violence were removed to cater to teenage fanboys). The best thing to be said about 'Chronicles' really, was that the production design and visual effects were quite impressive.'Pitch Black' offers something more in the way of characters, that you actually care about them and when you rooted for that bad ass Riddick (Vin Diesel), those feelings were genuine. You actually got scared when all the lights went out and the small band of survivors led by Riddick and the unwilling captain of the downed spaceship (Radha Mitchell) had to make it to safety in total blackness because bloodthirsty, nocturnal creatures were on their tail the whole time.The director, David N. Twohy, created a beautiful, nightmarish place - this sun-scorched desert planet that's roasted for an undetermined amount of time by not one, not two, but three suns. Twohy was a master with 'Pitch Black,' especially since his only previous directorial effort was the alien invasion thriller 'The Arrival,' with Charlie Sheen, back in 1996.The characters in 'Pitch Black' aren't fodder for the monsters; they're people with real feelings and emotions. You feel sympathy for Radha Mitchell's character, who quickly finds herself stuck in a really nasty situation and is also the unwilling leader of these survivors. And though this should be her movie, it's really Vin Diesel's, who would go on four years later to make 'Chronicles,' which really has nothing to do with this film, as it is more influenced by the subculture (comics, cartoons, etc.) that has amassed around the character since 2000.'Pitch Black,' despite some of its minor flaws (some pacing problems, a little uneven storytelling), is still a remarkable film nonetheless and I'm sure it's destined for some kind of cult status.8/10",8,0,0,22 August 2004
American Psycho," Serial killers in business attire
","'American Psycho' is a difficult film to review because one, it's never clear whether or not the events in the film are real, or are just a figment of Patrick Bateman's (Christian Bale) warped imagination. It's deliberately never stated and is something that is best left up to the viewer to decide. The Bret Easton Ellis novel from which this film is based, caused a stir upon its 1991 publishing, which satirized yuppie culture, Reaganomics-gone-amok, and crass materialism during the 1980s.As it would turn out, Bateman, a successful Wall Street investment banker, finally decides to give into an insatiable blood-lust that begins with the cold-blooded murder of a homeless man, followed by a colleague (Jared Leto), and an assortment of call girls and prostitutes. Why Bateman does these horrific things without provocation, purpose or explanation, is all part of the film's bizarre appeal and is not just for shock value.Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich in 'Scream') rhetorically asked why did Hannibal Lecter eat people? Why did Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers slash up promiscuous teenagers in their respective film series? So why does Patrick Bateman butcher prostitutes in his apartment? Maybe because he's a pretty sick guy? Who knows. All this can be debated for hours on end in a criminal behavior class (for which I'm reviewing this as part of an assignment) about Bateman's motivations.Bateman does not fit the profile of any known serial murderer before him. He's educated, wealthy, respected by his co-workers, and has a well-preserved body to kill for (no pun intended). So why does he one night, out of the blue, decide to chop a guy's face in two with an ax? Nobody knows, but my theory is that he just does it for because he has an unquenchable blood-lust that he suddenly feels the impulse to give into. To the world at large, however, he retains his businessman persona. To his fiancée (Reese Witherspoon), he's an all right if not somewhat shallow guy to want to be engaged to. He's also very sensible: he's often the one to straighten out his colleagues when they make a**es of themselves in public by making racially insensitive remarks.'American Psycho' takes a shockingly funny and horrific look at Bateman's twisted reality, all without the safety of a net. Director Mary Harron looks at the Wall Street world of male bravado, closet homosexuality, materialism, and masculinity without a single flinch. (Is there anything more blatantly homo-erotic than comparing the print on business cards?) When we look at this world, we wonder: Did the '80s really look like this? Did an insane Wall Street investment banker go on a naked rampage, chasing a hooker out of his apartment with a chainsaw?Perhaps they did (I was too young to remember), but Ellis certainly remembered, and caught considerable flak from it. That Bateman is able to wonder why his murder spree goes unpunished, why he can't inflict his inner pain onto an uncaring world and why a detective named Kimball (Willem Dafoe) doesn't think to ask him harder questions about his nocturnal activities, all escape him, and us. 'American Psycho' is a confusing, funny, and oft-shocking expose of a world that is best forgotten in history, but will still be nonetheless fascinating to criminal justice and psychology majors until the end of time.10/10",10,0,1,29 March 2007
North by Northwest," An excellent, first-class thriller - thrilling, chilling, and funny; one of Hitchcock's best
","'North by Northwest' may very well be one of the most entertaining and highly enjoyable thrillers ever made by a major Hollywood studio. I mean that, really. Expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film fires an arsenal of thrills, chills, first-rate performances from a first-rate cast, spectacular action set-pieces, and humor. Even with the humor, you can forget how profoundly disturbing this movie can be at times, but it's all part of the fun of 'North by Northwest.'I'll be the first ever to admit that I'm no Hitchcock fanatic in even the slightest sense, but there is one reason to believe that he was one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived. The man knew his way around films in a way few filmmakers today will ever be; today's wannabe directors, take note. The way he composes his scenes, his actors, and the on-screen action with expert precision and style shows that he always knew what he was doing when he was behind the camera, and he rightfully earned the respect as a master filmmaker.The film toys with the idea of identity. 'North by Northwest' begins with a kidnapping, and a case of mistaken identity: a hapless Manhattan advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is taken hostage by hired goons and brought to the lavish estate of one Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Here, he is harshly interrogated by his captors, who believe that he is really a secret agent of the government named George Kaplan. Thornhill tries to prove his innocence to them to no avail, and is soon plunged into a series of harrowing events of escalating danger, adventure and magnitude, culminating in him dangling for his dear life from Mt. Rushmore with the would-be love of his life Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), the mysterious woman he met while on a train trying to elude his would-be captors.'North by Northwest' may very well be one of the greatest chase movies ever made. The movie itself is a slow-burn of escalating danger and suspense, as Our Hero Roger Thornhill finds himself thrust into events that he can neither understand or comprehend. And we identify with the confusion he has over the surreal turn-of-events that have taken over his life. Cary Grant infuses his character with enough confusion and witty one-liners (many of which are actually quite funny and earn some much-needed laughs to alleviate the suspense) that he earns our sympathy as an Everyman who is forced to take the reins of being a hero to fight for his life against an unspeakable evil.Of course, this film is also noteworthy for its groundbreaking and suspenseful action sequences, the most spectacular of which is the infamous 'crop-dusting' scene, which has to be seen to be truly believed. That scene alone is worth the price of the admission. Rather than waste time on special effects and explosions and things of that nature (today's filmmakers, again take note), Hitchcock instead relies on the tension and the slow build-up so that he lets us have it with a one-two punch to the gut. Hitchcock also makes expert use of wide open spaces during this scene, and the wide-angle lens of his camera, so that even even when an airplane is the only thing we see in a wide-angle shot of a corn field, there is still an ever-looming sense of danger that something else could jump out at us from anywhere on the screen.'North by Northwest' is an expertly directed thriller from the 'Master of Suspense' Alfred Hitchcock. Today's filmmakers should definitely take note of this film and look for the many reasons for why it is as good as it is. His next film after this was of course the granddaddy of today's slasher flicks (and my personal favorite Hitchcock movie ever), 1960's 'Psycho.'10/10",10,2,5,28 November 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," 'Rise of the Machines'. Minor spoilers.
","I didn't really know what to expect from 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'.  I hadn't hyped myself up for it, being that I loved 'T1' and liked 'T2'.  So I went to see it today and I was pretty blown away by it. Clearly James Cameron, who directed both 'T1' and 'T2', is not here to direct 'T3'.  Jonathan Mostow, who I have never heard of until this film, really knows how to direct a 'Terminator' film.      I should tell you all that there is definitely going to be a 'Terminator 4'. Do not let the films title 'Rise of the Machines' mislead you in any way, since by films end, the machines have risen and the war has started.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as always, as is Nick Stahl (filling in for Edward Furlong) as John Conner.  Claire Danes, who I have never really paid much attention to (other than 'Romeo & Juliet' in 1996), is also pretty convincing too.  Of course, the real light here is Kristanna Loken as the T-X, who is even better than Robert Patrick's T-1000. 
I give 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' a 9/10.",8,0,0,2 July 2003
The Shining," 'The Shining'
","OK, so I just got done reading the IMDb FAQ page on Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror-thriller 'The Shining,' and I still don't have a clue about what to really make of this film's events. I just see it as a brilliant example of a pure and terrifying descent into madness that is heavily influenced by malevolent supernatural forces.An adaptation, or should I say, re-imagining of the Stephen King novel from which it's based, 'The Shining,' to me, is a film that is very open to all sorts of interpretations, which also makes it hard to categorize as a straight-forward horror film even though it seems to throw in some haunted house theatrics as well. But make no mistake, this is one of the most eerie and unsettling horror films ever made.The film is set at the Overlook Hotel in Colorado, where Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their psychic young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) have arrived to serve as the winter caretakers until the Spring the next year. The Overlook's beauty hides a dark and horrific history that eventually comes to claim the sanity of Jack, and the troubled man comes to act upon the supernatural forces at work in the hotel that are driving him into complete madness.'The Shining' is an epic horror film, perhaps the first (according to some). Nicholson is loony from the start; he's not some well-meaning family man who succumbs to evil supernatural forces at work in a haunted hotel. It's a trademark performance from one of the most skilled actors to ever work in Hollywood. His acting, as usual, is over-the-top and menacing, but once he begins to act upon his own murderous impulses and begin terrorizing his family, it's all the more greater because of Nicholson's sense of timing. His trademark line - 'Here's Johnny!' - is one of the most famous and memorable in the horror genre, and cinema history, in general.Kubrick, a master craftsman who co-wrote the film with novelist Diane Johnson (after first rejecting a script from Stephen King himself), sets up the film brilliantly so that it all goes downhill from the get-go, especially with its eerie opening sequences and musical score. The Overlook is vast and labyrinthic, and we get a sense of just how vast and labyrinthic it is through the various - not to mention, ingenious and groundbreaking - unbroken steadi-cam tracking shots. I also find it hilarious, and an example of how in-control Kubrick was of the material, of the numerous takes he had his actors make during this film. This sort of technique can be overly demanding on actors and crew members, but I see it as a master filmmaker demanding nothing but perfection from his actors and crew members, and the hell he puts everyone through really pays off in the end. (James Cameron, my personal favorite director, has the exact same reputation.)Kubrick also has a real taste for horror imagery: he's able to make simple human figures - a beautiful nude woman in a bathtub, for instance - instantly become an object of pure, unbridled horror in one of the film's most infamous and unsettling sequences. It may seem gratuitous, even voyeuristic for some tastes, but the way Kubrick handles it is pure genius. There's also those famous shots of blood pouring out of an elevator, and lastly there are the two twin girls - who are supposed to be objects of innocence due to their age - that come to haunt the Torrances' young son Danny in some of the film's most frightening sequences.'The Shining' probably ranks third on my list of Kubrick films, behind 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) - often cited as his weakest for some reason - and 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971). 'The Shining' is an example of a film adaptation of a famous book that actually supersedes its source material and becomes something else entirely. King says he dislikes Kubrick's film, because it strips away many of the finer elements of his novel (King would later have greater say in the 1997 made-for-TV movie). But 'The Shining' is one of the damn finest, most well-made and scariest horror films I've ever seen, a perfect example of a master filmmaker at the top of his craft.10/10P.S.: This movie has also been parodied to death. It was parodied in one of the 'The Simpsons Treehouse of Horrors' episodes as 'The Shinning.'",10,0,0,14 June 2009
"I, Robot"," Rage against the machines in 'I, Robot'
","The Three Robot safe laws:1. A robot may not injure a human being2. A robot must obey orders given it3. A robot must protect its own existenceIn 'I, Robot,' the latest sci-fi film that's an adaptation of stories written by a revered author to receive the Hollywood treatment in order to capitalize on post-9/11-era paranoia, you'll find a few shreds of genius and not much of anything resembling the works of Isaac Asimov.Asimov devised the '3 Laws Safe' paradox that I listed way back in the year 1940, and it doesn't take much deciphering to realize that law #3 is in obvious conflict with the first two: it states that a robot must protect its own life, but only if it's not in conflict with the first two laws, which states that a robot could harm a human being if it has to.The '3 Laws Safe' and their likenesses have been prevalent in science fiction ever since Asimov began writing the robot stories that he's most famous for today. I'm not going to waste my time with a useless book vs. movie comparison, but I'm only going to review the movie, which has its own merits but Asimov fans will be understandably sore.In Chicago 2035, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has a deep resentment of robots, which have been seamlessly integrated into American society and now are able to take on common, everyday tasks such as cleaning the house or providing companionship to humans. When a prominent robotics engineer and inventor, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), dies under heavily suspicious circumstances, Spooner is sent to investigate.His investigation leads him to the scientist's most prized invention, an 'NS-5' model robot named 'Sonny' (voiced by Alan Tudyk), whom of which Spooner is convinced committed a brutal murder and covered it up to make it look like a suicide. He aligns himself with another robotics engineer, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), and the two soon discover that a sinister element lurks amongst robot society that yields something in the way of total annihilation of human beings.'I, Robot' was directed by Alex Proyas, the gifted filmmaker behind 'The Crow' (1994) and 'Dark City' (1998), the latter film which was centered on an individual who tried to make sense of the deceptive environment he was trapped in. Will Smith plays such paranoia to full effect and he ends up being accurate in his conspiracy charges.Can a robot commit a murder? That's the central question at the helm of this thriller, and the dead scientist (using hologram technology) clues Spooner in on the deceptiveness of the world around him. He even says that robots can naturally evolve and develop emotions and such; he calls it a 'ghost in the machine' and this terminology may strike fans of the Anime' 'Ghost in the Shell' as eerily familiar.Much can be said about the film's production values, which are superb, but I wonder if Proyas had a think-tank come up with this future Chicago, much like Steven Spielberg did when he made 'Minority Report' two years ago?'I, Robot' is an action movie first and foremost, which was quick to cash in at the box office this summer. Smith's humor borders almost unnecessary at certain points, but it could be because of 'I, Robot's' bleak and frightening premise. The robots themselves, once their plot is exposed, quickly become video game targets and are easily dispatched by the frightened humans who fight back in whatever ways that they can.Despite these elements, when there is no action and the story settles down a bit to play with paranoia, it's actually quite interesting to see the characters interact with one another, accuse one another of not understanding a fellow human being, and yet the robots (for the most part) are able to cooperate with each other and nearly doom mankind.7/10",7,0,1,15 December 2004
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Now this is THE 'Spider-Man' movie I've been waiting to see...
","REVIEWER'S BIAS: I have been a fan of Marvel Comics' Spider-Man character since I was probably in elementary school; Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero. I grew up watching the excellent 'Spider-Man' animated series from the early 1990s, and I absolutely adored the first big-budget live-action 'Spider-Man' series that was released from 2002 to 2007.Four years ago, I finally got around to reading the much-talked-about Miles Morales line of 'Spider-Man' comics and - admittedly - I've come to enjoy his comic book adventures a lot more than I do Peter Parker's. (For you comic book geeks out there, Miles Morales was co-created by 'Ultimate Marvel Universe' chief architect Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, and he first appeared in the August 2011 issue of 'Ultimate Fallout #4' - having assumed the mantle following the death of the original Spider-Man, Peter Parker, at the hands of the maniacal Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Miles Morales is also the first black Spider-Man, and the SECOND Spider-Man to be of Latino descent - after Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099; Miles is half-black/half-Puerto Rican.)For this reason, that is why I absolutely refuse to ever watch 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017), which I believe should have been about Miles Morales, not Peter Parker, and Miles Morales is the version of Spider-Man who deserves to be incorporated into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) - especially since TWO previous big-budget, live-action film series have been dedicated to Peter Parker.But you can imagine my elation when it was announced that Sony (and by extension, Marvel) was producing an ANIMATED 'Spider-Man' movie that would finally mark the long-awaited big-screen debut of Miles Morales, and we got that this year with the 2018 Bob Persichetti-/Peter Ramsey-/Rodney Rothman-directed 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.' And its screen-story by Phil Lord, and final screenplay by both Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman is all over the place (in a good way), and is also quite inspired.Now THIS is THE 'Spider-Man' movie I've been waiting to see, and I didn't even realize it. Now I love Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), which is my favorite superhero movie, my #2 favorite movie of all time and is, in my opinion, the best live-action cinematic treatment that the famed Marvel Comics 'Wall-crawler' is ever likely to see. Like 'Spider-Man 2,' 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' appears to be a labor of love for its team of filmmakers and legion of animators - as well as a celebration of everything people know and love about Spider-Man as a character; it contains many nods to the comics, TV shows, and films of past & present. The film, by Sony Pictures Animation, is pure eye candy; it's beautifully and breathtakingly rendered and realized amazingly well - essentially a colorful, animated kaleidoscope of an animated comic book superhero picture - and the characterizations are spot-on and brought to life by a lively voice cast that includes lesser-known performers and firmly established film veterans.In discussing the story, I've read the majority of Miles Morales's original comic book adventures, so I'm quite familiar with him as the new Spider-Man. I knew going in that some things were changed (how can they ever be just like the comics?), but most of these changes are minor and insignificant and don't detract from the picture, as a whole - though Miles's nerdy best friend from the comics, Ganke Lee, is noticeably absent. Miles Morales (wonderfully voiced by Shameik Moore) IS the central character here - the film's opening moments work well to establish him and his life; his family, his parents Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree Henry) and Rio Morales (Luna Lauren Velez), and shady uncle Aaron Davis/The Prowler (Mahershala Ali); and his first days as an aspiring art student at the expensive charter school Brooklyn Visions Academy - and the film largely centers around him and how he becomes the new Spider-Man. But he's not the only Spider-person in town...The vile gangster Wilson Fisk/The Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) has had his chief mad scientist Olivia Octavius/Dr. Octopus/'Doc Ock' (Kathryn Hahn) design a machine that will open up a gateway to alternate dimensions. After Miles Morales gains spider-like powers from a genetically-modified spider that was similar to the one that bit Peter Parker - and following the death of the original Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Chris Pine) at the hands of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin (Jorma Taccone) - he soon finds himself encountering other Spider-people from other dimensions, most famously an alternate, albeit aged and disheveled version of the original Spider-Man himself, Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), who shows Miles the ropes of how to be Spider-Man in his world. And additional help comes from Gwen Stacy/Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), the anthropomorphic 'funny animal' Peter Porker/Spider-Ham (comedian John Mulaney), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), and Peter Parker's beloved Aunt May Parker (Lily Tomlin).'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a blast, from beginning to end. I have not enjoyed a superhero movie this much in a very, very long time. While so many superhero movies (and TV shows) these days concern themselves with such uber-seriousness and pretentiousness or silly one-liner-laden dialogue every five minutes, I found 'Into the Spider-Verse' to be a much-welcomed change-of-pace from everything we've become so accustomed to. The movie is light and fun, but is not weighed down by the forced corniness and fake levity of most live-action MCU movies of late, or the humorlessness and cynicism of so many DC Comics vehicles. 'Into the Spider-Verse' is self-knowing and hip and witty, and wears its heart on its sleeve, but it hits all the right emotive notes and the high-flying humor of the picture arises naturally from the material and doesn't come off as forced (again, like so many big-budget MCU and DC properties in recent years).'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' was the 'Spider-Man' movie event I've been waiting for, and I didn't even know it. For anyone that's a true fan of Spider-Man, it's definitely worth the price of the admission. I know it was for me.10/10P.S.: The film also contains heartfelt tributes to both of Spider-Man's late creators, Stan Lee (who passed away just last month and whom I had the pleasure of meeting six years ago at a comic book convention in Baltimore) and Steve Ditko (who passed away in June).",10,2,4,29 December 2018
American Beauty," A dark comical masterpiece
","American Beauty (1999) Starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.  Running time: 121 minutes.  Rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence and drug content.Meet Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey).  He's 42 and he's having a mid-life crisis.  His marriage to his wife Carolyn(Annette Bening) is on the verge of falling apart and his daughter Jane(Thora Birch) hates him.  One night while at a basketball game, Lester spots Jane's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). Lester immediately falls in love.  He then decides that this will be his last chance at true happiness in his life.  So he quits his job and begins working out.  On a minor note, Jane falls in love with the boy who lives next door named Ricky Fitts(Wes Bentley) whose father, Colonel Frank Fitts(Chris Cooper) is a homophobe.This is indeed the best movie of 1999.  Kevin Spacey has never been better on film.  He really deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.  I'm surprised that he was able to top his Oscar-winning performance as Verbal Kint from 'The Usual Suspects' in 1995 because many actors are rarely able to top a performance.  Annette Bening was great also as the obsessive and frustrated Carolyn who later decides that enough is enough and goes to sleep with a rival realtor.  The supporting performances are great as well especially from Thora Birch who befriends Ricky.  She at first hates him because he's always filming her, as he says that he finds her interesting and later falls in love with him.  Wes Bentley should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance as the troubled and misunderstood Ricky.  
I really liked this movie a lot.  I missed it when it was released into theaters.  I didn't get a chance to see it until it came on HBO last year.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'T2' review
","In director James Cameron's first 'Terminator' film, the story held that in the post-apocalyptic future of Los Angeles 2029 after a rogue super-computer called Skynet became self-aware and initiated a worldwide nuclear strike and waged a subsequent genocidal war on mankind, humans are on the verge of being wiped out by the machines that have taken over the world. However, a revolutionary leader named John Connor will rise to power and lead the human resistance to eradicate the machines. Since Skynet is on the verge of losing, however, it sends a cyborg assassin, called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back in time to 1984 to eliminate the man's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton).It failed.A few years later in Cameron's high-powered, special effects-laden 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' John Connor (newcomer Edward Furlong) is still a teenager, a wily and rebellious teenager, with the full weight of the future on his adolescent shoulders. Skynet, however, has one more card left up its sleeve: it sends another Terminator, an advanced prototype, the shape-changing T-1000 (Robert Patrick), to strike at Connor once again. The human Resistance reprograms another Terminator as a protector for John. It's only a question of which one will reach him first. So both Sarah and John are forced to team up with their cyborg protector if they are to avoid the T-1000 and the horrific future from which it came.Just to get this out of the way, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is in many ways superior to 'The Terminator.' Made on a significantly higher budget (at least 10x that of 'The Terminator'), Cameron employed many different ideas and special effects tricks that he couldn't do because of the budget limitations he faced on the first film. While I still hold that Cameron's original 1984 'The Terminator' is the greatest sci-fi movie ever - an unrivaled triumph of one ambitious filmmaker's fever-induced dream - 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is a triumph of its own. Although for me problems arise with the setup and the repeating of plot devices from the first film, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' shows just the length of Cameron's vision as a filmmaker. His writing here, with William Wisher, is not as strong or as sophisticated as it was in the first film, but the ideas remain powerful enough to get his vision across.The film is still a technical marvel, though, with crystal-clear cinematography by Adam Greenberg and some pretty strong and convincing performances. Schwarzenegger, doing his best turn as a 'kinder, gentler Terminator' (and surrogate father), does what could be considered his best performance as a machine, but for me, his best performance is that of the relentless Terminator from the first movie. Like the first film, you 'believe' that he's a machine in human form. But here he's given a chance to learn as a Terminator, and not be such a machine all the time, which does allow for some touching and humorous interactions with the young John Connor. (I cannot believe I just wrote that about Arnold.) Hamilton continues the trend established in Cameron's earlier 'Aliens' (1986) with strong female characters. Quite simply, this is her best and most memorable performance as well. She's one tough, beautiful, and formidable presence on the screen under Cameron's guidance. Like Sigourney Weaver, she helped to usher in a new generation of beautiful a**-kicking females. Most surprising here, though, is the newcomer child actor Edward Furlong. This is one of the most impressive debuts of any child actor ever, especially from one of absolutely zero acting experience beforehand. He finds the core of his character and truly brings the role of an adolescent John Connor to life brilliantly, and we're allowed to see shades of the brave future leader he is to eventually become.More to the point of why I love 'The Terminator' and its following, is Cameron's vocal decrying of nuclear holocaust and the ascension of man-made over made-men. The first 'Terminator' is a hot-bed of vocal opposition to nuclear armament with a strong anti-Cold War sentiment and the rising of technology in our society as we become more and more mechanical at an alarming rate. That to me, is what makes 'The Terminator' such socially relevant science fiction. Unfortunately, though, this vocalization is much stronger in the first film than it is in the second one, which is more action-oriented (even though the film has received positive accolades for its horrific depiction in nightmare sequences of nuclear holocaust).'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is a much more brilliant and more technical film than its predecessor, and for that I'm thankful Cameron was able to bring his vision to life with a capable cast of talent and special effects artists. The original 'The Terminator' is still my favorite sci-fi movie ever and Cameron's true work of genius. 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is still a brilliant exercise in high-charged sci-fi entertainment and nothing more.10/10",10,6,8,14 January 2008
Apocalypse Now," It'll blow you away (based on the Redux version)!
","'Apocalypse Now' is as powerful a war film as you're ever likely to see. The film is basically a mad-house of powerful imagery, sounds, and moody atmosphere - all this is done at the highly capable hands of director Francis Ford Coppola (working from the novella 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad). Coppola is not one of my favorite filmmakers, but 'Apocalypse Now' is the one film of his I've always admired and had a deep fondness for. The film works on a base level that seems to appeal to your worst feelings. 'Apocalypse Now' is a dark, violent, visually disturbing motion picture. Set during the Vietnam War, the film concerns the covert mission of Captain Benjamin L. Willard (the great Martin Sheen, in my favorite performance of his), a military assassin, to kill the rogue Colonel Kurtz (the late Marlon Brando), who has proclaimed himself god in a heavily fortified fortress located deep in the heart of Vietnam. Willard accompanies a small Army boat crew to take him up a river for him to complete his mission. 'Apocalypse Now' is a war film that does not play around in the visually disturbing imagery category, including the graphic combat violence and the (reportedly) live slaughter of a live a water buffalo for a ritualistic sacrifice by Vietnamese villagers. Kurtz's powerful final words signify the meaning of the whole picture - the utter 'horror,' and the utter insanity of war.10/10",10,0,1,12 March 2012
Edward Scissorhands," 'Edward Scissorhands'
","No matter what you may think of him, there's no question of director Tim Burton's gift for imagination, invention, and his mastery of storytelling. He also specializes in freaks (or more pleasantly, misunderstood outsiders); if you've seen 'Beetlejuice' (1988), 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' (1985), 'Batman' (1989) and his critical masterpiece 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), then you realize it's the truth. 'Edward Scissorhands,' often cited as Burton's most personal work, transcends its fairy-tale origins to become something far greater, like a mature cinematic masterpiece. Only true Burton devotees know why the film is so celebrated today, 15 years after it was released. Though Burton has made two better critical efforts since this one (1994's 'Ed Wood' and 2003's 'Big Fish'), it is 'Edward Scissorhands' that stands as his most delicate and greatest masterwork. The film takes place in some quaint, unnamed suburb (that looks like something straight out of a '50s supermarket real estate guide), where local Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest), desperate for a sale, stumbles up to the dark castle located on the hill looming over her neighborhood. On her way up to the door, she finds the garden and the magnificent artistic creations housed in it. Once inside, she finds the remains of a factory and its sole occupant, Edward (Johnny Depp). The greatest, yet unfinished creation of his late scientific inventor (the late Vincent Price, in one of his last roles), Edward is a sort of Frankenstein monster, only he's not built from human body parts and he is not an object of horror but more of sympathy: The Inventor died before he could give Edward real hands, so he's stuck forever with these 'scissor-hands.' Peg invites him to live with her family down in the 'burbs, but she is in no way put off by his 'hands,' which are comprised of razor-sharp knives and blades. I guess I shouldn't say it takes a while for Edward to grow accustomed to his new surroundings, but the locals are quite welcoming and warm to him (he even takes on the tasks of pet grooming, sheering, and eventually, salon styling). Why, he approaches adorability in this sweet, conformist society! There are others, however, like the native Christ-nut, sees foreboding in Edward's arrival, and Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), who is the rich, selfish and arrogant son of a local businessman, and who also happens to be the boyfriend of Peg's pretty teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), sees menace in innocence. Edward is kind and benevolent but he's also human (somewhat), and is capable of anger and rage and it isn't long before various misunderstandings allow this dark side of his character to surface. Long before he was Jack Sparrow, Depp was Edward Scissorhands in one of the most recognizable roles of his career; who could have seen him becoming the top-notch performer he is today? As the harmless Edward, his face is scarred by the many scratches of his scissor-hands, making him incapable of touching anything or anyone for fear of destroying it. He has minimal lines but delivers his performance through calculated mannerisms and facial expressions. It's probably one of his first great roles. As for director Burton, he indulges in his usual cinematic weirdness (is there any other kind?), but it's given a strong emotional and human touch with a light dose of comic fare, which manages to separate it from earlier substance works like 'Beetlejuice' or 'Batman.' He focuses mainly on the characters, and their reaction to the misunderstood outsider, and his reluctant acceptance, more or less, into their world. 'Batman' remains my favorite Burton piece, but 'Edward Scissorhands' is probably the best film he's made so far (from a fan's perspective). 'Edward Scissorhands' is a dark, comic fable come to life, and lives forever and ever, long after the lights in the theater come back on.10/10",10,4,6,9 November 2005
Van Helsing," 'Van Helsing'
","'Van Helsing' is a movie that boasts some incredible special effects, but suffers a lot from awfully strenuous pacing that mars what is an otherwise fun experience.Out on home video just in time for the Halloween season, the famous (or should I say infamous?) vampire slayer Van Helsing (Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman) is the most wanted man in Europe, for accusations that he is a murderer rather than a hero. His quarry has expanded from vampires to any number of ghoulish nasties, including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Aided by the bumbling friar Carl (David Wenham) and with the help of the Transylvanian beauty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), he proceeds to track down his arch-nemesis Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who has recruited the Wolf Man and seeks to use Frankenstein - both in some notorious plot.From the opening credits, which homages to the Universal monster classics of yore, 'Van Helsing' sucks you in. Certainly more comic book than fright film, it's still impressive entertainment. It has a fairly slow build-up, but gets interesting once the special effects kick in.Unfortunately, while the special effects are the best part of 'Van Helsing,' they quickly become 'Van Helsing,' abandoning any plot elements and reducing the characters to special effects as well.Aside from that minor quibble, 'Van Helsing' is still a fun and fast ride from Stephen Sommers, the director of the first two 'Mummy' films and the 1998 horror movie 'Deep Rising.'7/10",7,1,2,24 October 2004
Monsters vs. Aliens," Overall, this wasn't a bad film at all
","One of the great joys of watching 'Monsters vs. Aliens' is that it is a delightful throwback and a parody of virtually every sci-fi 'B'-movie made within the last 60 years. From 'The War of the Worlds' (1953) to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977), to 'Independence Day' (1996), to 'War of the Worlds' (2005), to Godzilla, to both the original and remake versions of 'The Fly,' 'The Blob' and 'Attack of the 50 foot Woman,' you can bet that if it's sci-fi and cheesy (cheesy sci-fi), it gets lampooned by the film-making team of Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon, working with DreamWorks Animation.Nothing about the animation in this movie really stands out when compared to what we're seeing from Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli (his animation is truly the best, in my opinion), but 'Monsters vs. Aliens' is pure fun from the start, beginning with a meteorite that crash-lands on Earth, or, more specifically, crash-lands on bride-to-be Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon). Witherspoon's Susan Murphy is really the most important character in the movie because she's the only one with significant motivation and feeling. Her cohorts do their normal supporting-role thing and manage to stand out on their own, but don't have the emotional depth that Susan Murphy does.As she's walking down the aisle to her husband-to-be Derek (Paul Rudd), Susan starts to grow - and I mean really grow - into a 49-foot-tall giantess (while still somehow managing to remain fully clothed in her wedding dress), who the government later names 'Ginormica.' She is soon taken prisoner, watched over by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland, 'W.R. Monger' - 'War Monger,' get it?) and introduced to characters who seem to have popped right out of '50s sci-fi movies - the Gill-man The Missing Link (Will Arnett), the blob B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), mad-scientist Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), and the gigantic Insectosaurus. The octo-pod alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) has plans for world domination, but the government soon sees it has no choice but to unleash these Monsters on an unsuspecting human populace to fight some nasty Aliens.'Monsters vs. Aliens' will at the very least keep you entertained. Should it be seen by adults? Sure, why not. If they've seen enough sci-fi movies over the years, then they might get a kick out of all the movies that get skewered during the proceedings. Obviously, kids will love it, especially B.O.B., who I found to probably be the best Monster character, largely because of Seth Rogen's portrayal of the lovable, stretchable, if not completely brainless and virtually indestructible one-eyed mass of gelatin. (I even got a free B.O.B. plush-toy out of the deal at Best Buy.)'Monsters vs. Aliens' is a great way to kill 94 minutes of your life. I bought the movie on DVD (with the aforementioned free B.O.B. plush-toy) and I can say that it was well worth every penny.7/10",7,0,0,25 March 2010
Dreamgirls," 'Dreamgirls' - Music & lyrics
","I don't normally like musicals and as such, went into 'Dreamgirls' thinking it was a fictional take on the real-life rise of soul singer Diana Ross and her former song-group The Supremes, except that it had singer Beyonce' Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose in the parts, and show business talents like Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy were there to keep everybody in line. It's a fairly good take on the crossover of black artists into the white mainstream music scene the mid-20th century, when music was still segregated. I thought it was going to be a biopic (sort of), with no music and song performances (well occasionally, like stuff we see on stage, rather than just random musical numbers). I can honestly say that 'Dreamgirls' is probably one of the first musicals I can actually sit through, which is good. I must say that the actresses (especially Knowles as Deena Jones and Hudson as Effie) project their voices flawlessly, and their performances work. I can lastly say that writer/director Bill Condon has done a good job of adapting Tom Eyen's original Broadway hit for the screen. But like I said earlier, I don't normally like musicals but this one was pretty good, with good music and music numbers, and a production that also captured the rise of black music and its crossing over into the white mainstream.7/10",7,0,1,1 November 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' does the deed and then something else
","In the previews, 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't. Too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. What's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called 'The 40 Year-old Virgin.'The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches 'Survivor' with his two kind elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.Now here's the real novelty with this picture: it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute, mature fashion. This is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low. Sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which are, in no way, meant to be taken as gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game ('Mortal Kombat: Deception,' no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys).As someone who is rapidly approaching 20, collects McFarlane Toys action figures AND has himself never done the deed, I found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40. A bit arrogant, I know, but would you ('you' is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin'?Of course Andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with 'morning rise' (don't ask), and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex. When it's first discovered Andy is a virgin, at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman, which couldn't be any further from the truth. The truth is, Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good.David, Jay, and Cal each embark on a mission to get Andy laid, so help them all. But you know that such escapades will only end in disaster, as proved by one date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst drunk-driving experience I think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.Things brighten up for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with that nice-looking collection of action figures, you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him, that is if he can ever 'do the deed.'At last, this is the sex romp we've been waiting for. It deals with a very real issue a lot of Lonely Guys probably go through, not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture: How many of us 'Lonely Guys' want to be a lonely guy forever? The important thing we're taught in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he needs to go through body waxing like Andy does (which is side-splitting to be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was in fact real, and so was the blood on Carell's shirt afterward).'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by himself and Carell, which originated as a skit that starred Carell. Carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps I've ever seen and is not offensive (a whole lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.The way 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' plays out is indeed funny in the end, but I'll leave that up to you, the viewer, to observe. Surely, if anyone can go through the things Andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, then it's true: It is never too late!10/10",10,245,346,22 August 2005
Face_Off," 'Face/Off' - Identity crisis?
","A movie about a hockey match, this isn't.1997's 'Face/Off,' the third (and to this date, most successful) American feature from Hong Kong action director John Woo, is everything a fan of Woo's Asian work could possibly hope for. It's a loud, fast-paced, and spectacularly violent epic helmed by a master craftsman. And even with this ambitious third American feature, it is vastly on par with the director's Hong Kong work and is very easily one of the best films of his career.Woo made a name for himself back in Asia as the director of hyper-stylized, hard-hitting pot-boiler action films like 'The Killer' (1989) and 'Hard Boiled' (1992), where he made an art form of dual-pistol-wielding gun-play and action shoot-'em-up. You want action? John Woo is your man to go to. He made his first American feature with Jean-Claude Van Damme in 'Hard Target' (1993) and followed it up with 'Broken Arrow' in 1996. Now we're at 'Face/Off.''Face/Off' stars a daring and intrepid Los Angeles F.B.I. agent named Sean Archer (John Travolta), who for the last six years has been on the trail of psycho freelance terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) after he killed Archer's young son. So when Archer finally captures Troy (who's put into a coma as a result) within the film's opening 20 minutes, Archer thinks it's the last of his arch-nemesis.But of course it's not over, not by a long shot. The screenplay by writers Mike Webb and Michael Colleary throws us a curve-ball in the form of something write out of a sci-fi medical novel: to save L.A. from biological annihilation, Archer must become his enemy and learn the location of said biological payload. Archer trades physical identities with Troy bu undergoing a radical surgical procedure to get Troy's sociopath younger brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) to give up the goods.However, Troy comes out of his coma and assumes Archer's identity as an F.B.I. man, a job he comes to love and abuses with joyful glee, and even gets cozy with Archer's neglected wife Eve (Joan Allen) and daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain). His first move is to destroy all the evidence that proves each man's true identity and seemingly leaves no way to reverse the procedures when he kills everyone involved in the mission (how sick and twisted is he, anyway?). His next plan is to systematically eliminate his old allies to afford protection for himself and his brother. In the meantime, Archer (as Castor) is left to rot in a federal prison that the Geneva Convention doesn't know exists and has to find a way to get out to defeat his nemesis once and for all, even if it means actually 'becoming' him, and using Troy's old buddies to his advantage. You want to talk about identity crisis?10 years after its release, this movie is still as balletic and energetic, action-packed and exciting as it was all those years ago. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were perfectly cast as the perfect hero and perfect villain in what was one of the hottest action movies of that year. The only problem is, though, both actors enjoy switching their roles and playing off each other in a vicious blood feud, although it seems that Travolta was having the most fun here, leaving Cage a little hard-pressed to remain on the sidelines as the hero. Hot off their success in movies such as 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and 'Leaving Las Vegas' (1995), Travolta revels in Cage's bad guy performance (even if Cage is Cage and Travolta is Travolta - for only about 20 minutes each). Coldly sadistic and over-the-edge/brave and determined, you can tell who likes things best.The film's action scenes, which there are plenty of, is where 'Face/Off' chiefly excels at. Woo brings much of the gusto and gun-play loved by so many in his native land to a place that's foreign. Perhaps this is why his two earlier efforts may have been failures here in the U.S. (Yet, third time's a charm, right?) As if crises of identity weren't enough, Woo seemed to be going through a transformation himself, adjusting his craft for American audiences.But with 'Face/Off,' Woo proves to be at the top of his game, since he has the right actors, the right action and special effects, and the right stuff to pull it all off.10/10",10,17,24,11 September 2007
Spider-Man," On the level of epic storytelling
","Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is lonely, insecure, and is in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst), a girl he has had a crush on since he was six. One day, while on a field trip to a laboratory where they are studying arachnids, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that had accidentally gotten out of its cage. Peter goes home in a daze over what has just happened. The next day, he finds himself mysteriously buffed up and no longer needs to wear glasses. So off he goes to school to endure another day of torment by his peers. Just as he is about to start eating lunch, a weird feeling comes to Peter, just as Mary Jane is about to slip in a puddle. Peter catches Mary Jane and her lunch just in the nick of time. After he continues eating, Peter accidentally shoots a string of web from his wrist. While trying to hide the webbing, he accidentally pulls a lunch tray and it hits one of his tormentors in the back. Peter then hauls a** out of the cafeteria. The guy he hit in the back follows Peter, looking for a fight. Peter is able to miraculously overcome his opponent with the use of his new found 'spider-sense'. On the way home, he begins running and running and finally leaping from building to building and then spinning and spinning. Peter decides to keep his new abilities secret, but when a thief that he could have stopped kills his beloved Uncle Ben, he then decides that he is going to use his abilities to fight crime. It seems that his abilities could not have come at a better time, as he now has to square off against the mysterious and deadly Green Goblin/Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe).'Spider-Man' definitely is the movie to see this year. The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. When I went to see this movie yesterday, the theater was packed. Everybody cheered when Peter beat up that one guy and when he tracked down the man who killed his uncle. It seems to me that this movie affected everyone in the theater the same way. There is a very wide range of emotions to be experienced when watching this movie. Some of the emotions I'm talking about like happiness, loss, grief, and good triumphing over evil to name a few. Sam Raimi of 'The Evil Dead' fame is the perfect director for this film. Some of the comic elements that he uses in some of his earlier films are highly present in this film. You should also be on the lookout for Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small cameo as a ring announcer. This movie succeeds because of two key things: smart casting choices and epic storytelling. First off, Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! I must admit, that I followed some of my friends when they said that Tobey Maguire could not play Peter Parker. I found out yesterday that is not true. He is Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man. He owns that role. Much as Christopher Reeve played the part of Superman and Michael Keaton was Batman before him, Tobey Maguire will take his place in superhero history as Spider-Man. He is a very good actor in this movie. The scene where he visits Aunt May in the hospital or the ending scene in the cemetery where he talks to Mary Jane about their relationship all go to show how good he can act. Although I have not payed that much attention to Kirsten Dunst, I must admit that she was perfectly cast as Mary Jane Watson. She really has that girl-next-door kind of charisma that is required for a role like hers. Willem Dafoe easily plays one of the best comic book villains of all time as Green Goblin. He's basically torn by grief from loosing his company and from pursuing a life of crime as Green Goblin. The scene where he talks to the Green Goblin mask is one of his best scenes.The costumes for Spider-Man and Green Goblin are some of the most fantastic costume designs and make up effects I've seen since 'Dick Tracy'. This movie deserves to get an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up.The action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen for a superhero movie. The web-slinging scenes, whilst being computer animated, are extremely convincing, largely because they look so real. The scene at the party where Spider-Man and Green Goblin meet for the first time is probably the best action scene in the movie.'Spider-Man' deserves all the praise that it is going to receive, no doubt. I love this movie. I really want to go see it again, but I know that I probably won't be able to. This movie will blow you away, it'll make you want to cheer and it'll make you want to cry. I give 'Spider-Man' a big 10.",10,2,4,4 May 2002
Jarhead," A soldier's story redefined
","'Jarhead' is a war film unlike any other before it because the story concentrates on the personal narrative and experiences of a single bored soldier and his companions in the United States Marine Corps. Its narrator, Marine Corps sniper Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), is the kind of American kid from a military background who convinces news reporters in an interview that he signed up out of idealism, has strong faith in his country's leaders, but at the end he quips that he signed up because 'he was dumb enough to sign a contract.''Jarhead' is more distinct from other films before it because there is little action, little heroics, and lots of swearing and standing around because they have nothing better to do. At one point late in the film, Swofford and a comrade have set up a sniper post, get orders to take a shot and just when he's about to pull the trigger, a fellow marine shows up and warns them to step down for fear the shot may give away an incoming air strike. Swoff's comrade begs for one shot because their hellish training and wasted days doing nothing has led up to this one point in time for glory, but ultimately comes no big reward or payoff.The film opens as Swofford has just entered basic training and offhandedly assumes he has made a mistake by enlisting. He's immediately signed on to a unit of rough-housers, screw-ups, and retards (and for some reason the man who assigned him to this unit didn't lead us on to believe he was kidding). Based on his own 2003 best-selling memoir of the same title, Swofford's narration ranges from scathing indictment of his situation to a seething resentment of it; he does provide some comedy, though it doesn't come easy for the most part (even though there is one funny part when a tent gets burned down, which has to be seen to be understood). He counts the days, cleans his rifle, debates past sexual conquests, thinks of masturbating (a lot), and worries about his girlfriend - who may be cheating on him.The men in his unit are some of the saddest sacks to ever join the Marine Corps. Under the command of Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), he trains them hard for battle. Sykes loves his job, loves the Corps, loves training the men, and can't wait for the moment of combat for his men to shine. And soon enough, they're shipped off to Saudi Arabia a.k.a. 'the suck' as part of the U.S. government's 'Operation Desert Shield' and their first mission is to guard the oil wells for their friends, the Saudis, from the Iraq president Saddam Hussein and the Republican Guard. This mainly consists of sitting around, braving the soaring desert heat, giving interviews to reporters, throwing around footballs, drinking lots of water, and trying desperately to maintain a sense of sanity.He does make a friend eventually, his spotter Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who is the aforementioned comrade who goes nuts during that sniper scene. In their first 170 or so days in Iraq, the men are pumped for action (in a motivational speech by Chris Cooper, no less, in a cameo), swearing constantly (with at least 278 uses of the f-word and its variants), getting drunk, and thinking about girlfriends or wives back home who may be cheating on them (and photos of those unfaithful women are posted on the infamous 'Wall of Shame'). There is no tension, and when they think they're about to be attacked by eight ominous, approaching Iraqis while on patrol in the desert, Swofford goes to investigate and when he returns to report to his comrades, it turns out that 'someone shot three of their camels.'The term 'jarhead,' the self-describing moniker of men in uniform, is defined early in the film as the way that a soldier looks in full combat gear, with a head, given greater definition by the crew-cuts, is shaped like a jar. 'Jarhead,' the film, is a soldier's story told from a young man who knows what's going on but not why. His whole war lasted 'four days, four hours, and one minute' - that was his war, Anthony Swofford's war. It was four days, four hours, and one minute or so of nothing but sitting around and killing time.When it came out last year, I remember a storm of controversy swelling up around 'Jarhead' because Hollywood seems to be riding the wave against 'Iraq, part II,' though I believe Anthony Swofford and director Sam Mendes have repeatedly insisted the novel and film are apolitical, despite the latter's open contempt for the war and our government, as well as some of the negative war reactions of actors including Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard. And it's true: the film doesn't take sides. But all it does is show the tediousness and boredom of a conflict that to them, never actually was, and leaves it at that.9/10",9,0,1,7 March 2006
Collateral," Tom Cruise as hit-man. ***MINOR SPOILER***
","Michael Mann may be one of Hollywood's best, if not somewhat underrated directors; he isn't exactly one of my favorite filmmakers, even though he made 'The Last of the Mohicans' in 1992, which is #14 on my all-time best movie list. Tom Cruise isn't the best actor in the world, but with a career spanning well over 20 years and with each role he's taken in his years as a big screen performer, has been more varied and detailed.With 'Collateral' however, two Hollywood wild cards come together to make what is certainly one of the most entertaining and stylishly-crafted action thrillers I've seen in a long time. Add to this equation a popular and talented comedian - Jamie Foxx - and you've got pure gold.Foxx is no stranger to serious performances despite his stature as a stand-up comic, since he has worked with Mann before, on 2001's 'Ali' and earned widespread acclaim with the recent made-for-TV drama 'Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story.' Here in 'Collateral,' he plays an innocent cabbie named Max, who makes the unwitting mistake of picking up a cool and casual hit-man named Vincent (Cruise). Vincent has come to Los Angeles to wipe out five people and needs a ride around the city and Max has just the nice enough vehicle for the job.What we get with 'Collateral' is a slick, stylish and intelligent thriller that utilizes the talents of its two leads almost perfectly. Foxx provides a valuable counterpoint of dark comedy and fear, artistically-speaking of course, to Cruise's all-too-savvy Vincent. There is even a romantic interest, provided by Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, who unknown to Max, is on Vincent's hitlist.Michael Mann gives us one of his best films in a long time. Tom Cruise gives a truly Oscar-worthy performance as well as Jamie Foxx, who turns in what is probably his most convincing role to date.",9,1,2,19 August 2004
Bad Teacher," A good 'Rotten Apple'
","There will be those who watch Jake Kasdan's 'Bad Teacher' and automatically think back to the cult classic Billy Bob Thornton-starring, Terry Zwigoff-directed comedy 'Bad Santa' (2003) and think that the two movies are somewhat similar: Both pictures center around a drug-abusing, alcohol-swilling 'protagonist' who doesn't give an 'F' about anything but abusing drugs and swilling alcohol, yet somehow by the end of the story is forced to change their ways... just a little bit.'Bad Teacher' is a rotten apple of a dark comedy about a Bad Teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), whose gold-digging ways are exposed by her fiancé at the beginning of the movie and left with little recourse, she is forced to return to her much-hated job as a middle school teacher at John Adams Middle School (JAMS). On her first day back, she makes the acquaintance of the geeky new substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), who also happens to be heir to a watch fortune; he also happens to like women with big boobs. So taking advantage of this fact to get him to become her new sugar daddy and concocting a scheme to get a $5700 bonus for getting the highest standardized test grades, she'll then use the money she earns from that to get breast implants. And she must also fend off the romantic advances of pot-smoking gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) and a caring goody-good rival named Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).This is not a bad film. Some thought 'Bad Santa' would scare people because little kids would go into it thinking it was a new Christmas movie about Santa Claus (and we all know how well that turned out). Some of the humor is very dark and very crude (and sometimes forced), but I welcome it as a change to the usual run-of-the-mill 'light comedy' being pushed upon us week after week. I laughed at many of the jokes here, and maybe some people have difficulty finding this sort of dark, crude humor funny. Some of the sub-plots involving a bullied unpopular kid and his crush on a pretty classmate are fairly underwhelming.On a more positive note, some of the characters are pretty colorful. Diaz is still looking great (I have to fake it here because I just can't get into blondes), but she relishes her role as a Bad Teacher with pill-popping, pot-smoking, alcohol-swilling pizazz. She shows up to work hung-over, and spends her nights hanging out at bars trying to hook up with any rich guy willing to take a chance with a gold-digging middle school teacher. I think it's a welcome change from her usual light-hearted comedic fare. In a nutshell, she gives the film's best performance.Surprisingly, Justin Timberlake, I think, continues to grow as a performer, especially after his well-received roles in past movies such as 'Alpha Dog' (2006), and 'The Social Network' (2010). While his work is not 'great' here, it is at least showing that he is indeed capable of giving solid performances if given the right material. Phyllis Smith is also hilarious as their slightly neurotic fellow co-worker Lynn Davies. Segel probably gives the film's most grounded and realistic performance as the gym teacher who is only concerned with simply having fun, even though by his own admission he doesn't have a whole lot to have fun with.'Bad Teacher' is a rotten apple that gets a 'B+' for effort.8/10",8,2,4,19 October 2011
Aliens," Believe the hype, it's a classic.
","Aliens is in fact one of my favorite science-fiction films. I also find it hard to believe that I was also only a year old when this movie came out and strangely enough, the special effects have held up quite well since 1986.As many of you already know, Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first encounter with the deadly alien. Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) is floating through space in hypersleep. Her escape pod is picked up by a deep-space salvage crew. She wakes up in a hospital where she meets Carter Burke(played with the right amount distrustworthiness by Paul Reiser) who informs Ripley about how long she has been floating in space. He also tells her that the Yutani Corporation has funded colonization of LV-426, the planet that the Nostromo(the ship from the first Alien film) landed on. Burke later shows up at Ripley's room with Lt. Gorman(William Hope) and tells her that contact has been lost with LV-426. Ripley tells them that it was the aliens had probably gotten the colonists. As her nightmares continue, she becomes convinced that the only way to end her nightmares is to go to the planet and see that the creatures are eliminated. So she goes. We next see her on the military ship, The Sulaco. She sees that many of the marines are very confident that they will succeed in their mission of exterminating the aliens. The marines include Hicks(Michael Biehn), Hudson(Bill Paxton), Vasquez(Jenette Goldstein), Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews), Drake(Mark Rolston), and an android(Lance Henriksen). They go to the planet and Ripley becomes a sort of surrogate mother to a lonely and terrified little girl named Newt(Carrie Henn). Newt tells that the aliens were in fact responsible for the disappearance of the colonists. Soon after, all hell breaks loose as each marine is picked off in the alien hive, thus leaving a only a small group of survivors.Aliens is probably one of the best movies to come during the eighties. Sigourney Weaver deserved the Oscar for best actress. The supporting performances are great also especially Bill Paxton who plays the frightened Hudson. He is probably my favorite character in the movie. Special praise should go to director James Cameron for keeping the action slick and the tension always mounting. I also think it was pretty clever with the film editing that made it look like that hundreds of aliens were all over the place when in actuality only six costumes were used. That's pretty tight.One gripe that I do have with the Alien films in general, are the aliens themselves which I think, are the most overlooked part of these movies. The aliens are the heart and soul of these films, but come off most of the time as just a really cool looking special effect. I'm not saying that's bad but come on the films should at least go into a little depth as to explaining what they are or where they came from. I mean, I wish a fifth alien movie or a documentary would be made that would go into depth to explain what they are or something like that.I have been a big fan of the alien series ever since I saw this movie. I even used to collect the Alien action figures that were popular from around like 1993-1995. Surprise, surprise, I still have them, most of which are still in good condition with the exception of about two or three. I'm just saying that to show you how big a fan of Aliens I am.Now about the other films in the series. In my opinion, Alien(1979) is probably the most overrated film in the series. Don't me wrong I liked the first film, it's just that it seems a bit dated and director Ridley Scott has made many better films since then. Alien 3(1992) has been unfairly judged as being the worst in the series. I think that happened because director David Fincher(Seven, Fight Club, The Game) was trying something new with the series and got badly criticized for it. Alien: Resurrection(1997) was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who by the way is a visual genius. Before Resurrection came out, me and my best friend would get into arguments of whether or not Resurrection would actually surpass Aliens. To our surprise, it did surpass it as far as special effects went but, we were a little disappointed with the film's story. But it's a real shame though, that Alien: Resurrection is an even more underrated movie than Alien 3.Aliens gets an 10/10",10,5,7,15 October 2001
The Fast and the Furious," High-Octane Entertainment
","The summer of 2001 was filled with a countless number of action flicks that for the most part were successful.  'The Fast and the Furious' was one of them.  Some of the previews for this movie which have Limp Bizkit's 'My Way' or Ja Rule's 'Furious' playing in the background can lead you to expect a no-holds-barred film with relentless action scenes that are made to get the adrenaline pumping.  'The Fast and the Furious' for the most part has all of that.  The acting here is pretty good despite the fact this is a summer action film.  Vin Diesel is already on his way to super-stardom as is Paul Walker.  The racing scenes are excellently done but look a lot more like something out of a really hot Playstation 2 game, as someone pointed out earlier at this site.Now for the bad parts.  The storyline sucks mainly because we saw it in another movie that was released nearly ten years before 'The Fast and the Furious'.  That movie was 'Point Break' which just so happened to star Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.  The plotlines for both films are almost identical.  I'm going to do this in comparison style with 'The Fast and the Furious' first and 'Point Break' second.  'The Fast and the Furious/Point Break' both have rookie cops(Paul Walker/Keanu Reeves) going undercover(LA street racing scene/LA surfing scene) to find the culprits behind several daring heists(truck heists/bank robberies).  The cops both fall in love with someone close to the suspected ring leader(Jordana Brewster/Lori Petty). The endings for both films pretty much leave the door open for sequels but is more likely with 'The Fast and the Furious' than it is 'Point Break'. None of these complaints however, really had an effect on my viewing pleasure.  Lastly, what the hell happened to Ja Rule?  His performance seems to be more a lot more of a cameo than a small role.  He's only in one scene in the whole movie(the first racing scene) and I expected him to at least be in more scenes.    Well 'The Fast and the Furious' gets an 8/10 despite the absence of Ja Rule.",8,1,3,24 January 2002
The Exorcist," 'The Exorcist' (1973 - Hell yeah, it's that good, scary!!!
","William Friedkin has a reputation in Hollywood as one of its great directors of fast-paced 'chase movies.' 'The French Connection' (1971), the controversial 'Cruising' (1980), and 'To Live and Die in L.A.' (1985) come to mind. 'The Exorcist,' his 1973 masterpiece of horror, is a chase movie in that regard, albeit a rather 'contained' one, in that the 'chases' all occur in one place, and don't involve cars, guns, or explosions.'The Exorcist' has a reputation as the scariest movie of all time. I'm inclined to agree. I've never seen such horrific imagery from a movie in my life. Much of the ghastly imagery and scenery in 'The Exorcist' still remains fresh in my mind. On top of that, I've never been so thoroughly unsettled by a horror film before. Before watching this movie, I knew (knew is italicized) that 'The Exorcist' was the scariest movie of all time; I just needed to confirm it with my own eyes, and ears.The chase elements in this movie come into play in its second half, when Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) work together to save Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) from possession by the Devil, and to 'chase' it back to Hell. Regan is the daughter of actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who at first thinks her daughter is suffering from some sort of strange mental disorder, but is forced to face the horror herself in that fact that her daughter is possessed by unholy forces intent on dragging her kicking & screaming into the darkest depths of the demonic underworld.Based on the controversial novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty (who also wrote the screenplay), 'The Exorcist' is THE horror film, and essential viewing for any true fan of the genre. Some will agree, some will disagree, but I don't think that lessens the film's impact. I've never been so thoroughly shocked by a motion picture before; all the warnings I've received beforehand proved out to be true. The film relies on realistic performances, Friedkin's precision direction, innovative and ground-breaking special effects, mood, horrific imagery, and disturbing bits & pieces of dialogue for its effects on the viewer (basically anything uttered by then-14-year-old Linda Blair while under the effects of demonic possession).I don't expect many of today's younger viewers to probably understand the significance of this picture, and its lasting effect on horror movie-making. They're too accustomed to gore and special effects. I should know, I'm one of them; I'm only 24, but I know powerful film-making when I see it. 'The Exorcist' is the scariest horror movie I've ever seen. Don't believe me? Just watch it for yourself.10/10",10,9,14,8 June 2010
X-Men: Days of Future Past," 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014)
","Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the 2014, Bryan Singer-directed 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is that it is a near-perfect melding of past and present, much like its source material. Personally, I've long considered the best 'X-Men' movies to have always been under Singer's direction (i.e., 2003's 'X2' - the best 'X-Men' film there ever was). As an openly gay Jew who was raised in a mostly Christian community growing up, Singer knew what it was like to be an outsider, which is why, it can be said, that the best 'X-Men' movies belong to him and do contain a slight personal touch.I've admired the X-Men pretty much since the time I first got into comics and superheroes. They are my favorite superhero team, without question. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby first launched the title for Marvel Comics in 1963 as a way of voicing their feelings about racism in American society, and over the years other artists and writers have used the title as a platform to voice similar concerns about racial hatred, homophobia, anti-Semitism, religion and religious fundamentalism, and any & all other forms of hatred and intolerance.'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is adapted from the famous two-part comic book story arc of the same name ('The Uncanny X-Men #141-142' - both of which I do own) by long-time 'X-Men' writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne. Like the original story arc that inspired it, the film features old and new, meaning old characters (from Singer's first 'X-Men' film series) and new ones (the new series that began with 2011's 'X-Men: First Class'). The story is greatly different from the comics, but the basic premise is still the same: in a dystopian future where mutants are hunted down and either killed out-right or imprisoned in internment camps, Professor Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) uses his powers to send someone - Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat in the original comics, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) here - back in time and avert the disaster that will turn humankind against the world's mutant population and lead to an eventual mutant holocaust.I'm going to stop there. The movie is quite thrilling and occasionally very frightening. The best thing that can be said about the picture is the fact that Bryan Singer is back on-board the film series he helped to create and bears his signature. The movie is a spectacle and can be pretty funny in some spots, i.e., the early scenes set in 1973 with the teenage mutant speedster Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver ('American Horror Story's' Evan Peters), and the younger, disenchanted Professor X (James McAvoy). And the way that it re-writes history to suit its vision is very creative (the JFK assassination, anyone?); special credit should be given to screenwriter Simon Kinberg in that regard. Oh yeah, and the fearsome Sentinels finally make their screen debut after all these years.So far, this is the second-best 'X-Men' movie I've seen. The return of Bryan Singer was very welcomed by this long-time X-Men fan. If the film's ending is any indication, I can't wait for this film's follow-up in a few years ('Age of Apocalypse' is what I've heard).9/10",9,7,12,3 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016)
","'Captain America: Civil War' is the second superhero film of 2016 to feature heroic super-powered characters fighting each other - the other film is DC Comics' 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,' which I have not yet seen. (On a side note: over the weekend, I watched 'Deadpool' finally, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual pool of superhero movies of late.)Joe and Anthony Russo return to direct 'Civil War,' which follows 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014) and 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015). In a story that bears some fairly obvious parallels to the contentious debate over the current U.S. foreign policy of interventionism (and the role of the U.S. in world geo-politics as a whole), the super-powered superhero team the Avengers are divided, after their recent battles with evil have left much destruction and lost lives in their wake.So the Sokovia Accords are drawn up, which seeks to limit the highly costly activities of the Avengers in the event that they need to be deployed into action; Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is for it, while his best friend and fellow Avenger Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is against it. Half the heroes side with Iron Man, the other half with Captain America; I never thought I'd side with Captain America ever on anything, but I thought he was in the right here (as well as in the original 'Civil War' comic book story-line).'Captain America: Civil War' also marks the debut of T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), the king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, and who in comic book history is the first black superhero of any significance, and who later became a prominent figure in the Avengers himself. I'm glad to see that such a historically significant character got the proper treatment in Chadwick Boseman that he deserved. 'Captain America: Civil War' also marks the debut of Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as introducing Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, the film's most welcomed comic relief) into the fold, too.The movie, as a whole, works, even though the issues that it brings up regarding the role of superheroes in the 2016, post-9/11 world of today take a back seat to overly choreographed fighting sequences, explosions, and special effects. I guess that's the sign of what Marvel Studios/Disney expects that audiences want nowadays - less not more.7/10",7,1,5,16 May 2016
American History X," America...
","Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar 10 years ago in 1998 for his performance in 1998 in 'American History X.' His role as Derek Vinyard, a once-bright kid-turned-charismatic-neo-Nazi skinhead leader is one of the most brilliantly brutal and uncompromising screen performances I've ever seen. After being released from prison, he emerges reformed, determined to leave his old life behind and start fresh, and try to make amends to his broken family. As a 22-year-old black male, I was not the slightest bit offended by 'American History X' and the violent racist rhetoric on display here. A lot of what is said and done in this film can be heard from any right-wing conservative loudmouth (i.e., Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage, among many others), so many of the discussions here won't be lost on some viewers. The meat of the story gets underway when Derek's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) writes a history paper on 'Mein Kampf' and is on the verge of expulsion by the school's principal (Avery Brooks) as a result. The principal decides to take Danny under his wing in a remedial history course called, among other things, 'American History X.' Through Danny's work under the principal, in equal parts back-story and present-story, he explores Derek's transformation into a skinhead, after coming under the influence of a local white supremacist, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), following the murder of their father (though the seeds were planted much earlier, as detailed fairly late in the film), and Derek becomes his protégé, recruiting many lost and impressionable young kids for him. Britisher Tony Kaye directed David McKenna's occasionally flawed script, which guides Norton's Derek Vinyard through a devastating and vicious cycle that is as brilliant as it is chilling and realistic. The transformation he goes through in this film, and his attempts to keep Danny from following in his footsteps is indeed one of the greatest screen performances of all time, even if some issues get left out in the cold, and the script seems deficient in the storytelling at times. But regardless, 'American History X,' is just one damn-brilliant piece of film-making. The intensity of the performances, especially Edward Norton's, and the material show us that this is film-making at its best. One of the all-time greatest films.10/10",10,1,4,8 February 2008
Saw III," 'Saw III' - Third time's a charm, isn't it?
","It was a few weeks before Halloween 2006 that I was able to get my hands on the uncut edition of 'Saw II' (2005) and, boy, was that a nasty entry in this horror series. But the third film, 'Saw III' is probably the best yet, following the first 'Saw' (2004).'Saw II' is probably the series low point, with part III bringing it (presumably) to a breathtaking close. James Wan directed the first 'Saw,' and Darren Lynn Bousman has been behind the camera for part II and part III. Leigh Whannell (Adam in the first 'Saw') wrote the screenplay for this third entry.Again like 'Saw II,' the infamous Jigsaw Killer (the ever-creepy Tobin Bell) is out in the open, and so is his young apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who survived a reverse bear-trap device in 'Saw' and whose true identity was revealed in 'Saw II'). This time, the terminally ill Jigsaw Killer has Amanda kidnap Doctor Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) to operate on the ailing killer. The twist is, Lynn has a bomb strapped to her head and in the event Jigsaw flat-lines or she's out of range, well, she won't be having anymore headaches.Lynn's horror story is paralleled with the plight of the vengeance-stricken Jeff (Angus MacFayden), whose young son was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Jigsaw has set up a tricks & traps funhouse that Jeff must make his way out of in two hours and in the process, face the demons of his vengeance. And thus, let the games begin.Of all the 'Saw' movies, 'Saw III' is the most reflective, often drawing on the past two films to advance its plot and wrap up shoddy details from those films. What I have always admired about the 'Saw' films is the excellent writing. If at all, I would just like to praise Whannell for one heck of a story. But the only thing that detracts from the 'Saw' movies is some of the haunted house elements and occasionally uneven writing.Like 'Saw' and 'Saw II,' 'Saw III' benefits from its tripped-out editing, trippy score, and cinematography. The tricks & traps scenarios the filmmakers present us with get nastier and more grisly with each movie. Tobin Bell has been the central figure of the last two movies and his creepy performance is likely to rank as some of the best work of a screen serial killer.It will be amazing if a fourth film is ever made.8/10",8,1,2,23 January 2007
Spirited Away," The real best picture of 2002
","Why is it that the Academy has such a difficult time giving awards to foreign films for the Best Picture category?  Being that 'Spirited Away' is an animated feature film from Japan and was directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is arguably the greatest animator alive, I am sure there was enough debate giving it a nomination.  Now that 'Spirited Away' won Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards this year, you get the feeling that perhaps this film was given the justice it deserved.  That said, 'Spirited Away' is a magnificent film.  I was totally blown away by it, as it was a lot better that I thought it would be.  The animation is beautiful, as that is always the case with Miyazaki films.  It's weird and funny, moving and touching.  It is certainly one of the best animated films I have ever seen and may very well be the best.  Well done, Miyazaki.10/10",10,0,2,19 April 2003
Pearl Harbor," I think there's a slight disagreement here...
","because I myself found 'Pearl Harbor' to be quite entertaining.  I'll admit that the first half of the movie is kind of slow and boring, but it gets better around the final twenty minutes leading up to the attack.  The actual attack was easily the best part of the movie.  It was amazingly shot and pulled off.  The love story I feel although it seriously messed up the movie in some spots, was necessary for the overall impact of the film.  The dialogue is kind of stupid too with lines like 'I'm not anxious to die, just anxious to matter', but I won't hold that against the movie.  I do agree with one previous comment about Michael Bay not being the right director for a movie about one of the biggest events of the 20th century.  That should have been done by either Steven Spielberg or Michael Mann, preferably Michael Mann.  I can't comment on the historical accuracy of the film since world history isn't one of my majors.  The ending was kind of stupid too now that I think about it.  One last thing, didn't Michael Bay do a film with a love story like the one in 'Pearl Harbor' three years ago?  I believe it was called 'Armageddon'.  Overall despite some of the film's stupidity and some serious bashings by critics, 'Pearl Harbor' is still a good film to watch and you'll probably see it at the Oscars next year.8/10",8,0,1,7 December 2001
The Usual Suspects," 'The Usual Suspects' is not the *Usual* mid-1990s crime-thriller...
","I have a strange history with the 1995 neo-noir crime-thriller 'The Usual Suspects.'I saw the film for the first time when I was in middle school; I remember being thoroughly impressed with the picture and I may (or may not) have rented it a few times from Blockbuster Video (I entered middle school in the late 1990s). And then I never really saw it again, but I do remember that 'The Usual Suspects' always stuck with me, even if 15 years has passed since I last saw it. And then on a whim, I watched the movie again today. My opinion has not changed on this movie at all, but today's viewing has only reaffirmed my glowing praise for this picture.The other reason that this movie stuck with me for so long was because this film made the reputation of its director, a then-29-year-old Bryan Singer. I came to know Bryan Singer through his work on the 'X-Men' movies - 'X-Men' (2000) and its superior sequel, 'X2' (2003). Although I won't go into the details why, I've long been a fan of the X-Men superhero team and I've long believed that Singer - through certain aspects of his personal background - was the perfect director for the first two films in that series and he brought those particular aspects of his personal background to make those films his own. That is something I'll always be thankful to him for, and 'X2' is my personal favorite film that he's ever done (if not necessarily his best).But still, let's go back to the film that started it all for Bryan Singer...Let me just say that I consider 'The Usual Suspects' to be the best crime-thriller of the '90s. Yes, I said it, 'The Usual Suspects' is even better than 'Pulp Fiction' (1994); while I like Quentin Tarantino, I've never truly liked 'Pulp Fiction' and have considered that to be Tarantino's weakest effort - yet Tarantino won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, so he obviously did something right. I don't think that it's any coincidence that a year after Tarantino won his first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his script for 'The Usual Suspects,' which I obviously feel is the better of the two. I've just found 'The Usual Suspects' to be far more inventive - and watchable - in its story and characters, and complex and involving story-line.'The Usual Suspects' is one of the most compelling, original, frightening, and (occasionally) blackly humorous thrillers ever made, with one of the greatest, and shocking, plot twists in cinematic history. The film begins in the aftermath of a mysterious ship explosion and firefight in San Pedro Bay in Los Angeles, California. The police arrest cripple and con man Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance here), who was only one of two survivors. While being interrogated by U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Kint reveals that six weeks earlier in New York City, he and four other small-time criminals - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt ex-cop who's since been trying to go straight; professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin); McManus's partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro); and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker and explosives expert - were arrested and interrogated by the New York City Police Department on trumped-up charges in connection to a gun shipment robbery.Kint goes on to further explain a rich and complicated back-story, in which the five of them enter into a series of complex criminal schemes that eventually brings the attention of a mysterious crime figure named 'Keyser Soze,' whose criminal exploits and ruthless reputation are so feared that he has earned a near-mythical status in the criminal underworld. It all leads to a shocking revelation of just who it is that's been pulling the five men's strings the whole time - Keyser Soze, or someone else?I have to admit that I loved every moment of 'The Usual Suspects.' This movie definitely earned every bit of praise heaped upon it by the mainstream and independent movie press upon its release in 1995; just as an aside, this film was released into theaters three days after my tenth birthday in 1995. Kevin Spacey earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor here in one of the great performances of the '90s. Though the work of the four principal actors cannot be discounted - Gabriel Byrne is by far the most sympathetic of the quintet as their de-facto, albeit highly reluctant, leader, Dean Keaton; Stephen Baldwin (whom I personally took the greatest liking to) as Michael McManus and this is probably his best-known film role before his career took a hit in the late '90s and early 2000s; Benicio Del Toro as the mangled-English-speaking Fred Fenster, who would go on to become an Oscar-winner himself in just a few short years (for 'Traffic' in 2000); and Kevin Pollak as the one true common-man of the group, Todd Hockney.Neo-noir crime-thrillers were big in the 1990s after 'Pulp Fiction' almost single-handedly reinvented the cinematic medium; 'The Usual Suspects,' with its gripping story and characters, and snappy dialogue, was the next (and arguably) greatest thing to come from that era. It's a brilliant, mesmerizing viewing experience from a film-making team that struck cinematic gold. And how can anyone not mention John Ottman's touching, occasionally brooding and mysterious film score? I just had to mention that also before I finally close this out.'The Usual Suspects' is certainly not your 'Usual' mid-1990s thriller...10/10",10,2,4,18 July 2015
Die Hard 2," More of the same, but still more fun with our favorite terrorist-busting detective
","It would be interesting to see if Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) ever has a normal day. Nah, that wouldn't be a whole lot of fun, now would it? We've been watching our hero bust up bad guys for nearly 20 years now, and with talks of another, fourth 'Die Hard' in the works, I think it would be nice to go back in time and watch his past exploits, like 1990's 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder.'John McTiernan directed 1988's 'Die Hard' and rocketed wild-card star Willis to fame in an iconic action role. McTiernan's gone for now, and up at the helm this time is Finnish blood-maestro Renny Harlin (whose future clinchers 'Cliffhanger,' 'The Long Kiss Goodnight,' and 'Deep Blue Sea' would later cement the director's reputation in Hollywood).The film is basically a repeat of its predecessor, going as much as to reuse some of that film's plot devices and mechanics to structure its own fast-paced story line. On a snowy Christmas Eve night, not a creature was stirring... okay, not quite accurate, but it's a good start for a review, even though the events are on Christmas and a blinding snowstorm is rapidly approaching the metropolitan area.At Dulles International Airport, where Detective McClane is patiently awaiting the arrival of wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), terrorists led by the ousted military colonel Stuart (William Sadler) lay siege not with guns, but by crippling the airport's landing system so they no longer have control of their incoming flights. Col. Stuart's meticulous plan is a jail break: deposed drug lord Gen. Esperanza (Franco Nero) is on one of Dulles's special Christmas Eve flights, and by disabling their guidance-landing systems and using their own equipment, they're going to spring him free and then head to a tropical paradise with no extradition treaties.Over Dulles, however, many planes are circling and have nothing to do except wait. Those with enough fuel are sent to alternate airports but there are still many overhead, and running out of fuel. With Holly on one incoming flight, what's John to do? The terrorists don't care of course, except getting their cargo.Only one thing stands in the terrorists way, and that is our hero John McClane, who must also deal with D.C. bureaucrats including a pre-'NYPD Blue' Dennis Franz as an airport security chief and Fred Dalton Thompson as air-traffic controller Trudeau. John does eventually find some aid with Leslie Barns (Art Evans) though. Reginald VelJohnson reprises his role as Sgt. Al Powell (in what is essentially a five-minute cameo) and William Atherton is back as arrogant news reporter Richard Thornburg, who's also trapped on a plane with Holly.For his rogue gallery here, director Harlin (working from Walter Wager's novel '58 Minutes'), has assembled a flawed but capable production that has a stronger emphasis on action scenes rather than plot. In 'Die Hard,' McClane was an Everyman caught in a not-so-everyday predicament and had to rely on his wits to stay alive, and a lot of the action was spare and took place in confined, claustrophobic areas. We don't have much of that here, as his character has pretty much been reduced to a generic trash-talking, one-liner-spewing archetype who's able to dodge the many bullets fired in his direction without much trouble. But he's still a pretty cool guy, though.The bad guys, corrupt military officials, aren't all that frightening or intimidating either, though Col. Stuart does seem to peak in sly villainy during one particularly disturbing and explosive sequence of 'lessons.' (This scene alone is probably why 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' is on the FAA's 'no-play' list of many in-flight movies.) Eventually, Washington brings in Maj. Grant (John Amos) and his men to come and deal with the crooked military terrorists. And lastly, you should also be on the look out for a pre-T-1000 Robert Patrick and comedian John Leguizamo in small parts as Col. Stuart's henchmen.'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' isn't a failure but is a worthy sequel to its landmark predecessor. It's bigger, bloodier, and much louder than 'Die Hard.' But the tag line's not lying: this sequel 'dies harder.'8/10",8,1,4,11 December 2005
Resident Evil," Well done horror film
","'Resident Evil' which is the highly anticipated big screen adaptation of the popular video game series of the same name, is a very well done horror film. The story surrounds a rescue team that is sent to a large underground facility to find out the cause of a mysterious accident that occurred there. When they first arrive, they discover three survivors: a young woman (Milla Jovovich) who is suffering from amnesia and whose name I don't think is ever mentioned, a guy named Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be a cop, and another guy named Spence (James Purefoy).  When they finally get into the Hive, which is the name of the large underground facility, they discover that no one is there, or so it seems.  Soon the team members begin getting picked off one at a time by bloodthirsty zombies, mutated dogs, and a hideous monstrosity that has an incredibly long tongue. 
I must say that this film is above all things, very entertaining.  I've never played the video games the film was based on, so I really can't be sure how accurate the movie is.  The acting is all right, but it isn't good nor is it bad.  The movie does maintain a constant level of creepiness, which is good.  I must say that 'Resident Evil' does keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  NOTE: One thing I do want to point out to gore fans is that this movie is no where near as gory as you may think it is.  I was pretty disappointed by that.  I mean a zombie movie, especially one like 'Resident Evil' should be dripping with bloody violence and gore, but it isn't.    I really like the fact that Paul Anderson (who directed another movie adaptation of a popular video game, 'Mortal Kombat', as well as a previous horror film 'Event Horizon') directed this film.  I love both of those movies.  I really don't see why so many people hated 'Mortal Kombat'.  That is probably the only movie adaptation of a video game that up until this film, is really worth watching.  'Event Horizon' while it wasn't a perfect horror film, should have almost certainly pleased any sci-fi fan.  That was a creepy movie right there, despite its flaws.  However, where 'Event Horizon' failed as a horror movie, Paul Anderson makes up for it here in 'Resident Evil'. A lot people claim that Milla Jovovich is hot (seeing that she reveals almost everything in this movie is worth the $20 for the DVD), but I don't really think she's that hot.  Personally, I prefer Michelle Rodriguez over her any day.",10,0,1,2 August 2002
Independence Day," Probably the greatest alien-invasion epic ever made
","'Independence Day' is quite possibly the biggest and greatest alien-invasion film ever made (and is also responsible for re-igniting the disaster movie craze of the late 1990s), and I mean that literally. Its budget, its Oscar-winning special effects, its blockbuster status as the highest-grossing movie of 1996 - yeah, all in all, 'Independence Day' is a big movie, a really big movie. It has a plot that is somewhat of a modern-day revisionist update of H.G. Wells's turn-of-the-century alien invasion epic 'The War of the Worlds.' It also has an all-star cast consisting of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox, and Randy Quaid. When massive 15-mile wide alien spaceships darken the skies over the world's major cities, the people of planet Earth are caught in spectacle. But wonder turns to out-right terror when the alien ships begin raining down destructive beams all over the major cities and killing millions in the process. Why do they do it? They're after our natural resources, we learn; they just want to wipe us out first to make it easier for them to get what they want and leave. The plot isn't the best or even the most original aspect of this movie; that's not the point. What master of disaster director Roland Emmerich wants to deliver is special effects, awesome scenes of extraterrestrial destruction, and action scenes detailing humanity's brave fight back against the technologically superior alien menace. 'Independence Day,' for the longest time, was my favorite movie of all time; I lived and breathed it. All I could talk and think about was 'Independence Day,' and I'm not sure how or why I didn't wear out my VHS tape from so many repeated viewings. 15 years later, this movie is still as thrilling and entertaining as it ever was. Is the movie really rah-rah go-it-alone American patriotism? I have no idea, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't care, and I'M an American. All I care about is the alien invasion and humanity's desperate struggle to fight back. I could care less if it's patriotism before 9/11 made uber-patriotism the hot new thing to be in America. And oh yeah, 'Independence Day,' as its title would imply, is set over the course of the American Fourth of July weekend. Oh, well. Regardless, 'Independence Day' still rocks, big-time! And get ready for those fireworks at the end!10/10",10,1,4,25 March 2011
Alien vs. Predator," It took 14 years...
","...Before a possible showdown between the iconic monsters of 'Alien' and 'Predator' would occur, when they would cross paths on screen and battle to the death. There's a scene in 'Predator 2' that occurs towards the end of the film, where Lt. Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) ventures into the Predator spaceship and accidentally stumbles onto the alien hunter's trophy room, and neatly placed towards the back amongst the various awards, was an alien skull. Those 10 seconds of film spawned over a decade's worth of rumors that one day these titans were going to go at it head-to-head, and that whoever won, we'd lose.As a fan of both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises, I've been looking forward to 'Alien Vs. Predator' for a long time, since that historic scene. I've admired the two monsters for years, collecting all kinds of memorabilia, including books and action figures; you name it, I've probably seen it.With 'Alien Vs. Predator,' director Paul W.S. Anderson has achieved something of a mixed bag. Undoubtedly critics will balk early into the film. They'll pick apart its MTV-style editing, bad pacing, and lack of spirit of a genuine 'Alien' or 'Predator' film. Die-hards will balk at Anderson's direction and the fact that he was even allowed near the film.I had fun watching it, despite some inconsistencies regarding our two iconic monsters who like to either use humans as hosts for more of their hideous offspring, or trophies which can be displayed in their intergalactic showroom of skulls.The story is that a massive, ancient Aztec/Egyptian/Mayan temple has been discovered deep below the surface of the Antarctic, and Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen of 'Aliens') has assembled a team of the world's best archaeologists, which includes Alexa 'Lex' Woods (Sanaa Lathan, who convincingly fills in the tough female role), Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova) and Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner) to accompany him in investigating it. But wouldn't you know it? They're not alone in this gargantuan maze of dark tunnels and ever-changing structures, and that a trio of Predators have come there to hunt rapidly reproducing Xenomorphs.Well, I can tell anyone that the powers-that-be in Hollywood and at Twentieth Century Fox played heavily into the film's mixed bag treatment. If the movie fails, I'd blame constant executive and studio interference - the b*****ds in suits who decide they want to cater to teenage fanboys instead of the largely adult fan base that this film was originally built on. In doing so, they opt for action over story, more importantly, $$$ over artistic vision.Anderson has remained faithful in preserving the essence of both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises by casting no-name performers to combat the extraterrestrial foes, and by emphasizing ideas over action and special effects. On a sour, angrier note, the gorehounds will be sorely disappointed, since executives at Fox toned down the violence considerably as to release it with a 'PG-13' rating, as to rake in every penny. Of course, that 'PG-13' rating doesn't stop us from getting quick edits (read: no gore) of chestbursting sequences, facehuggings, and people being mercilessly slaughtered by the Predators.I had faith that Paul W.S. Anderson wouldn't let me down long before I even saw the film; he doesn't, but I have a feeling that his film is destined for the same fate as David Fincher and his film 'Alien 3' - that it will go down in infamy and only years after the director has disowned the film and controversy is still brewing, that the true vision of 'Alien Vs. Predator' will surface and will finally earn the respect owed to it.7/10",7,165,313,14 August 2004
District 9," Hands down, the finest sci-fi film since 'Children of Men' (2006); also, it's what 'Alien Nation' (1988) could have been...
","You read my summary correct, folks: 'District 9' is the finest sci-fi film I've seen since 'Children of Men' (2006). Now why is that astounding? Because the genre of science fiction, while well-known for its occasional brilliance, is also rife with movies that are just flat-out terrible. Science fiction is a genre that takes both intelligence and originality combined with some impeccable skill to truly master. Of course, not every sci-fi film can be 'Star Wars' (1977) or 'Blade Runner' (1982). Likewise, not everybody can be George Lucas or Ridley Scott.That is where 'District 9' comes in, so far the best movie I've seen this year.Since 'Children of Men' depicted a future in which mankind was on the verge of extinction due to a worldwide infertility pandemic, the movie skillfully made a case for humanity to survive despite our past atrocities against each other. Here in 'District 9,' humanity is again seen at its absolute worst, because we have reverted back to one of our most basic, cruelest instincts: our ability to hate.What I just typed means to suggest that 'District 9,' as a science fiction/action film, may very well be one of the most socially conscious sci-fi pictures ever made. 'Alien Nation' (1988) had almost the exact same set-up as this film; I DID like that film, BTW. But where it went wrong was in the way it backtracked on its principles of how we treat each other just when things started getting interesting. What started out as a sly social commentary on how human beings will react to an extraterrestrial race's integration into the human populace, devolved into a standard buddy-cop movie with a slight, slight hint of social commentary.In 'District 9,' it's been over 20 years since an alien ship washed ashore on Earth, settling over the skies of Johannesburg, South Africa. Now for all of us history buffs, the significance of South Africa as this film's setting is not a random, isolated incident: South Africa has one of the worst civil-rights histories of any nation in the industrialized world, due largely to their government's apartheid policies that kept the native majority black African population oppressed under a white minority for over 40 years and those policies were only just abolished 15 years ago (as of this writing).The alien creatures, derisively nicknamed 'prawns' due to their appearance which is a combination of insect-iod and sea crustacean, in 'District 9' could of course be seen as a stand-in for any oppressed people or immigration population. What's most disturbing about this set-up is that formerly oppressed black South Africans are amongst those speaking negatively against the prawns, that they live like animals and that they should go home (how they're supposed to do that exactly is never explained by the South African people) - they're partial to eating cat food - in District 9's crowded, run-down slums, of which could very easily be seen as any ghetto - from South Central L.A. to the Bronx to, well, Johannesburg, South Africa - which is of course ruled by a strong military/police presence.Things get underway in a mock-u-mentary-/documentary-style fashion involving the promotion of a hapless tool named Wikus van de Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) from corporate office drone to field manager overseeing the relocation of the prawns from District 9 to a new home 240 kilometers away. Wikus is not your typical action movie hero; he demonstrates fairly early in the picture during the raids that he is in fact a coward, and only with his newfound status as relocation manager does he really seem to have any sense of power and authority over another life, human or alien. Without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus comes into contact with some potent alien bio-technology that quickly makes him an enemy of the state, and he is forced to go on the run into District 9 to evade his captors. It is here that he soon comes to discover, much to his horror, that he may very well be the only thing stopping a full-scale Earthbound intergalactic conflict between Us and Them, but more accurately, Their systematic annihilation by the powers-that-be in Johannesburg. And only then does he seem to make a gradual transition from coward to (marginal) hero.Peter Jackson ('The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) produced it, but the real strength of this picture lies within the watchful, socially conscious eye of director Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp makes no attempt to hide the strong parallels between the events of 'District 9' and human society. The allegory is pretty in-your-face, but the movie does not bog itself down too much in its real-life parallels. Instead, he plays on our emotions - he makes us feel for the prawns, no matter how disgusting they may appear to be, and their conditions, and to a lesser extent Wikus - and also lets us have it with some explosively violent action sequences in the last quarter of the film, all undercut with some sly, and pretty damn funny, social satire.Just as I wrote two years ago about 'Children of Men,' 'District 9' may yet be another link in the chain that will pull science fiction out of the gutter. This is by far the must-see sci-fi movie to see so far this century. I was genuinely moved by this picture, not just by its action sequences, but by the message, about our cruelest, basest instincts, and it's these qualities that makes Them far more sympathetic than Us. All I can say is that I'm glad I had the opportunity to see this film today, of all days.10/10",10,6,12,17 August 2009
Batman Begins," It Begins...
","'Batman Begins' is the long-awaited screen return of the Caped Crusader, whose last outing in 'Batman & Robin' (1997) met with disastrous results. Here, the DC Comics titan of the title is given a fresh start by director Christopher Nolan ('Memento,' 'Insomnia') and a new (albeit) unlikely face to boot - Christian Bale. Nolan's (mostly) brilliant film is an exercise of sheer timing and is something that even the most devout of 'Batman' purists can (finally) appreciate.Tim Burton's 1989 film adaptation of the 'Batman' legend returned the character to the darker, grittier, more noirish origins Bob Kane had envisioned, and is perhaps the best screen vision of the Dark Knight. The Gotham City in that picture was a decaying metropolis that was overrun with crime and corruption, and though many decried the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, he nonetheless fit the bill perfectly by exuding the moodiness and torment of the character he was playing.Burton's film was something extraordinary in the making as well, being that it was influenced greatly by the works of Frank Miller, namely 'The Dark Knight Returns' and 'Year One,' both of which apparently also played a hand into Nolan's picture. But since 'Batman Begins' takes place before Burton's films (and Nolan's vision discards that arc entirely), any comparisons are void and a waste of time and therefore, it must be judged on its own merits.To me, Batman is the most mythical and mysterious of superheroes, being he's a playboy and a brilliant philanthropist but suffers from deep psychological issues and is missing a few screws from an otherwise well-oiled machine. That quality of mysticism, to me, is at the heart of this dark and mysterious character known as the Batman, who 'would have to be some kind of a freak to go out at night dressed up as a bat.'Nolan's film dives right into the character of Bruce Wayne and his metamorphosis into the Dark Knight of Gotham City. As the film opens, we see Wayne (played wonderfully by Bale) is being held prisoner by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and his minions. Recognizing the anger festering inside him, Ducard appoints himself Wayne's mentor and begins training him for his (not yet realized) destiny.Years have passed since Bruce left Gotham City to travel the globe, never to return, after his parents were murdered and the man responsible was executed outside the courthouse. While here, he enters into harsh training with the League of Shadows, a band of stealth vigilante ninjas who have an apparent organization all over the world, not just in the mountains of Asia.But when Bruce draws a line between being judge and executioner, he becomes a marked man by the League, and makes mortal enemies out of Ducard and the group's leader Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Meanwhile in Gotham, things have gotten steadily worse since Bruce forced himself into exile away from the city. On the business front, Bruce must contend with a ruthless corporate raider (Rutger Hauer), and a powerful gangster named Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) controls the city's central criminal elements and assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) - who's also a childhood friend of Bruce - is trying her best to find a way to have him incarcerated.Falcone's wave of terror, however, is mere child's play compared to the scheme being orchestrated by corrupt Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), who moonlights as a hooded maniac called 'the Scarecrow' and is unearthing plans to contaminate Gotham's water supply with a powerful hallucinogenic drug that when vaporized and inhaled, will drive the denizens of the crime-ridden Narrows insane and then they'll begin to tear the city apart. When it becomes apparent that Crane is not working alone in his devious plans and that he is merely a pawn being used by a mysterious third party, Bruce is forced to spring into action as Batman.'Batman Begins,' put simply, is a comic book fan's dream; I don't have any other way to describe it. Like last year's 'Spider-Man 2,' a lot more is done right than wrong. Nolan's film exhibits all of the best qualities of the Dark Knight by shying away from any camp elements and creating a vision that's not only bold and faithful to its source material (and most rabid of fans), but is also quite scary. I guess that I should also make it clear that this is by no means a children's movie, despite its now-kid-friendly 'PG-13' rating.When Wayne first dawns the Batsuit, he's quite naturally clumsy, so it takes him a while to get used to it. And of course with the help of his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), weapons designer Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who first introduces us to the bad-ass Batmobile that would make Hummer and Cadillac both blush with envy, and the only honest cop left in Gotham City - James Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman is able to restore some order to the city.Christian Bale is cast amazingly well, almost surely joining the ranks of Keaton, who without any bias is my preferred choice for the role of the Dark Knight. Bale is cool when he has to be playboy Bruce, but when it comes time for action in the Batsuit, he takes on a whole new dimension. This is the first film of Christopher Nolan's that I've truly liked, and his direction here is standout, making this Batman that much more brooding and haunted. He also effectively cast much of Gotham in impenetrable shadows, thus making it the most distinct place of any movie today and almost making it impossible to see what's in that alley some character is walking into.'Batman Begins' is not your father's Batman, and that's a good thing. It's a triumph of timing and skill, and as the film's ending would have it, sequels are most definitely on the way.10/10",10,1,2,18 June 2005
The Fault in Our Stars," A near-perfect 'Fault'
","In our current 2014 Hollywood wasteland of an endless barrage of big-budget superhero movies (of which I'm a sucker for), Hollywood's other big obsession seems to be adaptations of popular teen novels. Earlier this year, I was gosh-wowed by 'The Spectacular Now' (2013). Now I've just sat down and watched 'The Fault in Our Stars.'I just needed a break from the big-budget superhero movie hoopla, you know? 'The Fault in Our Stars' was a perfect distraction until 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014) is released on DVD tomorrow. I've been eager to watch 'The Fault in Our Stars' for some time now, and let me say that I wasn't disappointed. I knew what the story was about, and wasn't disappointed by the final result. I was thoroughly pleased by this teen love story that like a lot of teen movies of late, invents its own language, lingo, and philosophical outlook on life as it goes along.Adapted from the book by John Green (which I intend to begin reading later on this afternoon) and admirably directed by Josh Boone, 'The Fault in Our Stars' tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus 'Gus' Waters (Ansel Elgort), two teenagers who meet in a support group for teen cancer patients. Gus is a survivor fully intent on living a life worth remembering, but Hazel is battling terminal stage IV lung cancer, and knows that her time is finite (after being granted a few extra years via an experimental cancer treatment) - while being cared for by her loving parents Frannie (Laura Dern) and Michael (Sam Trammell). Over time, however, Hazel and Gus develop a close friendship that gradually blossoms into a full-blown romance. And somewhere in there, too, these two also learn to fulfill their greatest dreams and aspirations.One of the key reasons I was so eager to watch this film is because I have personal experience with the film's subject matter - which is life with cancer: I lost my mother earlier this year to lung cancer, and in the remaining two weeks of her life, which were spent in the hospital, I visited her everyday and in her final moments, I did my best to make it clear to her that she was the greatest mom her only 29-year-old son could ever ask for. This was something I hoped I would not have to deal with until much later on in my life, but you never know what curve-balls the universe is going to throw at you. And I've moved on quite quickly and easily from the grief of having lost her so soon and so suddenly.Getting back to the film, of all the teen romance novels made into films over the last few years, this is the one that appears to have struck a chord with me the most. I couldn't help but feel that both Hazel and Gus are such strong, positive characters - making the most of whatever time they've got together and having no regrets about anything they do. Shailene Woodley appears to have an amazing future ahead of her in the movies, if only she can get past her persistent casting in adaptations of teen novels. She was quite amazing in this picture, as was her co-star Ansel Elgort, whom I've never heard of before, but he was quite phenomenal in his acting performance here. I admired his upbeat demeanor and humor and the way he was able to keep Hazel on her toes constantly during the course of their romance. But like life, 'The Fault in Our Stars' throws us a curve-ball an hour-and-a-half into the picture.I knew that this movie was going to end the way that it did, but I was not expecting the curve-ball it does end up throwing at us - it's something that truly catches you off-guard and comes straight out of left field, and makes you think about the special kind of cruelty that's dealt by the stars to some people in this life. But what's most admirable here is the way the two teens deal with it, with hope and humor - rather than gloom and despair.I'm glad that I had the chance to watch 'The Fault in Our Stars.' I'm sure I'm going to love John Green's book. Right now, I'm listening to the soundtrack, which is also worthy of special mention here. I'm not a fan of any of the artists on it - it's largely, mostly a mix of indie musicians I've never heard of (with the sole exception of Charli XCX and her song 'Boom Clap,' which I honestly can't stop playing) - but it fits the film perfectly. Many of the songs came from Josh Boone's personal music collection (while others made themselves known over the course of the film's editing process), and I can find no fault with his choices. It's equally as amazing as the film that inspired them.Keep playing Charli XCX's 'Boom Clap' like there's no tomorrow (which is what I'm doing)!!!10/10",10,0,1,8 December 2014
Twilight," Not a new fan... sorry, folks
","I'm a 24-year-old male.'Twilight' is a very strange movie. The notion of vampires falling in love with humans is nothing new; just think of Bram Stoker's timeless classic 'Dracula.' But 'Twilight' is nowhere near the Gothic horror and romance of ye old 'Dracula'; it's just cheesy pop romance for hormonally charged teens and young adults who think that all vampires have to look like they just stepped out of 'GQ.''Twilight' is still a very strange movie to me, and I'm not a new fan of the films or the books by Stephenie Meyer that inspired them. Now usually, I'm a sucker for romance stuff, even though I primarily like to watch action, sci-fi, and horror movies. (For the record, I like all movies, but those three are my primary interests.) So why did I find it so hard to even find an iota of any positive qualities to really like in this movie?For the most part, I just thought the whole thing was pretty cheesy, but what can you expect from a series of young adult novels? The story involves two loner/weirdos coming together and falling in love. I was a bit of a loner/weirdo in high school, so I should have gravitated straight toward this movie, but alas that didn't happen. (My computer-nerd friends also hate these movies.) 'Twilight' involves the social transplant of the socially awkward Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) to a Pacific Northwest town that is perpetually swamped in clouds of darkness.At her new school, she meets the hunkish, Emo-ish, pale-skinned would-be 'GQ' model Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). He isn't all that welcoming toward her, but since they sit next to each other in biology class, they have to work together if they want to make the grade. Their relationship continues to grow and eventually blossoms into a tentative romance. In case the 'big twist' has somehow escaped you (how is that even possible with this movie?), the reason Edward was initially so distant toward Bella is because he's a vampire.But he's not just any vampire. He comes from a family of vampires who are 'vampiric vegetarians,' meaning that they have sworn off human blood in favor of the local wildlife. You see, even though he's sworn off meat, he's still fighting with every inch of his being to not make Bella his next meal. Pretty soon the two are parading around school, holding hands and showing off how much they're in love with each other. Meanwhile, Bella's cop father (Billy Burke) is investigating several vicious animal attacks that have been plaguing the area recently. Of course, there's no 'big twist' or mystery here either; a trio of rebellious young bloodsuckers have turned the woods in and around town into their own personal hunting ground and when they get wind that human Bella is being protected by Edward and his family, their leader James (Cam Gigandet) makes it his personal mission to sink his teeth into Bella's neck at any cost.Regardless of how cheesy I think this movie is, it looks fantastic, like an actual Gothic horror movie (everything is drenched in an icy-blue hue), and is competently directed by Catherine Hardwicke ('Thirteen'). A lot of the dialogue is pretty hokey, and doesn't really extend beyond the type of stuff you'd probably read about in any run-of-the-mill teen romance novel. The young cast including the strangely attractive Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson perfectly fit their roles, even though they are by no means great actors here. Still, they're just so pretty! Everyone in this cast looks so young and pretty - everything a hormonally charged youth could ever look for in a movie like this.The main problem that I have with 'Twilight' and other vampire movies/shows that present sexy-looking vampires is that they seem to trample on the legacy put forth by previous vampire movies. They all think vampires need to look like 'GQ' models. In other words, they're no longer something to fear; they're something for young girls to swoon over - hence, all the female attention aimed at Robert Pattinson and his face on the cover of EVERY teen magazine you could think of. That's why my favorite of the old-school horror movie monsters were always werewolves. They were always the most grungy and sympathetic of all the old-school movie monsters. (For the record, I'm not looking forward to 'The Wolfman' in a few weeks. Give me 'The Wolf Man' or 'An American Werewolf in London' any day, preferably my all-time favorite werewolf movie 'An American Werewolf in London.')I'm also not a fan of how 'Twilight' tramples all over ancient vampire mythology. Of course I'm talking about vampires that can go out in the daylight, vampires that sparkle & glisten when the sun shines on them, vampires that can run like the wind through the woods, vampires that can climb trees like Spider-Man, and vampires that HAVE ('have' is italicized) a reflection in the mirror. I can buy the vampires not drinking human blood, fine, but all the other stuff - no way - it's just way too much trampling all over well-established vampire lore, and, remember, vampires aren't my favorite of the old-school movie monsters.I'm not a new fan of 'Twilight.' (My friends aren't either.) I am glad that I finally got to see what all the hoopla was about. It's really nothing to get all hyped up over.5/10P.S.: The greatest vampire movie of 2008 was the Swedish import 'Let the Right One In.'",5,0,2,29 January 2010
The Princess Bride," My favorite fantasy
","Let me say that 'The Princess Bride' is probably the best fairy tale presented on screen since John Boorman's 'Excalibur' (1981). Of course there's been plenty of other's I've left out, but this all just squarely my opinion. William Goldman seemed to really have a ball writing the book the film is based off, as well as the screenplay. Rob Reiner directs, much in the same league as 'Stand By Me' the previous year, with some pretty hard laughs. But what gets me loving this picture so much is the portrayal of true love. Let me explain: I've never had a girlfriend, which allows me to relate to the main character and his experiences in a number of ways: Westley (Cary Elwes) is the 'farm boy' for the lovely Buttercup (Robin Wright), who takes nearly every opportunity to insult him and realizes one day, out of the blue, she loves him. But Westley journeys across the ocean to collect a fortune and is attacked by pirates and presumed killed in the fray. Buttercup sinks to the lowest level of grief, and finds companionship with arrogant Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), who forces her into an unwilling marriage. But a mysterious figure known only as the Dread Pirate Roberts (could it be Westley in disguise?) appears on the scene and along with two others including the vengeance-driven Spanish fencer Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and the towering Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant), they seek to rescue Buttercup. 'The Princess Bride' is pure fun from start to finish, and the cast (what a cast - many of whom are American - faking their best European accents) seems to be having a ball. But love is what is at the center, and that's what I find the most impressive. Every classic fairy tale has such qualities and 'The Princess Bride' satirizes each trait and then some more. A classic, lovely story, 'The Princess Bride.'10/10",10,2,3,16 June 2006
Saving Private Ryan," War is hell after all...
","It seemed impossible (or was it inevitable?), but director Steven Spielberg did the unthinkable: he made a war movie. The creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like 'E.T. the Extraterrestrial' (1982) or 'Hook' (1991) and who had ventured into more mature territory with 'Schindler's List' (1993) made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the World War II conflict. We know how personal WWII is to Spielberg (especially to anyone who's seen 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' - he just loves to stick it those diabolical Nazis, or the aforementioned 'Schindler's List'), but after seeing 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), our assertions at just HOW personal it is to him are revealed. Opening on D-Day (June 6, 1944) at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day. We watch in horror as one after one, Allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the Germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them. In the middle of the chaos, is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), as he leads his men from the sandy, bullet and body-riddled beach up to the top of the hill. In the scenes that follow, Spielberg is unflinching as we see American soldiers as well Germans become the casualties of history's costliest conflict. The movie doesn't end there; it's only the beginning and the main plot of the film, which is supposedly based on a true story, takes shape. It turns out, that an American mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day, each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the D-Day invasion. But there is hope: her fourth son, a paratrooper, the eponymous Private Ryan (Matt Damon, in what could essentially be considered a cameo) of the film's title, survived. The problem is, he's located deep behind enemy lines, and it'll take a small squad of American soldiers to bring him home, as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front. Miller leads his squad, which includes Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and the unproven translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), deep into the French countryside to rescue Private Ryan and bring him home. It should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through. I remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how WWII veterans who were at D-Day had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle. But still, that is its goal: 'Saving Private Ryan' is the most realistic, gritty, and horrifically violent war movie I've ever seen. It does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas (patriotic flag-waving, one-dimensional soldiers, one-sided portraits of the enemy, no battle-related carnage, etc.) that haunted many WWII films made during the '50s and '60s; contrary to some reviews, none of this goes on in this film. The film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the WWII battle, and the cost it waged on them. The performances are flawless, as Spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved. The action, if you can sit through it, will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is. It should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of 'Saving Private Ryan,' but they can't ever live up to its originality and raw intensity. 'Saving Private Ryan' is Spielberg's WWII masterpiece, and is my favorite war movie. It's no wonder Spielberg was voted #1 director of all time; this film proves why.10/10",10,4,7,28 June 2005
The Transporter," A few bumps mar an otherwise decent outing in 'The Transporter'
","There's no question that Luc Besson is one of Europe's biggest action producers. I mean with the cult classics 'La Femme Nikita' (1991) and 'The Professional' (1994) behind him, he's basically been given the green-light for every big action picture he comes across. One of his latest and most ambitious projects was 'The Transporter,' released in 2002.I have to admit this is one flick I approached with a very open mind - very open. I mean, I like Jason Statham. I think he's a pretty cool guy and at first, even I questioned his casting as Frank Martin in 'The Transporter.' But the problem is, and I'm assuming this is the result of the quickly edited action scenes (which were toned down to make the film 'PG-13'), he's not being given the room to really be the best he can be.As the lead character, he's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW.It's not spoiling much that she and Frank get together and as a result, are forced to do battle with shady and vicious American businessman Wall Street (Matt Schulze) and his army of high-kicking, disposable assassins. There's a little more to the plot and Lai, and the circumstances surrounding her appearance in the trunk of Frank's car, and it involves some smuggling of poor Chinese immigrants from China to Europe, where much of the action takes place.Speaking of action and there's plenty of it, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences. Director Corey Yuen (whose work on Jet Li's 2001 action film 'Kiss of the Dragon' I admired), is behind it and Besson's got a producer credit.The problem may not be Statham because I think he's a really cool actor with a raspy British accent, but the script is worth some deeper examination by more thoughtful minds. There are plenty of holes and unanswered questions (i.e., the extent of Frank's military training and experiences, Lai and how she wound up with Frank and her quarrelsome relationship with her father who is played by Ric Young, and the plot with the Chinese smuggling).But why am I making such complaints? 'The Transporter' is an action movie; no plot required. Despite some bumps in the road, 'The Transporter' is pure action fun from beginning to end, and I got my free ticket to see 'The Transporter 2' on Friday.7/10",7,31,42,31 August 2005
1941," This Movie Rocks!
","I love this movie!  1941 is about the hysteria that gripped southern California shortly after the attack at Pearl Harbor.  It mostly surrounds the vignettes of about six or seven groups of people all in one night: a loser-type guy tries to get with his girl, Tim Matheson tries to get with Nancy Allen in a plane, a crazed pilot(John Belushi) dreams of nothing but shooting down Japanese planes, two guys and a dummy sit at the top of a ferris wheel overlooking the ocean in order to spot Japanese submarines, a bunch of guys led by Dan Aykroyd in a tank, Ned Beatty is an elderly guy who tries to defend his ocean side home with what I think is an anti-aircraft gun, and lastly the Japanese themselves as they try to find something 'honorable' to destroy.  This movie is hilarious.  It's a shame that director Steven Spielberg said that this is his worst movie and it only got three Oscar nominations.  I mean, at least '1941' is better than some of his more overrated tripe like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jaws(not too overrated, but too many people draw comparisons) and the completely idiotic E.T.  Don't get me wrong.  Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors and he's made some pretty good movies like Saving Private Ryan(the best war movie), Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I haven't seen A.I. yet but it looks good, the criminally underrated Amistad and the almost completely forgotten The Color Purple(his best movie).",10,21,43,9 November 2001
Revolutionary Road," 'Revolutionary Road' - Leo and Kate on the screen together again...
","I believe that it was in early 2008 that I heard that a new film was coming out that would be pairing stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on the screen together again, 11 years after they were the king and queen of the world in 'Titanic' (1997). That long wait happens again in the 2008 film 'Revolutionary Road.'Now I'm a guy and I'm a sucker for romances, so that when I heard that the power-couple of 'Titanic' were teaming up again for a new film due out later in 2008, you can bet that I waited with eager anticipation to see this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, in all likelihood, made film history with 'Titanic' by becoming probably the new Hollywood screen couple. And while the two are together again in the Sam Mendes-directed 'Revolutionary Road,' they are very much the complete opposite of the characters they made famous 11 years prior in 'Titanic.''Revolutionary Road' is an adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, and concerns the Wheeler family, spear-headed by Frank (DiCaprio) and his wife April (Winslet), who live with their two children in a lovely New York suburb. Remembering that the two are the opposites of the characters they portrayed in 1997, their marriage is very much on the rocks from the opening moments. Set in 1955, they live a picturesque life as a picturesque, perfect American couple, you know, the type of unique American family that all the rest of American families should try to be like.Things couldn't be any more farther removed from the truth.Frank hates his job as a lowly tech salesperson, and has often dreamed of better things in life. April is pretty much the ideal housewife who does the incredibly simple task of making a decent home life for her family. April soon comes up with the idea that in order to get what they both want out of life, that it would be nice to move to Paris, France, and try to start over. She'll get a job as a secretary, she says, while Frank will stay at home with the kids and try to figure things out. It's a lovely dream, but a highly unrealistic one, and soon numerous factors (internal as well as external) come out that threaten to tear this already faulty family unit apart.Now, I'm not one to really jump on the bandwagon of the latest Hollywood flick that's primed to sweep the Oscars. However, I found 'Revolutionary Road' to be something that is a little bit higher than the usual Hollywood drivel. I found the missing link in most Hollywood pictures purely in the star-power of the two lead performers. It was a sight to see DiCaprio and Winslet together again. (I might as well as proclaim them as my ultimate, favorite screen couple.) That they're together again under different circumstances and playing vastly different characters than the ones they immortalized in 'Titanic' is part of the experience. I found their characters to be brutally honest about themselves and inherently imperfect, but full-blooded and really life-like; essentially, they're real people here.I like Leonardo DiCaprio. He is one of my favorite actors. He has shaped up in the time since 'Titanic' to become one of the film community's most versatile and talented performers; he is no longer the 'King of the World' boy-toy he was in 'Titanic's' hey-day. (When is this man going to win an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe?) Kate Winslet proved to be the real winner here, since she won a Golden Globe for her performance here (as well as an Oscar for 'The Reader,' which I haven't seen, but I say she should have won it for this film, too). Her performance is honest to begin with, but halfway through takes a turn down a much darker route that was totally unforeseeable by anyone in the audience.'Revolutionary Road' is a real movie, a real movie that is full-blooded and smart. I should have said this way earlier, but I had to watch the film for a college class recently, and it was my first time seeing it. I have no idea how I missed this movie while it was in the theaters. But I was glad I had the grand opportunity to see what was one of the best - if not the best - drama films of 2008.10/10",10,0,0,20 February 2010
28 Days Later...," '28 Days Later...' we're still here and we're still scared...
","...And like the so-called 'rage' virus that is the main antagonist in this British horror film, '28 Days Later...' surprised American audiences with its frightening and visionary premise of the world being overrun by a virus, and even though this scenario is not new to the movie-going public, the ideas presented in this film are.Beginning with a small band of animal-rights activists who break into a laboratory to free some monkeys, the film quickly goes into overdrive in depicting the horror that is released with them as a result: the monkeys had been infected with a virus that turns its victims into raving, homicidal maniacs. The virus soon gets out and pretty much decimates the entire population of London.'28 Days Later,' we're introduced to the formerly comatose Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up in a deserted hospital and proceeds to walk the eerily silent streets of London. He naturally yells and gets no response (of course, this is not a wise thing to do). A newspaper caught in the wind informs him that a virus got loose and transformed people into madmen.He meets Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) and together the three of them stalk the lonely streets of this dark and dangerous metropolis that's teeming with the deadly 'infected.' They meet Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) and together, they all set off into the country in search of a possible cure for the virus and safety, which is at an isolated mansion that has been heavily fortified by a loose platoon of soldiers, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), and soon Jim and party realize that they are up against something much more sinister.'28 Days Later...' has been dubbed by some genre purists as a 'zombie flick,' but director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland have insisted it isn't and I'm inclined to agree with them. Though '28 Days Later...' was greatly influenced by the works of American director George A. Romero (who made the daring 'Living Dead' trilogy and basically defined a new genre of horror film-making), it's not a zombie flick because the so-called 'living dead' in this movie are still technically alive, just... 'infected.'That's about all I'm going to say about that, instead I'm going to turn my focus to the craft and ingenuity that went into this film's production. Even if one wants to call it a zombie flick (I'm not going to disagree with anyone that does), the horror and gore take a backseat to a larger social question about human nature: Is it in our blood to kill?Alex Garland might think so, since the virus has to be in the blood to infect its victim and transform them into what they are in the film. And if someone does get infected, any survivors around have 20 seconds (or is it 30?) to kill them before the infected individual has a chance to wreak havoc.I missed this movie when it laid siege to the theaters last summer and proceeded to scare the daylights out of its viewers. But in today's times, an observant person might assume that this movie provides a valuable commentary about the dangerous days that we're living in. The American people are scared and '28 Days Later...' may have provided the jolts we needed to shake us out of our disillusionment with modern times.An MTV (MTV?) special I watched a while ago talked about how people want to be scared out of their wits nowadays; just look at the massive success of movies like 'Cabin Fever' (another movie about a deadly virus on the loose) or Zack Snyder's remake of Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead,' which was released earlier this year.'28 Days Later...' is an eerie and frightening film that I highly recommend to any horror fan or anyone who wants to escape reality and slip into another darker, deadlier one.10/10",10,2,4,7 October 2004
It Follows," 'It Follows' is sure to develop a sizable cult following...
","The new 2014 horror film 'It Follows' (released earlier this year in March of 2015) is one of the most talked-about horror films to come out in years. 'It Follows' is, in many ways, a kind of throwback to the relatively gore-free, atmosphere-rich shock-fests of the 1970s, with films such as 'The Exorcist' (1973) and 'Halloween' (1978) - the latter of which this film invokes especially during the course of its 100-minute running time. And because of these deliberate invocations of horror films from 40 years ago (while also breaking with a number of well-known horror movie traditions and stereotypes), it's hard to not buy into the high amount of praise 'It Follows' has received.Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has stated in interviews that 'It Follows' is rooted in nightmares he suffered from as a child, where he was chased by a malevolent, slow-moving, shape-shifting supernatural entity that followed him everywhere he went. This idea managed to work its way into his second feature, where Detroit teenagers on the cusp of adulthood find themselves stalked by such a supernatural entity.The film opens unsettlingly enough - and with a pulsating synthesizer score by Disasterpeace (which is another key invocation from the 1970s) - with a scantily-clad young girl running from her house, getting into her car, and driving away. We next see her on the beach, tearfully calling her parents and telling her how much she loves them and that she's sorry for all the bad things that she's put them through. The next morning, the young girl is found brutally murdered.We're then introduced to Jay Height (Maika Monroe). Jay has a date with a 21-year-old hunk named Hugh (Jake Weary) that starts innocently enough. We next see them having sex in the backseat of his car. From this little encounter, Jay soon finds herself stalked by the malevolent, shape-changing supernatural entity (of Mitchell's childhood nightmares, remember) that will follow her everywhere she goes until it finally kills her - unless she can save herself by having sex with someone else and thus passing the curse along to them (even though we also learn that's really no guarantee she'll be fine - because if it kills the next person she passes it on to, it will come back for her).So she has to call upon her friends to help her extinguish a lethargic, invisible entity that only she can see, and this does lead to some genuinely frightening moments later on in the film (in particular, a climatic final showdown involving the teens at a community swimming pool).Many reviewers have also read into this film's events as an allegory on the dangers of STDs and promiscuous sex. When 'Scream' (1996) premiered 19 years ago, it commented - albeit satirically - on how it is usually in slasher films ('Halloween,' 'Friday the 13th,' 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' etc.), that the virgin always survives and that one of the only ways to not die in a horror movie is to simply abstain from having sex. (This has caused some to analyze some movie slashers such as Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees as moral avengers slaying promiscuous, drug-abusing teenagers and young adults.)But in 'It Follows,' that concept is turned on its head: sex is the only way to survive. But the filmmakers are not saying that sex is the key to prolonging one's existence here - however long that may be, since, according to the 'rules' surrounding the creature/curse here, there's no guarantee of survival by simply passing 'it' along to another person. The filmmakers have commented that the STD comparison is a fair interpretation, but David Robert Mitchell seems to suggest that it's more about the fear of your own mortality - and yet sex in itself, is about living, and connecting, physically and emotionally, with someone else. Personally, I would even go further to suggest the possibility that the film is really more about the fear of the unseen, the unknown - which can also connect to a fear of death, which many people, especially young people, cannot see or comprehend: These teens, in a figurative sense as well as a literal sense, must out-run death, from which there may ultimately be no escape. Really, any interpretation is fair here, and key to understanding the feature.'It Follows' is one of the best new horror films of the new millennium. It has a low budget, but like a lot of low-budget horror features, it is also stunningly well-made but most importantly, it has ambitions, ideas, that are realized in spite of its financial limitations. I've commented in the past that the British cult classic 'The Descent' (2005) is the best and scariest horror movie I've seen so far since the beginning of the 21st century; like 'It Follows,' 'The Descent' was also inspired by horror films of the 1970s, which is perhaps why these two films are so outstanding on a number of levels to me.This film will definitely require multiple viewings to fully understand everything it has to offer you.8/10",8,4,14,12 October 2015
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'
","You can bet that when director Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' came out in 2000, that many got to see the martial arts movie in an accessible, wholesome fashion. An adaptation of the works by Du Lu Wang, the film is set in ancient China and concerns two martial arts warriors (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) who are dispatched to retrieve a stolen sword, which leads them to the rebellious daughter (Ziyi Zhang) of a prominent nobleman. More than just a martial arts movie, the film builds on the relationships between the characters and the timely vibe. The action scenes (with choreography by Yuen Wo Ping from his work on 1999's 'The Matrix') are astounding, and are reminiscent of the old-school kung-fu flicks Lee and us grew up on as children. Certainly one of the most praised action movies of the last 20 years, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has received a lot of attention especially in the United States, from those not used to what Asia has to offer.10/10",10,1,2,7 April 2007
JFK," Oliver Stone - Brave filmaker or paranoid conspiracy theorist?
","Well, I believe the former; it's a widely-known, but little believed fact that there was a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy on that fateful day back on November 22, 1963.  Kennedy may very well have been one of this country's greatest presidents, but as Donald Sutherland's character states, 'all of that vanished on that day back in 1963.'Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the bravest filmakers of the last 25 years and seemed to have reached the height of his controversy with 1991's 'JFK'.  As you know, the story basically follows New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner in an Oscar-worthy performance) investigation into the Kennedy assassination.  He risked his life and his career in pursuit of one thing: the truth.  With that said, why is the government so keen to keep the public from viewing records that could possibly offer some insight to the assassination?  I have never read any of the books that inspired 'JFK' (though I plan to soon), but the Abraham Zapruder film should be enough to prove to any free-thinking person that Lee Harvey Oswald COULD NOT have done the shooting.  The physics of the 'Magic Bullet Theory' should also put a lot of doubt into the Warren Commission's claim of a lone assassin. 
Oliver Stone is one of today's truly great filmakers and I respect his views (mostly) but this one hits the nail on the head.",10,3,17,14 July 2003
Django Unchained," This 'Django' is most definitely 'Unchained'!
","Quentin Tarantino.If that name means nothing to you, just move on.10 years ago, in 2004, I had the great pleasure to watch Tarantino's epic revenge fantasy 'Kill Bill' (2003-2004) (yes, it is one film, split into two parts). I proclaimed 'Kill Bill' to be Tarantino's best work as a director (yes, even better than 'Pulp Fiction' - his most famous film to date). (I've always considered Quentin Tarantino to be a far better screenwriter than a director, hence why the 1993 Tony Scott-directed action film 'True Romance' - which Tarantino wrote the screenplay for but DID NOT direct - is my all-time favorite movie, and the single best piece of cinema that Tarantino has ever been involved with. There, I said it - 'True Romance' is Tarantino's greatest work to date.)I saw 'Kill Bill' as his best work because it represented a celebration of film - the very thing Tarantino loves to death and is, after all, the industry that employs him - a cinematic culmination of thousands of hours of late-night grind-house cinema outings when Tarantino was a highly impressionable teenager growing up during the 1970s. If you have a thing for martial arts movies, 'spaghetti' Westerns, Japanese and Italian horror films, Japanese animation (Anime') and virtually every single revenge movie ever made, you were in heaven. I know I was, which is why I loved it as much as I did.It's been a while since Tarantino has made another film that I was really interested in watching, that was until I finally saw 'Django Unchained,' which he wrote and directed and was released in 2012. I missed my chance to see it in the theaters, but fate allowed me to buy the movie on DVD and I just completed watching it this morning.In short, 'Django Unchained' is yet another celebration of film from Tarantino. Combining the 'spaghetti' Western (made most famous by the late Italian director Sergio Leone and his 'Dollars' trilogy which featured a young-ish Clint Eastwood in the leads) and the blaxploitation and soul flicks of the '70s, 'Django Unchained' is the type of film I've been yearning for a LONG time: a Western film with a blaxploitation attitude. Anyone who knows Tarantino, knows that he has a deep affection, and appreciation for, black culture and black cinema, so why else would he make a movie featuring a black-American protagonist leading an insurrection in the years leading up to the American Civil War?Now here is where we get personal for this viewer. As a person of color (black-American), I got a perverse pleasure from watching 'Django Unchained.' This movie caused quite a bit of controversy at the time of its release, namely because of its repetitive use of the word 'ni**er,' much to the consternation of fellow filmmaker Spike Lee (even though he admitted he had not yet seen the film). I fully understand Lee's point and can understand his frustration, but from watching the movie I KNOW that Tarantino detests slavery as much as anyone else (as much as anyone with even the slightest bit of common sense), which is why he doesn't shy away from the brutal reality of the times (the film's opening sequence featuring black slaves force-marched through Texas proves this point). But like typical Tarantino, he also finds a sense of perverse humor in mocking the pathetic conventional racial wisdom of the times and even in displaying the full-on horrors of slavery, is still able to solicit many, many well-placed laughs (take for instance, a hilarious sequence featuring the Ku Klux Klan - the KKK).Tarantino's perverse humor and sudden, explosive sequences of lurid, highly stylized bloodshed are right at home here. In 1858, two years before the official start of the American Civil War, German bounty hunter - and former dentist - Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award-Winner for Best Supporting Actor Christoph Waltz) stumbles upon and frees hardened slave Django (Jamie Foxx). Now here is where we get personal again: in Foxx's Django, I found myself the unlikely - yet fully willing, and committed - target member of Tarantino's audience, and Foxx's Django acting out a wild wish-fulfillment fantasy in a former slave-turned-gun-slinging-insurrectionist. In short, I wished I could be Django, the former slave who's a cross between Nat Turner and Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' (from Sergio Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy, remember).Schultz needs assistance in collecting a hefty bounty and lucky for him, Django - who is much wiser than he appears - can help him to positively locate and identify the men he's looking for. In exchange, Schultz will also help Django in locating his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who works as a servant for Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), an uber-wealthy Mississippi plantation owner who is as vile for his treatment of his slaves as he is lovable for his Southern charm, hospitality, and business ethics. The big joke here, of course, and in true Tarantino fashion, is Candie's house servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson, under some pretty heavy prosthetics to appear considerably aged), who quickly catches on to Django and Schultz's scheme.Now here is a movie that truly, totally, won over this viewer - 'Django Unchained.' In true Tarantino fashion, he's having a ball here, with his rich and over-sized characters and dialogue, and when pushed into a corner he retreats to his favorite - a bloodbath (one that's straight out of 'The Wild Bunch'!) - toward the end. But unlike his previous shoot-outs, you get a great sense of satisfaction from the blood and carnage, one that makes you realize that fully deserving foes have been truly vanquished and that good has triumphed over a great evil and injustice. In short, 'Django' has become 'Unchained,' a symbol of a time of insurrection BEFORE a time of an even Greater Insurrection (the Civil Rights Movement, which would take place a full century after this film's historically revised events).10/10",10,0,4,1 September 2014
The Theory of Everything," Simply brilliant, just like its principal subject matter
","Great Britain's Professor Stephen Hawking - What hasn't been said about the greatest living thinker on the planet right now?I've known about Professor Hawking for a long time now and have long admired him, but just two years ago I finally read his 1988 best-seller 'A Brief History of Time' and loved it - even if much of Hawking's theories (involving the search for the true beginnings of the universe and so-called 'Hawking radiation') went way over my head, despite his attempts to actually simplify his work for the lay person.James Marsh's new 2014 biopic 'The Theory of Everything' is about 25 years in Hawking's early life, from 1963 to 1988, much of it based off his ex-wife Jane Hawking's book 'Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.' The film itself is more about their relationship than it is Hawking's ground-breaking work in theoretical physics. He's played here to perfection by Eddie Redmayne (who I'm convinced spent a lot of time with the real-life Professor Hawking and copied his mannerisms almost exactly), while Jane is played by Felicity Jones, and it is just as much her story as it is his; her attempts to understand and love him are almost vicarious for the experience of the audience. 'The Theory of Everything' of course also includes his crippling diagnosis of motor neuron disease (ALS), which left him with a life expectancy of just two years - but he's obviously still here more than half a century after receiving that life-changing diagnosis.'The Theory of Everything' is a beautiful, marvelous film - so much better than the usual Hollywood stuff, even though this film is very much so-called 'Oscar bait.' But damn it, I loved it. I've always wondered what a screen adaptation of Professor Hawking's life would look like, and now we have it. I guess a more straight-forward look at his career would have to wait, or we can just continue reading his books (of which there are several). But if we want to get an idea of who he is as a person, look no further than 'The Theory of Everything.'10/10",10,2,4,29 December 2014
2012," It's the end of the world, but not the end of movie-making, as some would speculate...
","'2012' is the 2009 disaster epic from the 'master of disaster' Roland Emmerich ('Independece Day' - his best film, in my opinion; 'Godzilla'; and 'The Day After Tomorrow'). Whether you love him or loathe him, '2012' is his disaster epic, with plenty of spectacular scenes of destruction, a determined band of survivors (led by John Cusack as struggling writer Jackson Curtis) trying to live through the end of the world. Some scientific babble about the sun's rays heating up the Earth's core and loosening up the Earth's tectonic plates and shifting the poles has sped up doomsday from its predicted date (by the Mayans) of 12-21-12 to some time during the summer of 2012. Scenes of destruction are nothing new in movies like this. But what makes it all so very different is that the destruction on the scale as presented in '2012' is unprecedented in the movies. The scenes of mega-tsunamis engulfing Washington, D.C., and India, the super-volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park suddenly erupting, and Los Angeles (and pretty much the entire West Coast falling into the Pacific Ocean) are not only spectacular and awesome to look at, but are also harrowing and horrifying. I'm not a fan of the disaster movie genre, but the scenes of such mass death and destruction in '2012' are so unusually affecting and horrifying that I actually had a hard time watching it, but I couldn't look away. I don't know if that was intended or not by Emmerich, but if he wanted to scare the hell out of the audience, I think that in my case he succeeded in shaking me to my emotional core, and wondering if this is what the end of the world will really look like. While I don't think the world will end on 12-21-12 - I've read enough articles and discussions on the matter to convince me otherwise - there is no question, however, that '2012' may very well be the disaster epic of the disaster movie genre.10/10",10,17,31,13 June 2010
The Number 23," It's that freakin' 23!
","Talk about life imitating art, or art imitating life:Today, I was on my way home from viewing the new thriller 'The Number 23' starring Jim Carrey when I was startled to see that the car in front of me, a BMW 530 Xi, had a license plate ending with the number 4982. Pay particular attention to the 4982, because I did the math (4+9+8+2) and what did I get? 23. Scary, huh? Chalk it up to coincidence, is what I want to say, but still, scary. (Anyone reading this who has a similar experience, feel free to PM me here at IMDb. I'd love to hear similar plights.) Still, talk about art imitating life (or vice versa), which is precisely what happens to Carrey's character is this new film from director Joel Schumacher.Schumacher's film, for the most part, is smarter than the average Hollywood thriller in a lot of places, but just when things start to get really interesting in the climax, it all falls apart, which isn't to say that up until then 'The Number 23' has been a fun and engaging ride. 23, by itself, is a tricky little number with a lot of a bad omens attached to it. For all you conspiracy buffs and numerology experts, I'll leave that to you to decipher. I can just go on the always-reliable Wikipedia for my needs.Carrey, the comic-turned-Hollywood leading man, isn't all over the place like he usually is in most of his movies. For the most part, he's quite subdued, saving much of his comic grace for early in the picture before the plot unravels, and begins a downward spiral that eventually leads to a mind-bending chase with himself.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. What's all the hoopla about, again? As stated earlier, the number 23 is very tricky. The film starts with Carrey as loving family man Walter Sparrow and his narration informs us that today is his birthday (February 3). He's a dog catcher by trade, and he receives the call to handle the pit-bull that's been terrorizing a Chinese restaurant. The perpetrating mutt, named Ned, gets the upper hand on Walter, bites him on the arm, and runs off. The incident allows him to be late picking up his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) for his own birthday party, who managed to kill time by wandering into a used-book store where she selects a curious little title called 'The Number 23,' by a now-obscure author named Topsy Kretts.She buys the book for Walter, who at first isn't impressed by the narrative but as he begins reading deeper and deeper into the book, he finds that the main character, a detective named Fingerling, bears a rather disturbing resemblance to himself. And there is always that annoying little trickster 23, which Walter begins seeing everywhere in his life. His son Robin (Logan Lerman) is also lured into the madness that starts to consume Walter's life, as events spiral out of control and Walter's investigation into the book's narrative and the search for its author yields the gruesome 13-year-old murder of a young woman named Laura Tollins (Rhona Mitra), whose body has never been found, and for which a man may have been wrongfully imprisoned.Like what was stated earlier, for the most part 'The Number 23' appears to be smarter than the average thriller, and its script by Fernley Phillips makes every conceivable attempt to examine the bizarre and ominous nature of the infamous 23, including names, dates, and even the color of the Sparrows' living room wall. But just as things start to really get a grapple-hold on the viewer, it fades into typical Hollywood contrivances and sets us up with multiple suspects and multiple climaxes that ruin what could have been a really unique thriller. And the film's ending narrative happily explains (thus negating the confusion the movie worked so hard to achieve) the mystery surrounding the Tollins murder and Walter's involvement in it.Carrey is a delight in a change of roles, though the light humor he provides early in the picture is really the only thing resembling his younger days; call it 'Ace Ventura'-lite. The movie has other good performances, and the once-tight pace of director Schumacher is ruined by the explanatory ending.'The Number 23' is probably an example of Hollywood originality ruined by Hollywood itself. Perhaps if the movie had been made independently, we could have had something truly special.Oh, and that license plate number I told you about? The car made a right turn into a K-Mart parking lot and I never saw it again after that. But I was still looking for 23, just to make sure it was a coincidence. You know what? I think I was right.8/10",8,11,24,23 February 2007
Ghost Rider," A review of 'Ghost Rider'
","In the Marvel Comics pantheon of superheroes, Ghost Rider stands out as one of the more unique personalities in the fact that he is not a mutant (i.e., Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil), or a human being at the peak of his physical stature (i.e., The Punisher). No, Ghost Rider receives his unique qualities in the fact that he's a demon, manipulated by the forces of both good and evil for their respective purposes.Created by writers Roy Thomas, Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog for Marvel Comics in 1972, the title features stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze, who finds himself at the disposal of the forces of Hell after selling his soul to the Devil. By day (I love that 'by day' line), Blaze is pretty much himself: a reckless daredevil motorcyclist who loves to risk his life for the sake of his fans. At night, however, he hops on a revved-up motorcycle, possessed by the demon Zarathos, as the mystical Ghost Rider, to collect souls as a hot-rodding bounty hunter for his boss, Satan. But ultimately, circumstances in the world force the Ghost Rider into acting on the side of good, and trying to find a way to regain his soul.This would all make for some pretty intense entertainment with philosophical discussions dealing with the matter of choice, but it seems that with this latest comic book adaptation, writer/director Mark Steven Johnson's 'Ghost Rider,' such themes take a backseat in what is essentially a Hollywood-ized, special effects-laden spectacle that goes many places and savors stylish craftsmanship, but lacks any real substance. I'm not a huge 'Ghost Rider' fan, but what I do like about him is the fact that he's a demon and not a mutant (like so many others), and that makes him so much different from the rest.Johnson made a name for himself four years ago when he wrote and directed 'Daredevil' (2003). The film was initially a box office and critical disappointment, but has found a new afterlife on DVD with a highly praised director's cut that made the Man Without Fear shine in a whole new light. But the problem is ultimately with Johnson's writing, which has imagination and ideas, but lacks substance. I guess this is why 'Ghost Rider' gets off to a slow start, even with some rather stirring scenes of a young Johnny Blaze working with his dad in a carnival motorcycle stunt show.When his father is diagnosed with cancer, a stranger offers young Johnny a deal: sell his soul, and in the process spare his father's life. Blaze does so and his father recovers. But an accident takes his father's life, and now Blaze is at the mercy of the stranger, later revealed to be the demon Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda). Mephistopheles states that Blaze is now the mythological Ghost Rider, and will allow Johnny to lead a normal life until he needs him. So Blaze grows up, leaves behind his true love Roxanne Simpson, and goes about on a lifelong journey of waiting for his second chance at redemption.Now an adult, played by the oddly appealing Nicolas Cage (who is a die-hard Ghost Rider fan and had to have his tattoo covered up for the film), Blaze is continuing his life's mission of stunning the masses. On the side, however, he is still haunted by his father's tragic accident and his deal with Mephistopheles, which as an aside, he reads up on books that could offer clues as to how to break his contract with him.The main plot of the film gets under way when Mephistopheles's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), arrives on Earth seeking to bring about Armageddon. It seems that Blackheart has grown too powerful for his father and wants the Ghost Rider to help him find a hundred-year-old contract that contains the souls of the residents of a condemned desert town. Meanwhile, Blaze's heart goes bing-bing-bing by the sudden arrival of his old flame Roxanne (Eva Mendes), and she has a hard time accepting his life's choices. But Blackheart proves to be a big problem, and Blaze must now assume the identity of the Ghost Rider, flaming skull, chain, hot rod and all, and save the world.Stan Lee, who frequently pops up in Marvel adaptations, doesn't here (just so you know). As Johnny Blaze, Cage is sufficient, in a role that he obvious loves and sinks his teeth into. You have to admire his attempts at attracting Roxanne by revealing his true identity as the Ghost Rider and having her look at him cross-eyed and recommending psychiatric help. Also, Mendes generates a sense of warmth and provides a nice love interest. Peter Fonda and Wes Bentley both make for decent villains, and even Sam Elliott appears as a former Ghost Rider. But the problem, again, is with Johnson. I just wish that with his next film he leaves the writing to someone else and remains a director.'Ghost Rider' may not have shared the potential of something on the magnitude of say a 'Spider-Man' movie (the preview trailer for 'Spider-Man 3' was simply excellent, BTW), but it could have been really good on its own accord. I suspect that like Johnson's earlier 'Daredevil,' a director's cut is probably in the works, with much of the really good stuff that was left on the cutting room floor inserted back into the film. We'll just have to wait and see.6/10",6,17,34,16 February 2007
Hellboy," 'Seed of Destruction'
","One of the biggest perks of 'Hellboy' comes from the charisma of the massive red demon of the film's title, who is played magnificently by Ron Perlman. Perlman is barely recognizable underneath that dense makeup but his tough-guy attitude and his rough voice give him away.And this is one of the many reasons I found 'Hellboy' to be so entertaining.Adapted from the Dark Horse Comics character created by Mike Mignola and skillfully directed by Guillermo del Toro, 'Hellboy' is one hell (no pun intended) of a roller coaster ride.Guillermo del Toro, who reached mainstream success when he directed Wesley Snipes in 2002's 'Blade II' (which also featured Perlman in a key supporting performance), knows the material inside out and runs with it.'Hellboy' is definitely one of the more ambitious comic book adaptations in recent years, and is also one of the more faithful. (Before seeing this film, I went to my local book store and I picked up 'Seed of Destruction' and read that, which is where I got most of my information regarding 'Hellboy.')As a film, it captures the spirit and excitement of Mike Mignola's Nazi-spawned demon hero, who battles the forces of Hell with a really big gun and an attitude. In the closing days of World War II, renegade Russian monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), who is working with the Nazis, brings Hellboy into our existence in an effort to help turn the tide of the conflict in favor of Adolf Hitler. The Allies stop the ceremony and Hellboy is adopted and raised to adulthood by a benevolent scientist, John Bruttenholm (John Hurt).Rasputin will stop at nothing to bring about the Apocalypse but needs Hellboy to do it. Hellboy on the other hand, knows that being 7 feet tall and red can be very lonely, and he's fallen in love with Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who can start fires when she becomes excited.'Hellboy' is a wondrous marvel from start to finish and I enjoyed it very much. I waited until the director's cut came out before I would comment on this movie so I could see it in all of its visual glory.8/10",8,0,1,1 November 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," From the beginning...
","...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 fFangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the 'goriest movie ever made' (1992's 'Dead Alive'), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of 'The Lord of the Rings' saga, which include 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001), 'The Two Towers' (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner 'The Return of the King' (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since 'Star Wars' has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing 'The Lord of the Rings' films. 'The Lord of the Rings' is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the 'PG-13' rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get 'into' Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and 'The Enemy,' who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live ('live' is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a 'fellowship of the ring.' There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called 'The Lord of the Rings' the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10",10,0,0,3 August 2005
Schindler's List," A triumph...
","Filmmaker Steven Spielberg's 1993 World War II/Holocaust drama 'Schindler's List' is a cinematic triumph. Unquestionably Spielberg's most 'satisfying' film about WWII (and of his career, perhaps), 'Schindler's List' is one of his many directorial highlights because of its message of hope, survival, and humanity during a time in human history that lacked any of those three. This is what Spielberg's vision of World War II was really about: regaining a sense of hope, survival, and humanity in grave times.It's been a while since I saw it last. I saw this film about six years ago my sophomore in high school; we had to watch it as part of my world history class. Boy, am I glad I chose to show up those two days we watched this movie because I surely would have missed out on an incredible film experience. This is my favorite film about the Holocaust during World War II; 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981) was pure fun about World War II, and 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) showed the personal cost of World War II.Spielberg is himself a Jew, and his personal feelings about WWII and the plight of the Jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the Nazis, in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark?' I do. 'Schindler's List' is Spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. If 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' showed a Jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying Nazis, then 'Schindler's List' showed us that that kid has finally grown up.Adapted from Thomas Keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a German war profiteer named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 Jews (including his loyal accountant, Itzhak Stern, played by a superb Ben Kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). By no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the Nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by Neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to 'Save one Life, and save the World Entire.'What's most striking about this production is its authenticity. Spielberg filmed 'Schindler's List' at the real Nazi concentration at Auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. To make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. However, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why Spielberg chose to put it there. There's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. Who can forget the startling sequences where the Nazis are making the Jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead?'Schindler's List' is one of the key films about World War II, the Holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. Its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career.10/10",10,9,13,15 December 2008
The Incredibles," Amazing! Incredible! Unique! Pixar, you've done it again! 10/10
","The animation megalomaniacs at Pixar are at it again with this new film 'The Incredibles,' about a superhero family that comes out of forced retirement to battle a psycho wannabe superhero who's (surprise, surprise) bent on world domination. 'The Incredibles' plays out like a collision between every superhero comic book that director Brad Bird has read in his whole lifetime, and the super-villain clichés are there too, and the bad guy acts as if he KNOWS that he is destined to lose the battle. Everything from Superman, to the Fantastic Four, to Dr. Doom pops up here in the abundant comic book references throughout the film. What we have here is one of the most beautiful animated superhero epics the screen has ever seen. Amazing, unique, Pixar, 'Incredible'!",10,1,3,19 March 2005
I Am Legend," Surprisingly good, albeit flawed, 'Legend'
","There is a certain majesty and genuine creepiness present in the early sequences of 'I Am Legend,' an apocalyptic sci-fi/horror, last-man-on-Earth featuring Will Smith as Robert Neville, our heroic Last Man on Earth. The film opens with Neville, accompanied by his German Shepherd Sam, driving a new Ford Mustang through the streets of a barren New York City chasing a herd of deer. Stalking one through Times Square, he's about to pull the trigger when he discovers that a lion is about to have a much better day.And so begins 'I Am Legend,' an adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, and had it come out in 2001 or 2002, it might fair better in the area of being a genuinely frightening sci-fi/horror flick. Other similarly themed movies have come out over the years, most notably 'The Omega Man' (1971) and more recently '28 Days Later...' (2002), all of which have had varying degrees of success in adapting Matheson's work or taking the theme to a whole new dimension.In 'I Am Legend,' the year is 2012, five years after a viral cure for cancer mutated into an even deadlier virus that turned much of the world's population into bloodthirsty vampires. As a result, the island of Manhattan was quarantined with all bridges leading onto it destroyed. He has the city all to himself during the day, feverishly working on a cure (to which he seems to have had some success at doing because he's somehow immune) but at night, it's time to batten down the hatches of his Central Park brownstone because at night, the city belongs to them - the 'Darkseekers' (the plague-infected vampires) that own the night and the city when they come out to feed.A wrinkle in the plot comes in the form of beautiful Anna (Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have somehow managed to survive through this thing, thus no longer making Neville the Last Man on Earth. She says that they're heading north because there is a rumored 'sanctuary' somewhere in the mountains of Vermont, where the virus cannot survive due to the cold. Neville is skeptical, but Anna is absolutely positive because she believes that there is still a God up there.The early scenes of the film featuring only Smith and his loyal canine companion Sam are the best sequences of the entire picture. I'm not sure how director Francis Lawrence achieved the effect of a deserted New York City but it is damn compelling. And we get to see fairly early who Neville's nocturnal adversaries are in one particularly suspenseful scene.But one area that 'I Am Legend' seems to suffer from is the Last Man on Earth Really Isn't the Last Man on Earth Syndrome. It's one of the things that has repeatedly killed these sorts of movies in the past. I seriously think the movie would have been better had it just been the 'Will Smith Show Live & Uncut' for 100 minutes. And another area that really faults the movie is its climax, which is a sort of haunted-house routine that kind of ends anti-climatically and felt more than a little cheap. Of special effects, there is no shortage of them, even if these effects look a little unrealistic for today's highly sophisticated times.While 'I Am Legend' has plenty of faults, it is a chilling effective sci-fi/horror picture that does deliver in terms of shocks and special effects. I only hope the next Last Man on Earth is truly the Last Man on Earth.7/10",7,0,0,31 October 2008
Kick-Ass," 'Kick-Ass' - No superpowers? No problem. But he can still kick your a**...
","'Kick-Ass' is probably the most illogical logical comic book superhero movie ever made, and I say that in a good way. 'Kick-Ass' takes the idea of the costumed superhero to its illogical, logical extremes by presenting us an everyday teenager named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who takes his love of comic books a little too far and decides to become a real-life superhero, donning a costume out of a diving suit he bought off the Internet (eBay) and becoming embroiled in a deadly mob war as a result of his costumed theatrics.And thus begins 'Kick-Ass,' Matthew Vaughn's over-the-top, if not totally stream-lined (and dare I say, slightly 'sanitized'), adaptation of the comic book series created by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. for Marvel Comics, under the company's Icon imprint. I've read the first volume of 'Kick-Ass' comics in preparation for this movie and while I think the comics were way better (largely because of how vulgar, over-the-top, satirical, and violent the comics were), the movie is not half-bad. In fact, it's very good, despite the many red-flags it's raising.I laughed. My friend who was sitting beside me laughed, too. I laughed as blood and bodies hit the floor. I laughed as bad guys died horrible but fitting deaths. I laughed as a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughtered bad guys left & right. (Yes, you read that right, a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughters bad guys left & right.) I laughed at all the inappropriate times (there never is a real 'appropriate' time to laugh at all during this picture.) I laughed at the utter insanity and absurdity of it all. (I laughed more-so at the comics, but that's a different matter altogether.)Lizewski, like most superheroes in their ordinary civilian lives (such as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), is not popular with the girls, is the target of bullies and street muggers alike, and is a nerd who reads too many comic books. Despite not having any superpowers (he wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider and he's not a refugee from a dying alien planet), it's nonetheless a wonder that he soon dons the Kick-Ass suit and makes a name for himself by taking down a trio of gang members. A bystander records the action on his cell phone and uploads it to the Internet, where it goes viral and Kick-Ass becomes an instant media sensation with a legion of devoted followers and copycats, such as Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, of 'Superbad'), who soon takes to the streets as Red Mist. And that foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl I was telling you about? Her name is Cindy Macready a.k.a. Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz), who is waging a deadly father-daughter war on organized crime with her father Damon/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), a conflict that Kick-Ass is inevitably drawn into against his better judgment.'Kick-Ass' is a deliriously entertaining, if overly violent and totally un-PC superhero flick. The movie shows the 'real world' of superheroes and the logical consequences of their actions, which can include serious bodily injury and death, as Our Hero Kick-Ass quickly finds out. (And I thought My Hero Peter Parker/Spider-Man had it rough.) While I disliked some of the changes (both minor and major) made for the movie from the comics, I can say that 'Kick-Ass' makes those changes work, including the hilarious nature of Dave's unusual relationship with a pretty classmate named Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).I honestly can't wait for the sequel. 'Kick-Ass' kicks a**!10/10",10,4,12,19 May 2010
Ghostbusters," Who are YOU gonna call?!?
","There is a reason why 'Ghostbusters,' the supernatural comedy hit from 1984 that was directed by Ivan Reitman, is a classic today: 'Ghostbusters' is a film that easily worked its way into cinema and pop culture, spawning a 1989 sequel, a spin-off animated series, merchandise, songs (by Ray Parker, Jr.), and Slimer!!! It has a top-notch cast, including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis as three parapsychologists who go into business eliminating poltergeists in New York City.That plot outline sounds pretty simple, doesn't it? Well, OK, it is. 'Ghostbusters' has one of those 'novelty plots' (trademark), where a seemingly simple, maybe even random idea snowballs and becomes something truly unique altogether. That is what 'Ghostbusters' is, and that is what its plot has. I still don't think Reitman, Aykroyd, and Ramis had too many brainstorming sessions where they just sat in a room and tossed around random ideas for three hours.No. In 'Ghostbusters,' three unemployed parapsychologists, Dr. Peter Venkman (Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Ramis), are thrown out of the university because their studies into the paranormal have failed to yield any positive results. So they get the idea to put their heads together and go into the ghost-busting business. Of course, things are slow at first and people have difficulty taking their ads seriously (save for the opening sequence where a librarian has a creepy encounter with the specter haunting the library).They then get a break when Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) discovers that a monstrous dog-thing has taken up residence in her refrigerator. (If you think that's bad, just watch out for those eggs that start frying themselves on the kitchen counter.) Oddly enough, none of her neighbors have complained to the super of any supernatural activity in the building, not even her loser neighbor Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis), who I think, obviously, secretly has a crush on her.So the boys go about investigating Dana's claim, while Venkman initiates some poorly timed moves on her. More calls of ghostly encounters continue, and soon the general public has no choice but to let the Ghostbusters believe them. Cool. Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are eventually joined by a fourth, an Everyman named Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), who proves to probably be the emotional and spiritual anchor the other three need as they find themselves going up against an otherworldly threat that is far bigger than anything any of them ever expected.'Ghostbusters' is just as imaginative as it is funny and timeless. The cast members know their roles and fill them out with equal pizazz, including William Atherton as slimy EPA agent Walter Peck and Annie Potts as cynical secretary Janine Melnitz. The real spectacle of course, are the inventive special effects. Of course, it's pretty easy to computer generate ghosts and goblins and film them interacting with live actors. Back in 1984, the filmmakers still had to use lighting and other camera trickery to make such things possible. (So what are you going to do?)And lastly, who can forget Mr. Stay Puft's classic rampage down through lower Manhattan?10/10",10,0,0,22 October 2006
Hero," 'Heroic' and beautiful
","'Hero,' completed in 2002 but through some special promoting complements of Quentin Tarantino, was finally released to the American public in the summer of 2004. I've seen it twice; this is the most delicate and beautiful of what I call the 'art house' martial arts movies (i.e., 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'House of Flying Daggers'), and I'm simply amazed at the film's production, cinematography, fight scenes, and of course, Jet Li. Li is the most talented martial arts superstar the movies has seen since Bruce Lee. Li plays Nameless, a wandering magistrate who, as the film opens, entices the imperialist King of Qin (Daoming Chen) with a story of how he single-handedly defeated three assassins who had each vowed to kill the king. Much can be said about the film's fight scenes, which are beautiful and are amazingly choreographed, but the biggest problem, I think, lies within the story. I had to sit through the film two times before I felt I could get a grasp on everything, but maybe it's just me. The movie sometimes tends to meander through some of its slower parts and that could take points away from an otherwise excellent film. But as I stated before, the fight scenes are magnificent, the standouts of which come to include a fight between Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) that takes place inside a chess house, and the two float and practice their swordsplay as a blind man plays music during periods of when nothing goes on between the two men, and they just listen to the sounds as the man plucks away at the strings. And there is another scene where Nameless battles Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) over the serene mirror of a mountain lake, and the two men are careful to not break the water's surface. An excellent and delicate film.'Hero' - 8/10",8,0,0,30 March 2005
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," 'Fantastic.' Really. Better than the first
","Yes, you read the above correctly. Call me crazy, or call me an average movie-going American citizen whose expectations were mostly surpassed, but 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a fun, action-packed, and occasionally very funny superhero summer movie that remains true to its Stan Lee/Jack Kirby Marvel Comics source material.Here is another example of a movie sequel done correctly. The first 'Fantastic Four' (2005) received mostly negative reviews but was a box office success, enough of a success that Marvel Comics and Twentieth Century Fox thought it would be possible to channel funds into a sequel. Despite occasional flaws in the script and misjudgments on the part of the filmmakers, 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is mostly another successful entry into the superhero movie genre.If you remember from the first film, an accident in outer space bestows a vast array of cosmic powers upon five astronauts:<ul><li>Egghead scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) becomes Mr. Fantastic and is now able to bend any part of his body at will and can give Plastic Man a run for his money.</li></ul><ul><li>Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) becomes the Invisible Woman, with the ability to turn invisible and generate forcefields. More technically, she can't become completely invisible, but is able to bend light - nonetheless, it becomes difficult to see her (and sometimes she has to strip to get out of sticky situations).</li></ul><ul><li>Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue's hotshot brother, becomes the Human Torch with the ability to engulf his body in flames and can fly.</li></ul><ul><li>Lastly, poor Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) is transformed into The Thing, an unsightly rock-monster with the strength of at least 100 men and is pretty much indestructible.</li></ul>They put personal squabbles aside to unite as the Fantastic Four (as named by the media), and battled their fifth (and former) teammate and first movie nemesis, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who became Dr. Doom when the accident began to slowly transform him into an angry metal freak with control over electricity. He was defeated, imprisoned in his own metallic body, and sent back to his home country of Latveria in a crate.In this sequel, Reed Richards and Sue Storm are preparing to tie the knot, in a wedding that's all over the tabloids (and brings back memories of any celebrity wedding within the last seven years, say TomKat). Ben's relationship with blind chick Alicia (Kerry Washington) is off without a hitch, and Johnny is still the player with a different girl under his arm at every social function.The Fantastic Four also continue their adventures of saving the world at large and being the greatest heroes on the planet. But that's about to change: a malevolent entity from outer space is causing mayhem and destruction all over the world. Reed theorizes that whatever this thing is, it emits incredible amounts of cosmic radiation and destroys all life on all planets wherever it goes in an eight-day time-span. So the Fantastic Four goes right to work to uncover what this thing is.As you would have it, though, Johnny rushes head-first into the situation and has a face-to-face encounter with the Silver Surfer (played by Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), who is probably the Marvel Comics equivalent of DC Comics' Superman. The encounter leaves Johnny stunned and a bit of a danger to the rest of the team, since he finds he can now transfer his powers to the others. When it's discovered just how big a threat the Silver Surfer is to Earth, Reed's old adversary General Hager (Andre Braugher) contracts the Four to try to get a handle on the Surfer's movements.Other matters threaten to deteriorate the integrity of the Fantastic Four, however, the biggest being Reed and Sue's desire to get married and finally leave the team and start over with their own family. Needless to say, Johnny and Ben don't take the news lightly. But they'll have to put it all to the side when arch-nemesis Dr. Doom reenters the picture, and they discover they will have to work together to save the world from annihilation by the Silver Surfer. But a series of unexpected events force our heroes to realize that an even bigger threat lies beyond the horizon (G-A-L-A-C-T-U-S), and the Silver Surfer may be our only hope.I should have stated this a little earlier, but I'm not a huge fan of Marvel's first family, but the 'Fantastic Four' movies, as big as they are, they're highly enjoyable in a very simplistic fashion. They're not too big on intelligence but are very skilled in special effects, production values, and overall entertainment. I don't need to say that the acting is all that good, but the four are oddly fitting, and appealing. There's also no real need to get all mushy and stuff here, but you do feel yourself growing attached to this movie family that is as dysfunctional as any TV family you could think of.For all its faults, a good job was done of establishing the film, with a better-written screenplay by Don Payne and David Frost. Tim Story (returning from his joyful direction of the first film) is again at the helm of another solid and entertaining thrill ride that remains overall faithful to the spirit of its source material. The only major drawback 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' suffers from is that its only newcomer, the titled Silver Surfer, is not very interesting as a movie character. Defined largely by his cosmic powers and Fishburne's out-there creepy voice, little is done to really give him a personality or even make him sympathetic (since he is pretty much a special effect), acting as a herald for a greater evil. But I guess, how many other aliens can almost bring all life on Earth as we know it to an end?9/10",9,5,10,15 June 2007
Transformers," 'Transforming' the summer at the movies
","The overwhelming response to 'Transformers,' a live-action film version of the line of Hasbro action figures and animated series from the 1980s, proves that the days of genuine, brain-dead popcorn entertainment at the movies during the summer months are not yet gone. 'Transformers' is summer-movie popcorn entertainment of the first degree, seamlessly blending human actors and state-of-the-art CGI into a concept that's virtually out-of-this-world, and bringing it to life.Michael Bay ('The Rock,' 'Armageddon,' 'Pearl Harbor') directed this breathtaking action/sci-fi adventure epic, from a dynamite, intelligently written script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman that places its key source material, the '80s animated series, under a finely tuned microscope, casts off the dead weight (possible Cold War subtext), adds Bay's trademark music video-style over-direction and you get what is very easily one of the most groundbreaking summer movies in a long time.Like most people, I grew up watching 'Transformers' early in the morning during my youth. I was one of many young boys who went through the bang-bang-BOOM! phase as an adolescent and looked to 'Transformers' with a kind of gosh-wow, child-like innocence. I didn't collect the action figures, unfortunately, and although I watched the series whenever I could it was a rare occurrence toward the mid '90s when many cable network channels were rearranging their line-ups. Fast-forward to 2007, now I'm an adult, and I did look with skepticism to Transformers in live-action. And while I've liked Bay's movies in the past, I questioned his abilities to handle something so delicate for a brain-dead 2007 audience.Well...It's his best movie yet, despite his tendency for over-direction. For the most part, he flies on the straight & narrow, with few screw-ups. Perhaps it's because one of his main producers was Steven Spielberg and effects studio Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for the special effects. In the past, Bay's usually worked with super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who's gone for now and he seems to be showing signs of maturity as a filmmaker (did I just write that?).For those of us accustomed to the lore, 'Transformers' revolves around the centuries-old battle between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their war from home planet Cybertron to Earth. The Autobots find unlikely allies in humans, who join the fray in attempting to banish the Decepticons from our planet. In this big-budget blockbuster, high school loser Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his crush Mikaela (relative newcomer Megan Fox) are thrust head-first into the action when Sam discovers that his great-great-grandfather had accidentally discovered the frozen remains of Decepticon leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) in the Arctic Circle. As such, he also discovered an alien power source called the 'All Spark' that Megatron wants so that he can use Earth's technology to conquer the universe.Well, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by the only regular from the original series, Peter Cullen), aren't having it. And along with an elite Special Forces unit led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) that also includes Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and Defense Secretary John Heller (Jon Voight), Sector Seven agent Simmons (a scene-stealing John Turturro), and hackers Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) and Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson), it leads to a special effects-laden, no-holds-barred showdown in Los Angeles, where these forces collide head-on in an epic, 30-minute battle that's sure to please those hardcore 'Transformers' fans and those who might not even know why the hell these giant robots are fighting each other.The film opens with an action sequence in the Qatar desert where one of the Decepticons attacks an American military base there. This scene sets the pace for the rest of the film: a roller coaster ride that is pretty much non-stop for the 143-minute running time. There's never a slow moment for you to capture your breath! With explosions, car chases and machines waging epic war on each other, you can bet it's worth your $8. And there you go thinking that the blockbuster was long dead.What didn't escape my attention was that the film is driven not so much by the special effects, really, but by the actions of the human characters (not that the robots themselves are at all a boring sight). The actors, especially unsung Everyman Shia LaBeouf, are not short-changed and resolved to remain background to the action. The screenplay provides these characters with plenty of moments to shine, with some smart and witty dialogue combined with enthusiastic performances. These are people you come to know and like, not cardboard cut-outs, and likewise they grow on you. (OK, OK, so what about the Autobots/Decepticons?) The special effects are what's most accomplished in 'Transformers.' The actual 'transforming' scenes really bring the 'bots to life breathlessly, so that when they shift, you're in awe by their forms morphing and reconfiguring, and metal clanking together like living machinery. That first moment when Sam buys his new car - oh, a boy and his new car (a Camaro!) - that transforms into sweet-natured Autobot Bumblebee (voiced by Mark Ryan), it leaves you breathless and wanting more, which you get x10 later on. And you thought this was just another summer movie.'Transformers' - It's a step up from the cartoon, definitely.10/10",10,1,6,16 October 2007
Men in Black II," Back in Black. A 9/10
","'Men in Black II' is a worthy sequel to the 1997 smash hit of the same name. The plot is pretty simple other than it involves Agent J (Will Smith) trying to locate a neuralized Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) because he may know the location of an extraterrestrial device that a hostile femme alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) and her idiot partner(s) Scard/Charlie (Johnny Knoxville), a two-headed alien are looking for.  'Men in Black II' is not nearly as clever or original as the first film, as that is this movie's only shortcoming.  The jokes are also a little thin but not too thin.  The acting is pretty good too.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make one of the best comic teams in movie history.
A good movie.",9,0,1,6 July 2002
Children of Men," Where have all the children gone?
","In Britain 2027, it has been 18 years since the last recorded birth of a child. No explanation is given in 'Children of Men' as to why there has been worldwide infertility. (What's the matter, us guys can't get it up in the year 2027? Are all the ladies of the future on the pill?) OK, so I'm a little bit crude, but still it's scary to think that in 'Children of Men' humankind is on the verge of extinction simply because we can't procreate. Based on the 1993 book 'The Children of Men' by British mystery author P.D. James, 'Children of Men' envisions a future world where the last child, an 18-year-old boy, was the victim of an assassination, and now it appears that humanity has lost all hope. Alas, a miracle echoing the Virgin Mary Herself is discovered: a young woman, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), is pregnant, and it is up to government bureaucrat Theo Faron (Clive Owen) to safely deliver her to a promised 'sanctuary' far away. Of course, the task is easier said than done, as Theo, Kee, and several others (including Julianne Moore, in a 30-minute cameo as Theo's revolutionary ex Julian, Michael Caine as the humorous and senile Jasper, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the rebel Luke) have to fight through political unrest and warring factions to get to the safe haven. The director behind this project is Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, whose subject matter takes a look at today's world and transposes to a time that is not all that far-fetched. This is where the film's key brilliance shines. It is also why I've ranked this within my top-10 greatest sci-fi movies. The sci-fi genre is known for some brilliant movies (1982's 'Blade Runner,' which 'Children of Men' has been called the 21st-century equivalent of), and many bad ones (that are too numerous to mention). 'Children of Men' envisions a world of vast political turmoil and upheaval that is not too far off from the way things are looking now. Cuaron's oft-hand-held camera is with us all the way of Theo's journey, many times capturing with up-close authenticity the war zones of the future, and this incredible camera-work rightfully earned Oscar recognition for cinematography and editing. I only anticipate this picture gaining greater appreciation in the years to come.10/10",10,1,4,27 March 2007
Million Dollar Baby," 'Million Dollary Baby' - a knockout
","I'm amazed at the strength of this movie, 'Million Dollar Baby.' I'm also amazed at how far its director and lead actor, Clint Eastwood, has progressed as a filmmaker. (It's easy to see that his 'Dirty Harry' days are way behind him.) Since 1992's 'Unforgiven,' we've seen an insightful, straightforward way of storytelling from the actor-turned-director, who has developed the most unique talent of any filmmaker alive today, which is to understand his characters and present them in a significant, but not overstated fashion that brings about their emotions, pains, and successes. His latest film, adapted by screenwriter Paul Haggis from stories printed in 'Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner' by the late F.X. Toole, searches the souls of three people in the boxing ring of life. The first is old and tired gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), the type of world-weary character Eastwood specializes in, who knows the ring inside-out and reads poetry in his spare time. The second is hillbilly (white trailer trash?) Maggie Fitzgerald (a knockout powerhouse played by Oscar-winner Hilary Swank), who thinks boxing is the only way out of her job as a waitress, which she has been doing since the tender age of 13. Frankie reluctantly takes her under his wing and their path leads her on an escapable course with destiny. She trains hard, sweats hard, knocks out the competition in one round for several bouts (a feat that embarrasses the daylights out of certain managers), and a chance at a title shot if she can unseat the brutal Billie 'The Blue Bear' (Lucia Rijker). She makes a complete turnaround in character, going from bright-eyed rookie to seasoned professional, and the way the film tracks her progress is relayed to us beautifully. Lastly, there is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the story's narrator. Scrap is sincere in his narration in yet another world-weary manner like Eastwood and doesn't twist or play with his words to make points. As a former fighter who Frankie once trained, he's blind in one eye, out of the ring, but possess the wisdom worthy of one to tell a story like Frankie and Maggie's. It's not hard to see why Roger Ebert showered it with praise; nothing in his review convinced me he was lying. The raw power of 'Million Dollar Baby' lies in the performances and straightforward narrative of the story, all of which I described earlier. It won four Oscars and two Golden Globes, though sadly enough the emotional score that Eastwood himself composed didn't win anything. This is the best movie about boxing and boxers I've seen since 'Rocky' (1976). But right there is the distinction. 'Million Dollar Baby' isn't so much about boxing and winning the title as it is a close inspection of the relationship of three different people. 'Rocky' is about that one shot, that one chance to make something of yourself; this film is about living those dreams. 'Million Dollar Baby' - a knockout.10/10",10,3,6,21 January 2006
Casualties of War," How could this happen?
","The Vietnam War is something that I think we are all trying to forget. Young men, who weren't even over the age of twenty-one, were exposed to unspeakable horrors.  Thousands of young men died, hundreds of others were physically and emotionally scarred for the rest of their lives.  What makes this fact even more relevant today are all of the war movies that Hollywood has been producing recently.  These movies include 'Born on the Fourth of July (1989)', 'Hamburger Hill (1987)', and the much recent 'We Were Soldiers (2002)'.  All three of these movies are based on true Vietnam survivor stories.  'Born on the Fourth of July', the first of these films I'll talk about, starred Tom Cruise.  The story was about Ron Kovic, an all-American teenager who went to Nam, with high hopes of being able to serve his country proud.  Not even a year into his first tour of duty, Ron was wounded and was paralyzed from the chest down.  He returned home and endured a very unpleasant stay in a veteran's hospital.  He comes home only to discover that he may not be very welcome because of fighting overseas.  Despite all that, he would soon go on to become an anti-war activist.  Even though he lost the ability to ever be able to walk again, he had not lost his will to live a good life.  'Hamburger Hill' was about a platoon of soldiers who were trying to climb a hill that once conquered would be a crucial strategic point in the war.  These brave men endured enemy fire, as well as friendly fire, pouring rain, an ever-growing sense of dread, and unbelievable loss of manpower.  Still, aside from all of these elements of tragedy, they were eventually able overcome that hill.  'We Were Soldiers', the most recent of these films, which starred Mel Gibson, was about a group of soldiers, primarily young fathers, brothers and sons, who were able to fight bravely despite being surrounded by enemy forces.  Even with all of these excellent war films, we've forgotten something.  All of these films glorify soldiers overcoming powerful odds and tragedies and they've all been portrayed in a positive manner.  So what happens when our American soldiers become something that we could never imagine?  Keeping this question in mind, this brings me to Brian De Palma's forgotten war drama, 'Casualties of War'.The main story of 'Casualties of War' is that it is a morality tale.  A platoon of five soldiers goes into a Vietnamese village on a reconnaissance mission and kidnaps a young girl.  They then proceed to rape her.  One of the men refused to go along with the others.  After the rape, the young soldier tells the girl that he's going to try to get her out of there.  The other soldiers while trying to escape catch him.  Then the platoon, with the girl still in tow, proceeds on their way.  They then encounter enemy fire. In the fray, the young soldier sees his chance to try to get the girl out of there.  The platoon sergeant sees the girl trying to escape and then orders the other men to shoot her.  They do so and the girl falls to her death. After the incident, the platoon returns to base camp.  The young soldier who refused to go along with the others then reports to his lieutenant about the incident.  He's informed that something like this could severely damage the United States military and it's position in the war.  The other four soldiers are tried in a military court and are sentenced to lengthy prison terms for the crime.  The incident was never mentioned by anyone after that. It was not until a newspaper article, which a book then followed had been published about the incident that it would ever be brought to public attention.  This is Brian De Palma's best movie behind 'The Untouchables'.  I'm surprised that this movie hasn't gained the attention that it so righteously deserves in the long period of time that it's been on video.  Brian De Palma doesn't shy the camera away when it comes down to the rape scene.  We see the young girl screaming and we also see all of the men's reactions to the horrors at large.  I actually had to turn my head during the rape scene. 'Hamburger Hill' is another forgotten war movie that hasn't gotten much attention either.  The reason that movie is so good is that it shows men at their greatest when things are at their worst.  Michael J. Fox, who plays the new recruit, Eriksson, is excellent.  It was nice to him a really good serious role for once.  I think that performances like the one Fox gives in this movie are rare.  Sean Penn, who plays Meserve, is a monster in this film.  We see a war-torn veteran, who is only trying to survive his last few weeks in Vietnam.  When a friend is killed in an ambush, this causes Meserve's already stemming hatred for the Vietnamese to go even further.  It is now that we see Penn go into overdrive.  He is so intimidating, that as one viewer already claimed, that it's easy to see how a weak person could easily come under his control.  The supporting performances I think are some of the best.  Don Harvey and John C. Reilly both give great performances as the two soldiers who basically follow Meserve's every command.  John Leguizamo, who plays Diaz, the newest soldier to the platoon, is great in an early performance.  You see, when Meserve first says that he and the rest of the men are going to rape the young Vietnamese girl, Diaz decides that he won't participate.  Diaz says that he will back up Eriksson when it comes down to it.  Eriksson agrees that he will back up Diaz as well.  When it's Eriksson's turn to rape the girl, he looks at Diaz to back him up.  Meserve, Clark, and Hatcher then begin calling Eriksson names like 'fag' and 'queer' when he refuses.  Diaz, seeing the kind of ridicule that Eriksson just went through chickens out and goes into the hut with the girl.       It seems to me though, that Diaz is the only soldier out of the four that anyone can ever really have any sympathy towards.  I mean you have to feel sorry for him especially even though it wasn't really his fault for going along with the others in the rape.  If you think about it very carefully, you'll realize that he was FORCED into the rape.  This is a very debatable topic here because obviously Diaz is a person with morals, something the other three soldiers lacked.  Of course, one could easily blame him for not using common sense for going along with the soldiers, but what you have to understand is that it was peer pressure that made him do it.  All that happened was that he simply cracked under pressure.  Another thing that you have to remember is that this is set during a very stressful time and it's easy for anyone, even a person with good morals, to commit an unthinkable act.  Why do you think good people go badly all of a sudden?
I agree with one previous viewer that the Vietnam War truly brought out the worst in our American soldiers.  I've heard horrible stories about some people who claimed that the only reason that they enlisted into the United States army during that time was so that they could kill Vietnamese people. I know of one person who says that if he were of legal age, he would sign up to go into Afghanistan, just to kill some 'f*****g Arabs'.  It is exactly this kind of attitude that leads to atrocities like the one depicted in the film.  How many things like this really happened during the Vietnam War more so, the war in Afghanistan?  If so, how long will it be before they're brought to public attention?  I mean it took, what how long for the incident in 'Casualties of War' to be brought to public attention, two years?  Two years may not seem like much, but think about the family of that innocent girl who was wrongfully taken away from her home and was forced to service four out of five soldiers.  How those four men raped that young girl and then killed her and not have any regrets whatsoever is beyond anyone.
I think myself and everybody else, who has studied the causes of the Vietnam War, knows that the whole thing was a big mistake.  As stated above, young men were exposed to horrible conditions and were fighting a war that they are not even sure should have been fought.  I've heard that some soldiers did not even know why they were fighting.  So in conclusion, I really love this movie, but it's obvious that some people will hate it.  I think that before someone says, 'this movie sucks!' that it would be best to keep some of these things in mind.  Things like morality and the differences between right and wrong are all topics that need to be kept in mind when viewing this film.",10,2,4,8 May 2002
Event Horizon," Great!
","I remember when I watched the making of Event Horizon on HBO on day back in 1997.  I was thinking to myself,'What kind of movie is Event Horizon going to be, A sci-fi or horror?'  I missed the chance to see it when it was in theatres, so I rented it when it came out on tape.  The plot surrounds the Event Horizon, an enormous spaceship that has the ability to jump from one point in galaxy to another in seconds using the Gravity Drive, the device that makes this even possible.  Anyway, it disappears on its maiden voyage and mysteriously reappears 7 years later.  A rescue team led by (Laurence Fishburne) is sent to investigate.  When they arrive, they discover that no one is on the ship, but of course it doesn't mean they're alone.  Soon after they arrive, the crew members begin witnessing horrific visions as the ship begins 'toying' with there minds, searching deep down into their minds projecting their secrets and fears and turns them into horrifying reality. When I watched it, I had no idea that it was actually a horror movie and not a sci-fi film.  Viewers be warned, Event Horizon contains some really gory and sometimes grotesque images that are not pleasant to look at.  Event Horizon is a great horror movie and should be a classic.",10,1,4,11 October 2000
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Burton's 'Nightmare' is a dream come true
","By 1993, director Tim Burton was such a successful filmmaker in Hollywood that he was able to return to one of his most beloved early projects, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' It's certainly an inspired movie, as it is also very weird, and when I say 'weird,' I mean it's distinctly Burton.Even though it was directed with enough competency by Henry Selick, this groundbreaking stop-motion animation film is Burton all the way, as it contains ample 'esque' qualities that make this 'Nightmare' uniquely his vision.As the film opens in the twisted, 'Burton'-esque village of 'Halloweentown,' Jack Skellington, who is dually voiced by Chris Sarandon and longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, is celebrating another 'horrible' Halloween. You'll be shocked and amazed at some of the town's inhabitants, who include jazz-playing zombies, Four Tenor-like vampires, a wolf man, and a wheelchair-bound scientist who occasionally opens up his cranium to (literally) scratch his brain; his creation, a Frankenstein-like scarecrow named Sally (Catherine O'Hara), yearns for contact with others and is quite fond of Jack Skellington.But Jack's quickly growing tired of the same old routine year after year, and because he's so downtrodden with boredom, he ventures into the dark forest outside the town's borders, and accidentally stumbles onto the wondrous, jolly world of 'Christmastown.' Enticed by its splendor, he decides to bring back his discovery to the residents of Halloweentown, who of which are just as shocked by Christmas as he is. Jack gets the brilliant idea to pose as Santa Claus but hires three mischief-makers to kidnap the real Santa so he can share his own, misguided vision of Christmas with an unprepared world.Painstakingly and meticulously crafted, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a beautiful and wonderful film from start to finish. The most famous image of this film is the cover art, which features Skellington eerily silhouetted against a full moon while he stands atop a coiled hill that overlooks a desolate graveyard.Burton is such a wonderful director, who had already brought us one unique 'esque' vision after the other, especially with the first two 'Batman' films and 'Edward Scissorhands' behind him as of '93 when 'Nightmare' was made.10/10",10,181,212,10 December 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'
","I'll be fair in stating that 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is the perfect film to close out the turbulent summer of 2004. So far we've had 'The Passion of the Christ,' 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' and 'Spider-Man 2' - all of which have had a significant impact at the box office this summer.'Apocalypse' will be easy fodder for the critics, as they will balk early and be on alert for the slightest flaw. They'll pick apart the MTV-style editing, bad pacing, and seeming lack of an actual plot. Fanatics will pick apart the film for not staying true to the 'Resident Evil' video games. For the record, I never played the video games that 'Resident Evil' is based on, so I can't comment on accuracy.This film was really a birthday present for myself. I used one of two (count 'em - TWO!) free tickets that came with my purchase of the DVD for the first film 'Resident Evil (Deluxe Edition).' It doesn't disappoint in the action category or special effects, as there is plenty of both.7/10",7,1,3,12 September 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," A powerful film that shows the true cost of war
","'Grave of the Fireflies' is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's 'Akira,' or 'Princess Mononoke,' or 'Spirited Away' (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is 'Grave of the Fireflies.'What we have with 'Grave of the Fireflies,' is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked 'Grave of the Fireflies' is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.'Grave of the Fireflies' is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the 'Schindler's List' of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.",10,276,290,28 August 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 'The Last Jedi'
","I really felt that Rian Johnson's latest 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' only slightly better than 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015). This film is a little bit more original, in the sense that it isn't steeped in nostalgia for the original 'Star Wars' series that was released between 1977-1983, which I know grated some people who saw 'The Force Awakens.' It still pays a lot of homage and reference to the original trilogy, and tries to do its best to distance itself from George Lucas's prequel trilogy that was released between 1999-2005.You should see it to satisfy your curiosity and enjoy yourself.10/10",10,3,28,2 February 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Like someone else already said - 'A New Hope'
","I have a strange history with the Guardians of the Galaxy, that rag-tag team of intergalactic mercenaries (and more or less, superheroes) most famous for their appearances in comic books published by Marvel Comics.The first I heard of Guardians of the Galaxy, was in 2008, when Marvel Comics debuted a new line-up, which was a reboot of the first Guardians of the Galaxy team that first appeared in 1969. For one reason or another, I skipped over it. Then last year, a friend of mine who owns a comic book store sold me a copy of 'Guardians of the Galaxy #1' for $45, at a discount from its original price of $50. I read through the book quickly to get an idea of what it was about, but I didn't absorb the details then like I should have.Fast-forward to tonight: I just got done watching James Gunn's big-budget 2014 adaptation of the comics, 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' I have to say that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' has a chance to be A New Hope (hint, hint) for superhero movies.You see, since 2004, I've grown increasingly disappointed in the state of superhero movies. Readers familiar with my posts on here, know that 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), is, in my opinion, the greatest superhero movie ever made. I say this because, not just because Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero, but because 'Spider-Man 2' captured on film EXACTLY what made the comics so revolutionary when they first appeared on the scene in 1962: it was the perfect cinematic update for Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man because it made us all realize that being a superhero is not an easy task, and was not something that Peter Parker (played there excellently by Tobey Maguire) was not entirely willing to bear - exactly as it happened in the original comics. Ever since 'Spider-Man 2,' I've waited for another superhero film to capture that same pathos, genuine emotion, and being able to make a genuine connection to our version of the ancient Greek gods, but alas, I've been continually disappointed.That's not to say that superhero films made since then have been bad - quite the opposite - but I've just been looking for something with more feeling, and meaning, attached to it.Or something just different altogether. 'Chronicle' in 2012 represented a breath of fresh air to what at that time, I felt, was an ailing genre. Now, with 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' I see a novel, off-beat property get a lively, big-budget adaptation for the 2014 superhero craze.'Guardians of the Galaxy' is all of 'Star Wars,' Indiana Jones, and superheroes all rolled into one. (A New Hope for superheroes movies that combines so many different elements from so many different properties into one.) Though I know very little off-hand about the series, I came out of this film definitely more informed than going in. The film begins in 1988, with young Peter Quill losing his dying mother to cancer (thus representing the film's most - and only real - sincere and heartfelt moment, which coincidentally brings up painful memories for me, being that I lost my mother earlier this year to cancer in much the same fashion young Peter does). Immediately afterward, he's abducted by aliens and then we're catapulted 26 years into the future and into another galaxy, Far, Far, Away from our own.Peter Quill/Star-Lord (now played by Chris Pratt), is a mercenary, wannabe Indiana Jones going around the galaxy trying to retrieve priceless artifacts for his handler (emphasis on the wannabe, because he tries, and fails, to live up to his 'Star-Lord' moniker, often with hilarious results), infamous blue-skinned space pirate Yondu Udonta (Gunn regular Michael Rooker). A wanted man by intergalactic authorities, Quill's travels bring him together with several other hard-luck losers, freaks, and outcasts (and all-around bad-asses): the green-skinned assassin Gamora ('Avatar' Zoe Saldana); hulking, vengeance-seeking Drax (professional wrestler Dave Bautista); the wise-cracking gun-slinger - and my personal favorite and break-out character to hopefully rival the popularity of the X-Men's Wolverine - Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper); and Rocket Raccoon's mindless muscle, a walking tree stump known only as Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Together, these five unlikely anti-heroes must come together to save the universe from Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), who wishes to lay waste to a nearby planet full of billions of innocent people using a newly discovered orb of mysterious and deadly power.It must be said that Troma graduate James Gunn (who also wrote Zack Snyder's 2004 breakthrough hit 'Dawn of the Dead') has fashioned himself a different - not necessarily new - superhero film. Screen-time is evenly divided up amongst the five leads, who all turn in wry, slightly self-knowing performances. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' plays well throughout its 121-minute running time. Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon oozes slyness, coolness, and general bad-a**ery. Quite frankly, in the theater his character seemed to get the best response from everyone. And in true Marvel Comics fashion, beneath his hard-edged exterior lies an unwanted mutant freak of nature with no mission or purpose in life and no real connections to anyone else in the universe (except for Groot, that is).'Guardians of the Galaxy' looks to be A New Hope for the superhero movie genre - a superhero movie that combines 'Star Wars,' Indiana Jones, and superheroes all into one. Let's wait and see what they can do with this one.10/10",10,3,7,5 August 2014
Evil Dead," 'Evil Dead' (2013)
","For this horror film fan, the original 1982 Sam Raimi-directed 'The Evil Dead' remains one of the most purely terrifying motion pictures experiences of my lifetime. Its superior 1987 sequel/remake 'Evil Dead II' (also directed by Raimi) was the series high point - and my personal favorite of the original 'Evil Dead' trilogy - and was also a perfect marriage of horror and slapstick comedy. 1992's 'Army of Darkness' was more fantasy than horror, but it was nonetheless a worthy closer to the original series.Now it's 2013, and it appears that reboots/remakes of classic horror films are everywhere. It was inevitable that 'The Evil Dead' would get the remake/reboot treatment at some point. I was firmly against the idea of a remake/reboot of 'The Evil Dead' since the beginning. I could not imagine Sam Raimi - who ascended to the ranks of Hollywood blockbuster-dom with his work on the 'Spider-Man' trilogy from 2002-2007 - wanting to hop on the Hollywood bandwagon to remake his first hit movie.Alas, 2013's 'Evil Dead,' which marks the debut of Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez, was not the disaster it could have so easily been. Raimi, Rob Tapert, and the almighty Bruce Campbell himself all return as producers on this latest outing Into The Woods. And believe you me, it's not that bad. While the movie starts and stops early on and has an irritating tendency in the earliest proceedings to sometimes elicit unintended snickers out of the audience, 'Evil Dead' almost always plays it straight - much like the 1982 original, even though there may be one or two moments of gallows humor to liven the otherwise relentlessly grim mood.Things begin with an adventure to an isolated cabin in the woods: Mia (Jane Levy) is a recovering junkie who has been hauled out here by her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), and their mutual friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and David's girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) as part of her treatment after all other attempts to get clean & sober have failed - so now Mia has to go the detox route cold turkey. While exploring the cabin, they somehow or another wind up in the cellar, where someone slaughtered a bunch of poor felines as part of some kind of abandoned ritualistic sacrifice, and discover the so-called 'Book of the Dead.' Eric unwisely reads aloud the incantations within it, thus awakening the malevolent supernatural forces that had been lying dormant in the woods outside the cabin. One by one, the friends are slowly possessed by these demonic forces, leaving only one lone survivor to fend them off until morning.'Evil Dead' does not play around. Much of what made 'The Evil Dead' so purely horrifying has remained intact here: gore, self-mutilation, power tools, demonic possession, bodily dismemberment, and more gore. In fact, there's so much going on here in terms of gory special effects that at one point it's literally raining down blood. (Where's Slayer when you need them to provide some background noise for the slaughter?) Believe me, once the terror starts, 'Evil Dead' becomes an almost relentless shock- and gore-fest - though obviously because we've seen it all before it lacks the intensity of Raimi's original classic.Alvarez and his co-scriptwriter Rodo Sayagues pay plenty of homage to 'The Evil Dead' (it should be noted that this reboot combines elements of both 'The Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead II' - which was done, I would guess, to please die-hard fans of the original film series). Alvarez is also good in keeping up the tension throughout the picture, again in remaining in touch with the spirit of the original film and its sequels (even though it ultimately lacks the ferocious intensity of those films).It should again be noted that 'Evil Dead' is drenched in blood. This is perhaps the most relentlessly blood-soaked 'R'-rated horror picture to be released by a major American film studio (TriStar Pictures) so far this millennium - unless you maybe count Neil Marshall's 'The Descent' (2005), despite the fact that film was originally a British production released by Lionsgate Films here in the United States. How this movie managed to secure an 'R' rating with so much blood is beyond me.'Evil Dead' - It'll swallow your soul, maybe, if you let it.7/10P.S.: Watch after the credits - 'Groovy.'",7,1,4,25 October 2014
The Evil Dead," 'Evil' Indeed!
","As a birthday present to myself (and to gear up for the upcoming Halloween movie season), yesterday I bought the 'Book of the Dead' edition of Sam Raimi's 1982 horror classic, 'The Evil Dead.' I had rented it the night before and much to my mother's dismay, I instantly fell in love with it. 'The Evil Dead' concerns five friends, including Ash (cult favorite Bruce Campbell), as they go on a vacation to the mountains. They spend the night in one of those spooky log cabins and as you know, trouble's a brewing. One of them, discovers the infamous 'Book of the Dead' and as the plot requires, they read from it, not knowing that doing so would be opening up a Pandora's Box of ghastly horrors. One by one the friends are possessed by the malevolent forces that had been lying dormant in the woods, leaving only Ash to fight them off.'The Evil Dead' is truly a classic in every sense. It's not scary at all, but does have quite a lot of tension. I would guess that if this is scary to any degree, it's not because of atmosphere really, but more because of the horrific makeup used and the incredibly gory special effects. All of this is lightened up by a really dark sense of humor that would become more apparent in the later sequels.Sam Raimi really knows how to direct a good horror movie and of course would try to shake off this image over the next 20 years, which would lead him to directing last year's 'Spider-Man.' The hand-held camera shots, up close angles of Bruce Campbell in later scenes, is all genius movie-making.'The Evil Dead' is a great horror film, don't miss it. 10/10",10,3,8,15 September 2003
8 Mile," A warm reception for Eminem fans everywhere
","'8 Mile' is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. 'Rabbit', a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through 'battles', which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new.'8 Mile' certainly is a moving and very touching drama.  Eminem proves here that he really can act and in fact may have a future in motion pictures. This does not mean we will be hearing him thanking his producer Paul Rosenberg next year at the Oscars, but we can expect to him to receive a lot of praise for future movie roles.  It's quite obvious that some people will not like '8 Mile', just because of Eminem's controversial history.  The film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Eminem's hit single 'Lose Yourself' really does have a lot emotion put into it.   
Eminem, since he burst onto the music scene in 1999 with his critically-acclaimed/lambasted album 'The Slim Shady LP', he has been met with a lot of controversy, as well as praise.  Despite the often humorous content of his songs, there are many dark under tones in them as well.  In my opinion, too much has been made about his lyrics, most of which revolve around topics like homophobia, murder, and his failed relationship with his on/off wife, Kim.  Despite all of this, I think that people have overlooked the fact that he said the only thing that truly matters to him is his daughter, Hailie Jade.  Also, if people believed Eminem really was a homophobic, do you still think he would have agreed to perform 'Stan' with Elton John?  As a longtime fan of Eminem and his music, I try not to let such criticisms get to me, but sometimes you just have to say 'What the hell?  Are they really necessary?'  I don't think so.  The problem is that people today are just too biased when it comes to people like Eminem.  He's not another Vanilla Ice and '8 Mile' is not an attempt to cash in on his success like 'Cool As Ice' was.  I have a list of grievances that people need to realize about Eminem:<ul><li>First of all, do not disrespect this man.  I feel that many of the people who hate Eminem have never actually listened to one of his songs.  In my opinion, they have only listened to small clips that have been played on some discussion about his controversial lyrics.  If you actually listened to some of his songs, you'll realize that he is a very distraught young person with a lot to say.</li></ul><ul><li>Don't watch '8 Mile' with a predetermined mindset.  People who have already made up their minds about Eminem's talents are less likely to enjoy themselves much more than people who believe in him.  </li></ul><ul><li>To non-believers, if Eminem really did not have any talent, like so many people seem to think now, how is it that all of his records: 'The Slim Shady LP', 'The Marshall Mathers LP', 'Devils Night' (with group D-12) and 'The Eminem Show' together have grossed more than $12 million?  I think that it is a clear sign of TRUE TALENT.</li></ul><ul><li>Also do you believe had Eminem been black and rapping about such 'controversial' subject matter, that he would be famous like he is now?  No, because most likely no one would dare even produce him.  That said, I'm African-American and I don't care that Eminem is white and is rapping about such things.</li></ul><ul><li>I think that too many people have made his race too big of an issue. Eminem knows that he is white and will be nothing else.  He does not display to us a 'thuggish' image that some people think that any rapper should have. Also, he does not rap about the things that some people seem to think is destroying rap music.</li></ul>Eminem does have quite a future in store for him.  I'm sure that we can expect to be seeing a lot more of him later on.",10,198,258,9 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Beginning
","With the two-volume series of films that come to be known as 'Kill Bill,' Quentin Tarantino has achieved a level of creativity lacking in most modern films that will take years to surpass.  'Kill Bill' is, in fact, an amalgam of all the grindhouse cinema outings that Tarantino made during the 70s.When you think real hard about it, the plot to 'Kill Bill' is absolutely ludicrous, and under the direction of a normal filmmaker, wouldn't make it past the 50-minute mark.  But under Tarantino's careful guidance, that ludicrous plot remains ludicrous, but he injects his requited love of cinema into the material and the plot suddenly takes a life and a whole new spin.'Kill Bill' is by far Tarantino's most accomplished work as a director, considering that I typically favor his non-directorial efforts ('True Romance,' 'Natural Born Killers,' 'From Dusk Till Dawn') over his own directorial outings ('Reservoir Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Jackie Brown').I certainly look forward to more from Quentin Tarantino in the future being that with 'Kill Bill,' he has created a cinematic epic of one man's love of movies and then seeing it realized on the screen.",10,0,2,10 August 2004
Saw II," 'Saw II' horror feature ups the ante second time around
","It's truly amazing what the right amount of hype and the right kind of audience can do for a movie; 'Saw II' embraces its following so that genre veterans can be full-on prepared for another grisly gore-fest designed to test the human will to simply survive. This time, the Jigsaw killer (Tobin Bell), is out in the open, and does not speak to us through a gruesome-looking puppet or a tape recording.As we remember from 'Saw' (2004), Jigsaw is technically not a serial killer, at least in the traditional sense; he often sets up elaborate methods for his victims to kill themselves (i.e., a man rubbed down in flammable chemicals must find the combination to a safe etched in a wall before the candle he's holding ignites him, or another victim must crawl through a yard of barb wire to an exit before a timer runs out and the door slams shut).This time, Jigsaw sets up a funhouse for eight unknown people (including Shawnee Smith as 'Saw' survivor Amanda, back for round two) who are all somehow connected, and it's up to dogged cop Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) to figure out where they are and save them. As for the poor souls in the booby-trapped house, they have three hours to locate the exit, or antidote, before they are all nerve-gassed to death. They're all the typical undesirables who have to prove their worth if they are to survive by playing Jigsaw's twisted game. Matthews takes it personal because his son is one of Jigsaw's latest victims in the house.In the director's seat this time is newcomer Darren Lynn Bousman, who shares a screenplay credit with original 'Saw' screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who played one of Jigsaw's victims in the first film. 'Saw II' is at least clever enough to roughly follow the same pattern as its predecessor, but is even more clever to at least build on those ideas and not repeat itself. Whannell and Bousman's script still has that rare distinction of being simultaneously brilliant and god-awful and the players are still unlikeable, but Bousman is able to keep enough of a firm grip on the material that it never slips into mediocrity or stupidity.The nightmarish, funhouse tricks & traps scenario is something straight out of an S & M fantasy, highlighted greatly by tripped-out editor Kevin Greutert and David Hackl's twisted, goth-inspired production design. I'm sure that for this casual horror fan, 'Saw II' has still provided sufficient, delightful pre-Halloween entertainment, just as 'Saw' did two years ago. I would guess that 'Saw III' can only bring about a thoughtful conclusion, if that is indeed what Jigsaw has in store for us later this week.8/10",8,0,1,24 October 2006
Ip Man," 'Ip Man' (2008)
","Yip Wai-shun's 2008 historical martial arts action-drama 'Ip Man' is one of the most rollicking, rocking, socking martial arts films in years. It also has the distinction of being one of the few martial arts movies to be based on a true story. In this case, it's Wing Chun Grandmaster Yip Man (1893-1972), who once instructed a teenage Bruce Lee in Wing Chun (and we all know where Lee went afterward). The film basically tells a self-contained story set before and during the Second Sino-Japanese War in Fo Shan, China, with Ip Man (Donnie Yen, in a perfectly balanced dramatic action performance) helping to restore Chinese pride and nationalism in the wake of oppression by the invading Imperial Japanese Army. It all culminates in a vicious public - and symbolic - bout against General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), the commanding officer in charge of the Japanese military forces in Fo Shan. While 'Ip Man' pulls no punches (no pun intended) in detailing the brutal oppression the Japanese inflicted upon the Chinese, 'Ip Man' goes a step further in not showing a one-sided portrait of the Japanese (like so many other films have done in the past). The Japanese are indeed shown to be the brutal aggressors that they were doing that time, it also plainly shows that General Miura is at least a man of honor. The film's action sequences (choreographed by Sammo Hung) are fast and vicious, with star Donnie Yen's (a veteran of countless martial arts vehicles) excellent fighting skills at front and center. I can't wait for 'Ip Man 2.'8/10",8,0,1,18 January 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," Awesome!
","I can only say it in one word: Awesome! This is the absolute best vampire film I have ever seen and also the violentist.  Other more recent vampire films like Blade and Vampires are great but From Dusk Till Dawn is by far the best.  George Clooney is cool in his role as a play-it-by-the-rules bank robber and Quentin Tarantino is totally wicked as his psychotic younger brother.  From Dusk Till Dawn is also in my opinion probably one of the more original vampire films out there.  The idea of vampires in Mexico is completely original.  Viewers be warned however, From Dusk Till Dawn is incredibly violent, there is a lot of cursing, and Cheech Marin makes a barrage of funny one-liners that all include a certain female body part. Anyway, to sum it up, From Dusk Till Dawn is an original film, with an original plot, and some great casting and Salma Hayek ain't bad to look at either. 10/10",10,0,2,25 October 2000
Here Comes the Boom," 'Here Comes the Boom' (2012)
","It's been a long time since I last reviewed a new(-ish) movie for the lovely crowds of IMDb. Earlier today, I got the chance to watch the 2012 martial arts/sports comedy 'Here Comes the Boom,' directed by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison regular Frank Coraci ('The Wedding Singer,' 'The Waterboy,' 'Zookeeper') and starring the always-affable Kevin James.James is one of the most watchable and likable personalities working in big movies these days. Perhaps, that's why his starring character in 'Here Comes the Boom' works so well. The genial, portly James plays 42-year-old, apathetic Boston-area high school biology teacher Scott Voss, who's just screaming for a big 'Rocky'-style inspirational makeover.Voss's inspirational calling comes in the form of looming budget cuts that threatens his school's extracurricular activities, which includes best-pal and dedicated music teacher Marty Streb (Henry Winkler) being laid off and his band program getting axed - unless someone somehow magically comes up with the $48,000 needed to save everything. Bake sales and car washes won't cut it, so Voss does the unthinkable and signs up for a series of amateur mixed martial arts (MMA) bouts, where even the loser can net up to $10,000 - which is more than what most of today's educators make in a month - and the winner can make off with a $50,000 grand prize.But because Voss is 42 and out-of-shape (though he was a division-one wrestler in college) and COMPLETELY out of his element, no one takes his scheme seriously, though he does find unlikely support in Dutch immigrant and MMA trainer Niko (retired Dutch-American UFC champ Bas Rutten), Mark DellaGrotte (playing himself), Marty, and lovely school nurse Bella Flores (the always-lovely Salma Hayek). And somewhere in there, Voss also manages to find what it takes to live again and inspire his students and everyone else at his school.'Here Comes the Boom' is pretty by-the-numbers formulaic. But Kevin James keeps everything above water with his cool and personable Everyman portrayal of the once-apathetic Scott Voss. Salma Hayek isn't really given all that much to do, but - damn it - does she light up every scene that she graces. One of the great charms of 'Here Comes the Boom' is watching Bas Rutten deliver (what I've seen from him) his best acting portrayal, since it's well-known that most athletes are pretty poor screen performers - the guy energizes every sequence he's in; but watching Rutten here, you get to asking yourself why he hasn't been in more movies before this one.'Here Comes the Boom' isn't an Oscar-winner by a long shot, but the movie works because of two key players - Kevin James and Bas Rutten. It's not a knock-out winner, but it does land a few solid punches to the gut that will elicit a few painful, well-deserved laughs.8/10",8,0,1,13 April 2014
Paranormal Activity," A review of 'Paranormal Activity'
","Oren Peli's 'Paranormal Activity' is actually one of the better-made horror films to come out in recent years. The movie continues the trend we saw popularized 11 years ago in 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999), which contrary to a popular belief at the time, uses largely unknown actors being filmed in a documentary-style manner that elicits the notion that we're watching real footage, and that what we are seeing happening in said footage is indeed real.Alas, 'Paranormal Activity,' like 'The Blair Witch Project' and its successors 'Cloverfield' and 'Quarantine' (both of which were released in 2008), are all fake. From a critical standpoint, this is both brilliant and frustrating. It's brilliant because despite what we already know that these movies are obviously fake, the style and presentation are convincing enough that what we're seeing is truly happening and is 'real' within the context of the film.It's frustrating because many times, the best and most frequently used manner of eliciting realism for such documentary-style film-making is that the camera is often hand-held, which can sometimes induce vertigo and motion sickness in those who suffer from such afflictions. Critics will also point out that the camera-work is so frenetic and unfocused sometimes that it makes it hard to make out what's going on the screen. Fans will note the exact opposite: that many times the person holding the camera is an amateur, and thus we many times only see what they see, which ironically can sometimes be very little and the disorientation they experience in said events becomes our disorientation to experience.What a mouthful.Getting back to 'Paranormal Activity,' what makes this film stand out from those others ('Cloverfield' so far is my personal favorite - I'm a fan of Japanese monster movies and it won me over - so sue me), is that everything we see is taking place inside a normal-looking suburban household. Katie (Katie Featherston) and her live-in boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) are a young suburban couple who are conducting an experiment in which they are trying to document the Paranormal Activity that takes place in their home as they sleep. They set up a camera - which is conveniently placed on a tripod facing their bed as they sleep (thus eliminating the chances of the viewer suffering vertigo and/or motion sickness) - to try to document any supernatural occurrences that happen during the night when they're not awake.Thus, eventually a supernatural presence does make itself known to them, and the camera is able to effectively capture every occurrence that takes place in their bedroom, and it is indeed scary. (If you see the raw footage, it is so convincing that the special effects employed to make said supernatural occurrences seem real are virtually flawless, and are incorporated into the raw film footage effortlessly.) Eventually, for those of us that remember 'Poltergeist' (1982) all those years ago, these Paranormal Activities start out as being benign in nature, but grow in malevolence and ferocity and violence as time goes on, and Katie, who suffers from past traumatic experiences with these evil forces, begins to break down both mentally and emotionally as a result of the pressure.The primary performances by Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are good in luring us into their household as they go about their everyday lives and how their everyday lives are eventually torn asunder by malevolent supernatural forces of unknown origin. The heaviest burden is placed upon the delicate shoulders of Katie Featherston, who seems to be the primary target of the malevolent forces haunting her and Micah's home. She's obviously a bright young woman, but to see her suffer at the hands of an unknown supernatural presence is quite harrowing, and the camera is quite good in documenting her gradual descent into a virtual hell. Unlike the screamers in 'The Blair Witch Project,' you do feel some sort of connection with Katie, and feel for the pain and torture she endures.Like the many sorts of movies using this formula, 'Paranormal Activity' is incredibly well-made and the documentary-style of film-making is good in eliciting some genuinely frightening moments that increase in intensity as the film progresses. While it's not 'The Exorcist' (1973), it is a worthy entry into the horror firmament, something a lot of horror films using standard film-making techniques are consistently failing to do nowadays.I'm not sure I could really recommend watching this film at night and/or in the dark. (I cheated and watched it during the day with a friend because she confessed she couldn't do it either.)8/10",8,0,1,3 July 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," An engrossing, edge-of-your-seat... love story? 'The Adjustment Bureau'
","'The Adjustment Bureau' has been advertised as a sci-fi thriller about the mysterious behind-the-scenes machinations that may or may not guide our everyday lives as part of some Divine Plan. While it is essentially a science fiction parable about fate-vs.-free will (based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'Adjustment Team'), at its heart, really, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is a love story, and a very gripping one, at that.Dick (who passed away in 1982), you will remember, has had several of his works adapted posthumously into big-budget science fiction classics - the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' became 'Blade Runner' (1982), the short story 'We Can Remember it For You Wholesale' became 'Total Recall' (1990), and the short story 'The Minority Report' became 'Minority Report' (2002). 'The Adjustment Bureau' is the latest Dick adaptation to feature stellar performances and intelligent subtext that asks the ultimate question: Is it possible to deviate from a Divine Plan in favor of one's own personal destiny? What happens when we pit 'What could be' against 'What will be'?These are just some of the big question facing David Norris (Matt Damon), an aspiring New York congressman running for the U.S. Senate. After a crushing defeat his first time running, he retreats into brief despair to practice his concession speech. Hope comes in the form of a chance meeting with the lovely, free-spirited ballerina Elise (Emily Blunt). The two thus hit it off immediately, but soon Fate - in the form of the fate-controlling Adjustment Bureau - intervenes and reveals to David that he has a big future ahead of him, a future that could include a bid for the White House. To David, that sounds great. The problem: his future doesn't include Elise in it. And the big theatrics in this film feature David using his Free Will to deviate from a Big Set Divine Plan to make his own destiny with the one great love of his life.'The Adjustment Bureau' is the first truly great film of 2011 I've seen so far. After seven months so far of films that have continually failed to capture my interest, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is finally a film that not only captured my interest, but thoroughly engrossed me in its story, characters, humor and carefully-plotted revisionist universe of a world controlled from behind-the-scenes by mysterious, dapper, fedora-wearing Men in Black Overcoats who manipulate things big and small to ensure that things stay on-track according to The Plan. And, trust me, the mysterious Adjustment Bureau pulls out all stops to ensure that the plan succeeds, and sometimes these machinations can be quite humorous. But David never ever gives up, despite the many Rube Goldberg-style stumbling blocks put forth by the Bureau to keep him on his pre-determined path in life.Perhaps more than any other Dick adaptation in the last 30 years, 'The Adjustment Bureau' has characters and situations that are easily identifiable to everyday folks like you and me. While previous films were mostly set in dystopic futures, this film is set in the present, more or less, so there's no loss of time or space. What's more, how many of us have ever wondered if the set course we're on in life is what is truly meant to be? How many of us have ever wondered if mysterious forces are working behind-the-scenes guiding our every move? Will we ever meet 'The One'? (This latter question is especially relevant to everyday people, in my honest opinion.) If so, can it be God (or for you spiritualists, agnostics, and New Ageists out there, a Higher Power?)? Allah? Buddha? E.T.? 'The Chairman'? Who really knows?Matt Damon has never been better as the high-strung politician trying to outrun his destiny at every corner (many times, literally, as proved by this film's climatic ending foot-chase through the streets of New York). He takes his role seriously and is quite superb, as is his love interest played by Emily Blunt. The actress is equally important here not just because she's the love interest, but her heartbreak as the forces manipulating their lives trying to keep her and David apart really make you hope that they're able to overcome any pre-determined paths in life and wind up together. From the second they first meet, there's an instant burst of chemistry between them, which is something that is rarely achieved in movies these days. And what's even greater is that throughout the thick & thin of the plot, that chemistry remains intact and never folds.George Nolfi wrote and directed 'The Adjustment Bureau' and while I'm not sure if this is his debut film and if it is, it's an impressive debut. Nolfi definitely has a future in the thriller genre if he chooses that route; what does Fate have in store for him, I wonder? I was thoroughly on the edge of my seat the entire time throughout this picture, which ultimately seems like a cross between Dick's own 'The Minority Report' and a high-concept (is there anything else?) Hitchcockian-style thriller. I think that debt is owed to Nolfi's confident writing and directing, and the sure-fire performances of the two leads.'The Adjustment Bureau' is very easily one of this year's best and smartest films. Its being largely ignored at the box office only baffles me.10/10",10,1,5,7 July 2011
Black Hawk Down," A 6/10, but that doesn't mean I hate it
","Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down' is a rather brutal and unrelenting war film.  It certainly does paint a realistic view of soldiers in battle.  I don't know how much the film remains faithful to the book, so I won't bother with a grievous comparison.  This is not Ridley Scott's best film; that credit really goes to 'Gladiator'.  It has some really good isolated moments, but none that really are spectacular.  But I want to point out some things, both good and bad.  1) I personally do not think that this film glorifies war since as one previous viewer already mentioned, it shows horrible things happening to both American soldiers and Somalis.  A soldier is blown in half, a Somali person is shot dead in the street while a child frantically tries to figure out what happened, another Somali is blown apart by a stray rocket, and an American soldier is killed when he's impaled by a rocket.  So you see, it's horrific, unrelenting war.2) I do not consider this to be by no means an excellent war film, but an endlessly watchable one; Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' is clearly the greatest war film ever made.3) The British actors who are trying to speak American.  I'm sorry, but I just cannot buy Jason Isaacs speaking with a southern accent.  Ewan McGregor seems to be the only one that sounds reasonably convincing.4) I'm African-American and I do think that this film is sort of racist, since I've heard that a substantial portion of Mark Bowden's book had been omitted from the film, which detailed the Somali cause.  From what I've heard, it had been omitted for apparently no reason, other than to really give a sense of soldiers fighting bravely against impossible odds.  All the soldiers are white (there is a black soldier amongst them who only speaks a few lines) and are shooting at hundreds of Somalis.  5) I think that this film presents an unfair portrait of the Somalis. With the exception of a cab driver who has been coerced into helping the Americans and another Somali man who was arrested, there are no other signs of the Somali view.  Thus, this gives 'Black Hawk Down' a one-sided view of a battle that should never have happened.    6) I did feel sorry for the American soldiers at certain points during the film.  Such as when the three soldiers are in the helicopter and are defending it from oncoming Somalis.  Another instance would be the one soldier who gets separated from the rest and has to eventually find his way back to the group.  So as you can clearly see, I have many mixed feelings about 'Black Hawk Down', but I did thoroughly enjoy myself while watching this film.",6,1,2,7 February 2003
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Age Of Ultron
","Joss Whedon returns to write and direct 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron,' which is not in any way related to the critically acclaimed Marvel Comics comic book series 'Age of Ultron' by Brian Michael Bendis, Bryan Hitch, Brandon Peterson, and Carlos Pacheco - except, of course, for the title 'Age of 'Ultron.' (As a side-note, I read this series before I ever saw the movie, which has a completely different story-line from Whedon's film.)'Avengers: Age of Ultron' takes place three years after 'The Avengers' (2012), in which the Avengers team of super-powered heroes - Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) - must Re-Assemble to combat Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a rogue artificial intelligence that was created by Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner in a good-willed, if mistaken, attempt to protect the Earth from all threats, human and extraterrestrial, and to create a world where the Avengers are no longer needed.Of course, and in what is perhaps Marvel's attempt to one-up the similarly-themed 'Terminator' franchise, Ultron - Marvel's version of Terminator's Skynet - comes to view humanity as a threat, and that the only way to truly achieve peace is to eliminate all human beings. So the Avengers, with newcomers, and twin mutants - Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his sister Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - go to work to try to stop the ego-maniacal and quickly evolving Ultron before it destroys all of humanity. (In another side-note, it is worth mentioning that the pairing of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen here as siblings is really interesting since just one year before, they played husband and wife in 2014's 'Godzilla.')'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a superior sequel to 'The Avengers.' I've waited a year to see this movie and it didn't disappoint (much). I don't need to talk about the other performers because we've grown so accustomed to them already and we know who they are. And although strong supporting characters such as James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) make small appearances here & there, the real star here (and the real reason to see this movie, period), for me, was the truly awesome James Spader as Ultron.It is well-known that in the original comics, Ultron was actually the creation of Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, and the maniacal robot harbored a murderous personal grudge against its creator in a bizarre twist on the so-called 'Oedipus Complex'; but here, he was created by Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner. Ultron is also one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, and one of the few non-human characters to take that mantle. So although Spader himself never appears on-screen, he was quite menacing as Ultron, and with just his distinct voice alone, he was able to make Ultron a truly formidable adversary to the Avengers, with a darkly humorous personality to boot. His portrayal of this psychopathic robot from Hell is one of the better portrayals of superhero-movie villainy in recent years.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' was an exciting and action-packed entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - which, of course, was one of the principal titles that would set up this year's 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016).10/10",10,2,6,27 May 2016
The Dark Knight," Darkest 'Knight'
","'The Dark Knight' may or may not get the title for the greatest superhero film of all time (questionable, but I still hold that 2004's 'Spider-Man 2' is the greatest), but unquestionably what will forever make it memorable is that it features the much-talked-about final performance of Heath Ledger, who passed away tragically from an accidental drug overdose earlier this year, thus making 'The Dark Knight' a must-see at the movies this summer. His performance here is the film's shining achievement, although strangely enough he doesn't get that much screen time in a movie that runs 152 minutes and he's only on screen maybe half that time. (In what is) Probably the most beloved adaptation of the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane and who first appeared in 'Detective Comics #27,' Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is again battling the forces of evil as the Dark Knight of grim Gotham City, aided in his endeavors by several loyal confidants including faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Things get underway when a bank robbery (a la 1995's 'Heat') involving clown-faced goons yields a new and terrifying menace to law & order in Gotham City: The Joker (Ledger), a disfigured criminal mastermind looking to spread chaos and destruction and bring about the downfall of the Dark Knight. Meanwhile, Bruce (forever brooding) is vying for the affections of ADA Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from 2005's 'Batman Begins') against Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own personal crusade to rid Gotham City of crime and corruption. At a hefty 2 1/2-hour running time, director Christopher Nolan seemed to throw everything into 'The Dark Knight,' even in one interview I read calling this film this series' 'The Empire Strikes Back.' Perhaps an accurate assertion, since a lot does happen here but occasionally this oft-brilliant and mesmerizing film is prone to stalling in its quieter moments (and believe me, there are some). I do find it quite odd that since we're talking about Gotham City, one of the darkest places in comic books, there is an amazing amount of light, since many of the action scenes take place in broad daylight rather than under a menacing cover of darkness. The sheer brilliance of 'The Dark Knight' is the belated Heath Ledger. Like Brandon Lee in 'The Crow' (1994), this film is a testament, it is the last great work of a truly great actor and he will be missed. As the Joker, Ledger is cold and calculating, and truly menacing. He's evil and madness incarnate, and who could forget his now-classic 'Why so serious?' 'The Dark Knight' is far from perfect, I already mentioned the overly long running time and the seeming tacked-on rise of a deadly new villain, but the performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker and some stellar acting from the leads definitely makes this Dark Knight, the Darkest Knight for comic book superhero movies.10/10",10,10,21,5 August 2008
Toy Story," 'Toy Story' - The Toys are in town and something more
","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that 'Toy Story' is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of 'Toy Story's' fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new 'it' item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit 'Finding Nemo' in 2003) and Joel Cohen, 'Toy Story' is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love 'Toy Story,' and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10",10,4,4,6 September 2005
The Graduate," 'The Graduate,' with top honors!
","Incredibly enough, the only reason I even had the slightest clue about this movie was due to an episode of 'The Simpsons' a few years back. Now that I've seen 'The Graduate' in its entirety, I now see where that famous episode got its inspiration. Of course being that I'm only 24, that is perhaps the reason why I never quite caught on to the connection between this movie and that particular 'Simpsons' episode, and plus I have an entire century of movies to pick up the references from!On the serious side, though, 'The Graduate' is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies ever made. Directed by Mike Nichols (who won an Oscar for Best Director) and adapted from the novel of the same name by Charles Webb, 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (a then-30-year-old Dustin Hoffman in real life, in his film debut) is constantly on the verge of panic within the film's first 20 minutes. He's just graduated from college (hence the film's title), and has no clue about what he wants to do with his life. His upper-crust parents mistakenly think that he'll probably go to graduate school, after some much-needed rest & relaxation, of course. Instead, Ben just spends his days floating about aimlessly decked out in full scuba gear at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool.Ben does get some direction - or is it misdirection? - when Mrs. Robinson (the late Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner, tries to seduce him, and he eventually lets her, in private liaisons at an upscale downtown hotel. Ben's own youthful, post-college confusion and Mrs. Robinson's marital unhappiness is a match made in the hellish depths of suburban affluence. The affair continues on for a while with little problems, that is, until, Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), the Robinson's college-bound daughter, comes home from Berkeley and Ben suddenly finds some direction in his life because for the first in his life since he came home from college, he now knows what he wants because suddenly he's in love! This of course, causes all sorts of problems because he can't date Elaine while still carrying on a sordid affair with her mother!I've found yet another screen hero in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Benjamin Braddock. He's the character that defined a generation; not just for college kids circa-1967, but for college kids 43 years later in 2010! Any kid who goes to college for four years (in my case 5 1/2) and comes out without a single clue as to their future, will instantly find something to like about Ben. (I know sometimes that I feel that I'm Ben; I'm out of college three months and working full-time and still questioning whether or not I made the right decision in my college career.) Ben is confused, desperate, alienated, and clueless. The world as he knows it is big, bad, and scary (hence why he finds solace at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool). His parents expect that he's going to go and make something big of himself, but one of the film's themes regards the cross-generational shift in values, and so some (if not all) of the norms & values of his parents' age may not fit in within the norms & values of his generation.And of course, Ben's generation's norms & values are perhaps quite radically different from mine. In my age- and sex-obsessed generation of 2010, you can bet that Ben's generation of baby boomers would have coronaries due to 2010 standards of right and wrong, what's cool and uncool. And it just seems to me, at least, that people in my generation only just seem to really want instant gratification without really having the will to work for it (which could be blamed on the older generations, each previous one working hard so that the next one has it a little bit easier - but my generation seems to me, to get bored pretty easily, lacks any real moral/ethical foundations, and overall just seems to be pretty lazy); but again, this could be blamed on previous generations.At the end of the day, 'The Graduate' is really all just about Ben, and his lack of direction. Only when he makes the mistake of falling for Elaine Robinson does his future become clear: it's to marry her, with little pondering of what goes on after that, as demonstrated by this film's hilarious albeit appropriately awkward ending at a church. Anne Bancroft creates a sexy and fearsome, but ultimately tragic and sympathetic Mrs. Robinson. She's not a monster who really forces herself upon Our Poor Hero (a 'cougar' as today's modern slang terminology would call her), but she's someone who has a chance to make herself happy for once while stuck in a loveless marriage and it seems that she will do anything to keep Ben all to herself, much to his kicking & screaming (heart's dismay). We were all saddened by her passing in 2005, but if she is remembered for any of her many iconic screen roles, it should be the beautiful and seductive, not-so-ordinary suburban housewife Mrs. Robinson.'The Graduate' is obviously dated by its '60s-era Simon & Garfunkel-performed soundtrack. And even if the dated soundtrack is a musical vocalization of Ben's (and to a greater extent, '60s-era college graduates) frustrations and anxieties, the movie itself still has great relevance today, and for that reason alone, 'The Graduate' will never grow old, and will always receive top honors from movie-lovers everywhere, no matter what decade.10/10",10,1,1,10 August 2010
Elysium," A bit heavy-handed at times, but 'Elysium' is one futuristic allegory that delivers...
","South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp directed one of my all-time favorite science fiction films four years ago, 'District 9' (2009) (my second favorite picture that year, behind James Cameron's 'Avatar'). He follows it up with his second major feature, 2013's 'Elysium,' a nightmarish futuristic science fiction action-thriller set in the next century on an over-populated, pollution-ravaged planet Earth.In this future - year 2154 - there exists only two classes of people: the very rich, who live on an orbiting space station-habitat called Elysium, and everyone else, who live on an Earth that has been devastated by pollution and over-population. Enter into this picture, the wild card Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), an ex-convict factory line-worker living in Los Angeles who takes on a special mission that will take him from Earth to Elysium, and hopefully bring equality between the two disparate masses of people by opening up the ultimate gated community for Everyone Else. Even more so, Max's mission is not to save mankind, but ultimately to save himself.Matt Damon himself is a wild card in this picture. Known for his boyish good looks, Blomkamp has Damon do everything in his power to make him the most buff-looking, grungiest, most visually un-appealing science fiction anti-hero the genre has seen in the longest time. With a completely shaved head, prison-issued tattoos and a low-jack ankle monitoring device to complete the look, Blomkamp brings us a 2154 where Damon's ultra-rugged, reformed thug Max Da Costa fits right in.It is also without any real surprise that Max's tough-guy exterior begins to crack when by chance he one day reunites with his childhood sweetheart Frey (Alice Braga), who also comes with her own personal complications to overcome. And he also undergoes a gruesome back-alley procedure at a human chop-shop that has him retro-fitted with a state-of-the-art exo-suit (which recalls a more compact version of the alien weapon system at the climax of 'District 9') that will surely help him in his many battles against the corporate-run police state and the metallic armored robot-thugs that routinely oppresses him. In order to accomplish anything, he must first dethrone Elysium's well-dressed, ice-cold chief of security, Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster), and her chief minion, an Earth-bound mercenary monster named Agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley, Blomkamp's sole hold-over from 'District 9'), who grows progressively unhinged as the battle for Elysium wages on.In dealing with such timely issues such as class-ism, elitism, corporatism, environmental degradation, health care, immigration and worker exploitation, 'Elysium' successfully transposes these key themes into a realistic, futuristic scenario that is all too possible (and we do, in fact, seem to be well on our way to such a scenario), even if it is all a little heavy-handed at times. But Blomkamp delights in creating a rough & tumble wish-fulfillment science fiction fantasy that sees the poor, over-worked, down-trodden masses fighting for their rightful slice of the pie that's been horded by the uber-wealthy, elite 1%.Also like in 'District 9,' Blomkamp spares no cost in staging ultra-bloody action sequences where human bodies are suddenly transformed into Heinz ketchup. Matt Damon handles himself extremely well, bringing tough-guy gravitas - and his Everyman vulnerability - to a part that could have just been another typical sci-fi action hero. While he retains his Everyman sensibilities, he is otherwise virtually unrecognizable from his usual self; like I said earlier, he fits right in with his grungy, futuristic surroundings.Neil Blomkamp is quickly becoming one of my favorite new sci-fi filmmakers of late. With both 'District 9' and 'Elysium,' he has succeeded in bringing back intelligence, social commentary, and even principles to a genre that has lacked all three for several years. I still believe 'Children of Men' (2006) is the best new science fiction film the 21st century has seen yet. But if Blomkamp continues on this current streak of his, he may very well be in a new class of science fiction filmmakers, up there with other greats such as James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, and Ridley Scott.8/10",8,13,21,30 December 2013
Avatar," Where the wild things are - James Cameron's 'Avatar'
","I'm going to be frank: James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi epic 'Avatar,' his first feature film since 1997's 'Titanic,' is hands-down the best movie I've seen so far this year. I mean that. Prior to that, it was 'District 9.' I'm going to be even more frank: I've been pretty disappointed by the movies this year; I thought the aforementioned 'District 9' was utterly brilliant, 'Drag Me to Hell' is also worthy of some great mention, and so was 'Terminator Salvation.' So the question is: Was 'Avatar' worth the 12-year wait?In a nutshell: hell yes!Let's do a run-down of the usual James Cameron trademarks:<ul><li>Simple, but captivating and engrossing sci-fi story - check</li></ul><ul><li>Simple, but well-crafted dialogue - check</li></ul><ul><li>Groundbreaking special effects - check</li></ul><ul><li>Lots of appearances of the color blue - check</li></ul><ul><li>Strong female characters - check</li></ul><ul><li>Effective left-leaning social commentary - check</li></ul><ul><li>Liberal doses of humor - check</li></ul><ul><li>Evocative musical score - check</li></ul><ul><li>An utterly well-crafted and damn-brilliant sci-fi film with some (some is italicized) footing in reality - check, check, and triple-check!!!</li></ul>The film is set in the year 2154 (note that it takes place 25 years before Cameron's own 1986 film 'Aliens') on the distant alien moon Pandora. Pandora has since been colonized by humans, who are there looking to profit from its enormous supply of precious minerals. This has put humans at odds with the indigenous population, towering blue-skinned sentient humanoids called Na'vi, and other beautiful albeit terrifying forms of extraterrestrial life-forms. The Na'vi aren't your typical extraterrestrial primitives: they are more than a physical match for the heavily armed military forces of Earth, and they aren't going to roll over and let their home be ravaged by greedy capitalists (sounds familiar, doesn't it?).The military does have a plan: they're going to send one of their own, a paraplegic space Marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), to live amongst the Na'vi, AS A Na'vi. It turns out that the Earth scientists, led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, of 'Aliens'), have developed the technology that has allowed them to clone perfect replicas of Na'vi beings that are inhabited by the consciousness of humans. They call these replicas 'avatars.' (In Hindu mythology, an avatar is a reincarnated deity, but can also mean a temporary representation of a person, object, or concept in a virtual world; the film deals largely with the second definition.)Being an avatar gives Sully an optimistic new outlook on his life and career, as well as a newfound sense of freedom from the confines of being a wheelchair-bound war veteran. Predictably, he is reluctantly welcomed into the Na'vi way-of-life by Neyteri (Zoe Saldana) and is thus absorbed into their culture. He comes to see for himself that they are not the primitive, violent savages that they were made out to be by his handlers, and eventually develops a love for Neyteri, her people and her world, putting his mission and loyalties to the human race at risk. And it soon becomes clear that he may very well be the only thing keeping these peaceful creatures from being exterminated by Earth's gung-ho military forces.Let me just say this movie is a phenomenon, and a continual pleasure to watch on the screen. I wasn't expecting the epic magnificence of 'Titanic,' but I was expecting something on the scale of 'The Terminator' (1984) - my favorite Cameron film, my favorite sci-fi film, and my #3 favorite film of all time - and 'Aliens.' (Cameron has been wise in expecting 'Avatar' to not outdo 'Titanic.') 'Avatar' has been Cameron's pet project since 1995, but he felt that the special effects technology of the time was not developed well enough. And we know where he went next.Cameron has always had a way with special effects in his movies: he's careful to not drown the humans, their performances, and our emotional attachments to them in endless special effects sequences. (And there are plenty of epic battle sequences to get your mouth watery, so don't worry about Cameron skimping on suspenseful action scenes.) Even though the film is done largely using highly advanced motion-capture animation techniques, the performances from Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana especially are virtually flawless, and they are able to give their computer-generated alien counterparts believable ranges of emotion that allow great sympathy toward them and their cause.I have to say that since James Cameron is my favorite director, he has done it again: he has made a movie that defies expectations and the imagination, and is yet another worthy entry into an otherwise impeccable catalog of big-budget, groundbreaking special effects-laden spectacles. I will be very displeased with the Academy Awards if 'Avatar' does not win all of the special effects categories, because it deserves them - all of them. 'Avatar' is filled with stunning performances, special effects and imagery so that if I'm not mistaken in my honest opinion, this is the best movie of the year.10/10",10,15,28,18 December 2009
Toy Story 2," 'Toy Story 2' - Toys, toys, and more toys!
","1999's 'Toy Story 2' is a fine example of one of those rare movie sequels that far surpasses the original. 'Toy Story 2' is a far superior sequel to its 1995 predecessor, 'Toy Story,' a film that I will admit I loved watching growing up during the mid '90s, so you could expect my hesitation in viewing a sequel. My fears subsided within the first five minutes of 'Toy Story 2.' You can comment forever about the significantly improved Pixar animation, the increased human-like appearances of the toys, and the high-soaring story (that has many laugh-out-loud nods to past movie epics including 'National Lampoon's Animal House,' 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'Jurassic Park,' and 'The Empire Strikes Back'). But 'Toy Story 2's' real charm lies in its underlying message. 'Toy Story 2' involves beloved cowboy toy Woody's (voiced by Tom Hanks) theft by a greedy toy collector named Al (Wayne Knight). So it's up to Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to mount a gallant rescue attempt for his best friend. At the apartment of Al, Woody learns that he is actually a rare doll from a 1950's children cartoon and Al is intent on selling Woody and other members from the so-called 'Roundup Gang' - Jessie (newcomer Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar), and steed Bullseye - to a Japanese toy collector. This was an excellent animated family film from director John Lasseter (who also worked on the first film). Like its predecessor, 'Toy Story 2' captures what it means to be a child and eventually out-growing your youth, love, and friendship. Does Woody really care about about his friends back in Andy's (John Morris) bedroom and living a good life and being loved in the present, or does he care about living forever as a rare collector's item? 'Toy Story 2' really has a high nostalgia factor for its viewers, as some have pointed out, and that is probably what makes this movie just as important - arguably more important - than 'Toy Story.' Most of us do have toys that we love as children, but eventually out-grow as we get older (just imagine the rather heart-breaking flashback sequence explaining Cowgirl Jessie's history). I had a collection of stuffed animals as a child and I used to take them everywhere with me because I loved being home so much and they reminded me of being home. I'm 24 now; I didn't get rid of them - I'm not sure I could ever bring myself to do such a thing - but I do keep them on a shelf in my bedroom closet. See what I mean? This is the sort of nostalgia factor that 'Toy Story 2' elicits from the viewer and makes it a more personal and heart-warming experience than the first film, in addition to simply being action-packed and more entertaining. 'Toy Story 2,' as I explained, is a vastly improved sequel to its predecessor, the original 'Toy Story.' The story soars, the animation soars and the voice-acting performances, as you would expect, soar, but its message and nostalgia factor seal the deal and make this movie one of the greatest movie sequels ever made.10/10",10,0,1,13 June 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A 'Hell' of a good time at the movies, for real. 10/10
","In 'Drag Me to Hell,' Our Heroine Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) has it all: a good job, a great boyfriend - Clay (Justin Long), and a bright future ahead of her. But in three days, she's going to lose it all. Why, you ask? Is it because she got fired from her job as a loan officer? Did her boyfriend Clay cheat on her, because his rich parents think she's a poor little country girl and he's too good for her? Did things in her bright young life suddenly take such a big turn for the worst that there's no way back?You might say so. (Sounds like some Lifetime drama, doesn't it?) Things have taken a sudden turn for the worst in Christine Brown's life, all right. In three days, she's going to Hell, that eternal place of damnation, fire, and brimstone that all those fancy, big-name religions keep talking about.'That guy,' 'Evil Dead trilogy' director Sam Raimi, returns to his horror roots triumphant with 'Drag Me to Hell,' which he has co-written with brother Ivan. Of course, he's come a long way since 'The Evil Dead' (1982) and its sequels (1987's superior sequel 'Evil Dead II' is my personal favorite of the three); he's spent the last half-decade adapting Marvel Comics' flagship character (and my personal favorite superhero) Spider-Man to the big screen - 'Spider-Man 2' (2004) is my personal favorite superhero film of all time, and is also my #2 favorite film of all time. (Just for the record, though, 'The Evil Dead' scared the living sh** out of me!!!)If you know Raimi's 'Evil Dead' movies like you know your own face, then 'Drag Me to Hell' will be a never-ending delight. It contains much of Raimi's classic manic, frantic horror movie style: frantic pacing, frantic, shaky camera-work, outlandish sights & sounds, fountains and fountains of undead goop and bile, and outlandishly dark humor. 'Drag Me to Hell' is a brilliant hark back to simpler times for Raimi and company. (He's also put some of his horror trademarks to work - quite successfully, I might add - in the 'Spider-Man' movies.)Raimi also loves to torture his lead characters, many times in the most outlandishly (I'm sure using that word a lot here) over-the-top and comical ways imaginable. In the 'Evil Dead' movies, it was Bruce Campbell as the horror genre's supreme demon-slayer, Ash; in the 'Spider-Man' movies, it was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Here, it's Lohman's Christine Brown.As a loan officer with a loving boyfriend and a promotion to assistant manager being dangled in front of her by her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) and the office kiss-a** - Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee) - also vying for the same position, Alison seems to be at a crossroads in her life. So when an old woman, dear old Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) appears at her desk pleading for an extension to try to pay off her mortgage, Christine suddenly gets a cold heart and denies her request.That was not a good idea, because dear old Mrs. Ganush is also a Gypsy with an army of soul-stealing, soul-hungry demons at her disposal. So a Gypsy curse is placed on Christine so that in three days, after three days and nights of non-stop demonic torment, the Dark One will come to claim her soul and drag her to the demonic underworld for all eternity. Clay scoffs at the idea of demons in the real world, but psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) confirms that demonic forces are conspiring to take her soul after three 'hellish' days.'Drag Me to Hell' is living, breathing proof that Raimi has not lost his touch to deliver spine-tingling chills and over-the-top dark humor. He gives us some pretty good scares in this one, constantly changing up the pace to keep us on the edge of our seats. When we think that the latest demonic attack has finally ceased, when everything has gotten quiet, he lets us have it again with another good fright. He even takes time out from the horror to remind us of some real-life horrors, which is our current mortgage crisis (could dear old Mrs. Ganush be our in-theater vocalizing of our pain and suffering in these hard economic times?).Most of Christine's demonic attacks occur in both total darkness and broad daylight. Everyday items come to scare the living daylights out of us as well: cell phones, handkerchiefs, and a fly (yes, a fly!) provides us with one of the film's most unsettling frights. There's also lots of undead goop, spit, and bile that reminds us that 'PG-13' ratings for horror films still mean something; watch out for that nose bleed!!! And late in the film, Raimi makes a deliberate, jump-for-joy reference to any of the numerous scenes of demonic possession from any of his 'Evil Dead' movies. Lastly, true to Raimi's style as a director here, just when we think the frights are over and everyone is about to live happily ever after, he sucker-punches us in the gut with a rather bleak ending that truly proves he hasn't lost his touch in delivering the goods.'Drag Me to Hell' is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. Jacked-up ticket prices have caused me to miss out on a lot of good fun at the movies so far this year. But 'Drag Me to Hell' is the first movie I've seen this year that I've really felt deserved my $8.25. Even though Halloween is not yet upon us, 'Drag Me to Hell' has instantly become one of my most cherished horror flicks, from one of the genre's premiere talents - Sam Raimi, who has successfully returned to the genre that brought him to fame (or infamy).He has truly scared the hell out of us this time, which few filmmakers in recent years have succeeded in doing.10/10",10,19,40,29 May 2009
Selma," A film that every American needs to see (like, right now)
","There is an old saying that art - even the glossy, fanciful stuff that you see written about in the all the fancy magazines and news articles - does have some bottom-line commercial concerns, as well as providing a form of entertainment.There is also something to be said about motion pictures regarding real-life historical events. While they are made to bring attention to, or bring to life either long-forgotten or recent events in history, they are, at base level, concerned primarily with providing a form of entertainment, and will sometimes fudge the real-life facts for the sake of providing said entertainment.Any film based on true-life events will face this problem. I would guess that for anyone wanting 100% facts, then they should go watch a documentary or go read a book.I just got done watching Ava DuVernay's 2014 Oscar-Winner 'Selma,' about the marches and demonstrations in 1965 in Selma, Alabama, that led to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which extended voting rights to all people of color. The timing of the release of 'Selma' could not have been more perfect, in my eyes.I first heard about 'Selma' late last year, probably around this time, actually. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unceremoniously struck down a crucial portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - specifically Section 4(b), which was for the so-called 'coverage formula' for jurisdictions, mostly in the South, with proved, documented histories of egregious voting discriminations, including, regretfully, my home state of Virginia - a moment in recent history that shamefully received very little coverage in the news media of the time and to this day almost three years later still infuriates me.(It both saddens and frustrates me to think about how with the stroke of a pen, how so much has been lost in the 50 years since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law.)And then, the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday' was just this past March (March 7), an event which also did not receive a whole lot of coverage in the media, but I do remember seeing a few items on the news and on Facebook (of all places) of people, many of whom were there in 1965, walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge - just as they had done 50 years earlier.And 'Selma' was released during the time between the two momentous occasions.These events in recent history - and the current racial unrest and unease in this country - only serve to increase the demand that all Americans see 'Selma.' I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time, but I only recently gave it a viewing today. I had heard long before I saw 'Selma' that DuVernay's film was not entirely true to historical events, in particular the relationship between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo, who received a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor, but was shunned by the Oscars) and then-United States President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). I know from my understanding of history that President Johnson was actually the greatest political ally of the Civil Rights Movement, but was still under enormous pressure to go through with his own 'Great Society' programs and the escalating U.S. military conflict in Vietnam. In other words, they both wanted the same thing - the dismantling of Jim Crow - but just had different responsibilities and priorities.In fact, according to one analysis of the picture and this slight by Slate earlier this year, '...By hardening Johnson - and making him a larger roadblock than he was - DuVernay emphasizes the grass roots of the movement and the particular struggles of King and his allies. In the long argument of who matters most - activists or politicians - DuVernay falls on the side of the former; showing how citizens can expand the realm of the possible and give politicians the push - and the room - they need to act.'In other words, the film is mostly about the activists who drove the federal government into drafting and eventually passing the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law - and it is largely told from their perspective. In fact, the two biggest stumbling blocks encountered by both the activists, led by King, and the federal government, led by Johnson, are FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth); in real life, it was actually U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy who authorized the FBI wiretaps and harassment of Dr. King and other Civil Rights Movement leaders in an attempt to discredit his leadership and link him to the Communist Party (the film depicts Johnson authorizing this, not Kennedy), and George Wallace often used the police to violently suppress peaceful demonstrations in his state, like on 'Bloody Sunday.'Ava DuVernay's film isn't perfect; it's a little too wishy-washy in its liberal depiction of an extremely violent time in American history. But still, after seeing this movie finally (and taking into consideration recent historical events), I have now confirmed my feeling that 'Selma' is the film that should have won Best Picture at the Oscars earlier this year, but was shamefully overlooked by the Academy. That it only received one Oscar win (for 'Glory' by Common and John Legend), which I suspect was done to placate certain members of the audience, is a real disservice to one of the greatest moments in American history that took place just 50 years ago.10/10",10,2,4,21 December 2015
Saw," I +Saw+ it last night
","'Saw,' a film that was originally planned for a straight-to-video release but after receiving positive nods at test screenings, was finally given the green light in October 2004 - just in time for Halloween. 'Saw' contains one of the those plots that shows you everything it's got up its sleeve, then doubles-back on itself three-fourths of the way through and reveals something entirely new.It's not hard to see why this almost hit the straight-to-video fodder list. I mean, people will closely observe that it obviously contains the traits of its successors, namely 'Seven' (1995), and that may be all the ammunition the haters will need to trash it. Already, I see that the IMDb voters have averaged 'Saw' a 7.5, with those people who have rated it with an '8' or a '10' being neck-and-neck at the polls.But I begin with reassurances that 'Saw' is a genius thriller, if not entirely original or daring. The film does its best to exploit the claustrophobia and mounting tension that collects as it progresses. 'Saw' will also make you think twice about bladed objects as well.Ironically, the title has very little to do with plot, as there is no chainsaw-wielding maniac on the loose as the ghastly cover art of a severed foot would imply. The only saws here are the ones the two main characters Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell, also the film' screenwriter) have been given.The two men awaken to find themselves chained to lead pipes in a decrepit public bathroom. In the middle of the floor, is a dead body that's surrounded in a pool of its own blood, with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. As it would turn out, they're the latest victims of a serial killer known as the 'Jigsaw Killer.'Jigsaw has a nasty little way of torturing his victims by trapping them in a situation where they have to kill if they want to survive. As Lawrence explains, technically Jigsaw is not a killer, simply because he hasn't killed anyone; the victims do that for him. As one fortunate victim observes, who survived her ordeal, she is bound to a chair with a reversed bear trap-like device strapped to her head with pliers wired into her upper and lower jaws. A timer is on the device and if she does not locate a key before it runs out, her mouth will be ripped open and no more pretty face. In order to get out, she must open up the stomach of a dead man lying on the floor next her to get the key.As Jigsaw ever so carefully points out to his victims, he doesn't just choose them at random. To him, they're all perfectly immoral individuals and he uses their immorality to set up horrific situations where the victim rarely survives the trap; in essence, life is its own reward because Jigsaw's victims don't value it, as he explains to the one young woman lucky enough to fight through his plan. Also on the case of Jigsaw, are two detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), who bring forth the news of Jigsaw's previous victims in one particularly gruesome flashback sequence.Lawrence is pretty well aware of the case of Jigsaw, as even once he was considered a suspect by the police. As you would have it, Adam is not especially trustful of Lawrence being that he seems to know a lot and is not reporting many details to him. They realize, however, that if they are going to survive this nightmare, they're going to have to play into Jigsaw's game, observe the clues he's willing to give them, and ultimately make it out alive.'Saw' was directed admirably by James Wan and written by Whannell, who also makes an effective victim alongside Elwes. Elwes, a highly underrated actor, is given a chance to shine here, even though this really isn't an actor's movie, as it is more in the hands of the director. However, we do get a sense of the desperation of the two leads, who soon realize that they're not the only ones trapped in this madman's game.'Saw' does benefit from its moody atmosphere, which may cover up any of the film's shortcomings. Towards the end, it does lose pace a little bit as things seem to be spiraling down the haunted house route, but quickly regains momentum as it draws to a close. I know that despite its flaws, I was glued to the seat and really 'in' the film's tight tension, which thankfully doesn't let up.Is 'Saw' a genre classic? Certainly. Is it a classic like 'Seven'? I don't know. There's a lot to consider when pondering a question with so much baggage like that one. I liked it, but I'm not so sure about the news that a sequel is in the works. This seems a lot like a stand-alone-type movie, that of which doesn't need to get bogged down by the weight of unnecessary sequels.8/10",8,79,112,11 June 2005
The Last Samurai," 'The Last Samurai'
","It seems I have only been given a few occasions in my life where I am genuinely 'in' a film. Edward Zwick's 'The Last Samurai' embodies the elements of the rousing historical action epic and strong human drama so perfectly I found myself unable to turn away from the glorious battle and sentimental character-driven plot. Where most films of this particularly high caliber sacrifice themselves to Hollywood conventions ¾ of the way through, 'The Last Samurai' remains consistent and stays with you, even long after the credits and action have ceased.One should also take into account the West's immense fascination with the East too. Samurai pictures, as relayed to Western culture most popularly by Akira Kurosawa, and martial arts flicks from the 1970s, have been the focal point of an intense study by American film-goers in the last half-century. 'The Last Samurai' remains faithful to the myths of Japanese swordsmen by building on the mystifying qualities that made them so fascinating in the first place and also by carefully shying away from stereotypes.Add to that, it has a magnificent leading actor, Tom Cruise, who is no stranger to action cinema and really threw himself into his character of Capt. Nathan Algren by training in various sword-fighting techniques and learning to speak much of his dialogue in Japanese. Similar to 'Dances With Wolves' (1990) and in the tradition of fish-out-of-water tales, Cruise's Algren is the disillusioned outsider from American civilization who wholeheartedly adopts the ways and the culture of a 'savage' people and eventually participates in a grand epic battle against his former walk-of-life.As the film opens, Algren is already a highly decorated Civil War veteran, who of course is suffering from open wounds of his battle time experiences. Living on the bottle and reduced to retelling fabrications of epic battlefield skirmishes (chiefly General George Custer's famous last stand), he makes an a** out of himself on stage and becomes a huge embarrassment to the theater owners.His days as a soldier are not long behind him, however, as he is called to journey to Japan by Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) and a man named Omura (Masato Harata) to aid the Japanese government in crushing a rebellion of the samurai led by Katsumoto (Academy Award-nominee Ken Watanabe, in his first English-speaking American performance). The emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura), a young and indecisive man, has grown an immense fascination with all things Western, which has put the samurai, who have a 900-year history of serving the Japanese government, and their glorious past written out of future accounts of Japan's culture.Algren's job in Japan is to train and act as an adviser for the emperor's army. After very little time training them, Bagley takes the opportunity to see them in battle; Algren says that they are not ready, as proved in a scene that is reminiscent of Zwick's own 'Glory' (1989). In Japan's hills, a skirmish breaks out between the army and samurai, and in the ensuing chaos Algren is captured.I have always admired films that embrace their subject matter like this one does, and I have to admit I have always admired films about the outsider who embraces an alien culture. Algren writes in his journal, about how he comes to question what he is doing there and how the Japanese and their culture are not so primitive. He engages in deep philosophical conversations with Katsumoto; for the first months Algren is in captivity, he does not speak to Katsumoto, as he still feels his allegiance to his own native America. But he comes to question that loyalty as he witnesses how disciplined and loyal the Japanese are, and how the questioning of own his values eventually makes him comrades with Katsumoto.Where movies like this have failed, the Japanese would be very ignorant and would warm themselves up to the way of the White man and Algren will be the one to lead them to victory; that does not happen here. Algren is merely a participant in something far greater than himself and just as he had been assigned to do with the Americans, he acts an adviser to Katsumoto's samurai.While in captivity, Algren, the outsider, is eventually welcomed into Katsumoto's household and is introduced to his family. Katsumoto's teenage son takes a strong liking to him but Katsumoto's sister-in-law, whose husband Algren killed in battle, is not so forgiving. Eventually Algren finds himself warming up to his captors and their dedication to preserving the Samurai code.'The Last Samurai' is really one of those movies that doesn't seem to get the praise it deserves. There are many breathtaking action sequences (none of which are stylized in any fashion) and you will not find any trace of the 'modern' action movie in this film.We are shown here, the way of a dying culture - the samurai. In this film, they are presented to indeed have a strong and dedicated ethic of preserving their history, a glorious history that will be forgotten as Japan moves forward into its modernization with the West and director Zwick shows us this.The performers are excellent, especially Cruise but even more compelling are many of the Japanese actors. Ken Watanabe is simply amazing in his first American role. We actually believe in his strength and dedication to preserving the samurai code. Cruise takes on the role of acting as Katsumoto's outsider general in the film's final, spectacular action sequence between the Japanese military and the samurai.'The Last Samurai' is a beautiful and rousing epic that will certainly live on as a fantastic samurai film; it almost rivals any Kurosawa action-set piece (just kidding). But 'The Last Samurai' does raise the bar as far as portraits of the East go in Western cinema. If 'The Last Samurai' is remembered as the grand epic it surely is, then the East will get its respect in due time.10/10",10,2,4,20 July 2005

A Clockwork Orange," A Dark, Violent and Twisted Masterpiece - Spoilers
","Alex DeLarge(Malcolm McDowell) is a hoodlum in not-too-distant future London. As the tagline says, 'His principal interests are rape, ultraviolence and Beethoven. He and his 'droogs'(friends) often spend a lot of time away from home and out on the streets. They go out at night and have fun which means getting into fights with other gangs, commit random acts of violence, and 'in-out'(rape) women. One night, when Alex comes out of some lady's house after beating her to death with a large statue, he is beaten up and betrayed by his droogs and is left to be arrested by the police. At the jail, Alex is informed that a woman that he had performed an 'in-out' on had died at the hospital from her injuries. Alex is then sent to prison. While there, he reads the Bible(he only reads about the sex and violence) and dreams of getting out of prison. He then asks a preacher about an experiment that he had heard about at Ludovico that if successful, could possibly rid him of any violent or sexual impulses he might have. Soon enough he is sent to Ludovico. There he is forced to watch unedited footage of brutal beatings, rapes, and Nazi marches all the while with good old Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing in the background. Alex comes out of Ludovico a changed man or is he?This is actually the second film directed by the late Stanley Kubrick that I've watched with 'Full Metal Jacket' being the first. Malcolm McDowell is truly awesome in his role as the sadistic, young Alex. Stanley Kubrick said he wouldn't been able to make this movie without him. Stanley Kubrick did take an awfully big chance with this movie. The violence here in 'A Clockwork Orange' can simply be described as ultra. There are many brutal rape scenes and several bloody beatings. People who like Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the Rain' may not like it anymore if they watch 'A Clockwork Orange' because Malcolm McDowell sings it while kicking the crap out of an elderly man and raping his wife.The musical score is the easily one of the best parts of 'A Clockwork Orange'. It is fantastic! The opening score is the one I like the most. The way it plays while Alex is looking into the camera with that half-smile, you wonder what exactly is going through his head at that moment. The 'milk bar' or whatever it's called that Alex and his droogs are sitting at, is unique and yet ultimately frightening and disturbing at the same time.The film's setting is apparently futuristic London, but it seems a lot like present day London. The reason it feels so much like present day is because of the clothing and all the cars and stuff like that. This feels a lot more like some sort of dark, comic satire than it does a science-fiction movie.'A Clockwork Orange' certainly is a twisted work of art. It is now my favorite Stanley Kubrick film. As I said before Stanley Kubrick did take a chance making this movie. It probably could of either made or ended his career because of all the sex and violence that's in this movie.'A Clockwork Orange' gets a 10/10",10,1,2,10 November 2001
The Fly," A Good Remake
","Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of creating a teleportation device that could revolutionize the world.  It can transport inorganic objects perfectly but there is one major setback: it can't transport living matter.  He first tries a baboon as the first living specimen and the results are horrific.  Just when Seth thinks he has all of the bugs worked out, he tries it on himself.  Seth comes out of the chamber apparently unaffected by the experiment.  Then Seth begins to notice a change.  He first finds himself performing acrobatic stunts that he thought he could never be able to do as a normal person.  Next his girlfriend Veronica(Geena Davis) begins to notice a disturbing change in his behavior.  Then Veronica discovers the strange hairs growing on Seth's back.  Veronica, horrified, takes the hairs to a doctor and finds that the hairs growing on Seth's back weren't human, but were in fact, insect hairs.  Seth, shrugging off Veronica's pleas that he see a doctor, decides to review the process as it happened.  He then makes a horrifying discovery, his genetic make up had been accidentally spliced with that of a house fly that flew into the chamber shortly before he teleported and then begins Seth's transformation. 
David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the 1958 film of the same name, is a completely different film from the original.  For instance, in The Fly(1958), a man just has the head of a fly on a human body.  In the remake, a man and a fly become one being and the end results are terrifying.  The Fly is a total gross-out of a movie.  The horrific, Oscar-winning special effects truly are what I describe them as: horrific.  I won't ever forget the arm wrestling match, or the nightmare sequence, or the ending transformation scene.  I'll admit that I used to be scared to watch this movie, but I'm not anymore.  My mom sort of hates this movie because of the way that it shows how flies 'eat' their food. The Fly is still a great movie.  The special effects, albeit they are disgusting have held up pretty well since 1986.10/10",10,1,2,18 October 2001
Total Recall," 'Total Recall' - 10/10
","I have to make a confession that I have a serious lack of knowledge concerning the workings of revered science fiction author, Philip K. Dick. However, I do know that three of his workings have been turned into some of the greatest science fiction action set-pieces of the last 21 years. The first was Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner,' which was released in 1982 and is the obvious best Philip K. Dick adaptation ever. The most recent was last year's 'Minority Report,' which starred Tom Cruise and was directed by Steven Spielberg. Somewhere in between there, was Arnold Schwarzenegger's action epic, 'Total Recall,' which was released in 1990 and was directed by Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop, Starship Troopers).'Recall' (adapted from Dick's short story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale') starred Schwarzenegger in the role of Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who goes to a place that sells you fake memories and Quaid opts for an implant of the planet Mars. However, a mishap occurs during the implantation and it is discovered that Quaid is actually a secret agent. Quaid's journey then concerns him having to leave Earth and returning to Mars to find his true identity.If 'Total Recall' is the least successful of the 'Big Three' ('Recall,' 'Minority Report,' 'Blade Runner'), then it is at least the most inventive. The movie has such a wondrous vision of future Earth and a production design that no one can beat. Paul Verhoeven injects his usual gratuitous bloodshed here (a number of scenes were edited to remove excessive violence), while also carefully planting little bits of social satire. The Oscar-winning special effects are another one of the great highlights of this film, too. Though dated, they still look pretty convincing, even today 13 years later after this films release.",10,7,8,13 December 2003
Rocky," You'll love it the first time you see it...
","...Which is ironic for me to say that because I'll admit the first time I saw the original 1976 'Rocky,' I wasn't all that impressed. Maybe it was because of Sylvester Stallone, his hammy Oscar-nominated role as the 'underdog' boxer Rocky Balboa, or its lack of in-the-ring action (which is saved for the last 20 minutes) - I don't know, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. The point is, after a lot of soul-searching and realizing that 'Rocky' is the real deal (plus a convenient chance at re-watching the film in its glory), I find that 'Rocky' is very easily one of the best movies ever made. The story of strength, determination, and the desperate need of a new hero in the wake of political turmoil during the 1970s helped Rocky Balboa's eventual rise to fame at the box office in '76, and his subsequent entry into pop culture history. At the heart of the film, is the title character, a hard-luck Philadelphia loser played gloriously by Stallone. The muscle for a local loan shark, his only real source of pride is in the ring, besting other fighters who are way below his skill level. On the side, he also flirts with Adrian (Talia Shire), the sister of his best friend Paulie (Burt Young) who is also the chronically shy clerk of the pet store where he frequents. When the reigning world heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) discovers he needs a challenger for the upcoming Bicentennial because all the rest of the competition has bowed out, he chooses the 'Italian Stallion' out of other contenders. When Rocky gets the news, he sees it as a chance to prove his worth and 'go the distance' and start training with a former champ, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). 'Rocky' was a huge hit in 1976, as Stallone's script floated around Hollywood for several years before being picked up by United Artists and given to director John G. Avildsen. Sure, 'Rocky' gets off to a slow start. But that's part of its magic: to let the audience really know who these people are, and the lives they are leading. The big day does come, but there's something about the conclusion of the picture that will always remain true to real life, and about that once-in-a-lifetime, million-to-one shot at glory.10/10",10,1,2,21 February 2007
The Descent," The battle of the six vs. The Darkness
","(This movie definitely made me think twice about ever going cave-diving!!!)More than a few critics this year have hailed 'The Descent' as one of the scariest horror movies of the last 10 years. For once, they're right. I've seen a fair share of 'Saw' (another Lionsgate franchise) over the last two years, but 'The Descent' is in a whole other ball park by itself. Claustrophobia? Darkness? Gore? Nasty monsters? You bet. 'The Descent' has it all.The story is that six adrenaline-charged females are trapped underground by a cave-in. With nothing around them but darkness, they strive to stay alive long enough to find the light. Unknown to the women, something is lurking within the darkness, just out of sight, watching their every move. And it soon becomes a battle for survival as the women are hunted down and eviscerated by some really nasty creepy-crawlers.The director of 'The Descent' is Neil Marshall, the Brit responsible for 2002's ultra-bloody werewolf adventure 'Dog Soldiers.' Marshall made a name for himself with that picture, and 'The Descent' contains the same sense of wall-to-wall action as 'Dog Soldiers,' except that the action here is literal, much rather than figurative. The gore factor is extremely up there (perhaps even more extended in the original unedited version) and those creepy-crawlers I mentioned? The first image of them is sure to stick with you; for once in a long time, the protagonists are terrorized by creatures that are actually scary.Many of the females are pretty, and tough, and able to handle themselves in hand-to-hand combat with the creatures, and so the body count on both sides sort of evens out. So, 'The Descent' sort of turns into a battle royal toward the end. These women are strong, giving their characters that extra kick of girl-power, and alas, there's no gratuitous nudity here although one girl is seen taking a shower, and the movie doesn't pause to give us an excuse for T + A. It's all about survival, and seeing what's ahead, or as far as the beam of your flashlight will go.Though the movie is set in the United States, many of the actresses do lousy jobs of masking their European accents. (Maybe it would've been better if Marshall instead kept the horror in Europe? It still would have given 'The Descent' an exotic appeal that doesn't conform to shoddy American standards).'The Descent' is one tension-filled and nasty horror masterpiece. Just pray for daylight if you ever get trapped underground with nasty creepy-crawlers.10/10",10,3,7,26 December 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," 'Vol. 2 - The Awesome Mix'
","There isn't much to say about 2017's 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' that probably hasn't been said already, so I'm just going to try to break it down into a few pointers/highlights.<ul><li>Writer/director James Gunn. I am continually impressed by this jokey, enthusiastic former Troma alumnus who has certainly come a long way SINCE his Troma days, and the gross-out horror of 'Slither' (2006) and his first superhero effort, the black comedy 'Super' (2010). You can tell that the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' series for Marvel are probably the films he's been wanting to make for the longest time.</li></ul><ul><li>James Gunn, again. Gunn is a true smart-aleck, and his film is rife with witty one-liners and clever dialogue that shows that while his budgets have increased ten-fold, he still retains his smart-aleck sense of humor that characterized much of his earlier, smaller-budgeted work. And he makes his laughs, and the timing of those laughs, count.</li></ul><ul><li>The cast - Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). What can I say? The central themes of this sequel are family, and the ties that bind. While Gunn's script kind of hits us over the head with this, it is clear that a cinematic family of sorts has been formed, amongst these hard-luck losers of petty crooks and fugitives-turned-mercenaries-for-hire, and they all appear to be having a blast in their roles - especially Chris Pratt, who before 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was known primarily for his role on 'Parks and Recreation' and has lost a considerable amount of weight, beefed up, and shaped himself into a capable leading man.</li></ul><ul><li>The music. The film has a score by Tyler Bates, but its main soundtrack is comprised of old-school hits primarily from the 1970s, which gives 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' a kind of self-knowing retro-hipness that shows that while it's set in outer space and in another galaxy, its roots are firmly in the distant past, in far simpler times that Our Hero Star-Lord clings to desperately even as he embraces his new role as the leader of a mis-matched group of interstellar heroes.</li></ul>That's all that I really have to say about 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,' which is an even more Awesome Mix than the first.10/10",10,7,12,12 May 2017
Titanic," Look at it for what it is and not for what it isn't
","It has now been five years since 'Titanic' was released into theaters and broke box office records by taking in more than $500 million worldwide (due largely to teenage girls). The story soon became familiar to everyone: poor boy Leonardo DiCaprio falls in love with rich girl Kate Winslet. 'Titanic' won eleven out of fourteen Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director: James Cameron. This movie made Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet box office stars. Leonardo DiCaprio became the biggest teen heartthrob since Corey Feldman while Kate Winslet became the hottest woman in Hollywood. This for me, was most evident when these two kids in my sixth grade class made a wallpaper (it was non-nude) of her on the teacher's computer. However, even with all the positive press this movie was getting, some people felt that 'Titanic' was not all that it had been hyped up to be. Those people felt that 'Titanic' was really nothing special, the acting especially that of Leonardo DiCaprio totally sucked, and some people claimed that the best part of this whole movie was when Kate Winslet stripped naked before having her youth immortalized as one of the girls in Jack's book. Even after hearing all of these negative comments about this film, I did not let them have an impact on my viewing of it. First, I think we all have to remember that this movie is coming from James Cameron, the man who brought us 'The Terminator', 'Aliens', 'The Abyss', produced 'Point Break' and wrote 'Strange Days', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', 'True Lies', and TV's 'Dark Angel'. This movie made James Cameron probably one of the most successful directors in Hollywood. Even before 'Titanic,' James Cameron had never ever really experienced that much success with any of his previous films.Second, look at this film for what is, which is a fictional love story in a historical setting, not a historical romance. Third, this is the most expensive movie Hollywood has ever made, costing $200 million to make. Director James Cameron risked his entire career as well as sinking Paramount studios into bankruptcy. It was a VERY, VERY big gamble that fortunately for James Cameron and Paramount studios, would pay off.Fourth, I'm a guy. I don't care to see Leonardo DiCaprio and I didn't watch this movie just to see Kate Winslet strip either, but I watched 'Titanic' because I'm a fan of James Cameron and I have been since 'The Terminator'. Fifth, I know that this is one of those movies that when there is a wide range of comments about it, that it is best view it for yourself and then make your own judgment. That being said, I've watched 'Titanic' at least ten times since 1998 and I still don't know whether or not I hate it or like it. But I give 'Titanic' an eight out of ten based squarely on my own viewings and not popular opinion.",10,1,4,13 April 2002
Thor," So this is why that girl from 'Adventures in Babysitting' (1987) loved Thor so much?
","If you've seen the popular 1987 comedy 'Adventures in Babysitting,' then you don't need to know what the title of that comment means. But I'm going to tell you anyway: I have to give the little girl in that movie some credit because she's got some original tastes - rather than idolizing something obvious like Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, she chose the lesser-known Marvel Comics superhero Thor.Thor, or The Mighty Thor, is not one of my favorite superheroes. While I consider myself a Marvel Comics reader more than any other comic book publisher - readers familiar of my reviews will note that I'm an avid Spider-Man fan - Thor is nonetheless an interesting Marvel Comics character to me because he's so different from other comic book superheroes, for one simple fact: he's a god. And not just any god, he's the God of Thunder in Norse mythology - re-interpreted as a comic book superhero. His comic book equals could possibly be Superman (of DC Comics, Marvel Comics' chief rival) or even the Silver Surfer (another popular Marvel Comics superhero) - although astute comic book readers will note that Superman and the Silver Surfer are actually aliens, not gods, but are still quite just as powerful (it'll be interesting to see a fight between the three, though).Stan Lee, his brother Larry Lieber and the legendary, late, great Jack Kirby were the trio of well-known Marvel Comics personalities who brought Thor to life in 1962, debuting in the issue 'Journey into Mystery #83.' 49 years later, that British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh brought The Mighty Thor to life in his own movie, 'Thor,' to add the mighty Norse god to the current crop of special effects-laden superhero movies.For the most part, Branagh succeeds. Marvel's superheroes were always noteworthy for being outsiders, freaks and misfits, so where does The Mighty Thor - a god, remember - fit into that mold? Well, the movie does a good job of representing his origins: the mighty God of Thunder (played by Australian newbie Chris Hemsworth), is exiled from his home-world of Asgard to planet Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that his son will learn a lesson in humility. (I'll just go ahead and say that Stan Lee chose his character's flaws rather well: he's one of the first superheroes whose personal dilemma is to learn a lesson and not just any lesson, but a lesson in power and responsibility.) It goes without saying that Thor is arrogant and reckless, nearly bringing Asgard to war with the neighboring realm of the Frost Giants, Jutenheim.Arriving on Earth stripped of his powers, he must now learn what it truly takes to be a hero and to be responsible for his actions. He's discovered by a trio of scientists in the New Mexico desert - Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, hot off her Oscar-win for 'Black Swan'), Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) - and they befriend him. It is through his encounters with them that Thor develops a deep fondness and admiration for the human race (in particularly Jane, his would-be love interest) and once he regains his powers - granted to him mostly by the mighty hammer Mjornir - he must eventually combat his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who seeks the throne of Asgard for himself.I'll say that 'Thor,' like most blockbuster superhero movies of late, is a breathtaking wall-to-wall action flick. If anything else, this movie also got me interested in learning more about Thor and the world he lives in. Although the movie starts off rather slowly and alternates a lot between Earth and Asgard (thereby creating an unwelcome case of vertigo at times), it keeps your attention throughout. While also not too deep or intelligent as it could be (as it should be), Chris Hemsworth proves to be a capable God of Thunder. Stripped of his abilities and forced to learn that ages-old Marvel adage ('With great power, there must also come great responsibility') - and also making an unusually quick adjustment to life on Earth (one of the film's key weaknesses, I feel) - only then can he once again become The Mighty Thor!Newly-minted Oscar-winner Natalie Portman is serviceable as Jane Foster (she did go to Harvard, after all), but I do feel that she is somewhat under-used, as is Stellan Skarsgard, whose Eric Selvig is also quite familiar with the legends of the classic Thor from his childhood. Thor's close friends and fellow Asgardians - his homeboys Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Joshua Dalls), and home-girl Sif (Jaimie Alexander) - also provide Thor with some much-needed back-up on Earth when Loki's forces threaten our planet. And speaking of Loki, I believe that it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the film's most complex and emotional performance as the son desperate to earn his father's love and respect, even if he has to wipe out all life on two worlds to make it so. So in that regard, he seems like such a worthy opponent to Thor.I enjoyed 'Thor' for what it was, a worthy summer blockbuster comic book superhero adaptation. Even if it wasn't as deep or as involving as it could have been, it does serve as a build-up, yet another piece of the puzzle that will eventually lead to 2012's all-out superhero-fest 'The Avengers.'8/10",8,1,2,21 May 2012
The Untouchables," 'Untouchable' - True Gangster Greatness
","I'm going to make this short and to the point:To me, Eliot Ness and the Untouchables were true patriots, fighting to end corruption wherever it reared its ugly head. With that in mind, 1987's 'The Untouchables' is one of the greatest gangster movies - period. Brian De Palma, coming down off of the landmark gangster classic 'Scarface' (1983), continued the trend with this carefully woven tale (screenplay complements of David Mamet) about Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, perfectly cast) and his band of incorruptible federal agents. Ness is as naive as they come - bright-eyed and ready to take gangsterism down the 'old' way - but being that this is Prohibition-era Chicago, the police are on the take, and no one can be trusted for fear of retribution from Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Ness finds his most trusted and loyal partner in a beat officer, Jimmy Malone (Oscar-Winner Sean Connery), who so carefully spells the law out out for him, 'He {Capone} sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!' The Untouchables certainly do seem to overstep their boundaries in bringing Capone down, using a number of well-planned and law-bending tactics. The cinematography is beautiful, helping to capture the gangster-era in all its glory, and the Ennio Morricone score really gets you pumping for the action. De Palma is at his greatest in directorial excellence in staging stellar, heart-pumping action sequences (with the Morricone score blasting away too), which come to include the Canadian liquor bust, the train-station shootout, and the ending rooftop chase between Ness and Capone's #1 hit-man Frank Nitti (Billy Drago). Beware though, since this is De Palma territory here, we should be on the lookout for some scenes of pretty stylized bloody violence and the blood + guts action that characterized the times. Still, 'The Untouchables' is one of my top 10 'must-see' pictures and I'm sure it's essential viewing for any gangster movie aficionado.10/10",10,20,29,11 March 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Here is what I think about 'The Matrix Reloaded':
","'Commander Lock: 'Not everyone believes what you believe.'Morpheus: 'My beliefs do not require that they do.'<ul><li>Characters are always talking like this in 'The Matrix Reloaded,' which plays like a collaboration involving a geek, a comic book and the smartest kid in Philosophy 101. Morpheus in particular unreels extended speeches that remind me of Laurence Olivier's remarks when he won his honorary Oscar--the speech that had Jon Voight going 'God!' on TV, but in print turned out to be quasi-Shakespearean doublespeak. The speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: It sure sounds like those guys are saying some profound things.</li></ul><ul><li>That will not prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of 'The Matrix Reloaded' in endless Web postings. Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology; there is something refreshingly ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass culture, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.'</li></ul>My thoughts:Nothing sums up the hype surrounding 'The Matrix' trilogy better than the above quote from Roger Ebert. Like him, I believe that much of the hype surrounding 'The Matrix' and its sequels is nothing more than shallow philosophy mixed with allegorical and metaphorical strains of the Bible, among various other religious texts and two guys love of comic books. Do I believe any of it? Absolutely not, and I honestly hope that the people who seem to watch these movies religiously do not believe any of the things they say about it either.It's been four years since the first 'Matrix' film wowed audiences back in 1999 with its special effects and mind-bending story. It has since been followed by a frighteningly devoted fan base, countless books and various interpretations of the plot line. I don't view the 'Matrix' movies as anything more than a 'Christ' parable and a very shallow one at that. The movie has its influences deeply rooted in Christianity (the most obvious), as well as Japanese comic books (Manga), Anime ('Ghost in the Shell' and 'Akira' come first to mind), Hong Kong action flicks, and countless other sources that have been rolled into one hell of an action film.And also like Ebert, I make these statements with amusement, not criticism, mixed with a little bit of bewilderment. You see, like most movie-going people, I was put into awe by the special effects and story. I loved the first film and it's a classic, believe me. The first 'Matrix' film is an obvious achievement in special effects and a landmark in science-fiction,but unfortunately its sequels aren't bringing anything new to me and (obviously) to others, which brings me to 'The Matrix Reloaded.'The cons:The biggest problem I have with 'Reloaded' is that it many times tries to be deep and meaningful but fails miserably most of the time. The fight scenes aren't really worth any particular mention (the only exception being the '88 Smiths' and the much-talked about 14-minute 'Freeway' chase) either. Many of them only seem to be in this movie to eat up time and don't have any significance to the story.That, to me seemed to be the biggest fault with 'Reloaded.' In 'The Matrix,' the big lobby scene in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) get into a huge shootout with a S.W.A.T. team, signaled the start of a glorious rebellion within the system but not only that, kept your eyes glued to the screen for the rest of the movie, all the way up to when the credits start to roll and Rage Against the Machine plays on the soundtrack.The fights in 'Reloaded' are too repetitive and seem to take forever to be over. Also, the romance in this film seemed to be way too tacked on to be believable. I wanted to see Neo and Trinity become a couple but I have to say that they have no chemistry on screen whatsoever. Their love scene is intercut with a huge mosh pit scene about 30 minutes in after Morpheus gives this huge inspirational speech and everybody goes nuts.Any plusses? Well yeah, that's why I gave it a six out of ten. I have to say, that while the fight scenes seem to be a bit on the excessive side, they're extremely well executed. The cinematography is beautiful, giving 'Reloaded' a unique and eerie look. The 'flying' scenes with Neo are very well done too.To sum up:'The Matrix Reloaded' was at best, failed potential but it shows what happens when you try to put too much into one movie.P.S: If I want a science-fiction movie with real philosophy (emphasis on 'real'), I'll go and watch 'Blade Runner,' 'The Terminator,' or 'Ghost in the Shell,' the latter film was a key (read: obvious) influence of the 'Matrix' films.6/10",6,16,31,6 December 2003
Zombieland," 'Zombieland' survival guide rule #1: Love this movie!
","Ruben Fleischer's 'Zombieland' is one of the best horror-comedies ever made. The horror genre has some real shockers that will no doubt have you cringing with fright in one moment, and then laughing out loud the next - George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978) (my favorite zombie movie of all time, and my favorite horror movie of all time), 'An American Werewolf in London' (1981), 'The Return of the Living Dead' (1985), 'Evil Dead II' (1987), 'Tremors' (1990), 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004), and last year's 'Drag Me to Hell.' It comes close to rivaling 'Shaun of the Dead,' Britain's comedic take on the worldwide zombie pandemic. Now on our home soil, we now have 'Zombieland.'Of course after a worldwide zombie pandemic, one of the last few human survivors is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a nerdy college student whose only real reason for survival is that he's scared of everything, and has an almost endless list of rules for survival; they've done him good so far, but he needs to loosen up a bit and 'enjoy the little things in life.' He soon meets the gun-toting, Twinkie-loving Tallahassee (a scene-stealing Woody Harrelson), who makes killing zombies look easy, cool,and fun. In their travels across the country, they also meet the traveling pair of sisterly survivalists/con artists Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and hope to head for a rumored zombie-free getaway somewhere on the West Coast. (Note that none of the characters in this film have real names, just the names of the places that they supposedly hail from/or are going to.)'Zombieland' is literally fun from the very start. What gets the movie working from its first moments (aside from the hilarious slow-motion opening credits sequence) are the knowing wink-winks aimed directly at the audience that promise you that you're about to watch something very special. And special this movie is, indeed. The movie is pure fan service to the literally dozens of zombie movies and the nihilistic zombie comic books/novels (think author Max Brooks's titanic 'World War Z,' which is required reading for any zombie movie fan) past and present that all seem to reference each other. In that regard, it's really nothing special but damn it, it's pure fun from beginning to end. 'Zombieland,' like 'Shaun of the Dead,' references them all with a knowing wink-wink and a big, goofy smile.(Another aspect of the film that I thought was ingenious is that the zombies themselves are quite formidable. In keeping up with the recent trends in zombie-themed horror flicks - which I believe originated in 'The Return of the Living Dead' - these zombies can run and climb over obstacles in order to munch on human flesh. And true to most zombie movies past and present, there are some impressive special effects zombie kills and the zombies themselves often become objects of some of the film's best laughs. It should also be noted that the zombies themselves also have very little screen time whe compared to the four main leads, and don't really become a major element of the picture until the last 20 minutes. Lastly, how do these characters get away with dropping so many 'Z'-bombs? Don't they know that you never say the word 'zombie' in a zombie movie?)Like 'Shaun of the Dead,' I had a lot of fun watching 'Zombieland.' As a fan of zombie movies, I'm not quite sure how I missed this movie in the theaters. But I can say that the wait for the DVD was well worth it, especially Best Buy's exclusive 'Nut Up or Shut Up Edition.' It is clear that the cast and filmmakers had a ball making this movie, the most obvious of which is Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee. As a zombie-killing redneck with a sweet spot for Twinkies, he really takes his role to heart with one-liner after one-liner and a knowing wink-wink that he's got this part in the bag.If there are any downsides to the experience, it's that the movie is way too short at just a mere 88 minutes, which actually kind of surprised me when I learned that no extended version of the movie - presumably with more character development and gore - is available. But I guess that's only a minor grievance for a movie that does everything that it promises to do, does them right, and then some.'Zombieland' is an impressive new feature about the soon-to-be worldwide zombie pandemic. I can only hope that the (proposed) sequel set for release some time in 2011 is as good as this one.10/10P.S.: In a movie that never ceases to surprise you with the laughs, watch out for a hilarious cameo by comedic actor Bill Murray about halfway through.",10,0,1,13 February 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," I'll have a martini, please
","'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' expresses a degree of 'realism' that's been lacking in most Hollywood movies in the last 10, 15 years or so. When I mean that what's taking place on the screen is real, I mean we get a feeling that the chemistry between stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is genuine. Well, if the rumors are true, then the chemistry is indeed, 'real.'Much has been made in the tabloids in recent months over Brad Pitt's failed marriage to his wife, actress Jennifer Aniston. The rumor mill has centered on the possibility that Pitt's on-screen antics with co-star Jolie were a lot more than just skillful acting. As the rumor mill would have it, things do seem to look the way the media is portraying the stars of this film.Does this hype it up? Sure. Will it work? Definitely. Will it be a box office smash this weekend? Well, let's just see on Monday. While those who read the gossip pages in US Weekly or The National Inquirer will certainly get their just desserts, others who haven't been bombarded by those star-studded tabloid rags may find a surprising level of ingenuity in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith.'Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, a happy suburban couple who literally save each other's necks in Bogota, when the military there is on a manhunt for lone tourists over an apparent assassination attempt on an important political figure. They introduce themselves to each other, go dancing, and spend the night in one another's arms before they realize that they're going to be a lot more than just friends.Much to the dismay of John's friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn), who has more than a slight distrust of women and is living with his mother (the only woman he feels he can trust), they get married. Eddie is another one of those faithful movie buddies, who works with John and Vaughn's role here is a little more than a retread of the character he played in 'Swingers' (1996).Five or six years later, they're living in suburbia, where John has taken up a job as a construction worker, while Jane is a happy-go-lucky housewife, always fixing a beautiful dinner for her husband - who has perfect timing - just as he walks in the door from a hard day's work; they eat dinner, right on the money, at 7:00 p.m.What neither individual is aware of, however, is that they are both highly trained assassins. When they are simultaneously dispatched by their respective handlers to take out a target, this poses a serious problem for the two lovebirds, as they both scramble to find the identity of the rival would-be assailant.The action is paralleled by John and Jane's attendance of marriage counseling and therapy; an off-screen personality provides them with questions to which they answer, either jokingly or honestly. Well, if you found out that your lover is living a secret life as a hired killer, would you attempt to save your marriage? I honestly can't say.The way that this is played out eventually culminates to what is arguably the funniest and most amusing scene in the movie, where Jane cooks John a wonderful dinner. John already has a hunch of Jane's intentions, and it's exciting to see them pick up knives, check food for poisons, test each other, and otherwise try to outdo the rival spouse who may or may not be aware that the other is a hired assassin out for their blood.'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is helmed by Doug Liman, the hip director behind the already mentioned 'Swingers,' which also co-starred Vince Vaughn, 'Go' (1999), and attempted mainstream capability with 'The Bourne Identity' (2002). Here, Liman exercises the comic timing and hip directorial flamboyance he perfected in both of his hit indie flicks.The stars, Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith, have a chemistry that easily surpasses an otherwise ludicrous plot, which is also the film's biggest weakness. Like any average film, it only serves the purpose of providing big set-pieces, that are somehow or another balanced by the stars' attempts at sorting out the complicated details of a crap marriage. Also, how often do we have films where real-life couples come together on the screen, and the film either flops or is a magnificent triumph at the box office? The release of 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' couldn't have come at a better time for either star, as the rumor mill is simply going bonkers over both of their personal lives.'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' works best as a screwball satire of idyllic suburban life, not an action flick. Both Pitt and Jolie aren't strangers to action (Pitt's been in 'True Romance' and 'Spy Game' - both directed by Tony Scott; Jolie starred as Lara Croft in both 'Tomb Raider' films). They fill out their action scenes all right, but aren't terrible or full of themselves in their skills.Well, the tabloids are sure to have a ball with this one, if you haven't already seen the front page stories of their rags. It's a decent effort, if not entirely memorable one. But the tabloids will definitely be this one's biggest ally in helping to rake in the cash over the weekend.7/10",7,1,10,10 June 2005
Die Hard," You'll 'Die Hard' with this action-lover's action movie
","One could claim that 1988's 'Die Hard' is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an 'x' number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.By the time that 'Die Hard' was released, the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris. Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's 'Moonlighting' and 1987's 'Blind Date,' which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero 'John McClane' - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real 'party' - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the 'fly in the ointment' (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, 'Die Hard' did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller 'Predator,' which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.Personally, I think 'Die Hard' is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Like Indiana Jones in that film, 'Die Hard' had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10",10,268,384,4 January 2005
Psycho," I guess it's never too late to thrown in your own love and admiration for a classic film...
","I have to admit that I have a terrible habit of getting around to watching classic movies when it's really late in the game. I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called 'classic' movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both 'Jaws' (1975) and 'Halloween' (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller 'Psycho.'A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. 'Psycho' has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. 'Psycho' finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous 'shower scene,' which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The 'shower scene' itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.'Psycho' is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that 'Psycho' is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. 'Psycho' has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' series), Michael Myers (from the 'Halloween' series), Jason Voorhees (from the 'Friday the 13th' series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series), and countless other imitators. 'Psycho' would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.'Psycho' has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study 'Psycho' (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with 'Psycho,' since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film. At least now I've finally had a chance to see a movie that I've heard so much about and never previously got the chance to watch.10/10",10,6,7,27 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The movie of the day, er, weekend: 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'
","Reflecting on 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,' much of the movie's imagery remains permanently etched into my memory. I remember the ear-shattering sounds of Autobots and Decepticons going head-to-head in many spectacular battles in Shanghai, later in the American wilderness and some unnamed college university, and finally in the Eyptian desert. I also remember the sounds of metal and machinery reconfiguring itself and the camera being able to catch every mechanical whir and clank. But all that mechanical wonder and glory can be drowned out by a great many explosions and crashes, complements of Hollywood's favorite go-to over-director, Michael Bay, who has also found some kind of guidance in over-direction from the legendary Steven Spielberg, breaking away from his previous long-standing relationship with producer Jerry Bruckheimer.I also vividly remember the film's plot, where Our Hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is attending his first year at college, leaving behind girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) so she can help in her ex-con father's rehabilitation; she is also responsible for being the film's most striking image - the first shot of her, lying on a bike with her posterior high up in the air, is pure eye candy and unforgettable, and an early indication of how she will be used in this picture.I predict that 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' will win over many hearts and minds over this Fourth of July weekend, and how could it not? It has giant robots fighting to the death, lots of epic special effects transforming sequences, lots of explosions and of course, Megan Fox (by the way, as a guy, I actually think she's one of the LEAST - least is italicized here - attractive young actresses working in Hollywood at the moment).Bay, that Hollywood hit-maker behind big, explosive epics such as 'The Rock' (1996) (my personal favorite film of his), 'Pearl Harbor' (2001) and 'Bad Boys II' (2003), returns to direct a much bigger, much louder sequel to his 2007 blockbuster hit 'Transformers,' which saw the big-screen debut of the line of toys made popular by toy company Hasbro in the '80s about massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin that mistakenly bring their centuries-old war from their home planet Cybertron to Earth, and their luring Everyman Sam Witwicky into the center of their battle.'Revenge of the Fallen' concerns the malevolent Decepitcons' - now under the leadership of the newly resurrected Megatron - attempts to locate a mysterious alien power source on Earth so that they can drain all the energy from the sun, or something like that. And for that, they need to locate poor college boy Sam Witwicky. Meanwhile, the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, have forged a top-secret Autobot/American military alliance to hunt down rogue Decepticons on Earth. And so, we can basically resume the same 'chase movie' plot between humans and robots from the first film. And somewhere in there, we also learn a little more about the history of the Autobots and Decepticons and their reasons for being on Earth in the first place.Boy, is this film long. But, at 2 1/2 hours, the film is never really boring, despite getting off to a very slow start. There's a lot to like here, and there's a lot to not like. The good is that the movie looks fantastic, is well-acted (especially Agent Simmons, played by a scene-stealing John Turturro), and well-made; I'm really getting tired of saying that about most big Hollywood blockbusters, because any movie being made nowadays can look fantastic and can be well-made and well-acted and still be complete crap. Truly the second best thing that can be said about 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is that Shia LaBeouf is turning out to be one of the most likable Everymen working in Hollywood nowadays, since he is basically continuing the likable Everyman shtick from the first film. Also, Fox looks pretty good, but that's really all that she does for the movie: she looks pretty good.The bad is that the movie is just too long, there are too many unnamed robots running amok (Devastator was awesome beyond words and was actually quite scary, but he wasn't in the movie long enough), and a lot of the comic elements really aren't that funny; of course I'm talking about the jive-talking twin Autobots. Much has been made about these two and their (alleged) racist portrayal of blacks, right down to one of them having a gold tooth. As a black male, I didn't find them offensive in the least bit, but I instead found them to be stupid, unnecessary, distracting, and annoying. Above all, they were terribly un-funny.The best thing that can be said about 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is that while it's not a vastly superior sequel in the least, it's more like the 1980s cartoon series that it inspired it. And that is what will undoubtedly make this movie a winner this Fourth of July weekend.10/10",10,1,5,3 July 2009
War of the Worlds," They're here...
","I have recently commented on the 1953 movie 'The War of the Worlds' - that it was a perfect examination of humans if Martian invaders came to our planet to wipe us out and then looked to call Earth their new home. I re-watched that movie three days ago and it is still effective in telling its story. That film is also a favorite of mine that scared me a lot when I was kid.'The War of the Worlds' has shared a long and colorful history in the annals of American pop culture, since the story's origins began with the publishing of the 1898 novel written by H.G. Wells. Since then, it's been memorably retold in many formats, from Orson Welles' chilling 1938 radio broadcast (which surely enough caused a widespread panic), to Byron Haskin directing the aforementioned first film adaptation in '53, to a television series that ran during the 1980s, and finally to this big-budget action epic that's directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Cruise.If anything, 'War of the Worlds' serves the purpose of returning Spielberg to form in the eyes of the public and a few select members of his fanbase. He really goes for the jugular with this picture in creating a scenario that in tone, is all-too realistic and brings back a mood of terror not evident in Spielberg's work since 'Jaws' (1975). But of course Spielberg is no stranger to aliens, especially with 'E.T.' (1982) and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977) under his belt.And 'War of the Worlds' has a bankable film star - Tom Cruise, who is not on cruise control at all during this picture. Much has been made in recent weeks about Cruise's religious Scientology beliefs, which have since come to include the belief in the existence of aliens. Does this hype it up? Sure. Does this make me want to see it anymore? Yeah. Why? Because with Spielberg and Cruise together, it's a perfect match of two alien geeks, especially since they first teamed up in 'Minority Report' (2002), and that movie was dazzling.As for the movie, it doesn't disappoint in any respect. It features a master filmmaker back in the game of mastering his imaginative craft of storytelling in the most perfect fashion. Actually, though, 'War of the Worlds' is quite literally terrifying. It's impossible to not overlook the real-world similarities present in this film's screenplay by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, as well as the many parallels to our own reality as human beings and the only species in this universe with brains and thoughts of planetary conquest.In 'War of the Worlds,' after a grim opening narration by a gravely voiced Morgan Freeman, enormous and ominous EMP (electromagnetic pulse) storms have been zapping out electrical systems all over the world. I just love this particular segment of the movie, as the mood and tension begin mounting to unbearable levels and never lets up. But of course, we humans are oblivious that our actions on this planet have been monitored by an alien force that has patiently plotted our demise for eons.Gone from this picture are brainy scientist-types and military personnel and it's the better for it; instead we focus in on blue-collar Everyman man-boy Ray Ferrier (Cruise), who has the kids for the weekend. In the tradition of Spielbergian fathers, Ray is irresponsible and not a good dad even though he tries his hardest. Ray's son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) openly despises him for being a bad father but his young daughter Rachel (the amazing Dakota Fanning) is a little more forgiving.This next part is where Spielberg really shows off his skill of imagination, which is when the Martians invade. It turns out that the Martians' tripod war machines were already here, buried deep underground millions of years of ago and when they were ready to attack, the Martians were beamed to Earth in space capsules (through the EMP storms) and reactivated the machines.The tripod war machines make an astonishing debut, rising up out of the ground and then vaporizing countless fleeing humans with their death rays. It soon becomes a race against time as Ray, Robbie, and Rachel try to make it to Boston from New Jersey as they escape the major cities that have fallen to the Martians, as well as the thousands of other desperate, terrified individuals.From the beginning, 'War of the Worlds' wraps you up in its grip and doesn't let go. Tom Cruise is more than adequate, giving one of his finest performances and providing a strong emotional center. The supporting players are great too, especially the delightful Ms. Fanning and a rather creepy cameo from Tim Robbins as Oglivy, a paranoid survivalist.What's most impressive are the Martian invaders and their tripods. Spielberg took a gamble in showing us the Martians' direct confrontation with human beings by presenting the invaders to be vampires, apparently needing blood to survive. Humans are captured by the Martians and are then harvested; the creatures then eject the veinal remains (which are scattered about in areas where the invaders have already hit) and is quite nasty but is still effectively chilling in that it makes them that much more ruthless.If there are any shortcomings, it's that the film's ending seems too abrupt (though it should be familiar to those who have followed the story in its past incarnations), and Spielberg seems to lose his grip on the story as it draws to a close. These are the only things I felt took away from the film.'War of the Worlds' is a perfect summer movie that shows a master on top of his game once again. It's quite terrifying in its premise, as real-world events factor into the on-screen action. It's just too bad we humans won't ever learn from what annihilation will bring onto us if such a thing does occur.8/10",8,1,6,4 July 2005
Man on Fire," 'Man on Fire'
","Director Tony Scott, who some have dubbed the 'lesser' Scott brother (and the one to call when Ridley is unavailable), has had a wildly uneven career over the last 15 years or so. He has his own trademark visual aesthetics down pat, and has directed some relentless action bloodbaths in his career ('The Last Boy Scout,' 'Revenge,' 'True Romance').But since the mid-90s, Scott has tried to relieve himself of those stylized action flicks in favor of more 'respectable' Hollywood productions, and 'Man on Fire' is the latest effort. While 'Man on Fire' boasts some terrific visuals and action, somewhere in the middle, things are lost, but the film isn't a failure because of that.Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed Tony Scott's take of 'Man on Fire.' It has a worthwhile star, Denzel Washington, plot and performances from much of the supporting cast. The problem is, Scott's rendition of 'Man on Fire' is simply too much. It suffers the most from a buildup that seems more perfunctory than dramatic, and bad pacing due to Scott's over-indulgence into the characters.Washington plays Creasy, a bodyguard with a shady past, who is hired by a Mexican businessman named Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) to protect their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). When Pita is kidnapped, Creasy embarks on a mercilessly bloody quest of vengeance to find those responsible, and eventually traces those links back to the family household that hired him.The film focuses pretty much, for almost the entire first hour, on the developing relationship between Creasy and Pita. And therein lies the problem: the previews had led us to believe that Washington was going to kick some serious a** but unfortunately none of that occurs until the last 45 minutes or so. So until then, you'd have to sit through a lot of dialogue and people standing around talking.None of that is bad really, except if you're more of a fan of bloody thrillers (which Scott had become famous for during the 90s), but 'Man on Fire' is made more for those who like action movies with a purpose, other than blowing stuff up.Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are both flawless, in roles that really are moving and profound, as are most of the supporting players including Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, and Mickey Rourke. Scott himself is showing signs that he's maturing into a true filmmaker and is not living in older brother Ridley's directorial shadow.'Man on Fire' does of course contain many of Scott's trademarks, including twisting, beautiful cinematography and visuals, tough, convincing characters, and stylized bloody violence. Scott even makes good use of the lush Mexican setting and uses them substantially in staging the action sequences.All in all, 'Man on Fire' gets a '7,' and I certainly enjoyed it a lot for what it was.",7,1,3,10 November 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' - 10/10
","It is widely believed by a number of critics that Milos Forman's 1975 Best Picture-Winner, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (only the second film in history to win all five major Academy Awards), is an anti-establishment, anti-conformist, anti-anything.  I think it's all of those things, plus the most crucial element that some seem to be overlooking: You can't defeat the human spirit.  This film is remarkable in its portrayal of people who are uniquely human, and director Milos Forman knows this, especially during the opening scenes at the hospital when he shows us the patients going about a daily routine of standing in line awaiting medication.  Jack Nicholson is brilliant in a winning performance as R.P. McMurphy.  As McMurphy, Nicholson is a rebellious con artist who faked insanity to avoid time in jail, and is sent to a mental hospital where he encounters the dispirited patients and runs afoul of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  McMurphy begins to enlighten many of the patients, including Billy (Brad Dourif) and Chief (Will Sampson), a mute and deaf man who everybody thinks is retarded.A truly unique film that isn't to be missed.",10,1,2,24 August 2003
Army of Darkness," Can they be stopped, the 'Army of Darkness'?
","If chins could kill Â– 'Army of Darkness' is director Sam Raimi's insanely funny and action-packed (and presumed) closer to his 'Evil Dead' trilogy. Chaos reigns supreme in this third entry, with smart-alecky demon-slayer Ash (Bruce Campbell) being magically transported back to the medieval ages. Between his flirtations with local maiden Sheila (Embeth Davidtz), battling the evil deadites including his clone Evil Ash and Raimi's penchant for gut-busting manic hilarity (which often places Ash on the receiving end of a proverbial foot in the a**), we get what is very easily one of the most innovative horror movies ever envisioned. It's clear Raimi and company are having a blast here; 'Army of Darkness' has become the director's pre-'Spider-Man' signature piece, and has made Campbell the cult icon he became under Raimi's guidance. The one-liners fly, boomsticks blast, laughs are plentiful, and 'Army of Darkness' remains an unquestioned masterpiece of slapstick horror-comedy.",10,2,3,3 October 2005
Con Air," 'Con Air' - What a wild ride!
","I have to say that 1997's Jerry Bruckheimer-produced, Simon West-directed 'Con Air' is one of the best action films to come out during the cynical, seen-it-all late '90s. The film is over-the-top with over-the-top characters, dialogue and situations that are just too over-the-top to be truly believable and deliberately so. But damn it, is this movie good and endlessly re-watchable - 14 long years after the fact!True to most Bruckheimer productions (it was only just Bruckheimer at this point because his long-time business partner Don Simpson had only just passed away the year before during their time on 1996's Michael Bay-directed 'The Rock,' and that film was dedicated to his memory), 'Con Air' is loud, crazy, and there is not anything even remotely close to resembling a brain cell in sight during its 122-minute running time (this review is based on the extended version). But like I said, damn this movie is really good.'Con Air' begins in the aftermath of the U.S. military's Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and U.S. Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) has just returned home to Mobile, Alabama, after his tour of duty overseas. Before he can break out the celebrations with his pregnant wife Tricia (Monica Potter), he gets into a drunken brawl with three locals and kills one of them. An unsympathetic judge sentences Cameron to no less than seven to 10 years behind bars for his crime.Eight years passes and the day Cameron has eagerly awaited has finally come: he's been paroled, and he's on his way home to reunite with Tricia and see his young daughter Casey (Landry Allbright) for the very first time on her birthday (July 14). He's hitching a ride home on the U.S. Marshal's prisoner-transport plane, The Jailbird, along with his buddy Mike 'Baby-O' O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). This same flight is a special one, because it is also transporting some of this country's most lethal criminal offenders to a brand-new maximum-security penitentiary in Alabama - a place that has been 'designed to house the worst of the worst... most of these guys are lifers, some on death row,' one official exclaims.Some of these 'colorful,' over-the-top characters Cameron and 'Baby-O' are sharing this ride with include arsonist and dope addict Joe 'Pinball' Parker (comedian Dave Chappelle), who is actually one of the least dangerous of all these hardened criminals and is essentially a nice guy; the notorious serial rapist 'Johnny-23' (Danny Trejo) - '23' standing for 23 counts of rape - and who has his eyes set on the flight's sole female, Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin); Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a former general in a black militant organization who blew up an NRA meeting; mass murderer William 'Billy Bedlam' Bedford (Nick Chinlund), who proudly boasts that he's serving eight consecutive life sentences for killing his cheating wife's entire family, even the dog; the soft-spoken, yet weaselly Hannibal Lecter-wannabe Garland Green (the weaselly Steve Buscemi), 'The Marietta Mangler,' who went on a serial-killing spree that spanned up and down the entire Eastern seaboard; and the notorious criminal mastermind Cyrus 'Cyrus the Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich), 'who likes to brag that he's killed more men than cancer.'Predictably, some of these convicts, led by 'The Virus,' get loose during the middle of the flight, kill some of the guards and take control of the plane, which he not-so-subtly re-names 'Con Air' for a trip to a non-extradition country somewhere south of the border. Cameron and 'Baby-O' realize they're in way over their heads on this flight. Meanwhile on the ground, U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) clashes with DEA Agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) over how to bring the situation to a resolution that will hopefully please everybody but it appears that the only one capable of saving the day is Cameron.'Con Air' is loud, brash, and over-the-top (did I say that it was over-the-top already several times?). It's hard to believe that Michael Bay WASN'T in the director's chair this time, since it contains many of his trademarks including fast editing, crazy characters, outlandish dialogue, stunning action sequences, explosions, car chases, and shootouts. What involvement he had, if any, on this picture is unclear, but it is clear that Simon West definitely took his cues from Bay and definitely knew how to stage the picture in his vain. That goes to show you Bay's influence in movies these days.Cage is good in another one of his trademark low-key performances, since this action flick was made to cash in on his massive popularity following his Oscar win for 'Leaving Las Vegas' (1995). It's clear the actor worked pretty hard on his Southern accent and hand-to-hand combat skills as well as his physical appearance in order to beef up for the role. The actors playing the convicts seem to be having the most fun here, though, and let loose with over-the-top (there's that hyphenate again!) theatrics and performances, especially the lunatic criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus played by John Malkovich. He's made a career out of playing creepy, compelling psychopathic bad guys (like in 'In the Line of Fire'), and with his role as the steely-eyed 'The Virus,' he has more cause to celebrate as this is one of his greatest portrayals of movie villainy.'Con Air' is one boldly energetic and exciting action flick. I've seen the movie well over a dozen times since it first came out in 1997 and it's never lost its luster or ability to be exciting, brain-dead entertainment. Trust me, it's one wild ride you'll want to take again and again!10/10",10,0,0,8 July 2011
Jaws," Finally, 33 years later, I've seen the movie that reminded us to not go in the water...
","'Jaws' is a movie for the ages. It's an example of what happens when the right people come together for the right reasons, for the right movie.Firstly, author Peter Benchley co-wrote the screenplay (the screenplay itself is adapted from his own novel of the same name) that became one of the new, classic scary-stories of our time: a huge great white shark is terrorizing the residents of a small New England beach community. Amity Police Chief Brody (the recently departed Roy Scheider), marine expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and grizzled shark hunter Quint (the late Robert Shaw) are the heroic three who volunteer to have a climatic showdown with this man-eating menace appropriate described as mother nature's ultimate killing machine.I should make it clear that for years I was never one of this movie's biggest fans. So I just kind of avoided it - the theme just didn't appeal to me, since I've never been afraid to go swimming at the beach. But guess what? 'Jaws' is the classic adventure-horror of our times, and I am now amongst one of its many, many fans. A lot of things are classic about this movie - it's pointless to even describe them here.Also, I'm sure there are a number of scientific inaccuracies about the true nature of sharks (the recently departed shark hunter who inspired 'Quint' always said he felt sorry for the shark in this movie) and whether or not they are truly something to fear - but, you know what? - it's Hollywood, they always win. And I'm also sure that the liberties with sharks were liberties well-taken for the sake of dramatic potential: This movie did its job in scaring the living daylights out of a lot of people.Most importantly, other than serving up great scares, suspense and adventure, 'Jaws' is responsible for starting the career of Hollywood director Steven Spielberg. 'Jaws' was his claim to fame; it's also the movie credited for starting the summer blockbuster phenomenon (this currently ranks pretty high amongst one of the highest-grossing movies of all time), and spawning three sequels and countless imitators. Spielberg would go on to do great things in his career, long after 'Jaws,' and he still continues to do great things to do this day because of this movie. It's probably one of my favorite movies of his and one of my favorite movies of all time.'Jaws' is a movie not likely to ever go away any time soon. That is part of its appeal: its ability to remain an important piece of cinema and a pop culture phenomenon that continues to genuinely frighten us even 33 years after its release. And that is also the mark of a truly great film. It's a powerful example of what film-making can really do when the right people are involved in the right movie, for the right reasons.10/10",10,12,24,12 November 2008
Hancock," A flawed, weird, funny, and action-packed new look at the superhero movie
","I think Superman co-creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster would have a hard time with 'Hancock,' a movie that is pretty much the anti-thesis to the DC Comics flagship character who first appeared in 'Action Comics #1' back in 1938. The rebellious actor-turned-director Peter Berg sees to it that this cinematic creation sits neatly in his own universe and revels in it.'Hancock' is a fun new look at the superhero. As a comic book reader, I had high expectation for this picture; what begins as a sort of original parody/satire of superheroes evolves into something else halfway through, giving us the feeling that the movie suddenly retreats to formula when things finally seem to be getting really interesting. Funny that a film such as this would be suffering from an identity crisis - it seems to have two scripts here: the superhero movie satire and the superhero movie itself.Hancock (a surprisingly engaging Will Smith) is a hard-boozing, hard-living modern-day superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public in Los Angeles. His acts of super-heroics - while super-heroic - are often highly destructive and have cost the city millions in damages. Finally, the city has had enough and a warrant is issued for Hancock's arrest.After saving the life of image consultant Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), Embrey takes it upon himself to give the boozy, hard-living Hancock an extreme image makeover in the hopes of redeeming this once-widely admired lush and helping him to earn back his superhero mantle.I already explained that this movie is flawed, due largely to its script - or rather, two scripts, that don't turn out to be some hideous comic book mutant, like it could have been, had this movie completely derailed off the tracks - that seek to take things in two different directions when things seem to be getting fresh, original, and interesting. What keeps the project from really falling apart, in my opinion, is the fresh new look at comic book superheroes and their personal lives, as well as the plot twist two-thirds of the way through.'Hancock' gives its title character a complex and involving origin story, one that spans centuries, and somehow involves Embrey's pretty wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who certainly harbors some interesting secrets of her own that are very engaging themselves. Of action scenes and special effects, there's no short in 'Hancock.' This is a summer movie, after all, and it's obvious that a pretty penny went into producing this film's action sequences.'Hancock' is still an enjoyable action picture, even with its flaws. I still had a lot of fun. I only hope 'Hancock' maybe gets his own comic book title soon, or animated series, or at least a sequel that better fleshes out some of the film's more original ideas.8/10",8,1,2,26 November 2008
Kong: Skull Island," Into the 'Heart of Darkness' with King Kong
","2017's 'Kong: Skull Island' was a much better film than I anticipated it to be. Perhaps my enjoyment of the film was strengthened by the fact that I didn't go into it with very many expectations - as I had shielded myself from the hype and plot details for months, ever since it was announced that the film was being produced.Boy, am I glad that I cared little, at first, to read or see anything regarding this picture. (I honestly did not care to see the film, period, but my curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad that it did.)What I did know, before going in, was that 'Kong: Skull Island' was meant to reboot and reintroduce King Kong for the modern era - and set up a possible future crossover with 'Godzilla' (2014); Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are behind the whole thing. (And rumors suggest that 'Pacific Rim' may figure in there somewhere, too.) I'm 31, going on 32. I grew up on the original 1933 'King Kong,' as well as the 1962 Japanese kaiju-eiga (Japanese monster movie) 'King Kong vs. Godzilla,' which saw America's Eighth Wonder of the World go head-to-head against Japan's mighty King of the Monsters. ('King Kong vs. Godzilla' is referenced here, too, in one brief eagle-eyed scene, just to show that the filmmakers had in fact done their homework.) Honestly, 2020 cannot get here fast enough for this monster movie fan.But back to 'Kong: Skull Island.' Let me just say, this film did not disappoint in the slightest. I saw the film with a good friend of mine (which enhanced the experience for me on a deeply personal level). I was surprised to find the picture working from its opening moments, which begins in World War II before fast-forwarding to 1973 during the height of the Vietnam War era. Mixing the story of the original 1933 'King Kong' with elements of 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) (and its source material, the novella 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad) and 'Platoon' (1986), plus the South Korean monster movie 'The Host' (2006) and the critically acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki Anime' 'Princess Mononoke' (1997), 'Kong: Skull Island' proves to be one of the more original films of its genre - since I did not know much of this beforehand.The story involves a scientific expedition led by Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his young associate Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) to the titular Skull Island, an uncharted destination located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean that he compares to the Bermuda Triangle, and he has a small helicopter contingent of the U.S. Army led by Lieutenant Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) as a military escort. Leading them all into the jungle (the 'Heart of Darkness'), is an expert hunter-tracker and former British S.A.S. soldier named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston). Once on the island, they come to make an amazing discovery of a world that time forgot - and it is ruled by a monster-god who is the last of his kind, but the 'King' of his domain...This version of King Kong is a true force to be reckoned with. Brilliantly motion-captured by Terry Notary, this is a Kong that can think and displays ample cunning and intelligence, and attitude. Reimagined here as a fierce protector of his homeland (but whose role is not unchallenged by some of the other ungodly prehistoric beasts on Skull Island), it'll be very interesting to see him go toe-to-toe with Godzilla in three years. That should be an incredible monster battle re-match from when they first fought in 1962.'Kong: Skull Island' is a film that had me on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire time that I was watching it. It's not perfect, but director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has crafted a wonderful first entry into a possible amazing franchise. Its screenplay is credited to three writers, one of whom is Max Borenstein, who was on-board 2014's 'Godzilla' (and thereby sealing the behind-the-scenes connection to that film). Where the film may ultimately fall short, are in its characterizations. While Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly (in a surprise cameo halfway through the film) give the most note-worthy performances, you do care about what happens to everyone, even lesser developed characters like Packard's straight-laced right-hand man Jack Chapman (an effective Toby Kebbell, who also motion-captured Kong's performance along with Terry Notary). My personal favorite character was U.S. Army pilot Slivko (Thomas Mann). Maybe it's because I like Thomas Mann a lot as an actor and that I've enjoyed everything I've seen him in (namely 2012's 'Project X'), that I gravitated mostly toward his character here and hoped he made it out okay.'Kong: Skull Island' is a thoroughly enjoyable monster film from start to finish. I had my fun with it. My lack of knowledge beforehand undoubtedly helped me like this movie a lot more than I thought I would, I think. I'm glad that I had the chance to see it yesterday with my friend.P.S.: Its soundtrack features many songs from the Vietnam era (Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid'!), and if you enjoy the music from that time, you'll probably like the movie a whole lot more.P.S. #2: Stay through the lengthy end credits. You won't regret it. Serious.9/10",9,33,67,10 March 2017
Hitch," 'Hitch' - It worked for me, but will it work for you?
","'Hitch,' the new romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant and starring Will Smith, is a delightful film if not completely original, and this is coming from someone who usually hates movies like this and didn't have the slightest hopes of liking it. For one, Smith is one of the most likable personalities in current popular entertainment, and I found him to be quite appealing as the lead character of the film's title.To collect my thoughts, I had to watch 'Hitch' twice before I felt that I could accurately relay its effect on me into this comment. 'Hitch' worked for me because, I myself, fall more or less into the category of men that date doctor Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Smith) helps with their dating woes and who desperately need to meet a special woman at the office, next door, or just saw walking down the street.But as stated earlier, I usually detest Hollywood romantic comedies, especially one as by-the-numbers as 'Hitch,' but damn it, it worked both times I viewed the movie. My highly critical and skeptical expectations of no-joy were proved wrong on both occasions and now I feel that 'Hitch' could be required viewing for any one guy that desperate for a gal.To quote Hitch, 'If there was ever a man born without game, it was Albert Brennaman (Kevin James),' and this leads into part of the film's main plot. Albert is the screen epitome of the Lonely Guy (almost too convincing, if you ask me) and the film takes great liberty in showcasing his comedic social ineptitude and clumsiness around beautiful women.He's Hitch's latest client, and he wants to hook up with the lovely celebrity heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta) a la Paris Hilton. Albert works as one of Allegra's many yes-men account consultants and he desperately wants a date with her since she just ended a relationship and the tabloids are all over her every movement like a broom.Albert's attempts with Allegra are paralleled by Hitch's own dating insecurities, in which his current romantic entanglement is with a pretty but man-cynical gossip columnist named Sara Milas (Eva Mendes). The budding romance that develops between the two is sweet and touching but as with all Hollywood love stories, is destined to run into trouble. And trouble comes along when the plot reveals that Sara is determined to expose the notorious New York date doctor, who of course unknown to her, is tall, dark & handsome Hitch. The results of the encounter, as the plot would require, are not pretty.'Hitch' works largely because of the likability of its screen stars (Smith, who I've already mentioned), Eva Mendes as his love interest, and the hapless Kevin James as Albert. All three do wonders for their respective roles and the film is the better for that. But the success lie in its timing: the movie was released the weekend before Valentine's Day! So 'Hitch' WOULD make for a great date movie and I'm sure that's what it's going to go down in cinematic history as.Any complaints? Yeah, why not. The biggest misstep 'Hitch' suffers from is its story, which ironic as it seems, is very fun and sharp, but ultimately uneven. The romance between the two leads is good, fun and wholesome, but the subplot with Albert and Allegra, to me, is far more interesting. I wanted to see their relationship become a lot more developed, but more time seemed devoted to Hitch and his relationship with Sara. The film seems to focus more on Hitch and Sara than it does Albert and Allegra, who I'd been led beforehand to believe the story was really about.But with that aside, 'Hitch' is still fun to watch. Then there is the lingering question of the validity of Hitch's information. Will it work for Lonely Guy? Maybe, but a woman who watches this movie might be warm to his intentions. So it might be wise for him to steer clear of Hitch's advice, if he knows what's good for him.But still, if only more guys like Hitch existed in real life too and were able to give credible dating advice...8/10",8,1,2,15 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'Revenge of the Sith' - An epic closer that shows Lucas' return to form
","The saying 'Third time's a charm' is more relevant with the fantastic 'Star Wars' films than I think it's been with any other action series. Its creator, George Lucas, first kicked off 'Star Wars' in 1977, and revolutionized the way people made movies, as well as how people view them.As a casual fan of the 'Star Wars' saga, I found this entry to be quite an (un)pleasant ride, but that's its entire point: to show a man's slide to the 'dark side of the Force.' The prequel trilogy has slowly lead up to this film, and I can definitely tell anyone who views it that the six-year wait was well worth it.In 'Revenge of the Sith,' Lucas demonstrates skill and directorial excellence that's been noticeably lacking in the past two prequel installments, 'The Phantom Menace' (1999) and 'Attack of the Clones' (2002). In fact, he reaches the peak of his skill in this film in a way that hasn't been seen since the original trilogy.As a movie, it runs an epic 140 minutes and doesn't waste a single frame. Critics and fans have always panned the dialogue in 'Star Wars' and here it's no different, but Lucas is able to draw attention away from that by focusing on dazzling visuals, lightsaber battles, and other action sequences.Die-hards have argued in the past about how the new films betray the originality and daring feats exercised in the original trilogy. They make the point about how much Lucas was able to do so much with so little in the absence of CGI 28 years ago in '77. When he re-released his original trilogy in 1997 (with newly added CGI footage and effects), it left a sour taste in the mouths of the fans, as the only film that was significantly improved was 'A New Hope' (1977).Lucas has countered that by stating that he's only bringing forth his epic vision to the best realization that it can possibly get. Die-hards, of course, have argued that he tends to go overboard sometimes, and that in some epic lightsaber battles, like this film's climax, tend to only be pleasing to the MTV-generation crowd, not the film's hardcore fanbase.Of course, what is greatest about 'Sith' is its story, which is a continuation of the two previous episodes and wraps itself up so it can lead into the original trilogy. Issues of continuity and logic are always plaguing films like 'Star Wars,' but I think that Lucas was smart enough to tie up loose ends without much difficulty.And then there are the performances. Acting has never been an admirable quality in a 'Star Wars' movie (save the late Alec Guinness, and maybe Harrison Ford), but Hayden Christensen (as Anakin Skywalker) may be next in line for an Oscar nomination, as we watch a once benevolent young man descend into the depths of evil in its most despicable form, and finally become what he was destined to be: Darth Vader.Lastly, today's hostile political climate also figures into Lucas' screenplay, with countless parallels to tragic real world events here in the United States and abroad. Observant viewers will note how the Republic in this film closely mirrors the grim direction that the U.S. is heading under our current administration. And I strongly believe that in interviews, Lucas has been quite frank about his feelings regarding these issues.'Revenge of the Sith' is the last installment of a film series that has finally regained some momentum under its creator. George Lucas shows why he's one of our most capable, if not all-around greatest filmmakers.10/10",10,3,15,30 May 2005
The Terminal," Life is like a can of Planters, especially when you're stuck in 'The Terminal'
","'The Terminal' opens up amidst the hustle and bustle of newly arrived international travelers as they wait in long lines to be processed onto American soil.Tom Hanks plays one such traveler, a confused Eastern European named Viktor, who is unable to enter into the United States because a military coup in his fictional home country has rendered his passport and visa useless.With little options (he's dubbed as a 'crack in the system') and because he can't go into the U.S. nor can he go back to his country, he is forced to actually live within the confines of JFK airport's international lounge. (Given this shaky premise, it could easily have turned into a movie with too many so-so gags that play on the plight of foreign travelers.)'The Terminal' plays on a note unlike many of Steven Spielberg's previous comedic efforts, a note that's actually quite funny. Spielberg, who also directed Hanks two years ago in 'Catch Me If You Can,' reuses some of the conventional comedic elements that were present in that movie.Spielberg, like Hanks, seems casual and takes an Everyman approach to his material (which is somewhat sensitive, pending on your ideological bent about U.S. national security) in guiding his actors along this interesting ride through an airport terminal.Tom Hanks is at an all-time great here (with a perfect Bulgarian accent too), playing the stranger in a strange land to perfection, and the thing about it is, he's not even really trying.One sequence that I found to be particularly funny, is when Viktor returns airport baggage carts to the machines for quarters, and uses the change to pay for food and books. This also leads him to eventually land a job as an airport construction worker, so that he can impress a pretty flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones).'The Terminal' is a funny, fun ride through and through.8/10",8,0,1,28 November 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," 'The Shawshank Redemption'
","Now this is why we go to movies. I'm surprised at how this film flopped when it was first released in 1994 and yet 11 years later, it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I think it's the greatest movie of all time (sorry, to all of those who think that title goes to 'The Godfather'). Yet, here is a movie that in all instances should have failed. Maybe it was because of the plot, which shared too many likenesses to every cliché prison drama we've ever seen. But I assure you, that's not what goes on here. Directed by Frank Darabont, who wrote the film's script, which is an adaptation of the Stephen King short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,' 'The Shawshank Redemption' is filled with a strong sense of self-worth and purpose. Yes, in the beginning a man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for a murder he did not commit. Behind the walls of Shawshank penitentiary, Andy finds himself the victim (a 'fish' - prison slang for a new arrival) of violent acts by other hardcore convicts. He begins a tentative friendship with a fellow lifer, Red (Morgan Freeman, in an Oscar-nominated role), and Andy finds himself doing the taxes of the warden (Bob Gunton). In all of this, we know that a man, like Andy, is not meant to be locked up, whether he committed a heinous crime or not because simply, the human spirit is not meant to kept down by mortal circumstances. This lends a great amount of weight and structure to the film's most powerful image, which has ingrained itself indelibly into our minds. This movie carefully avoids clichés, and it's the better for it. Tim Robbins is a revelation in this movie, as is Morgan Freeman and the rest of the supporting players. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a film about hope in even the most bleak of places, which could be considered prison. It's a movie that has rightfully earned a place in cinematic history as a legend and a masterpiece of film. It's no wonder why.10/10",10,0,3,29 June 2005
Platoon," This film is really something ***SPOILERS***
","Even after 16 years, 'Platoon' still is something that is wondrous to behold. Directed by Oliver Stone, whose personal experiences in the Vietnam War were inspirations for the film's script, makes this movie simply stunning.The four Oscars that this movie won including Best Picture and Best Director - Oliver Stone just goes to show how amazing this movie is. The musical score is also one of the best I've ever heard. Evidently, some people today, don't really think that this movie is as great as it used to be. 'Platoon' over the years has received quite a bit of criticism. For example, some people have attacked the possibility of a civil war ever erupting between two groups of soldiers in a platoon. I agree it is hard to imagine something like that happening, but that doesn't mean it isn't likely. The tension that grows between Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe) has been growing for some time. Barnes believes that the Vietnamese should be wiped off the face of the earth. Elias, who is slightly more humanitarian, believes that the war is already lost and has deeply immersed himself in drugs just to escape the grim realities of Vietnam. Elias' demise at the hands of Barnes goes to show how far down the path he has gone. Two things to watch out for between these two: Elias' in his final climatic scene and Barnes' burning red eyes at the end of the movie. Another criticism people seem to have with this movie, is its special effects, namely explosions, gunfire, etc. People have attacked the effects because to them, they say that they're dated. Well of course they are, this movie was made in 1986. Compared to today's war movies such as 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan', it's no wonder that it will seem out-dated.But the effects in this film were pretty state-of-art when this movie was released.The performances here are excellent. I've never seen Tom Berenger or Willem Dafoe in better performances. Of course, this is really Charlie Sheen's movie, as this is his best role yet. The supporting performances from Keith David, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, John C. McGinley and Kevin Dillon are amongst some of their finest performances as well.This is Oliver Stone's finest directorial effort to date. He's never matched it but has come pretty close especially with 'JFK' and 'Born on the Fourth of July' under his belt. 10/10",10,1,2,2 August 2002
Scream," 'Scream' - 15 years later, it's still the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slasher movies!
","OK, here it is, finally, the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slashers: 'Scream' is the popular 1996 slasher epic that single-handedly signaled the return of the slasher movie, and also single-handedly revitalized the sagging horror genre. But there was a twist: a large part of 'Scream's' massive success had to deal with its open acknowledgment of its source material, lending the movie a level of self-awareness that had never been done before in horror (or at the very least, done very successfully).The closest horror movies I can probably think of before then might have been 'The Lost Boys' (1987), or maybe even 'An American Werewolf in London' (1981). (And yes, I do realize there is a possibility that I could be wrong, but those are the only two I can immediately think of.)The movie also represented a marriage of old and new: horror maestro Wes Craven ('A Nightmare on Elm Street,' 'The Hills Have Eyes,' 'The Last House on the Left,' 'Shocker,' - to name a few), the man behind the camera of this wildly inventive slasher, was a seasoned professional in the horror genre at the time, yet his career at the point up until 'Scream' seemed seriously lagging - despite the mild success of the reality-bending 'New Nightmare' in 1994. Enter into the picture newbie screenwriter Kevin Williamson, whose inspired script for 'Scream' took the lessons of past slasher flicks and injected a hip, knowing, mid-1990s cynicism and self-consciousness into the material that didn't ride the fine line into camp territory: the kids in this movie spoke and acted like they *knew* they were in a horror film. Together, these two gave us horror movie heaven - 'Scream.'Despite the over-riding sense of self-knowing and movie-referencing humor, 'Scream' is still edge-of-your-seat entertainment of the first order. It's a ludicrous premise that in theory should not work, but it does: the movie is still pretty damn scary (in addition to being gruesomely bloody and gory), even though all the characters are keenly aware of the 'facts' of horror movies yet still knowingly break the rules established by the three godfathers of the slasher genre - the aforementioned 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (my personal favorite slasher movie), 'Halloween' (1978), and 'Friday the 13th' (1980).The film's plot is deceptively simple: Somebody is taking their love of scary movies too far, and they're making a killing (pun intended). The classic opening double-murder sequence (featuring Drew Barrymore) sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and that is a non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills, chills, and laughs. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, whose performance here officially ushered her into being the MTV generation's scream queen) leads an all-star cast of a slasher movie that also doubles as a brilliantly thrilling whodunit.So whodunit? It obviously wasn't the ultra-feisty reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), nor was it Sidney's best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) or Tatum's bumbling older brother, Deputy Dewey (David Arquette). Or was it one of them? Either way, other suspects include Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich, whose character's name is an obvious reference to the late Donald Pleasance's Dr. Sam Loomis from ye old 'Halloween'), Tatum's mentally deficient boy-toy Stu (Matthew Lillard), or was it the movie-loving uber-geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy)?I've seen 'Scream' countless times over the years, several of those times were in a high school graphic design class my sophomore year. I got into it around '99 or 2000, three or four years after the fact, but I loved it from the opening moments. Upon a refresher viewing today to mark the 15th anniversary of the film's release, I realize 'Scream' has not lost of any its impact. But because 'Scream' was the movie that revitalized the horror and slasher genres in a single dose, it didn't take long for imitators to follow its self-knowing, movie-referencing satirical formula, and some of those imitators include its three sequels (released in 1997, 2000 and 2011, respectively). (And how about those slasher movie parodies in the 'Scary Movie' series? Isn't it ironic that 'Scream' was initially titled 'Scary Movie'?) It was a formula that worked once and only once.Most famously, perhaps, 'Scream' firmly established once and for all, the 'rules' for surviving horror movies. Drum roll, Randy:1) Sex = death,2) No drinking or doing drugs, and3) Never say, 'I'll be right back' because you won't be.15 years later, 'Scream' is just as thrilling, entertaining, and funny as it was when I first saw it as an impressionable teenager in 1999 or 2000. Wes Craven has always had a way for directing scary movies with lively and three-dimensional characters, but 'Scream' carried the revered horror master and his chief screenwriter into mainstream blockbuster territory, three more times, even.(Yes, I loved - that's right, I said I loved 'Scream 4'; it's the best and funniest since the original.)10/10",10,12,13,21 October 2011
Never Back Down," 'The Karate Kid' plus MMA (mixed martial arts); by-the-numbers all the way
","Don't tap-out yet!From reading the title 'Never Back Down,' you get the impression that what you're about to watch will be something pretty macho and also pretty lame - a bad combination. The claims of this being a remake of 'The Karate Kid' plus 'Fight Club' and mixed martial arts is not undeserved or inappropriate. What it does aim to be, is a 'Karate Kid' for the MTV generation and a generation of kids who may think that MMA is the future of the martial arts.As a casual fan of mixed martial arts, the gladiator-style spectacle of this sport goes all the way back to the Greeks, with their sport Pankration (which pretty much resembles today's MMA). The idea of cross-training and mixing techniques of different fighting styles gained popularity in the 20th century with Bruce Lee and his theories on Jeet Kune Do (which when translated from Cantonese, means 'the way of the intercepting fist'). However, mixed martial arts, as we know it today in the Ultimate Fighting Championships (UFC), PRIDE and other MMA organizations, gained widespread recognition when Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grappler Royce Gracie won UFC 1 in 1993. Since then, a revolution has been sparked in the world of full-contact fighting. (On a side, UFC president Dana White considers Bruce Lee the 'father of modern mixed martial arts.')In 'Never Back Down,' which seeks to promote MMA for the mainstream, Jake Tyler (Sean Faris, who looks remarkably like a young Tom Cruise) is a promising football player who is relocated with his widowed mother and younger brother from their home in Iowa to the posh surroundings of upper-class Orlando, Florida; they opt for a cramped apartment in suburbia away from the surf and bikini-clad babes. Right away, it's established that Jake's a born brawler and has a chip on his shoulder, so right away the filmmakers are attempting to remove themselves from the 'Karate Kid' legacy.Right away, he locks eyes on the pretty blonde Baja Miller (Amber Heard, uh-huh), and she invites new-kid Jake to a party later that night. At this same party, he locks heads with rich-boy Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet), a champion MMA fighter who gets the upper hand on Jake and beats him to a pulp in a no-holds-barred brawl.All hope is not lost. On his first day of school, Jake had witnessed a fight happening under the bleachers, where an outcast kid named Max (Evan Peters) was getting his butt kicked by Ryan and his goons. It just so happens that Max is being trained by the legendary MMA champ Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou) and takes him under his wing. So cue the MTV soundtrack and training montage.In terms of being a simple martial arts movie, 'Never Back Down' is nothing new. Plenty of martial arts movies have been made about the bullied good guy who gets his butt kicked, learns to fight from a master, and tests out his newfound skills by getting revenge on his tormentors in the ring. The by-the-numbers script by Chris Hauty pays attention to a few of the details of modern mixed martial arts training, but doesn't really go into any real depth about it, even if some of the harsher stuff is only glossed over for the sake of trying to mainstream it. But I also guess that this Jeff Wadlow-directed vehicle has seen way too many better movies, and it's inherently self-referential toward them.'Never Back Down,' I guess, is a fun way to spend $7.75 (what I spent); at the very least, even if the plot is formulaic, it's still entertaining. The acting, writing and plot are decent, but still, the performances, acting and writing, like everything else, are by-the-numbers. Although we don't really wade grimly through worthless dialogue scenes, we do perk up for the fighting and training sequences. The best thing about these scenes is that they're authentic: what the actors are doing is so 'real' you 'believe' it. As brutal as they are (even for a 'PG-13'-rated movie), they're fairly exciting and there isn't a whole bunch of flashy camera cutting that takes away from the intensity of the full-contact punching and kicking. The camera stays put for the most part and isn't moving all over the place. It looks like the actors are really going at it, and it looks like it hurts. So you 'believe' it in a way you don't really do for a lot of martial arts movies made in America these days.And that's what no-holds-barred is all about, right?6/10",6,65,104,14 March 2008
Prometheus," 'Prometheus' - More questions than answers...
","Prometheus - 'A Titan in Greek legend who steals fire from heaven as a gift for man' (Websters Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, 1965)With Ridley Scott's 2012 futuristic science fiction adventure-thriller 'Prometheus' (his first sci-fi film since the 1982 science fiction landmark 'Blade Runner'), the audience gets more questions than answers - even though one of the movie's tag-lines is, 'Questions will be answered.' Heavily touted early on as a prequel of sorts to Scott's equally ground-breaking sci-fi/horror masterpiece 'Alien' (1979), 'Prometheus' IS more or less - mostly less, but also a little bit more - a prequel to 'Alien,' while also leaving an open-ended conclusion that will spin more sequels to the prequel that supposedly started the whole thing in the first place.'Prometheus' is a visual marvel; this cannot be denied by anyone watching the movie with an open mind (and with their eyes pried wide open). Scott has always been a strong, masterful visual filmmaker; most filmmakers can have a strong visual sense, but weak story-telling capabilities. Scott, always the strong visual-lover, remember, tells a sweeping existentialist tale regarding questions about humanity's origins (including our potential beginnings in the stars), the role of God in the equation (if any, really), meeting your maker (a central theme in Scott's earlier 'Blade Runner'), and why a creator would ultimately want to destroy the creation that they labored so hard to create. But again, Scott's 'Prometheus' may only leave the audience even MORE confused than BEFORE they went in.'Prometheus' begins with a sweeping panoramic view of what is presumably an alien planet that looks remarkably a lot like Earth, backed with a majestic orchestral overture by composer Mark Streitenfeld (who's serviceable, but he's no Jerry Goldsmith - may he rest in peace - who composed the moody, atmospheric, and ominous ground-breaking score for Scott's earlier 'Alien'). This opening sequence by itself may be worth the ticket price alone, but it also presents the first of many unanswered head-shakers in a movie that will no doubt have you glued to your seat, but also shaking your head in confusion most of the time.Flash forward thousands of years into the future to 2089 (77 years from now - I did the math!), where it introduces us to its principal players, archaeologists and lovers Drs. Elizabeth Shaw (Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, from the original Swedish-language 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). The two have discovered the latest in a set of ancient cave paintings that they believe confirms their competing theories on the extraterrestrial beginnings of all life on Earth. They also pose an interesting (if all too obvious) dichotomy that has hounded humans since the beginning of time: Shaw believes in God almost as much as she does science, while Holloway is a staunch supporter of Charles Darwin. Anyway, they manage to find themselves (with 15 others), four years later, on the scientific research vessel - overseen by chilly corporate head honcho Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) - the 'Prometheus' of the title, which is traveling to an unknown planet in an undisclosed region in the darkest reaches of outer space. Of course their natural scientific curiosity compels them to search the planet for any signs of life (which also harks back to the vaguely sexual, bio-mechanical architectural set-designs by 'Alien's' Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger), and eventually uncovering a horrifying secret that has the potential to wipe out all life on Earth as we know it.I'll say that as a fond admirer of 'Alien' (though I personally prefer James Cameron's superior 1986 sequel, 'Aliens'), 'Prometheus' is one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of the year for me. From the opening moments, I was hooked just to see where it would go. I knew from the previews that things were going to get gory and scary eventually, so I was not worried about a potentially disappointing third act here. I guess what ultimately did disappoint me were the unanswered questions that would presumably link this movie to 'Alien.'I presume a director's cut is on the way eventually (since Scott has a funny habit of re-cutting some of his most well-known works), but then I remember reading somewhere that this is unlikely, for whatever reasons Scott has in mind. I think that if a director's cut were to be released, it would answer some of the unanswered questions that will no doubt be confounding viewers for many more years to come, but it will also make the movie make more sense. I know a wealth of material ultimately did not make it into the final film, and I'm sure it'll make some things (like some of the character's questionable actions and motivations and the exact origins of the extraterrestrial threat) much clearer.There may be one or two breakout performances here (Noomi Rapace being the most likely), but the film's real stand-out proves to be the android servant David (Michael Fassbender), who studies to learn how to be human by mostly watching old movies. The predecessor to Ian Holm's traitorous android Ash in 'Alien' and Lance Henriksen's enigmatic Bishop in 'Aliens,' you're utterly convinced by Fassbender's subtly remarkable performance that will no doubt spark calls for an Oscar nomination. His acting also recalls 'Star Trek' (2009) and '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) in his robotic expressiveness that makes him appear more human and empathetic than some of the other characters that we KNOW are obviously human.'Prometheus' does boast one of the strongest visual senses of any big-budget Hollywood movie I've seen this year. I'm unsure if it's truly Ridley Scott's much-fabled return to the genre that made him such a prominent name in the film industry. His return to sci-fi is not a triumphant one, but a confounding one, as I'm sure anyone looking for a definitive connection to 'Alien' will most definitely have to wait for another sequel to the original prequel.8/10",8,2,6,30 November 2012
Halloween," The night HE came home!
","Co-writer/director John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece of horror and suspense remains to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The simple story of a masked maniac going on a senseless rampage on Halloween night in a small suburban community and the determined psychiatrist hot on his trail still rings true even to this day. For the longest time, I avoided this movie, I'm not sure why. I don't normally like 'slasher' movies, although I do consider 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984) to be the best of this particular genre. I would guess 'Halloween' follows at a close second. This is often cited as the one that started it all, even though earlier slasher flicks such as 'Black Christmas' (1974), 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974), and Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Psycho' (1960) could definitely be seen as influences on Carpenter's work here. Compared to the horror movies of today, what's most striking about 'Halloween' is that the violence and gore is actually very minimal. The surreal, minimalist violence and gore is far more frightening than anything produced in the sequels or any of its countless knock-offs. Carpenter instead relies on his direction, actors (especially Jamie Lee Curtis as would-be female victim Laurie Strode), camera-work, and overall atmosphere and suspense to get his chills here. Rob Zombie's 2007 remake couldn't even compare! Carpenter's moody score (most effective in the opening sequence) sets the tone for the rest of the film, a series of relentless shocks and ever-mounting tension; 'Halloween' is the sole reason why Carpenter is oft-cited as the master of suspense. What we have in 'Halloween' is one of the greatest and scariest horror movies of all time, a horror movie that influenced an entire generation of filmmakers. Trust me, Halloween was never the same after that night when HE came home!10/10",10,1,2,1 September 2008
Wonder Woman," A 'Wonderful' 'Wonder Woman'
","To say that 2017's 'Wonder Woman' is the best DC Comics film I've seen since probably 'The Dark Knight' in 2008 is indicative, I think, of how far DC Comics has lagged behind Marvel Comics in terms of bringing their superheroes to the big screen. But DC Comics did have one ace up its sleeve, in that Wonder Woman, the first widely recognizable super-heroine in the history of comic books, would ALSO have the potential to be the first super-heroine to launch her own truly successful movie franchise. (The first female superhero franchise would have been the 'Daredevil' spin-off 'Elektra' in 2005, but that film failed to launch such a movie franchise.)To that end, DC Comics has largely succeeded with 'Wonder Woman,' a film that breaks with past DC movie titles in the fact that it's headlined by a female lead and - most important for this viewer (and, borrowing the words of another commenter) - it has a finer balance of action and levity, and the latter seems to arise naturally from the material and doesn't feel forced. Marvel has succeeded in that regard to make their films more entertaining - even if every other line in one of their films now ends in a punchline.But, I digress.Wonder Woman, who was created by American psychologist William Moulton Marston (the man responsible for creating the polygraph machine) and inspired by his wife Elizabeth and their mutual live-in lover Olive Byrne - and who first appeared in 'All Star Comics #8' - is a character I have an unusual relationship with.I'm 31, going on 32. And I'm a guy. Growing up, I had always heard about Wonder Woman, but did not actually become a fan of the character until about five years ago, and that was by way of the Lynda Carter TV series 'Wonder Woman' from the 1970s. I still believe Carter to be the ultimate Wonder Woman - in spite of that show's inherent '70s cheesiness - but this big-screen 2017 film adaptation may prove that that version of the character has been formally relegated to the rapidly changed times. Wonder Woman was also not the first female superhero I encountered growing up - I believe it was Storm of the X-Men, from Marvel - but she was still the most widely recognized character that I was aware of growing up. Watching the Lynda Carter TV series, I thought it was amazing to see such a positive central portrayal of a female superhero that I hadn't seen yet in television or film.'Wonder Woman' is a film that I had high expectations for, and those expectations were largely met. 'Wonder Woman' isn't your typical origin story, either - being that this version of the character first appeared in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016) last year. The film also doesn't waste a lot of time obsessing over every little detail, and waste precious screen-time, of how young Diana (Lilly Aspell), an Amazonian princess, eventually grows up into the beautiful Diana Prince (Israeli model and actress Gal Gadot). She already is Wonder Woman; she just has to learn to be the person that she was destined to be and realize her purpose in this world as a super-heroine.When American U.S. Army intelligence operative Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands his World War I plane in the waters just off Diana's beautiful island of Themyscira, he enlists her to return to Man's World to help him deliver a stolen notebook containing valuable information on a new chemical super-weapon that the Germans are developing (mustard gas). Along with Diana, Steve recruits three friends - secret agent Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Scottish sharpshooter Charlie (Ewen Bremner, Spud from 'Trainspotting,' who also serves as this film's comic relief), and the Native-American expatriate The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) - to help them accomplish their mission and stop the war-mongering German commandant General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) from going forth with his plans to launch a mustard gas attack on nearby London.Directed by Patty Jenkins, 'Wonder Woman' has the distinction of being only the SECOND superhero film with a woman at the helm - after German director Lexi Alexander ('Punisher: War Zone' in 2008). It would seem appropriate, I suppose, that such a groundbreaking character could only be done proper cinematic justice by a female director, and Patty Jenkins is quite the competent one here. Gal Gadot, who like all able-bodied Israeli citizens, served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and I would hazard a guess that her military background certainly helped in getting her the part to play Wonder Woman. She's a tough and formidable presence on the screen and plays the character remarkably well (she definitely IS this version of Wonder Woman) - but again, I still favor Lynda Carter as the DEFINITIVE Wonder Woman.If 'Wonder Woman' suffers from any problems, it's in the action sequences. As someone else here pointed out, 'Wonder Woman' suffers from the same slow-motion, gravity-defying CGI effects first pioneered by 'The Matrix' (1999) and was way, WAY overdone in its two sequels. I honestly felt like I was watching 'The Matrix Reloaded' (2003) and 'The Matrix Revolutions' (2003) all over again, and I thought that Hollywood had grown out of its 'Matrix' obsession years ago - and yet it seems like it's coming back. You could find an excuse in the fact that it's a comic book superhero film - but still, it's very jarring and can tend to slow action scenes down. Yeah, it looks cool and all, but sometimes it can be overdone and hamper your overall enjoyment of the picture in these places.'Wonder Woman' was a solidly entertaining, if imperfect, big-screen debut solo outing for such a groundbreaking character and comic book property. Now, I honestly can't wait to see a sequel where Wonder Woman is saving the world in modern times.A 'Wonderful' 'Wonder Woman,' indeed.8/10",8,12,25,2 June 2017
Carrie," Where is Carrie White now?
","Carrie White (Oscar-nominated Sissy Spacek) is about the shiest, mousiest girl ever portrayed on film.I'm a guy, and never have I really felt such sympathies for a nerd-girl, especially one who seemed genuine. Hence, 'Carrie' looks and feels less a horror movie and more a teen-drama. Style filmmaker Brian De Palma directs 'Carrie,' an adaptation of the Stephen King novel (King's first work to be adapted into a movie), and thus one of the scariest movies of the genre.As Carrie White, Spacek seems a natural. Our feelings for her are genuine, especially since as the film opens, she has her first period while in the girl's locker room and panics at the sight of her own blood. Because her mother (Piper Laurie) has burdened her down with a whole bunch of religious nonsense, Carrie just has no idea about how to react to a natural bodily function.The incident also brings about something else in Carrie: she realizes that she has psychic powers, which she then uses against her tormentors, including her mother and classmates Chris (Nancy Allen) and Norma (P.J. Soles), and Chris's boyfriend Billy (John Travolta). It all boils down to a blood-drenched, special effects-laden climax at the school prom.There are others who care for Carrie: a fellow classmate named Sue (Amy Irving), her friend Tommy Ross (golden boy William Katt), and a sympathetic gym teacher (Betty Buckley). But the constant torment of her enemies leaves Carrie no choice but to do the unthinkable on a night where everybody is supposed to be happy.'Carrie' was made before the slasher madness of 'Halloween' (1978), its sequels, and the many knock-offs. So in this sense, 'Carrie' seems to be a stand-alone picture. As stated earlier, the bloodbath at the end is so unexpected in a movie that was building up into a touching teen story. Such effects-laden sequences come as a surprise and are indeed frightening to watch.Spacek is wonderful, generating the emotional depth required for her character. Since she just celebrated her 57th birthday yesterday, why not give 'Carrie' another chance in some other media format to mark its 30th anniversary? I've read that Stephen King doesn't particularly care for the movie adaptation of his first hit; I find it hard to believe he's truly upset with the finished product. But 'Carrie' is a true classic of the genre, one of the first of the best.10/10",10,4,7,26 December 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," The greatest thriller of all time? I think so.
","I don't think a movie has really been so effective in shocking the hell out of the audience. So let's be frank: movies like 'The Silence of the Lambs' don't usually win very big awards, let alone Oscars (in all five of the major categories, no less, making it only the third film in history to do so).With gruesome scenes of murder, autopsies and cannibalism, it's hard to imagine 'The Silence of the Lambs' winning Best Picture at the Oscars, not to mention heaps of praise and topping numerous 'best' lists since its release. 'The Silence of the Lambs' has also become a bona-fide cinematic and pop culture icon, introducing two of the most memorable characters in cinema history.The film, an adaptation of the novel by Thomas Harris, concerns the FBI's hunt for a particularly brutal serial killer, 'Buffalo Bill' (the creepy Ted Levine), who skins his victims, mostly plus-sized women, for reasons that are too gruesome to be repeated here. The FBI puts a young trainee on the case, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), and they have her, in turn, interview the deadly Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cunning psychopath who remains under tight lock and key at a hospital for the criminally insane. Lecter offers to help Clarice in developing a psychological profile in order to help capture 'Buffalo Bill,' in exchange for her confiding in him, some of her darkest and most troubling childhood memories.'The Silence of the Lambs' is not a film for the squeamish; I already mentioned why. But even for its scenes of grisly carnage, it's not a horror film, nor an exploitation picture that revels in scenes of outlandish gore. Instead, the real terror is more psychological: we rely on the reactions of the characters for the effect. It's a technique that director Jonathan Demme found to be quite satisfactory (it was also put to effective use in the equally disturbing, and commanding serial killer thriller, 'Seven,' four years later in 1995). Another technique that Demme put to great work here was having his actors stare directly into the camera, allowing us to become uncomfortably intimate with the on-screen action.I'm not really a fan of Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins, really, but their work here is nothing short of legendary. Foster is stunning as the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, an attractive but commanding young woman who, it seems, is an adult child still reeling it in from some deeply-seeded childhood traumas, and it is through her work on the 'Buffalo Bill' case and her meetings with Hannibal Lecter that she seems to be able to get a chance to deal with her troubled past and get some closure. Hopkins is equally commanding as the manipulative 'Hannibal the Cannibal,' who is able to probe the mind of his young interviewee with disturbing efficiency and ease, to satisfy his own twisted curiosities that I don't think are ever really explained (that's a good thing - it makes him even scarier). These truly are, two of the most phenomenal performances in a movie that is a phenomenon upon itself.'The Silence of the Lambs' is purely the greatest and most terrifying thriller I've seen. However, my personal favorite thriller of all time remains 'Seven.' But the contributions that 'The Silence of the Lambs' made to the thriller genre, and motion picture history, are not to be overlooked. If it weren't for this film, I don't think I would've gotten 'Seven' all those years ago.'The Silence of the Lambs' was recently named the greatest thriller of all time in Britain.I'll be hard-pressed to find a reason to disagree with that assertion.10/10",10,1,2,7 June 2009
Vanilla Sky," Understand a few things ***SPOILERS HERE IN***
","Cameron Crowe's 'Vanilla Sky' may not be the total mind bending 'alternative piece of film' that we may have wanted it to be, but it sure is something to behold. I understand that this film has received quite a number of bashings (not like 'Pearl Harbor', but even those criticisms weren't that necessary) and an equal amount of praise as well. This is definitely a thinking persons kind of film, though not on the level of something say 'The Usual Suspects' but is close to being there with an ending where all the missing pieces fall right in. I've never seen the original Spanish film that 'Vanilla Sky' was based on, so I'm not even going to waste my time making comparisons. I will say that judging from the reviews and the films story, that Cameron Crowe was not trying to outdo that film, but was trying make something close to it that all audiences, not just American could understand. Secondly, there is nothing wrong with the characters in the story. David Aames (Tom Cruise) is not a yuppie jerk, Sophia (Penelope Cruz) is acting no matter what people say, and Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is not a total nut job because it takes a lot to tell someone that you love them THAT much. For me, the characters make 'Vanilla Sky' what it is, which is an 'alternative piece of film', which is what I wanted it to be. The two main female characters in this film, to me, are both direct opposites of each other. They both love David Aames, but in different ways. Sophia loves David only after he has the reconstructive surgery that restores his former beauty. Julie loves him because of who he is on the inside, not because of what his face looks like although ironically she made him like that. There is nothing wrong with the story either. If there are any faults in the story, it's that the science fiction elements in the story aren't that well thought out and that's it. Also, many people are overlooking the fact that as one previous viewer already mentioned, the story is just a series of nightmares and the ending proves this: David was just dreaming. So before you go making snap judgments, sit down and actually watch this movie. Who knows, you may just understand it. I know I do.",10,0,1,24 June 2002
Black Panther," 'Black Panther' - A film fit for a king
","I believe that I was 20 and in college when I first came across the Black Panther, the first black superhero of any historical significance and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in 1966 (and whose creation pre-dates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party), and in the adventure I read about he was searching the world for his future bride - and eventually found her in the Kenyan Ororo Munroe/Storm (of the X-Men). In his travels, he also came across other noteworthy black superheroes including Brother Voodoo, Luke Cage/Power Man, The Falcon, Monica Rambeau/Pulsar and my personal favorite superhero of color, the vampire hunter Blade.(As most readers of my reviews know, Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero.)This was 12 years ago, I would say, and the Black Panther has come a long way since then.Ryan Coogler's ('Fruitvale Station,' 'Creed') 'Black Panther' arrives in a 2018 dominated by racial and social debate (and controversy) - not unlike the time that the Black Panther character first debuted at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1960s. The Black Panther first appeared in a two-part origin story - 'Fantastic Four #52' and 'Fantastic Four #53' (July 1966-August 1966) - and there he single-handedly defeated the Fantastic Four in order to test his skills in preparation for his battle with his arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaw. Black Panther later became one of the Fantastic Four's closest allies, as well as a member of the Avengers.'Black Panther,' the film, has many firsts going for it. It would be the first superhero film with a black director (Coogler), the first superhero film with a largely black cast including strong portrayals of black femininity (and featuring white actors in roles usually reserved for minorities), the first superhero film to display an entirely fictional African culture and civilization in a positive non-stereotypical light, and of course it's a superhero film about the first black superhero ever created (and the first black comic book character that was ALSO not a racist stereotype). It achieves many of its objectives, even if every now and then it slips into some of the corniness and silly comedy that I believe has come to define many modern superhero movies since Disney acquired Marvel nearly a decade ago.'Black Panther' is in some respects quite different from most big-budgeted superhero epics of late. The film has a decidedly political slant to it, which I see that some viewers have already commented negatively about. This doesn't give me some of the pause that it should have, and, after viewing the film for myself, I saw that these politics aim to address a key issue that I've often wondered myself about the Black Panther, and his home country - the fictional African nation of Wakanda, which is the most technologically advanced civilization on Earth.The Black Panther is, of course, the King of Wakanda, and his real name is T'Challa (played here by the mesmerizing Chadwick Boseman). In 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016), that was where the Black Panther was first introduced into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and in his first outing his father, the previous Black Panther and king of Wakanda, was killed in a terrorist bombing. Now as the new king of Wakanda, T'Challa finds himself tasked with the enormous burden of being leader to his country and his people, who have remained socially isolated from the rest of the world and become the most technologically advanced country not just on the African continent, but possibly the whole world.Wakanda has managed to thrive, and survive, hundreds of years without having to face the horrors of colonization and exploitation by outside forces, by those who want what has led to Wakanda's vast wealth and technological prowess - the alien metal vibranium. But all this is about to change with the arrival of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). But Klaue is merely a puppet in the scheme of Erik Stevens (Coogler regular Michael B. Jordan), a former U.S. military black ops mercenary and hired assassin who now goes by the name 'Killmonger,' to lay claim to the Wakandan throne. It turns out that Killmonger also has a tragic connection to the Black Panther's past.I have to say that I was quite well impressed by 'Black Panther.' Some of the early comments I had heard about the film were proven true. The one that stuck out to me the most was the villain Killmonger. Going back to what I said earlier about this film's politics, the character of Killmonger presents an argument about his motivations for villainy that are hard to counter: he forces Wakanda to face up to its greatest moral contradiction, which is its isolationism. His goals are just as much personal as they are political, and this gives him some much-needed dramatic and emotional dimensions to not make him seem like so many bland and poorly defined super-villains of recent memory. That is what I appreciated most in Michael B. Jordan's ruthless, yet ultimately sympathetic, portrayal of such a dangerous and fascinating character.The film has the usual sensational special effects-driven action scenes that are cool-looking but tend to distract from a film outing that had a lot of firsts going for it, and could have been very different from most other superhero films of the last decade. (Coogler, as the film's co-screenwriter, was at least wise enough to not serve up every other piece of dialogue as a punchline.) The Black Panther, to me, would have worked a lot better if it was a stand-alone picture and not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what can I do?Ultimately, 'Black Panther' did not disappoint. Ryan Coogler had a huge task ahead of him when he made this film and despite a few faults, he delivered. 'Black Panther' will undoubtedly win the weekend, if not an entirely new generation of young Marvel Comics readers.9/10",9,9,56,16 February 2018
Iron Man," 'Iron Man' - Marvel Comics' man of steel... um, iron
","'Iron Man,' a cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics icon created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Don Heck and Larry Lieber in the early 1960s, is in many ways one of the best comic-to-film adaptations out there (perhaps because Marvel chose to fund this one themselves - the first move of its kind for this sort of movie). Despite having the usual trappings of the usual origin story, 'Iron Man' is pure fun. What makes this story stand out are two key factors: the smart-a**ed performance of a newly-reformed Robert Downey, Jr., and a smart-a**ed screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway.Working behind the camera (and sharing an on screen cameo) is director Jon Favreau of 'Swingers' fame. An admitted Marvel Comics aficionado, Favreau seemed to be the perfect guy to direct an adaptation of Marvel's Man of Steel. Of course, I've never been able to land a copy of an Iron Man comic myself, but I've always admired the character (those who have read my reviews know that Spider-Man is my greatest comic book superhero). As an aside, fans will also realize that Iron Man served as a partial inspiration for the landmark sci-fi picture 'RoboCop' (1987), and the character is one of the many aliases of Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah, and his 1996 debut solo record was appropriately named 'Ironman.'As billionaire industrialist Tony Stark - who is in some ways analogous to DC Comics' Bruce Wayne/Batman - Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the smartest (and unlikeliest) casting choices for any superhero character thus far. He's got the smart-a** attitude, the irresponsible playboy demeanor, dry humor, vibrant sexuality, and the cool slyness of any man at ease with his wealth. While the comics had a Tony Stark who journeyed to Cold War-era Vietnam, Our Hero is now seen demonstrating his company's weapons technology in war-torn Bush Regime-era Afghanistan.After his U.S. Army convoy is attacked, we next see Stark being held captive by Islamic militants who want him to help build them one of his most lethal and effective 'toys' from scratch. Stark, who now wears a device that helps keep shrapnel out of his heart (compliments of a fellow benevolent prisoner), thinks otherwise. Using the raw materials at his disposal, he plans to engineer a daring escape plan by constructing a powered suit of armor.After this huge action sequence, Stark returns to California's Stark Industries a changed man. No longer the arrogant rich-boy he was before, he has seen the light; undergoing a sort of philosophical awakening in Afghanistan after seeing the militants use his own weapons against U.S. forces there, he ceases weapons production at Stark Industries, much to the mortification of his business partner and surrogate father figure Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who eventually uses Stark's own technology against him to become the armored super-villain Iron Monger. Along for the ride, of course, is Stark's pretty assistant Pepper Potts (an amazingly well-cast Gwyneth Paltrow), who he starts putting the moves on and she seems to return the affection; there is also loyal best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who in the comics, of course, eventually becomes War Machine.Yes. 'Iron Man' is one heck of a fun ride. Yes. It is incredibly well-acted and directed. Robert Downey, Jr., an alcoholic himself and whose drug problems are well-documented in the annals of Hollywood celebrity hell, is perfectly cast as the rich playboy-turned-superhero Tony Stark/Iron Man. Stark's change-of-heart business philosophy and alcoholism battles and many personal demons were well-documented in the comics as well, thus furthering the true-to-life superhero portrayals defined by Marvel back in the '60s when the character first saw print. This is all something that Downey, Jr. plays incredibly well in the film, and it seems he not only looks like Stark, he IS Tony Stark. Also, most superhero movies make the mistake of having the protagonist just jumping into fray; not so with 'Iron Man.' Here, Stark's becoming the iron-clad superhero is a process, with a number of technical glitches that provide plenty of humorous bumps along the way to keep it from ever getting boring.Since the movie is typical superhero origin story stuff, it falls victim to it as well. The film of course ends in a fantastic super-powered showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger that kind of wore itself out after a few minutes in. We've seen so many of this stuff in the origin stories before, so let's just hope that like 'Spider-Man 2' (2004) - the greatest superhero movie ever - 'Iron Man 2/Iron Man Returns' takes the time to really explore the depth of the character and make good with his many personal flaws.9/10",9,2,5,2 May 2008
Blade Runner," See 'Blade Runner' run
","Director Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' was one of the very first and best director's cuts to come out on the home video market. Scott re-cut, reedited, and otherwise restored the film to his original vision, which was compromised by excessive studio interference 10 years before.Scott did away with star Harrison Ford's horrendous voice-over narration, replaced a number of shots to make up for the gaps that were the result of the narration's removal, and deletes the so-called 'happy' ending. In doing so, Scott restored his original vision and the film was released in 1992, 10 years after a disastrous reception from audiences and critics.In 1982, 'Blade Runner' was released between 'Alien' in 1979 and 'Legend' in 1985, and Scott was on a wild streak and it seemed that only he could stop himself, since he was bringing the audience one visually dazzling and intricate masterpiece after the other.As a matter of fact, 'Blade Runner' is still one of the only sci-fi films released in the last 25 years to really have a serious impact on audiences; Steven Spielberg's 'Minority Report,' which is ironically another acclaimed adaptation of a work by Philip K. Dick, was another example.'Blade Runner,' adapted from Dick's acclaimed novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' is set in the 21st century, and Rick Deckard (Ford), is a 'blade runner,' special police detectives who have the authority to kill 'replicants' (human-like androids) on the spot. Replicants have been outlawed on Earth, so they're confined to a space colony on a nearby planet, where they are forced into slave labor, and they only have four-year lifespans - so they value life more dearly than any human ever could.A group of renegade replicants (Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Brion James) hijack a space vessel and come to Earth to search for their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). And so Deckard is forced to lead a private investigation to track down and eliminate the four androids before anyone figures out they're on Earth.This is Ridley Scott's most beautiful and philosophical film to date. He really taps into the emotions of the viewer by evoking such feelings using philosophical imagery and dialogue; there isn't a single wasted frame at all in this film.And he also uses violence to great effect in 'Blade Runner.' Even though none of the violence is hardly of the super-graphic type, it is nonetheless effective, especially during one particularly wrenching sequence where Deckard kills one replicant as it runs away for its dear life (you'll know the scene when it happens).'Blade Runner' - 10/10",10,0,1,2 December 2004
Bruce Almighty," Great movie. Jim Carrey is good as always. But too many people seemed to have missed the message.
","OK, it's clear that 'Bruce Almighty' has stirred up quite a storm of controversy apparently on all fronts for its views of religion (I've read it's been banned in several countries) and the fact that the powers of God can be trusted upon an average joe, who is in this case, Bruce Nolan (played by Jim Carrey).  I have no beef against 'Bruce Almighty' because I feel that anyone can relate to Bruce's situation, and I think that is what a lot of this movie's attackers have missed.  Yes this is a comedy, but it has a heart and it's in the right place.  As for the storm, however, the question of whether or not this movie is truly blasphemous in any kind of way, I'll leave to the scholars but don't look past the message that this movie is trying to convey to the audience. It simply tells a story that you should love yourself for who you are and that God (or some force higher than Man) has a plan for you and don't think that you are insignificant.  God (or a higher force) always answers, but the answer you receive may not always be the one that you desire. 
I could go on and on about this but I don't want to be attacked by people from each and every direction.",10,0,2,6 December 2003
Toy Story 3," An amazing third 'Story'
","Lee Unkrinch directed 'Toy Story 3,' the third and presumably final installment in the 'Toy Story' movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's 'Toy Story 2' remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto 'Toy Story 2' for deep personal reasons, but 'Toy Story 3' does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.As foreshadowed in 'Toy Story 2,' Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; he's 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gone-but-not-forgotten-and-within-reach-type of deal).Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andy's favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metro-sexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic back-story that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in 'Toy Story 2.' So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.'Toy Story 3' is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first 'Toy Story,' which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disney-owned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most life-like and real and it's damn-near flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with 'Toy Story.' And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.While 'Toy Story 2' had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, 'Toy Story 3' is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, 'Toy Story 3' can also be an incredibly dark film at times - a bold move considering that this is a family film - but there's no need to worry because the fact is that it's all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light-hearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.'Toy Story 3' is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a die-hard 'Toy Story 2' fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. It's just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone bye-bye.10/10",10,44,46,4 November 2010
Trainspotting," Choose life or choose heroin?
","1996's 'Trainspotting,' an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's cult novel about heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a deliriously funny and imaginative ride through the pitfalls of addiction. However, the movie never glorifies addiction; if it did, we wouldn't see the grim aftermath of so many instances that are otherwise avoidable if its characters chose to remain sober.The film wastes no time in establishing that the main characters are addicts, each of them shooting up in a rundown apartment. They are a loose group of fellows, with Renton (Ewan McGregor), violent drunk Begbie (Robert Carlyle), Sean Connery-enthusiast Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), the nerd-like Spud (Ewen Bremner), and life-chooser Tommy (Kevin McKidd).What we get for 90 minutes is unrepentant drug use from the leads and the resulting depravity. We watch the funny/grim aftermath of wild sex romps for each of the main characters while some time down the road, we're treated to visions of dead babies and the inevitable overdose or death.But despite all these grim underpinnings, there is a faint glimmer of hope, and that hope rests within our emotional connection to Renton, who knows he has a problem and tries to correct it, despite the influence of his friends.We watch as Renton painfully goes through withdrawal, the horror that he witnesses, and the aforementioned dead baby crawling on the ceiling.'Trainspotting' is an intricate and funny masterpiece of what it's like to be an addict and on the loose. It's no wonder this movie was such a hit here in the United States.10/10",10,1,2,20 October 2004
Beowulf," 'Beowulf' - Zemeckis-style...
","Admittedly, 2007's 'Beowulf,' the latest adaptation of the classic Old English epic poem with no known author (and is very often required reading in high school), is not a film I paid very much attention to when it was first released two years ago. Home video has been very kind to this picture, however, since it received mixed reviews but was a huge box office success (it earned well over $150 million during its theatrical run) when it was released, due in no small part to its groundbreaking performance-capture CGI technology - improved significantly from director Robert Zemeckis's earlier 'The Polar Express' (2004).But let's be honest with ourselves: this is not your father's 'Beowulf.' I don't remember the exact details of the epic poem from English 12 my senior year in high school five years ago, but I do not recall that it was a dark, uber-sexy, ultra-bloody affair and treatise on the dangers of pride (this review is based on the unrated director's cut of the film, not the 'PG-13' theatrical version). Differences aside - major and minor - Zemeckis's 'Beowulf' is not a bad film, but a different one from what most of us are probably used to reading about, whether in school or for pleasure. In fact, 'Beowulf' is a ridiculously entertaining film, even if it is prone to slowing down during its quieter moments, and the performance-captured animation is nothing short of beautiful and breathtaking.In 6th-century Denmark, King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) kingdom of Heorot is being terrorized on a nightly basis by the hideous demon Grendel (a frighteningly effective Crispin Glover). To the rescue is the fearless Geat hero Beowulf (Ray Winstone) to battle Grendel and restore peace & tranquility to Hrothgar's kingdom. (Winstone's Beowulf is significantly different from the one in the poem; he's no longer the perfect 'hero,' but is instead flawed and is much more believably human. He's also prone to strong lapses in judgment when he lets his pride get the better of him.) Those who know the story know the rest of the film's events - Beowulf eventually slays Grendel, and does battle with his mother (Angelina Jolie) and becomes king of Heorot himself, now married to Queen Wealtheow (Robin Wright Penn). And lastly, there is the costly battle with the dragon that comes to terrorize his kingdom a few years later down the road.'Beowulf' is a breathtaking action-adventure fantasy epic. It looks fabulous, and is appropriately dark, violent and sexy, everything a revved-up Hollywood adaptation of an ancient work of classical literature should be. The animation is advanced enough that it does allow for the characters to express believable amounts of emotion and even display facial expressions. And it's easy to tell who's playing who, since the characters do somewhat resemble the actors playing them, except of course the frightening, hideous monster that is Grendel. That was a brave performance by Crispin Glover, I'll tell you, who manages to make such a ravenous creature sympathetic by making him appear as a misunderstood outsider who is disturbed by the noises coming from King Hrothgar's mead hall and only goes there in an attempt at trying to get some peace & quiet. He's no longer the soulless, evil monster that we might remember from the epic poem, but simply a misunderstood monster-child who's trying to get some sleep, but the greedy, noisy humans who live nearby won't let him. I'm quite surprised that Crispin Glover hasn't gotten better work over the years.And there is also a healthy dose of sex appeal to be enjoyed by members of both sexes. Considering that Ray Winstone looks nothing like his animated on-screen counterpart, the film's animators can be forgiven with taking some creative liberties with the actors. (And Angelina Jolie, presumably the sexiest woman in Hollywood, is certainly enjoying the you-know-what out of her 10-minute cameo here as the seductive, ultra-sexy Mother of Grendel, who eventually manages to seduce Our Hero Beowulf. The movie is certainly worth the ticket price alone just to see her in the nude, with gold body paint covering up her most private of parts, about an hour into the picture. Does anybody know for sure if she was really naked in this movie?)Considering the movie was co-written by comic book artist Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, I expected the script to be a little bit better. And what I mean is the tendency of the film to slow down toward the middle. Some of the changes that they made to the story can also be forgiven, but it also gives the viewer the impression of how much they were trying inject modern-day religious (read: Christian) themes into the story, which I can't even remember being hinted at in the original epic poem (but then again it's been a while since high school). The character Unferth (John Malkovich) becomes a vocal proponent of the then-new Christian faith and his suggestion early in the picture that King Hrothgar and others pray to the new Roman god is just one prime example of this. It goes to show the viewer the type of modern-day slant the filmmakers were trying to put on the picture.Robert Zemeckis is still one of Hollywood's most valued dealers in groundbreaking special effects-laden spectacles. Even if his 'Beowulf' is a mixed bag - but a significant upgrade from 'The Polar Express' five years ago - it is an entertaining film, a ridiculously entertaining and ultra-sexy/ultra-bloody film. If you can, I'd highly recommend watching Zemeckis's director's cut. With this version of the film at least, even though it's got more bloody violence and greater sex appeal, you get the feeling that this is the complete film, and the real story that Zemeckis was really trying to tell, short of the ratings restrictions on the picture.You'll either really love it or really hate it; I think I'm somewhere in the middle.7/10",7,0,0,26 December 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard 4.0 - Cyber-terrorism
","The 'Die Hard' movies, which have starred Bruce Willis spanning through an illustrious 19-year career, have always been about action and excitement, much like any action movie. However, unlike most action movies, the hero in each, Detective John McClane, was an Everyman. This allowed Average Joes to connect with a genuine human being who got hurt and was often caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. McClane was sort of like an urban Indiana Jones and likewise, this is what allowed us to forge real connections with him, much rather than your typical Chuck Norris's, Sylvester Stallone's, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's.2007's 'Live Free or Die Hard' (or 'Die Hard 4.0'), is the first 'Die Hard' film Willis has appeared in since 1995's 'Die Hard With a Vengeance.' Just to get pretenses out of the way: 'Live Free or Die Hard' is the best film since the original. While being more technically brilliant and showing off a kind of chic flashiness all too apparent in today's action films, it doesn't mean that 'Live Free or Die Hard' is even remotely a bad film, it's just more technically sophisticated than its predecessors. But that's very good; it just shows that all concerned here are getting with the times, while not sacrificing a potent action movie legacy that's been built on believable characters and suspense. More to the point, 'Live Free or Die Hard' proves that even dinosaurs like the 52-year-old Bruce Willis, still have a punch or two left in them.The film is a technical marvel, to say the least. It has a number of breathtaking action scenes, thus making 'Live Free or Die Hard' the most action-packed and exciting entry in the series since 'Die Hard' back in 1988. Watching these action scenes, I got the feeling of expert craftsmanship, almost a nostalgic feeling for the action blockbusters of yesteryear. There are action scenes and then there are action scenes, which are not overblown by today's standards. I got the feeling of watching real human beings doing real human stunt-work, including watching Willis handle himself capably even while chaos is erupting around him.The series has been handled by two skilled and capable directors so far - John McTiernan and Renny Harlin. In the director's seat this time is Len Wiseman, who is obviously hoping this big jump into the Hollywood limelight is his ticket out of cult 'B'-movie fanfare like the 'Underworld' films. To this critic's surprise, he, like the aged Willis, is able to handle himself capably and admirably. He's earned his spot in the 'Die Hard' legacy.This time around, McClane's task seems simple: escort a lowly computer hacker, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), from New York City to Washington, D.C., for questioning by the F.B.I. after several of his hacker pals have bitten the dust. But because it seems that Farrell has been involved in some shady Internet dealings with a particularly cold-blooded Web-based terrorist named Thomas Gabriel (the effective Timothy Olyphant), things are going to get hectic real fast.It isn't long before assassins come after McClane and Farrell and they stumble onto Gabriel's plot: he's going to use his legion of hackers and infinite computer resources to systematically shut down the entire United States (Farrell explains this three-step process as a 'Fire Sale'). So it's up to McClane and the computer-savvy Farrell to use what technological resources they have left to foil Gabriel's plans before he puts us back into the Stone Age (oh, my, a world without computers and the Internet). However, when Gabriel is pushed into a corner, he's forced to take drastic measures and take McClane's feisty daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hostage.'Live Free or Die Hard' is really the first 'Die Hard' film to take a slice of modern-day paranoia - cyber-terrorism - and work it into a feasible action film that at times is a little scary. We've come to be so reliant on technology that it's only a matter of time before a computer-savvy psycho like Thomas Gabriel comes along and exploits that fact. So, the smart-alecky script by Mark Bomback, taking inspiration from a news article titled 'A Farewell to Arms' by John Carlin, really doesn't seem all that far-fetched when you think about it.At center stage, of course, is Bruce Willis, sharing screen time with the youngster Justin Long. Bomback's screenplay, under Wiseman's skilled direction, provides the two with a believable amount of running dialogue, rapport and teamwork, giving them time to develop, and exchange humorous and wily insults back and forth to one another while running for their lives. (It's a generational buddy-trip that works.) Their first meeting, in Farrell's apartment, followed by a shootout, really sets the pace for the rest of the film, and guarantees that no one will be snoozing during this hardcore action-fest. Surely one of the best of these sequences has to be McClane's showdown with a Harrier Jet on a collapsing freeway. And then there are also McClane's potentially lethal encounters with Gabriel's chief baddies Mai (Maggie Q) and Rand (rising French action star Cyril Raffaelli). In a not-so-surprising cameo, filmmaker Kevin Smith also appears as an Armageddon-prepared hacker named 'Warlock.''Live Free or Die Hard' is the best film the series has to offer since the original 1988 'Die Hard.' It proves to us that the days of real action movie heroism are not yet gone, and that action-hero dinosaurs like Bruce Willis can still roll with the new.9/10",9,15,28,20 November 2007
X2: X-Men United," 'X2: X-Men United'
","'X2: X-Men United' is the long-awaited sequel to 2000's 'X-Men' and is one important piece of film. The new film, directed again by Bryan Singer, is far superior to its predecessor. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still engaged in his search into his mysterious past. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is continuing his fight to get mutants equally accepted into a society that fears them. Magneto (Ian McKellan) is still locked up in his plastic prison. Surprisingly, Magneto is not the primary villain this time, now it's William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military scientist who seeks to eradicate mutants once and for all, with the help of Yuriko Oyama a.k.a. Lady Deathstryke (Kelly Hu). The other mutants are here too, including Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Rogue (Anna Paquin) who is in a relationship with Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and Storm (Halle Berry). The newest edition to the 'X-Men' is one of my personal favorites, Nightcrawler (played by Alan Cumming underneath some pretty neat-looking makeup).'X2: X-Men United' - a 10/10.",10,0,0,24 May 2003
Thor: The Dark World," The little girl who loved Thor in 'Adventures in Babysitting' (1987)...
","My biggest complaint with that great British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh's take on 'Thor' (2011) was that its titular character, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder in Norse mythology reinterpreted as a Marvel Comics superhero, seemed to adjust to life on Earth fairly quickly after being exiled here by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as a lesson in humility.That problem can be forgiven here (since in the grander scheme of things, my overall opinion is hardly consequential to anything), since two years have passed and Thor has spent that time on his home-world of Asgard, rather than on Earth, even though he still longs for his mortal would-be girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and she for him.And that's one of the things to take away from 'Thor: The Dark World' - the resolutions of various relationships - with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh (who brought some Shakespearean-styled drama to a superhero movie with the first 'Thor') and he takes the series into much darker territory, even though there's still a variety of well-placed humor here to liven things up a little bit; imagine even a smidgen of humor in Christopher Nolan's ultra-serious 'Dark Knight' movies - oh, the horror!To be fair, I enjoyed this picture more than I did the first one, if because the changes in the director's chair also resulted in a change of direction into a darker one. So again, Earth is in danger from an other-worldly threat that is beyond human comprehension. The Mighty Thor is forced to not only save our planet, but his own as well, from the genocidal warlord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a Dark Elf who sacrificed his entire army to try to defeat Asgard in a thrilling a prologue, only to go into hibernation for 5,000 years so that he could once again try to wipe out Asgard, something that requires the life of the human Jane Foster for him to do.So Thor is forced to do the unthinkable: he must team up with his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, a 'Thor' film's best performer, once again), who is now currently imprisoned for his crimes against humanity in 'Thor' and 'The Avengers' (2012), if they are to save both Earth and Asgard.The focus in 'Thor: The Dark World,' aside from the various superhero battles, are the relationships - chiefly Thor's romance with the human Jane Foster, and his complicated familial relationships with his parents and of course, Loki, who still vies for the throne of Asgard. And it's also about how Thor must juggle all these if he is to save two worlds from a threat that not even he can defeat all on his own (hence the teaming up with Loki).I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did 'Thor.' Here is one of those rare sequels that performed better than its predecessor.9/10",9,3,8,12 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Impressions from 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015)
","I guess like every fan of the 'Star Wars' saga, I eagerly awaited this new movie, and was not disappointed (much). I waited long enough until the massive crowds died down enough that I could finally see the picture and not have to worry about sitting in a heavily crowded theater and being constantly distracted by everything that comes along with a large crowd.Alas, I was but one of five people at a 1:15 P.M. showing at my local theater.With the eagerly awaited 2015 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens,' I can say that 'Alias' J.J. Abrams has fashioned a reasonable sequel to the original 'Star Wars' trilogy that began in 1977 and ended in 1983, as well as the much-beleaguered prequel trilogy that began in 1999 and ended in 2005.The film is not the prequel trilogy and doesn't contain any of its silliness, but it falls short of the epic grandeur of the original trilogy. It's really somewhere in the middle, if you really want to think about it. But I guess, if we were to have a continuation of 'Star Wars' following the conclusion of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983), then this was it.This new film is very much a return to the tone and style of the original trilogy, and features a great many nods to those films, while still in other ways continuing the story.People, and George Lucas (creator of the 'Star Wars' saga), have speculated for years that a follow-up to the original trilogy would be something like 'The Force Awakens,' where a time after the conclusion of 'Return of the Jedi,' we would return to many of the principal cast members and some new, fresh faces to the saga, as well.I wasn't disappointed, but aside from a few minor quibbles, this was a worthy entry into the 'Star Wars' cinematic saga. I look forward to 'Episode VIII' in a few years.10/10",10,7,43,4 January 2016
Final Destination," Scared Me Good
","I have to admit that when I first saw the previews for Final Destination, I didn't think much.  But after reading several reviews that said how good it was, I thought about seeing it, but couldn't because of a busy year. 
The story is about a kid named Alex(Devon Sawa) who just so happens to have a fear of flying.  With a class of 49 students, they are going to France on a field trip.  When Alex has a horrific premonition about dying in plane crash, he freaks out and is kicked off the plane with five other students and teacher.  Minutes after getting kicked off, and Alex is calm, the unexpected happens, the plane actually does explode.  Over the next few weeks, however, teachers, the survivors, as well as the police become increasingly suspicious of Alex.  Some of his friends even think of him as a god.  Anyway, the survivors of the plane crash soon begin dying in gruesome and sometimes horrific fashions.  Alex soon discovers that by getting off the ill-fated flight, that he had intervened with Death's predetermined pattern.  Death, however, has made a new pattern and Alex must find out what it is to save his friends as well as himself. 
I have to say that this movie scared me and my parents good.  I also must say that this film deserves a lot praise.  Although the plot is not original, however the antagonist is, Death itself.  What I really liked about it was that Death never showed itself and that it turned simple everyday items into murder weapons.Of course no horror movie is perfect.  There is one beef I do have with Final Destination.  Some of the death scenes are pretty creative and terrifying, but some of them seemed to have been forced.  I mean who is going to place a beverage on top of a computer monitor?Other than this one minor flaw, Final Destination is still a great and scary horror film.8/10",10,37,52,19 December 2000
Kagemusha," 'Kagemusha' (1980)
","Akira Kurosawa's 180-minute, 1980 'comeback' film 'Kagemusha' is one of the director's most ambitious films. Like I already stated, it clocks in at 180 minutes, but the film is never once boring. Having watched his later 'Ran' (1985) yesterday and then having watched this movie today, 'Kagemusha' is very much a 'dress rehearsal' for 'Ran' since it can be seen that many ideas/themes from this film were later used on 'Ran.' (Having watched both movies, however, I can conclude that 'Ran' is the better movie.) 'Kagemusha' (which means 'shadow warrior') and is set over the course of a two-year period between 1573 and 1575 in Japan, concerns a petty, unkempt thief (Tatsuya Nakadai) who is plucked from imminent execution to be the double for the 16th-century warlord Shingen Takeda (also played by Nakadai), due to his striking resemblance to him. When Shingen unexpectedly expires, the thief is forced to take his position as leader of the Takeda Clan. This could have been an amusing comedy, but Kurosawa was too smart for that, and his scope of the material went way beyond what would typically be silly Hollywood comedic theatrics, like a comedy about role-/body-swapping (even though Kurosawa sought financial backing from American filmmakers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola - two well-known admirers of his from the United States who are also well-known admirers of his impressive body of work over the decades). The main theme of 'Kagemusha' is the battle between illusion and reality: The Double effectively deceives a great many people with the illusion that he is the real Shingen (including his grandson, mistresses, and sworn arch-rivals), and the real Shingen's generals (including his brother Nobukado - played by Tsutomu Yamazaki - who also bears an uncanny resemblance to his late brother) must keep up the elaborate charade - while also somehow managing to keep The Double out of trouble and keep away anyone from discovering their ruse. The film ends with an epic, large-scale massacre marking the downfall of the Takeda Clan, but the magic there is that we never actually see any real combat. Instead, we rely on the horrified reactions of the characters as they witness the unrelenting bloodshed of battle. It's a truly powerful moment in a film that never ceases to cause wonder and stir up strong emotions about the enormous 'responsibilities' that come with such elaborate deception and the swift fall from power.10/10",10,1,1,10 July 2012
Rear Window," Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic masterpiece
","Alfred Hitchcock; what hasn't been said about this great man? I'm no Hitchcock fanatic, but I can comment on his significance as a great filmmaker. The man knew his way around the camera in ways that are highly instructive in how today's filmmakers should learn to make movies. One thing I have noticed about the few Hitchcock movies I've seen is that the man has an eye for simplicity - that is simply telling stories that by themselves seem insignificant, but something, I'm not sure what exactly, I guess just the way he tells his stories, composes his scenes, and directs his actors are nothing short of brilliant and instructive.One of his more acclaimed and masterful films is 1954's 'Rear Window,' an adaptation of the short story 'It Had to Be Murder' by Cornell Woolrich. 'Rear Window' concerns wheelchair-bound photographer L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries's (James Stewart) routine observations of his neighbors from his apartment perch overlooking a Greenwich Village courtyard, a 'hobby' he takes to in order to ease the pains of boredom. At home recovering from an on-the-job injury, he keeps tabs on his neighbors, but as they say that curiosity killed the cat, Jeff thinks he gets wind of his neighbor Lars Thorward (Raymond Burr) murdering his nagging, invalid wife. Pretty soon Jeff's attempts to prove murder become an obsession, an obsession in which he also draws his socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) into as well.We really get to know the characters in 'Rear Window,' the other apartment tenants, I mean. Incredibly enough, we actually know very little of the main characters played by James Stewart and Grace Kelly. Both Stewart and Kelly are good in excellent, well-known performances. They are interesting characters by themselves and we get to know their problematic romantic entanglement... um, relationship, but Jeff's observations of his neighbors occasionally make them far more interesting characters. Through Jeff's observations and musings, we come to learn a lot about his neighbors, even though they themselves have little dialogue or screen time.The film's message couldn't really be any more clear, and that's the moral and ethical questions of watching people when they think no one's looking, and the desire people have for privacy in their own homes away from stranger's eyes. I also think it goes a little bit deeper: people are strange, and they're even stranger behind close doors when they think no one's watching. But it's within those people's rights to be strange in their own homes, behind close doors. Sometimes, however, those strange activities can hide dangerous behaviors that can have great implications for those around them, as Jeff, Lisa, and others soon find out in 'Rear Window's' inescapable, all-too suspenseful climax.'Rear Window' is yet another brilliant and well-composed feature-film from Alfred Hitchcock. I'm giving the film a '10,' like I have his other films, the best of which, in my opinion, is the landmark suspense-thriller 'Psycho' (1960).10/10",10,0,3,5 January 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," From the beginning...
","...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the 'goriest movie ever made' (1992's 'Dead Alive'), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of 'The Lord of the Rings' saga, which include 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001), 'The Two Towers' (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner 'The Return of the King' (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since 'Star Wars' has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing 'The Lord of the Rings' films. 'The Lord of the Rings' is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the 'PG-13' rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get 'into' Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and 'The Enemy,' who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live ('live' is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a 'fellowship of the ring.' There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called 'The Lord of the Rings' the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10",10,3,5,3 August 2005
Munich," When you live by the sword, you'll die by the sword
","There's no question that 'Munich' is sure to spark debate about the ongoing conflicts between Israel and the state of Palestine. The two powers have been going at it for years: when one strikes, the other reprises two-fold, and that's a lot of blood. For the most part, Steven Spielberg's take on the real-life events that unfolded in Munich, Germany in 1972 is a bold and explosive vision.The events first open as Palestinian militants disguised as tourists storm an apartment building where 11 Israeli athletes participating in the '72 Munich Olympics are staying. The gunmen themselves are eventually killed in a shootout with German authorities but not before they've killed their 11 hostages.Israel's prime minister makes it a point to not compromise their own deeply-rooted values, but if they don't act they'll appear weak to the rest to the world, so action must be taken. (So perhaps her decisions aren't so much motivated by out-and-out vengeance as they are politics.) She dispatches a team of five men, led by Avner (Eric Bana), to track down and eliminate the 11 men responsible for the massacre (and according to my information, nine of the 11 men were killed).Based on the book 'Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team' by George Jonas, Spielberg's 'Munich' also makes a point to explore the nature of revenge while trying its best to not take sides. We know how Spielberg feels about Israel and his own Jewish heritage, but we also see that the man put his heart into this vision. The violence in 'Munich' is quite graphic and unsettling but it's still a powerful experience, as we the audience is forced to confront a growing problem within the Middle East.Though it seems both powers are at a stalemate, one character in 'Munich' is blunt that the battle could take hundreds of years and many lives, but eventually the 'promised' Holy Land of Israel will fall to Palestine simply because the Palestinians want it more.From the way things are looking now, I think he's right.10/10",10,1,3,9 May 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," My favorite slasher flick
","If someone were to ask me who my favorite movie slasher was, I'd have to say Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) from 'A Nightmare On Elm Street.'Krueger, the brainchild of horror movie veteran Wes Craven, has a distinct personality, which separates him from his contemporaries (i.e. Michael Meyers of 'Halloween' or Jason Voorhees of 'Friday the 13th.')He's given a sickly humorous and sadistic personality by Robert Englund, who first dawned the dirty, red and green sweatshirt, raggedy hat, and razor fingers in 1984 when he began his reign of terror by stalking Heather Langenkamp and numerous others in their dreams.He was unique amongst them because of the fact that he even had a personality. He didn't hide his face behind a mask; if he were killing you, he wanted you to know that it was him doing it. Krueger was also unique because you couldn't be really sure that he was even a living entity, since he stalked you in your dreams.Craven has stated that the character of Fred Krueger was inspired in part by an article he read about perfectly healthy people dying mysteriously in their sleep. To further add to that, the name of 'Fred Krueger' was inspired by a bully and a disfigured hobo who scared him when he was a child.With 'Nightmare,' Craven had crafted himself an icon horror film, one that was sure to inspire many knock-offs in the coming years. The sequels turned down the terror and upped the dark comedy. The series only seemed to return to its roots when Craven became involved with the project again and created 'New Nightmare' 10 years later in 1994.Even to this day, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' still terrorizes its viewers, prompting them to not fall asleep as that razor-fingered sleep-stalker Fred Krueger could come looking for you in your dreams.10/10",10,0,0,28 July 2004
The Matrix," Can Special Effects Really Make A Movie?
","Well obviously so because that really seems to be the only reason people like this movie.  From the sound of this you may think I hated this movie, but I didn't.  The special effects are truly breathtaking.  Don't get me wrong, I love this movie!  Thomas A. Anderson/Neo(Keanu Reeves) makes a horrifying discovery; that life as he knows it, is just a dream.  A cover-up for the real world.  The real world is basically nothing but endless and endless fields of comatose humans that are used by killer machines as a source of energy.  He is rescued by Morpheus(the great Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss).  Neo is later introduced to the 'real world' and is informed of his role in the rebellion against the controllers of it.    Keanu Reeves is awesome in this movie.  It's glad to see that his stoner image is starting to fade away.  He was awesome in Point Break and Speed. The great Laurence Fishburne is just what he always is, great!  His role as Morpheus was probably the most important role in this movie.The main problem that I have with this movie is it's story.  It's basically the Terminator all over again except with better special effects.  Numerous influences from many other science-fiction films are everywhere in this movie.  Most notably The Terminator, Blade Runner, the Star Wars Trilogy, and even Jacob's Ladder(cuz it deals with issues of what's real and what's fantasy). Aside from it's flaws, The Matrix is still an excellent sci-fi adventure with some truly amazing stuntwork and breathtaking special effects.10/10",10,0,3,9 November 2001
Godzilla," 'Godzilla' (2014) - The King is Definitely Back (and he's definitely still taking names)!
","<ul><li>'...'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds...'' - J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967), in a 1965 television broadcast recalling his witnessing of the Trinity test in Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945</li></ul>First, some perspective.For years, I've been against yet another attempt of an American 'Godzilla' film, ever since I first heard that Hollywood was making one. Put simply, the first American attempt at a 'Godzilla' film, 'Godzilla' (1998), was a disaster, yet I saw it six times in the theater. Of course, I was but 12 at the time and was just hyped to finally see Godzilla lay waste to the United States.But then reality (and age) set in and I realized what a god-awful mess that movie was. The Japanese already had their eyes set on reviving the mighty King of the Monsters for a third movie series with 'Godzilla 2000' (1999), while he lay in a state of disarray here in the United States. During that time, other giant monster features have made a splash here; the first was South Korea's 'The Host' in 2006, followed by the J.J. Abrams-produced 'Cloverfield' in 2008, and then Mexican director Guillermo del Toro gosh-wowed (most of) us with 'Pacific Rim' (2013) - which was, quite frankly, the best of the bunch - last year.So giant monster movies have seen an increase in popularity (and legitimacy) here in the U.S. over the last seven years. So, what better way to capitalize on that increased popularity and legitimacy than to once again go back to the one giant beast (or 'kaiju' - the Japanese word for 'strange monster' or 'beast') that started it all in the first place, Gojira (Godzilla).To put it simply, Ishiro Honda's dark & gloomy, black & white 'Gojira' (1954) is the single greatest monster movie ever made; yes, it's better than 'King Kong' (1933) - there, I said it. I've been the biggest devotee - that I know of - of Japanese 'kaiju-eiga' (Japanese giant monster movies) for much of my life; Godzilla, obviously, was the most famous of them all (Hollywood confirmed it themselves by giving him a star on the Walk of Fame 10 years ago to mark his 50th anniversary). Of course, that darkness and gloominess didn't last long, as Godzilla (originally a living manifestation of the atomic bomb and nuclear warfare) was eventually reworked into a superhero throughout the rest of the first-generation Showa-Era films - only returning to his roots as a rampaging menace in 1984 with the second-generation Heisei-Era films, beginning with 'Godzilla 1985' (1984).Now, Britain's Gareth Edwards has completely dazzled us with 2014's 'Godzilla.' I knew this movie was working when at a pivotal moment late in the third act when Godzilla (brilliantly motion-captured here by Andy Serkis) - now slightly re-worked here to appear literally as a force of nature - appears to lay waste to human civilization, over half the theater erupted in applause (myself included amongst them). In short, this is the 'Godzilla' movie we've all been waiting for since the original 'Gojira.'While this is nowhere near the greatness of 'Gojira,' it's definitely not the '98 'Godzilla.' This film contains much of 'Gojira's' gloominess and growing atmosphere of imminent apocalyptic doom from the beginning, and that's a good thing. The picture begins in 1999 in The Philippines, where Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe, whose character's name is an obvious reference to both the late Ishiro Honda and the doomed scientist from 'Gojira,' Dr. Serizawa, played there by the late Akihiko Hirata) and his assistant Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) have discovered the remains of an enormous prehistoric creature in an underground cavern. Things then shift to Japan, where American nuclear engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is at war with the corporate owners of a nuclear power plant in Janjira to shut it down over growing safety concerns and soon enough, tragedy strikes, losing his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) in the process.15 years later, Joe has become a paranoid conspiracy theorist and virtual recluse, convinced that the Japanese government covered up what really happened at the plant and is desperate to get answers. His son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), now a family man himself, has just returned from active military duty overseas to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son Sam (Carlson Borde), and soon joins his father where they make a terrifying discovery.It turns out that a previously unknown species of large prehistoric creatures (which vaguely resemble the monster from 'Cloverfield,' crossed with a praying mantis) - called here as MUTOs ('Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism') - that feeds off radioactive materials has been awakened from an eons-long slumber and is now ready to lay waste to all of human civilization. In turn, the MUTOs are also being hunted by an even larger stone-age monstrosity, and you can pretty much guess who that is, if you haven't figured it out already...'Godzilla' has the usual epic destruction, monster-vs.-military firefights, and monster-on-monster smack-downs that have long characterized the monster-on-the-rampage movie genre. The only downside to the experience can be all the 9/11-styled imagery that's present (in addition to scattered references to Chernobyl, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster), which could rub some viewers the wrong way and possibly incite calls of 'bad taste.'This is one 'Godzilla' devotee who was once a doubter, went into the theater hyped and came out eagerly a believer, and REALLY eager for an even bigger sequel (and possible future franchise cross-over with 'Pacific Rim,' which Legendary Pictures also produced)...10/10",10,3,8,18 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What's left to say?
","It seems that the honoring of George Lucas with the Lifetime Achievement Award could not have come at a better time for the visionary and imaginative filmmaker. With 'Episode III' still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, 'Star Wars' (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. 'Star Wars' is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established 'Star Wars' as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw 'Star Wars' for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. 'Star Wars' was of course followed by the somber 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) and the triumphant 'Return of the Jedi' (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's 'The Phantom Menace,' 2002's 'Attack of the Clones,' the aforementioned 2005 conclusion 'Revenge of the Sith') out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with 'Star Wars,' and may be looking to start a new trilogy. But with all this, we still need to look back at the film that started it all, the film with nothing left to talk about, the original 'Star Wars' (1977).10/10",10,4,7,28 June 2005
300," Days of glory
","'300' is something to get excited about, just to put that out there. Never before has the glory of battle been such a rousing and intense experience as it is here. Never mind the ho-hum acting from a cast of largely unknown supporting players and the testosterone-driven dialogue of 300 Spartan warriors battling to the death against the massive, 1000+ Persian army of Xerxes (the towering Rodrigo Santoro). The exact historical details of the Battle of Thermopylae in 648 B.C. escapes me, but The History Channel and Frank Miller's original '300' graphic novel do fill me in on some information. Spartan king Leonidas (Scotsman Gerard Butler) leads 299 of his fellow countrymen into the battle against the mammoth Persian army, which outnumbers them 3-1. A great leader and a motivational speaker, he is; the words 'retreat' and 'surrender' are not in his vocabulary. But their early skirmishes are costly for Xerxes's military forces, who underestimates the will and strategic determination of Leonidas's 300-strong force. The battles grow more and more intense and frequent, with plenty of graphic battlefield carnage to satisfy the gore-hounds of the masses. Back on the home-front, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is trying to convince the Spartan council to send more reinforcements for her husband's military forces. Since 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004) showed much promise for what it could do for his career, director Zack Snyder seems to have a firm grip on the material, even if the plot takes a backseat to the graphic battle scenes in the second half. His eye for detail is overwhelming (even as limbs are lopped off and the body count easily surpasses the thousands), since it pays close attention to Miller's original graphic novel (especially during the closing credits, with artwork lifted directly from the panels). Much of the action is CGI and filmed on sound-stages and against computer-generated backdrops, so the close-quarters combat throws you right in along side the Spartan army. '300' is undoubtedly a success, even if the performers are short-changed in the end. I do wish that the film could have explored more of Spartan culture (since let's face facts, a lot of Americans are not up to par on their world history - including me), instead of just catapulting us into the action with only a few passing lines of dialogue to clue us in on what's going on. The details of Sparta's 300 should live forever, though, because of this film.10/10",10,3,11,9 March 2007
Ran," A modern-day Akira Kurosawa masterpiece
","Late Japanese master of cinema Akira Kurosawa has many masterpieces to his name - 'Seven Samurai' (1954) (my personal favorite), 'Rashomon' (1950), 'Yojimbo' (1961), 'Throne of Blood' (1957), 'Kagemusha' (1980) and the film I'm commenting on here, 1985's 'Ran.' Having seen this movie in its entirety for the first time earlier today, I'm simply amazed by the epic scale of the picture, the performances, the use of color and imagery (by Emi Wada), and Kurosawa's master direction.'Ran' is a unique collaboration between Japan and France. 'Ran' (which means 'revolt,' 'chaos,' or 'fury' in Japanese) is Kurosawa's epic adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy 'King Lear,' and surrounds the aging 16-century Japanese warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) after he unwisely decides to give up control of his kingdom to his three sons - Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu) - with the land divided up equally amongst them. Hidetora falls prey to the false flattery bestowed upon his by two oldest sons - Taro and Jiro - but angrily banishes his youngest child Saburo when he speaks the truth about the insanity of his father's actions. Madness, bloodshed, betrayal, and all-out war soon follow.Kurosawa is by far the greatest foreign director I've ever encountered in my 26-and-a-half years on this planet. I've already mentioned a number of pictures that I've seen and consider to be classics, not just of Japanese cinema, but of all films (I consider 'Seven Samurai' to be the greatest foreign-language picture I've ever seen). What makes 'Ran' so powerful is its strong performances, inventive use of color and costumes (which won an Oscar at the Academy Awards for 1985 for costume designer Emi Wada) and having looked at the picture, there's a certain air of timelessness to it: it feels like it could have been made decades ago back in the 1960s, yet it's only 27-years-old! (This last statement could be because of the restored audio and picture on the Blu-ray edition of this film, from which this comment is based.)The film also plays on two common themes in Kurosawa's work, the battle between reality vs. fantasy (the flattery of Taro and Jiro to their father for his decision, and the madness Hidetora soon falls into), and the lust for power (and the bloodshed that ensues as the three newly crowned warlords battle each other for ultimate control of the land). Perhaps is this no better seen here than in 'Ran.'This is another Akira Kurosawa masterpiece to behold!10/10",10,1,3,9 July 2012
Easy A," 'Easy A' gets an 'A' for effort...
","(John Hughes would be proud with 'Easy A.') Oh, boy, where to start with this movie, hmm? Well, for one, Will Gluck's 'Easy A' provided me with a brief respite from the day-to-day insanity that is my life. The last movie I saw in theaters was 'Predators' and that was back in July; that's three months of not having to pay the inflated ticket price of $8.75 to see a movie. But my self-imposed moratorium on not going to the movies was well-worth the wait with 'Easy A.' The script shines in delivering a fast-paced, laugh-a-minute screenplay with a story vaguely paralleling 'The Scarlet Letter' by Nathaniel Hawthorne (which I never read in high school); Olive Pendergast (Emma Stone, the husky-voiced redhead from 'Superbad' and 'Zombieland' whose career has just been made with this film) is a social nobody at her shiny, pristine Southern California high school. But that changes when a little lie to get out of spending time with her best friend's weird family somehow explodes into a huge, school-wide rumor about how she allegedly lost her virginity to some made-up college hunk. A la Hester Prynne in 'The Scarlet Letter,' Olive becomes the talk of her high school rumor mill, with boys approaching her left and right to help them with their reputations around campus. So she decides to embrace her newfound infamy (complete with a telltale 'A' pinned on the shoulder of her new wardrobe), much to the chagrin of the high school queen bee (Amanda Bynes, fresh out of her retirement) and the mascot of the basketball team (Penn Badgley), with whom Olive shares an unusual romantic past with. And we all know how one lie leads to an even bigger lie and how that bigger lie leads to an even bigger lie and so on and so forth. 'Easy A' is a brilliantly acted teen comedy with nods aplenty to the work of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), 'Can't Buy Me Love' (1987) with Patrick Dempsey, and Cameron Crowe's 'Say Anything' (1989). Stone is a star; she's not just a pretty face. She's spunky with an incredibly razor-sharp wit, and a heart to boot, even as she must face the music and try to put the wrong things right in her chaotic life and improve her high school reputation before it's too late. She's intelligent, easy on the eyes, and proves with this movie that she has a bright future ahead of her in the movies. 'Easy A' is an easy movie to like. In a wasteland of instantly forgettable and stupid teen movies, 'Easy A' is one teen flick you can pay $8.75 to see in the theater, and not kick yourself for doing so in the morning...10/10",10,2,5,25 October 2010
Honey," 'Honey' is sweet, but is otherwise empty. 6/10
","I typically try to stay away from movies like 'Honey' because they appeal to such a limited audience. It's basically music video flash and glitter - the 'Flashdance' of the 21st century, made for a braindead audience raised on MTV. I was raised on MTV unfortunately, so naturally I fit into this film's demographic, which is why I did like this movie, though it faded from memory very quickly after viewing it. Jessica Alba is sweet, to say the least, and she truly comes alive as Honey Daniels, who dreams of being a music video choreographer. She storms the dance floor in the local club and eventually gains the attention of a prominent music video director who wants her to work with him on his projects. Of course, this puts a strain on the life she already has with her friends and family, as well as her commitment as a dance teacher at the local community center.This movie resembles 'Flashdance' in a lot of ways that are too numerous to mention, but that did not stop me from liking 'Honey.' Jessica Alba gives a great performance and I'm probably sure it was her that kept the movie from going off the tracks. Unfortunately though, it is her and only her, plus a few exciting dance sequences that really make this movie memorable. That is why I rated it a '6.' Nonetheless, this movie is good for a Saturday night with some friends if you have nothing else to do.",6,0,2,16 June 2004
Fantastic Four," It's 'Fantastic' in a way I didn't think possible
","If you're reading this, then there's a high possibility that you've already taken a chance or are at least interested in seeing 'Fantastic Four.' The film is big, loud, and totally captured my interest in a way that a number of movies already out this summer haven't, except for 'Batman Begins,' which is another adaptation of a popular comic book superhero.Where other superhero flicks have probably failed or have not lived up to their full camp potential (save Sam Raimi's marvelous 'Spider-Man' movies), 'Fantastic Four,' surprisingly, succeeds, especially in its joy and role as a summer crowd-pleaser and I make those judgments out of amusement, not criticism. Though I'm not big on Marvel Comics' cosmic foursome, the Fantastic Four certainly do rank as their most popular team of heroic mutants outside the X-Men.Even more surprisingly, some may realize that this is not the first time Fantastic Four has gotten the green light as a motion picture; some may remember a straight-to-video version from 1994 that a lot of people merely laugh at. But this big-budget screen adaptation, directed by Tim Story (of 'Barbershop' fame), is 'fantastic' and fun and may be one of the better special effects bonanzas we'll see this summer.Beginning with a trip into outer space, a team of five scientists - Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and the mission's sponsor Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) - have journeyed to Doom's space station to monitor a radioactive energy cloud that's set to pass by Earth.This energy cloud, we learn, may have been responsible for the beginning of life on Earth. A mishap in the mission occurs when they learn that the energy cloud is approaching the station hours before it was scheduled to pass by. The team members are exposed and the next thing the audience realizes, they're back on planet Earth recovering from their ordeal.They all seem fine, except that Reed's feeling a little more 'loose' than usual, Susan's having trouble seeing her reflection, Johnny's 'hot,' and Ben's skin is hardening. Before long, we've got four mutants on our hands:<ul><li>Reed becomes 'Mr. Fantastic,' in that he can stretch, bend, and otherwise reconfigure his body and give Plastic Man a run for his money; shame about the grays though.</li></ul><ul><li>Susan becomes the 'Invisible Woman' - 'nuff said. Well, not exactly. She can't turn completely invisible but she can bend light, which of course doesn't amount to the same thing. But, it becomes harder to see her, which may be a disappointment to those who expected to see a naked Ms. Alba (even though she does strip a few times but sadly, we can't see her when that happens).</li></ul><ul><li>Johnny becomes the 'Human Torch' and with those famous words 'Flame On!' - he's on fire - literally, and the girls are melting over him. I can still picture that famous scene where the nurse shoves a thermometer in his mouth and she reads a computer monitor and exclaims, 'You're hot!' to which Johnny coolly replies, 'Why, thank you. So are you.'</li></ul><ul><li>And lastly, there's poor Ben, who's my personal favorite FF member, who becomes 'The Thing,' and he's less +Rocky+ than Stallone but more heartfelt than The Rock himself.</li></ul>The characters bicker amongst themselves like a close family as they try to figure out what's happening to them. After a daring rescue on the Brooklyn Bridge, the four become instant media heroes and are dubbed 'The Fantastic Four.' Johnny gets the most exposure of course, Reed and Susan try to sort out their tentative romance, and poor Ben struggles with his unsightly figure.This will all have to be brushed to the side, however, when Victor notices he's feeling a little 'steely,' and he becomes 'Dr. Doom' and wishes to challenge our four heroes. As it would turn out, he was affected as well by exposure to the energy cloud and he now has control over electricity and (surprise, surprise) he has plans on world domination.'Fantastic Four' raises the bar on superhero flicks in a way not quite seen since the modern genre was kicked off with 'Superman' (1978). I say that it is extremely enjoyable, doesn't take itself seriously, and is forever charming. This film embraces its camp elements and just goes to town with the humor, which, from my experience in the theater today, was met with a wildly positive response.As stated earlier, though I'm no FF geek, I can honestly say that this instantly ranks as one of the more fun, less serious of the lighter superhero movies. We have four excellent leads who come together on-screen and realize their lives' mission in saving the world from imminent destruction at the hands of a madman.'Fantastic Four' is fun and flawed but likable in a way that those flaws can be brushed under a carpet and left there for good. I just hope the DVD is as fantastic as a I anticipate it should be.8/10",8,8,13,8 July 2005
Pineapple Express," An action-comedy about the best of buds
","I just saw the excellent and laugh-out-loud hilarious action-comedy 'Pineapple Express' for a 7:50 showing at the local theater. I'm not even a stoner, yet I still found the 'high as a kite' humor and pot-smoking to be down-right hilarious; my ribs are still hurting, I was laughing so hard. As with most comedies of late in which Judd Apatow is involved, 'Pineapple Express' is indeed funny - with plenty of laughs and late in the film, blood + guts 'Die Hard-/John Woo'-style action shoot-'em-up - but somewhere in there is a subtext on male-bonding and friendship that proves that these new Apatow comedies are certainly more than they appear on the surface. 'Pineapple Express' involves Dale Denton (the lovable new face of Hollywood slacker-dom, Seth Rogen, also the film's co-writer along with Evan Goldberg), a process server (he hands out subpoenas and other legal documents to truant folks due in court) and out-and-out pothead who's also dating Angie (Amber Heard), an 18-year-old high school girl. Anyway, Dale witnesses a murder one night that was committed by a local drug kingpin (Gary Cole) and his corrupt-cop girlfriend (Rosie Perez). Fleeing the scene of the crime in terror, Dale goes to his only (and unlikely) source of refuge, his dealer Saul (James Franco, the film's most valuable and unlikely asset). It turns out that Saul is in possession of a new and extremely rare kind of marijuana, the 'pineapple express' of the title - he's one of two dealers known to be in possession of it, in fact - and so when they learn that the drug kingpin's assassins are gunning for them, they take the contraband and go on the run. As it turns out, their time on the run proves to be a perfect bonding experience: Saul likes Dale (in a perfectly heterosexual way) and during their deals is always trying to warm up to him so that they can be friends, not just dealer and client. And there are plenty of moments in this buddy comedy where the two get a chance to shine. Franco, as I stated earlier, is the film's most valuable and unlikely asset. Frankly, he steals the show and he's the guy in the movie that you feel the most for. As the perpetually stoned Saul, you see it in him his yearning for friendship and desire to move beyond the increasingly boring day-to-day routine of pot-dealing and into greener pastures, like caring for his grandmother and nurturing his knack for industrial design (he invents a joint shaped like a cross). In other words, he's lonely. So in a way, if they survive their time on the run, Dale and Saul will without question become the best of buds. 'Pineapple Express' is a wonderful and action-packed comedy, smartly written by Rogen and Goldberg, and directed by David Gordon Green. Of their comedies of late ('The 40-Year-old Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad'), Apatow and friends' 'Pineapple Express' is the best one I've seen yet. The laughs are a mile-a-minute, and while some may be turned off in the film's third act by an ultra-bloody shootout in a warehouse involving the drug kingpin and his rivals - unnamed Asian gangsters, who also deliver some hardy laughs themselves - I guarantee that even there, there's a little something for everyone: blood, guts, guns, cheesy one-liners ('You've been served!'), and explosions - which shows that director Green and his co-writers were in perfect control of this well-executed film. In an age where so few comedies are actually funny, 'Pineapple Express' proves that you can go to the movies with your friends, and come out after the show's over - The Best of Buds.10/10",10,3,9,18 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," I know it's a little late but...
","...What can I say? I wasn't even alive when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came out in 1980; I wouldn't be around for another five years after its release and even then, I still couldn't comment on it like this until I had learned to read and write. But it's 26 years later and we can't change what has already happened. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is considered the best (if not the best) movie sequel of all time and here's why: it just can't be topped; it's that good, it's that awesome. Bigger and bleaker than its 1977 George Lucas-directed predecessor, 'The Empire Strikes Back,' this time directed by Irvin Kershner, is an example of a movie sequel done right. It's completely different from the original and does not try to repeat formulas or details or ideas from the predecessor and most importantly, it's just too damned good and much better than 'Star Wars.' Some time after 'Star Wars,' the Rebel Alliance has retreated to the ice planet Hoth while the Galactic Empire has sent imperial probe droids all over the galaxy and luck out when one reports back data from Hoth. The Empire, now under the command of Darth Vader (played by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), sends effects wizard Phil Tippett's AT-AT walkers to the planet to lay siege to the Rebel base. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) must journey (with unwilling robot ally R2-D2 accompanying him) to the swamp planet Dagobah to begin his training with venerable Jedi master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). In the meantime, swashbuckling pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is on the verge of leaving the Rebel Alliance behind in favor of repaying his debts to intergalactic gangster Jabba the Hutt but his growing affections for Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) keep him, his ship the Millennium Falcon, and Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) around and in service. After the Rebel base evacuation, Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and droid C-3PO journey to Bespin's Cloud City to reunite with Han's old buddy Lando Calrissian (trilogy newcomer Billy Dee Williams). 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the definition of a fantastic movie sequel. As stated, it's bigger and full of more surprises than the first entry. With more shootouts reminiscent of our favorite westerns, fearsome bounty hunters (including Boba Fett), more Force philosophy and a climatic lightsaber battle (that reveals a secret so big it deserves its own movie), it's everything a proper 'Star Wars' picture should be. Just don't get too carried away with fantastic fan responses like this one.10/10",10,0,1,28 May 2006
Incredibles 2," A sequel that was well-worth the wait...
","I'll be quick and to-the-point. 'The Incredibles' (2004) was simply the best and greatest animated film to come out in 2004. It was a love-labor to superhero lore, as well as a bold-faced SATIRE of superhero lore - done in animated form, by the one American animation studio to top them all off, Pixar. 'The Incredibles' was a box office success and critical hit. So the question was, how could writer-director Brad Bird and his team of animators at Pixar follow it up?We got that answer with 2018's 'Incredibles 2.' While not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it grips you from its opening moments and holds your attention for the entire duration of its 118-minute running time. This sequel is bigger, bolder, and more family-centered than the first one; but don't let that fool you, there are still plenty of thunderous action sequences and moments of laugh-out-loud comedy and genuinely heartfelt family times to keep you interested.Do yourself a favor, and watch one of the most 'Incredible' sequels ever made.9/10",9,2,3,9 August 2019
Sin City," 'Sin City' - Digitalized violence, film-noir, steroids, and comic book greatness!
","'Sin City,' directed by one of the greatest directorial trifectas - Robert Rodriguez, 'Sin City' graphic novel creator Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino - is a visually stunning and breathtaking piece of film-noir graphic novel, cinematic greatness on steroids.By and large, this is what a movie based on a comic book should be. It's flawlessly adapted from the source material, with only a few slight changes (presumably to avoid the more explicit contents of the original comic book) and many of Miller's panels come to life on the screen through Rodriguez's skillfully placed camera. Comic book movies represent one of the remaining avenues for truly original film-making, and 'Sin City' takes full advantage of its digitalized violence and groundbreaking CGI vainglory. And the cast (and what a cast!) brings the shady, corrupt characters to life, along with the amoral Basin City metropolis they inhabit.As a newbie reader of Miller's work on 'Sin City,' I was amazed at the care that went into Rodriguez's attention to the story as it unfolded on the screen. As mentioned earlier, the visuals are lifted right out of the original 'Sin City' graphic novel panels, so audience members would not have to be readers themselves to understand what's going on.Although the world of 'Sin City' exists through seven transversal story arcs, the film primarily focuses in on Miller's three tales 'The Hard Goodbye,' 'The Big Fat Kill,' and 'That Yellow Bastard.' It's brutal, it's violent, it's vicious, it's beautiful, and it's sinful. The events in 'Sin City' kickoff after a brief narration by The Man (Josh Hartnett)...In 'The Hard Goodbye,' a hulking, hard-luck loser named Marv (Mickey Rourke, under about 15 pounds of prosthetic makeup) wakes up in the bed of a run-down motel room with a dead prostitute laying next to him. The hooker, identified by Marv as Goldie (Jaime King), apparently picked him up in a seedy bar and showed him the time of his life. But, somehow, someway, somebody sneaked into the room and offed her while she slept, and Marv, framed for the murder, now scours the streets and alleys for her killer.This is my favorite of the three, as 'The Hard Goodbye' was the first 'Sin City' graphic novel I picked up at Barnes & Noble Booksellers a few months ago. Rourke is a total bad-ass as Marv, virtually unrecognizable underneath such heavy-duty prosthetics and bandages. He eventually finds his quarry, Kevin (Elijah Wood), a nerd-looking, silent psychopath who kills women, eats them, and hangs their heads on the wall. Rutger Hauer co-stars as Cardinal Roark and a scantily-clad Carla Gugino also appears as Marv's lesbian parole officer, Lucille.In 'The Big Fat Kill,' corrupt cop Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) is about to break down the door of his stripper lover Shellie (Brittany Murphy). What Jackie Boy doesn't know, is Shellie has a new man in her life, and that man is Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight is a wanted murderer who underwent plastic surgery and has found unlikely love with the hardened Shellie. Well, to make long stories short, all hell breaks loose when Jackie Boy and his lackeys wander into the wrong part of town and are killed by chop-soki swordswoman Miho (Devon Aoki).In this part of the city, known as Old Town, the whores are their own enforcers as they have an uneasy truce with the corrupt police. But with Jackie Boy and his loser friends getting wasted, that truce has gone bye-bye. Gail (the luscious, the leather-and-chain-bound Rosario Dawson) is the leader, and Dwight formulates a plan to dump the bodies into the distant tar pits. But between getting there, narrowly evading the cops (including Michael Clarke Duncan) and assorted foreign mercenaries and his own stupidity, each of these almost prove to be Dwight's undoing.Oh, wow, where to begin. For starters, Rosario Dawson!!! I never knew this woman could look so hot in S&M, not that I'm into that sort of thing, but damn, I at least partially bought this just to see her in leather and chains. As Dwight, Clive Owen hits all the right notes as an outsider anti-hero in way over his head, and Devon Aoki is pretty vicious as Miho, who serves up some delectable sushi bad guys with the same swords used in the 'Kill Bill' films. But 'The Big Fat Kill' is big, bloody, and fun.'That Yellow Bastard' is the only one of the three I haven't read (not that it really matters), so I have to go on what the movie says. The yellow bastard in question is an unrecognizable Nick Stahl as Roark Jr., the psychopathic son of Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). He's racked up a nasty reputation on the Basin City streets as a vicious serial killer who loves to torture women, and his latest target is stripper Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba). Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the only honest cops left in the city, has a bad heart and little patience for incompetence, which only intensifies when he is stopped by his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) from killing Roark Jr. and is then sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Hartigan escapes, and then goes after Roark Jr., who is setting his sights once again on the innocent Nancy.'Sin City' is already one of the most talked-about films this year. It's definitely not for the faint-of-heart, as the stylized and incredibly bloody violence should ruffle a few feathers. The numerous unsavory characters are truly right out of a comic book, as they make no attempt to rise above their amoral existences in Miller's decadent Basin City.There are few heroes in 'Sin City' and there are even fewer identifiable characters, but there's no two ways about it: 'Sin City' is a visual masterpiece, a pumped-up comic book come to life on steroids, and is one of the best movies I've seen this year.10/10",10,13,16,18 August 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," Just when you thought you'd seen it all... you hadn't
","'The Cabin in the Woods,' directed by Drew Goddard (screenwriter of 2008's 'Cloverfield') and co-written by himself and Joss Whedon ('Firefly'), is a crystal-clear example that you truly haven't seen it all from the horror genre. I'm sure we've all just about given up on horror movies these days, but 'The Cabin in the Woods' is the proof we need to shake us out of our delusion.'The Cabin in the Woods' is a delightful send-up of 'dead teenager' movies, using the Cabin in the Woods set-up that's so popular in movies like 'The Evil Dead' (1982), Eli Roth's 'Cabin Fever' (2002), and even 'I Spit on Your Grave' (1978); I'm actually quite certain there's more - OK, a lot more - but it's 11:00 at night and I can't quite think of horror movie names right now. It also throws in heavy elements of zombie movies and slasher movies for good measure. (Who said original horror movies are a lost art these days?)The story follows five college students (Kristen Connolly as Cute Virgin Girl Dana, Chris Hemsworth as College Football Jock Curt, Fran Franz as Bleary-eyed Stoner/Paranoid Conspiracy Theorist Marty, Jesse Williams as Stalwart Nice Guy/Scholar Holden, and Anne Hutchison as the Slutty Dumb Blonde Jules) as they take a break at a remote Cabin in the Woods; note that they're all blatant horror movie stereotypes being lined up for an imminent slaughter. A night of bloodshed and terror ensues. In a parallel - yet brilliantly, brazenly inter-connected and constructed, and also equally important - plot-line featuring faceless bureaucrats, things quickly become a witty essay on Hollywood horror movie narratives. To divulge any further details, destroys the surprises in store for you.It's amazing the way that 'The Cabin in the Woods' cuts between its two parallel story lines; witnessing this in action, I savored expert classical craftsmanship on the part of both Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon and their equally talented young cast members and film crew. Both are alive & kicking, and one directly influences the actions of the other (this aspect of the picture is later flipped on its head late in the film). And did I mention that this is pretty funny, in addition to being occasionally gripping and scary?'The Cabin in the Woods' is genuinely scary in an old-school fright-fest way. It's also funny in a uniquely self-aware, post-'Scream' fashion that doesn't threaten to drift into full-blown camp territory. Even though it still exists in the post-'Scream' void of self-knowing horror movies, the movie actually reminds me a lot more heavily of Sam Raimi's 'Drag Me to Hell' (2009), which also went straight for scares/jump scenes with a sly sense of humor under-cutting the action. And 'The Cabin in the Woods' does have some impressive scenes of gory violence featuring - what else? - dead teenagers.'The Cabin in the Woods' is a unique breath of fresh air for a genre that definitely needed a huge breath of fresh air.9/10",9,1,4,12 October 2012
True Romance," My #1 movie
","Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a lonely, but pretty hip kind of guy. He works in a comic book store, is obsessed with Elvis Presley (he even talks to his ghost, whom of which is played by Val Kilmer), and has a thing for Kung-Fu films.  Things take a turn for the better when Alabama (Patricia Arquette) walks into his life.  They automatically fall in love and just days after they first meet, they decide to get married.  Alabama, however, has a confession to make: She is a call girl and is determined to leave behind her old life in order to make a fresh start with Clarence.  Even with all of this behind them now, Clarence still has something eating away deep inside him.  It seems that he can't stand the fact that Alabama's former pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), who is also a white wannabe homeboy, is breathing the same air as he is.  So Clarence decides to pay Drexl a visit.  Drexl is not exactly anxious to let go of Alabama and so a shootout ensues which leaves Drexl dead and Clarence with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Clarence walks away from the situation as a hero in the eyes of Alabama, but from this you can also conclude that he is very stupid, yet courageous.  After the confrontation, Clarence hatches a brilliant scheme to go on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles to sell the cocaine to a rich movie producer named Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek) and with the money, they can go anywhere in the world that they want.  So Clarence reunites with his childhood buddy, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) and his slob of a roommate, Floyd (a very stoned Brad Pitt).  Dick has setup a meeting with Lee through his connection with Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) who is Lee's assistant. Clarence's plan seems perfect, except that what he doesn't know is, the cocaine that he stole actually belongs to a group of very p****d off mobsters who have come looking for it. 'True Romance' is now my all time favorite movie.  The performances are excellent and with an all-star cast such as this one, how could it not be? Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a very good couple and you cannot help but praise their efforts for what they have to go through to start a new life with each other.  Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken have one great (and very offensive) scene together.  Gary Oldman is totally off the wall as the wannabe homeboy, Drexl.  Although he is only in two scenes, he does make a lasting impression.  His first scene, which is during a drug buy with Big Don (Samuel L. Jackson), is amongst some of the best parts of the movie.  I cannot find a single fault with this movie.  I have noticed that Quentin Tarantino has not received a lot of credit for this movie.  That is most likely due to the fact that he did not direct this movie; that credit goes to Tony 'Top Gun' Scott.  Of course, since Tarantino DID write this movie, you can expect the following: witty dialogue, unbelievable characters, lots of dark humor, and at least two or more scenes of unsettlingly, brutal violence.  To those who do not know what I am talking about, watch Patricia Arquette's encounter with James Gandolfini in the hotel room or watch the ever-famous 'Mexican Standoff' at the end. 10/10",10,3,7,22 August 2002
Slumdog Millionaire," A real treat for anyone who sees it
","'Slumdog Millionaire'This was the true winner of 2008, a true rags-to-riches tale that took everybody by surprise and gained all of the praise and recognition it deserved. It's brilliantly acted, written, and directed by a mostly unknown cast of Indian actors and actresses, and their performances are true-to-life and phenomenal. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is also one of those rare instances where all the hype and talk of multiple Oscar nods is actually true. And I'm glad I finally got to watch it.The setup is pretty simple: Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is a 'slumdog,' a poor, uneducated kid who grew up on the rough streets of Mumbai, India, who by some unbelievable stroke of good luck has managed to land on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.' However, he is soon arrested and accused of cheating by the show's producers because he knows the correct answers to the seemingly impossible questions that have been stumping scholars for years. The answer is: by sheer coincidence, that is how Jamal knows the answers to these questions. So, desperate to prove his innocence, he relates his life story and experiences, and his life-long quest to find his long-lost true love Latika (Freida Pinto).Directed by Danny Boyle ('Trainspotting,' '28 Days Later...') and adapted from the novel 'Q & A' by Vikas Swarup, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is that unexpected masterpiece, a true winner in every sense. I had the opportunity to see the movie several weeks ago but due to a shortage of funds at the time (I had just seen 'Watchmen'), I was unable to do so. But this movie pretty much came out of nowhere, and took everybody by surprise because it was the real deal, a real winner, a real underdog story, a real rags-to-riches fantasy come to life. We've read about and seen this sort of stuff in books and movies for years, but it's never been done this good before.'Slumdog Millionaire' is a movie that deserved each and every one of its eight Oscar wins this year. This film is a real treat for anyone who watches it. Trust me, you won't regret watching it.10/10",10,0,6,31 March 2009
The Breakfast Club," Saturday morning detention was never this funny, moving, or heartfelt
","'The Breakfast Club' is arguably the best movie ever made about teenagers that it's no wonder that it's such an essential piece of 1980s teen fanfare/nostalgia. This movie is all of funny (sometimes hilariously so), moving, and heartfelt. The most authentic thing about this film is that regardless of the blatant stereotyping of high school cliques (honestly, not a whole lot has changed since 1985) and melodrama, this movie pulls at the heart-strings in ways you never would have thought were possible for a film such as this. And this heart-string-pulling is sincere and honest, making my assertion that it's authentic correct.For early Saturday morning detention, five suburban Chicago high school students have showed up as punishment, with Principal Richard Vernon (the late Paul Gleason) presiding over the festivities. They've all done something to land here this morning, and they each represent the various cliques in their school: Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) is the stereotypical jock, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) is the stereotypical beauty/princess, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the stereotypical nerd/brain, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) is the stereotypical shy-quiet girl/weirdo/outsider, and John Bender (Judd Nelson) is the stereotypical rebel. As an aside, when I was in high school, I fell into three of the five categories here: nerd/brain, shy-quiet guy/weirdo/outsider, and rebel - in that order.As I said before, they all have their reasons for being there, and on another day in another world they would have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But this is not the normal world. This is writer-director John Hughes's teen world, and in his teen world, anything goes. Of course these kids don't like each other; Hughes makes sure of that, but as the day goes on, barriers are broken, alliances are made, and each of these kids discovers that they have more in common with each other than they think - of course after having gone through a lot of pain to get there. They have sincere heart-to-hearts with each other that are not like anything seen in another film of this genre. Spliced in with the drama, Hughes's flawless screen-writing does give these kids some time to have some fun and stave off the boredom and mess with Vernon, with well-placed scenes of comedy, even slapstick comedy, that get as much laughs from the comedy as the tears we shed from the heart-string drama.'The Breakfast Club' is a first-rate teen comedy/drama with some first-rate performances from some of the top 'Brat Packers' from the time. Estevez, Ringwald, Hall, Sheedy, and Nelson are a brave, once-in-a-lifetime cast that do their characters plenty of justice. These kids may be stereotypes, but they're three-dimensional stereotypes, and real people with real feelings and real troubles. (These former Brat Packers, now fully-grown adults, would reunite 20 years later at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards to receive a special honor.)John Hughes never quite repeated the success of 'The Breakfast Club,' and his career began to decline toward the '80s and into the '90s. But 'The Breakfast Club' is unquestionably Hughes's masterstroke of teen comedy/drama. He was able to give teenagers a three-dimensional gloss and show us that these teens are indeed real people with real feelings and real troubles.Saturday morning detention was never this fun.10/10",10,1,1,27 February 2009
Gladiator," Epic
","'Gladiator' is one of those films for the ages, a film that defies expectations and becomes something legendary. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for Best Actor as a Roman general seeking revenge on the corrupt prince (Joaquin Phoenix) who murdered his family. While a simple revenge dominates the plot, it really gives director Ridley Scott a chance to re-imagine ancient Rome as it was before its historical downfall. His vision is astounding, with plenty of graphic battle sequences (many of which are enhanced by CGI), great acting, and all-around epic greatness. 'Gladiator' is really sweeping entertainment of the first order. While I feel I can no longer pay to see Russell Crowe in a movie anymore, this was his greatest performance ever, with an Oscar win that was surely well-deserved.10/10",10,2,3,2 December 2008
Donnie Darko," Drifting on the Darkside...
","For me, 'Donnie Darko' certainly was an otherworldly film experience. This movie has everything: comedy, tragedy, and time travel. Yes, you heard me correctly. I said time travel. I waited for months to see this movie and when I finally saw it, I was blown away. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the film's title character, Donnie Darko. When we first meet Donnie, it's obvious that he is a very disturbed individual. He's a borderline schizophrenic and has an imaginary friend named Frank, who just so happens to be a giant monster rabbit. When Donnie is nearly crushed to death by a falling jet engine, his 'friend' Frank tells him, that this is a sign of an impending apocalypse. Frank then informs Donnie that the end of the world will occur in twenty-eight days and during that time; he must commit several acts of violence. This means vandalizing the school, defacing private property, and burning down the house of a local self-help guru. This is a remarkable piece of artwork right here. So many elements of science fiction that were thought to have died in the eighties are brilliantly brought back to life here. Jake Gyllenhaal, who has done some pretty amazing things in his past, is excellent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. First time director, Richard Kelly, makes a very impressive debut here as well. I really think that it is best to view 'Donnie Darko' with an open mind and it's best to be prepared for anything this movie is going to throw at you. Once you begin watching this film, you may not be able to take your eyes off it. 'Donnie Darko' succeeds largely because instead of suckering the viewer into thinking that this will be just another freaky science fiction flick, it instead pulls you into its own dark world. This explains the title of my review 'DRIFTING ON THE DARKSIDE' because when you watch this movie, you may start to slowly DRIFT into the DARKSIDE of your personality. Donnie Darko himself has a Darkside that is clearly present in every facial expression. His Darkside is his schizophrenic personality, which we see when he talks to Frank and goes on his 'missions'. When I saw this film for the second time, I kind of felt a strange euphoric feeling coming over me. No, I was not under the influence of any drugs when I watched this. It's really weird though. I don't normally get any kind of feelings when I watch movies, well maybe a few, but this one was the exception. It may have been because of all the topics being discussed in this film. All the stuff about time travel and the destinies that God sets for people are a lot for the mind to take in one blow. I mean if you really try to think about this movie, I mean really think about it; you are going to be in for a total mind trip.I really like the concept of time travel that this film presents us with. One of the concepts shown in the movie is the wormhole. These 'wormholes' as they're called, will open up right in front of a person without them even knowing it. When we first see these wormholes, it is almost as if they are leading that person to a destination. It seems to me that with the way the wormholes are formed on people that their destinations may never be reached.However, it does seem that if the wormholes do come to an end somewhere, that time will be when that person dies. Then there is the mystery surrounding the origin of Donnie's 'friend' Frank, the giant monster rabbit. ***SPOILER*** Although we quickly learn that Frank is imaginary, soon elements in the story begin to arise about the possibility that he may very much be real. This becomes most evident to us when Donnie is speaking to Frank in the movie theater (they're watching 'The Evil Dead'). Donnie then asks Frank to take off his stupid mask. Frank then tells Donnie to take off his stupid 'man' costume. It is now that we see what Frank looks like without the mask. What we see is not pleasant.The ending to 'Donnie Darko' may prove to be one of the most confusing and enigmatic conclusions to a film I've ever seen. I've seen this movie four times and I still don't fully understand the ending, but I'm starting to. All I know is, that you would have to really have paid attention to all the stuff about time travel to fully understand what happens in the end.",10,0,1,3 June 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'
","I have to say that I actually really enjoyed 2011's 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon,' much like I did its predecessors 'Transformers' (2007) and 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' (2009). Now I know I'll probably just catch hell for making that statement. But I don't care, it's my thoughts and that's all that matters to me.Like most 20-somethings today, I grew up watching the original 'Transformers' cartoons throughout my youth growing up in the early '90s. Those were really good times. I even collected a few of the Hasbro toys (which inspired the cartoon and big-budget live-action movies), but my admiration for 'Transformers' never really peaked because the channel that I used to watch the original series on removed the show from its early-morning line-up during the mid-90s and it didn't return to TV until just recently - like within the last four years when the first live-action movie was released.History lesson over...Like its two predecessors, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is loud, obnoxious, high destructive good fun. The first film is obviously the best by any standard, I'm partial to liking the second film only slightly more than that one, and this third entry probably has the most ridiculously over-the-top city-wide siege battle I've ever seen. (The film's last 40 minutes are basically one long action sequence; 20 years ago something of this magnitude would have been impossible because of the sheer scale of everything but because of CGI and bigger budgets, lengthy action sequences of this type are now commonplace in the movies today.)As you will recall (or in case you've been living under a rock and have no idea what a 'Transformer' is), the whole 'Transformers' mythology involves a centuries-old war between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their conflict from their home planet Cybertron to Earth where humans are soon brought into the fold along with them.'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' begins in 1961, when an Autobot spaceship carrying a secret from Transformer home planet Cybertron crash-lands on the moon. A little bit of revisionist history thus takes place in which it is revealed that the whole Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time was instigated to see who could reach the lunar crash site first and learn its secrets. (This is all set up in some pretty quick-step tempo that includes archival footage of President Richard Nixon and the 1969 moon landing integrated with scenes newly shot by over-indulgent, over-director Michael Bay.)We learn that this secret could also save mankind, or wipe us out.The Decepticons are back once again, led by their fearsome leader Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), and they once again resume their war with the heroic Autobots who are led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, the only voice actor from the original 'Transformers' TV series). Caught in the middle of it, are determined human players Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf, still continuing his likable Everyman thing), his new love interest Carly Spencer (newcomer and model Rosie Huntington-Whitely, now having thoroughly replaced Megan Fox), soldiers Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson), Agent Simmons (John Turturro) and his assistant Dutch (Alan Tudyk), and newcomers federal bureaucrat Agent Mearish (Frances McDormand) and Carly Spencer's hunky boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey).Everything culminates in an epic, highly destructive Earth-bound siege in Chicago between the Autobots and their human allies, and the evil Decepticons.I think Bay out-did himself on this picture with seeing how many things he can blow up and how many bullets can be fired. It's all utterly ridiculous, but the entire time I was more in awe of the amazing technical feats of it all. From the beginning of the 'Transformers' series of films, I've always been impressed by the level of attention paid to the littlest details of every scene.Every time a Transformer transforms, I've always been amazed by the sights and sounds of metal parts clanking, whirring, and reconfiguring into some robotic alien mass or robot disguised as heavy-duty machinery. I'm also awed by the amazing details of every explosion, every slain robot that gets torn apart limb from limb in battle, and just the overall attention to detail. It's a pure visual spectacle where you're just in awe of everything that's going on. If you hate Michael Bay, at least like his special effects.Whatever your feelings regarding Bay are, don't miss out on this one; you'll only regret seeing one of the most finely detailed action epics of the year.10/10",10,15,24,18 November 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," Happy Birthday, Mr. Ron Kovic...
","Oliver Stone's 1989 Oscar-Winning anti-war drama 'Born on the Fourth of July' is the quintessential film about the experiences of Vietnam War veterans returning home from their terms of service overseas in Southeast Asia. It's also about the loss of innocence that war took away from the United States of America, and also the loss of the hope and idealism that had existed in this country in the 1950s and early 1960s, and would be completely evaporated by the latter half of the decade. It's about veterans returning home to a country that was not the same as before they'd left. It's about the opposing sides fighting for control of America's future during times of great social and political unrest and unease.It's also a deeply personal story about a wounded veteran of that war, who, as a teenager, inspired by the inaugural presidential address given by then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy in January of 1961 ('Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country'), eagerly volunteers with the United States Marine Corps immediately upon graduation from high school and embarks on a tour of duty in Vietnam, is injured - becoming a paraplegic paralyzed from the mid-chest down - comes home, recovers in a decrepit veteran's hospital, reconnects with his family and community, and after a lengthy period of disenchantment and despair, becomes an out-spoken anti-war activist.'Born on the Fourth of July' is based on the real-life story of Ron Kovic, that wounded Vietnam War veteran who became a prominent anti-war demonstrator after his time in the war and a voice for disenchanted war veterans and peace activists everywhere; it's based on his best-selling 1976 autobiographical book of the same name. Kovic famously won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the film's screenplay (co-written with Oliver Stone, also a Vietnam vet himself), the latter of which was received 22 years later to the day that he was wounded in Vietnam. 'Born on the Fourth of July' could be considered a follow-up of sorts to Stone's earlier Best Picture Oscar-Winner 'Platoon' (1986); in fact, 'Born on the Fourth of July' was at one point pitched AS a sequel to 'Platoon.'And somewhere in there, too, 'Born on the Fourth of July' captures what is very easily the best performance of its young star, a then-27-year-old Tom Cruise, who was best-known at the time for several high-profile leading roles in big-budget Hollywood blockbusters from earlier in the decade, including 'Risky Business' (1983), 'The Color of Money' (1986), 'Cocktail' (1988), 'Rain Man' (1988) and of course his most famous movie up to that time, 1986's mega-hit 'Top Gun.' But these roles - even the previous year's Best Picture Oscar-Winner 'Rain Man' - had mainly focused on Cruise's 'all-American boy' good looks and inherent screen charm, and people (Stone and Kovic included) were initially very weary of whether or not he could truly carry a film like 'Born on the Fourth of July' - a film with some enormous dramatic weight and history attached to it.And Tom Cruise delivered - he got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and won a Golden Globe Award for the same category for his performance in the film. Both were richly deserved, and Cruise from then on would be considered a 'serious' actor who could move effortlessly between critically acclaimed dramatic ('serious') roles and large-scale big-budget Hollywood blockbusters.In many ways, Cruise was utterly perfect for the embittered Ron Kovic because it also allowed him to deconstruct his own popular image. (It has also been reported by some sources that one of the reasons Tom Cruise accepted the part was because he was acting on the advice of late film legend Paul Newman - his co-star from 'The Color of Money' - who had convinced him to take the part in order to counter the uber-jingoistic image of his performance in 'Top Gun.') He starts out as a young, handsome-looking, idealistic, high school athlete superstar and small-town hero (his hometown of Massapequa on Long Island, New York) - but by film's end and now confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life due to injuries sustained on the battlefield, he is a completely different person, angry, cynical, hot-tempered, embittered, and feeling betrayed by the country he loves so much and sacrificed his body and spirit for. That 'all-American boy' charm gets lost over the course of 'Born on the Fourth of July's' 145-minute running time, and we believe it.In short, it's the role that Tom Cruise was born to play.Oliver Stone, who also served in Vietnam, shaped a movie that captured the pain, agony, and overwhelming sense of betrayal that many wounded (psychologically, not just physically) Vietnam War veterans surely felt after coming home to a country that was now so radically different from the country that they had known before - and also seemed to have forgotten them, turned its back on them, or left them behind completely. Stone's opinions on the war are also well-known to both his critics and anyone who's followed his career over the decades - but his film is not propaganda and never goes off in the many wild directions that it very easily could have. It's simply a portrait of a wounded man who is stripped of his youthful idealism and cradle-born values by the trauma of war, and finds a new purpose for his life by speaking and acting out against war in order to prevent the creation of other wounded young men like himself.'Born on the Fourth of July' is a challenging and angry film. It is unflinching in its scenes of graphic battlefield combat - influenced by Stone's earlier 'Platoon,' no doubt - as well as an America that is changing, socially, morally and politically, as the hope, dreams, and values of a bygone era give way to the burning anger, cynicism, and uncertainty of a new one as the angry voices on all sides (know-nothing anti-war demonstrators, self-serving politicians, the neglected vets themselves, and everyday Americans) fight for control of America's destiny and soul. 'Born on the Fourth of a July' is a film that took 13 years to make - from the time of publication of Kovic's book in 1976 to the film's release in December of 1989 - and its love-labor is apparent every step of the way. The teaming of Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic was an inspired partnership borne of their shared experiences on the battlefields of Vietnam; in some ways, it is as much Stone's story as it Kovic's. We, as Americans, owe them a sincere and heartfelt thanks, and an apology for the hell that they were put through almost 50 years ago.Happy Birthday, Ron Kovic. We owe you our thanks.9/10",9,1,2,4 July 2019
The Social Network," 'You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies' - Tagline for 'The Social Network'
","OK, by now everyone on planet Earth has heard about the social networking phenomenon that is Facebook, launched in 2004 by co-founder Mark Zuckerberg in his dorm room at Harvard University. By now, no doubt we've read the stories about how it came to be and how Zuckerberg has since become one of the youngest (if not the youngest) billionaires in the world. What we haven't seen, is a movie that highly dramatizes Facebook's founding for entertainment and educational purposes. So here is 'The Social Network.'I have a Facebook account, let's just get that out there. Want to friend me? Send me an e-mail. How many people at IMDb don't have Facebook accounts? Come on, be honest; shoot me a private message and we'll talk about it. OK, back to the movie. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (working from Ben Mezrich's highly embellished novel 'The Accidental Billionaires') have created an outstanding film, a film that masterfully captures an era, and the revolutionary young tech genius behind it all, as well as the friends and colleagues he either intentionally or unintentionally alienated as a result of Facebook's mammoth, unprecedented success.The problem with movies that 'define a generation' (like 'Rebel without a Cause,' 'The Graduate,' 'American Graffitti,' 'The Breakfast Club,' etc.) is that they are very much products of that time. They capture what it was like at that time, in this case, the era of social networking. By that very fact alone, the picture will become dated some time down the line. 'The Social Network' will undoubtedly be added to that list, as well as many more. But it's still fun to live in the moment.It is suggested that in the film, which opens in 2003, Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) may have created 'FaceMash,' Facebook's early predecessor, because of a nasty break-up with his then-girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), to get girls, and elevate his status on campus. The online traffic from FaceMash crashes part of Harvard's server, and he is put on six-month academic probation as a result. Nonetheless, others are impressed. He is thus recruited by wealthy seniors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played by Armie Hammer and body-doubled by Josh Pence) and their business partner Divya Narenda (Max Minghella) to help create a social networking website for them as their programmer.Now this is where things start to get sketchy. This inspires Zuckerberg to start his own social networking website called 'Thefacebook' which will be exclusive to Harvard University students. Using the financing of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and recruiting roommates Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello) and Chris Hughes (Patrick Mapel), 'Thefacebook' is soon up & running, and has gone beyond Harvard's borders to many other prestigious college campuses around the U.S. and quickly, around the world.This doesn't impress the Winklevoss's and Narenda, who soon cry foul and allege that Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social networking website. Another wrinkle in the scheme of things is file-sharing website Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), whose shady personal and professional exploits are well-known to anyone old enough to remember Napster (I certainly do!). He has soon worked his way into Zuckerberg and Saverin's inner-circle and is now giving them financial and marketing advice (and he eventually became Facebook's first president), which doesn't sit well with Eduardo since he views Parker as a threat - both to Facebook and his friendship with Zuckerberg. Intertwined with their rising success, is what happened afterward, with Zuckerberg giving depositions in two different lawsuits: one with the Winklevosses and the other with Eduardo.The rest is history.'The Social Network' is a phenomenal film, a film that perfectly captures an era; thus my earlier assertion that it's a period piece that 'defined a generation,' the Facebook generation. Also, even though Facebook's founding is a classic tale of unlikely success, as are most American success stories, 'The Social Network' is not a purely American film. No, it's a universal film. Hence, Facebook's appeal to people all over the world (online membership only recently surpassed the 600 million user mark), at least, to people in those countries that will allow online access to it.And not only that, Facebook has become a culture all on its own. You can't go anywhere online anymore without seeing a 'Like' button connected to Facebook, or a link offering you the choice of posting a web page to your Facebook 'Wall.' Or you can't be in a college classroom (or high school classroom, for that matter), without watching others - or doing so yourself - logging into their Facebook accounts updating their statuses with witty lines like, 'In class, so bored!' or 'I'd rather be stabbing myself in the eyeballs with a pair of rusty scissors than listen to his/her nagging voice go on and on!' Facebook is also highly addictive. It's almost like a drug. Perhaps when you're first starting out, you just can't get enough of it. You're on it all day/night.If anything, the success of 'The Social Network' with both critics and at the box office (and more recently, the Golden Globes) has brought in more users who just want to see what all the hoopla is about. The film might as well have been a two-hour advertising campaign in that regard. Having been a Facebook user for three-and-a-half years now, I can see that this movie was an event movie in the making, and an event movie that lived up to the event it depicted and perfectly captured a slice of an era. You can say all you want about Zuckerberg and his back-room dealings in getting Facebook started (I just don't know the guy), but you can't deny its impact and this film's deserved success in showcasing a modern phenomenon that's likely to continue for a very long time. Facebook is Zuckerberg's baby and like any newborn, it's still just in its infancy.10/10",10,1,2,17 January 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The greatest 'Indiana Jones' sequel
","I've always personally considered Steven Spielberg's 1989 blockbuster 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' to be the greatest sequel in the 'Indiana Jones' series of films. It has the greatest charm, action sequences, special effects, and story of all the entries in the four-film series, after the first movie 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981). In this third entry, two-fisted globe-trotting archaeologist and adventure Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is once again racing against the Nazis for possession of an ancient religious artifact; this time it's the Holy Grail. And Jones is also bringing along his father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery). Like its predecessor, the film's strength lies in its action sequences and charm, but there's also a much stronger emphasis on characterization, provided largely by the great interactions between co-stars Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Spielberg's movies have always had a theme on the shaky relationships between fathers and their children, and this film plays on the strained relationship between Indiana Jones and his cantankerous father Henry Sr. It's a great dynamic that fuels the best and most impressive action sequences during 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.'10/10",10,2,3,7 March 2012
Back to the Future," My favorite movie from 1985
","Why is 'Back to the Future' my favorite movie from 1985? Because that was the year I was born! I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including 'Forrest Gump' (1994) and 'Cast Away' (2000). But his best will always be 'Back to the Future,' at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. 'Back to the Future' remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the future with his fight against Parkinson's Disease.10/10",10,3,4,7 January 2007
Shark Tale," 'Shark Tale' is a 'fishy' tale, all right, but a worthwhile one
","I have to admit going into this review that I didn't at all have the slightest hopes of liking 'Shark Tale.' From the previews last fall, it reminded me a little too much of Pixar's 'Finding Nemo.' Not so, as I would later find out. 'Shark Tale' draws much of its inspirations, as noted by critic Roger Ebert, from 'Casablanca,' 'Jaws,' and 'The Godfather' - all movies that are considered to be modern American classics.'Shark Tale' plays out like an amalgam of all three classic films, and has a plot that shares uncanny parallels to the current events debate about morality and homosexuality in America. The film is set in and around a coral reef that is controlled by a 'Godfather'-like mob family of great white sharks. Don Lino (Robert De Niro) is as ruthless as they come, and his two sons Frankie (Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black) both have their eyes set on controlling the family and the reef when Lino retires.The sharks, who run their business out of a spruced-up version of the sunken Titanic, have a reputation for routinely shaking down clients and otherwise being pretty hard on the reef, but Lenny doesn't have that killer instinct in him - he's a vegetarian - and at dinner one night, he sets a shrimp free. This comes as a shock for Don Lino, as Lenny's behavior suddenly becomes a huge embarrassment for him.On the reef, a hustling fish named Oscar (Will Smith) is aspiring to rise out of his lowly existence working at a whale wash. He's thought up a number of schemes in the past that have all failed and his closest friend is his boss's secretary Angie (Renee Zellweger), who also has a crush on him.Things become complicated for all the characters when Frankie is accidentally killed by a fisherman's anchor being dropped on his head while he was trying to convince Lenny to be a killer shark by feasting on Oscar, who's indebted to Don Lino for a failed horse-betting scheme. Oscar, who bore witness to the whole incident, seizes the opportunity and using his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) as a shameless fight promoter, becomes a hero around the reef as a shark slayer, and Lenny is forced to go into hiding as a result.'Shark Tale' is entertaining to say the least, with enough in-jokes and gags to certainly reel in unsuspecting viewers. Even though this is a children's film, there is a lot of thematic material that is just too serious to not go at all unnoticed.The animation is beautiful (though not as good as anything done by Pixar in the last 10 years) and it really gives the deep blue that admirable quality. The voice-acting is pretty impressive too, with all of the actors doing their best, including Angelina Jolie as the gold-digging Lola.7/10",7,26,43,11 March 2005
Hustle & Flow," Player's Ball
","I guess the old saying 'Every dog has its day' is true but also perhaps no more in a way than it can be applied to Southern hustlers and pimps. 'Hustle & Flow,' written and directed by Craig Brewer, is a movie about that one shot. It's about how everybody's got a dream, and they only get one chance to grasp it and hold on to it.From the outset, this could have been a laughable, if not completely stereotypical 'gangsta hustla' flick about aimless Memphis layabouts who attempt to brighten their dim outlook on life through hip-hop. In all respects, from the advertisements on television, that's what it appears to be but when you actually see the movie in action, a whole new dimension is revealed.'Hustle & Flow' flows through its story the same way most 'dream' movies do but somewhere in there, we get a genuine feel for the characters and their motivations, and an especially profound performance from lead actor Terrence Dashon Howard as DJay, a Southern hustler who suddenly finds himself writing rhymes almost every minute of the day.As I write this, I'm still humming the words in my head ('Whoop that trick! Whoop that trick!'). Of course with those words, come sounds and with the sounds come images, powerful ones. The makings of a truly good rap song, in my view, originate in deep meaningful words that are written from the heart, and that's how DJay's lyrics flow. (I'm aware his lyrics are hardly inspiring, but you get the idea.)As the Southern hustler/pimp in a mid-life crisis, the mode is turned on for DJay when a junkie sells him one of those old Casio electronic keyboards. He toys around with it for a little bit, as he remembers that he had one himself when he was little boy but soon a light switches on, and DJay is tossing around lyrics like a football.He presents his ideas to an old high school buddy, Clyde a.k.a. 'Key' (Anthony Anderson, in a nice turn-around role from his usual comedic antics), who currently records demos for his church. When DJay first pitches his plan to him, Key is discreet, 'A lot of people talk the talk, but don't walk the walk,' as he at first believes he's not serious. Key's wife Yevette (Elise Neal) isn't especially happy by this sudden turn of events for her husband but he's profoundly touched, as is DJay, by the sound, and the two are quickly chanting 'Whoop that trick!' like it's the Gospels, but Yevette is at least supportive enough to remind them that even they have to eat dinner.Meanwhile, DJay must also contend with the worrisome troubles of his current reality, from live-in stripper Lexus (Paula Jai Parker) and her baby son, both of whom he eventually throws out of the house, to his pregnant ('ho, or main girlfriend? I'm not sure) Shug (Taraji P. Henson), who eventually sings the chorus of his demo, and Nola (Taryn Manning), who also aspires to do something else with her life. Together, with Clyde and white boy disc jockey Shelby (DJ Qualls), everybody, in a fashion much like a family, begin recording demos left and right with a makeshift studio in DJay's house.'Hustle & Flow' is pleasantly surprising in a way that a lot of black-themed movies aren't anymore. It has a genuine spirit that's carried on the shoulders of its lead performer, Terrence Dashon Howard, who speaks with that unique Southern hustler drawl and slang that makes his character all the more realistic and believable. He's simply brilliant in this role, as I've heard he's no stranger to music himself and his lyrics in this film seem so inspired you'd think he has a shot at a career as a rap star.What all of their hard work eventually culminates in, of course, is a chance meeting with a rapper from Memphis who managed to blow up and is featured prominently on television and such; his name is Skinny Black (real-life rapper Ludicrous), who DJay insists he attended school with. DJay sees the opportunity on July 4th to slide Skinny Black his demo tape and have him put the thing on the radio.'Hustle & Flow' ends on a note of deep profundity. Does DJay blow up and become the huge star he wants to be? I won't tell, but the movie ends in such a way you'd think it was true about people with dreams. Key says that life doesn't always pan out the way it should for some people, but that also, sometimes, it does. The thing about it is, he's right.Note: As a fan of rap, it is true what Shelby says about how much of popular music arose from or originated in the South (in addition to a lot of good rappers), from Arrested Development, to Outkast, to the Geto Boys, to Ludicrous himself (whom I'm no big fan of).Note #2: Yes, I'm aware that 'Ludicrous' is typed correctly; it gets auto-corrected by IMDb for some reason so please just ignore the spelling.8/10",8,1,2,22 July 2005
Princess Mononoke," 'Princess Mononoke' - Wondrous, Magical, Mystical Storytelling
","'Princess Mononoke' is Japanese animation at its peak. It's full of dazzling visual delights, kinetic action, magic, mysticism, epic-level storytelling, and it is frankly quite difficult to not get swept up in it all. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, it scared me, and it moved me and it touched me, deeply. This is one of the most thematically deep and touching animated pictures I've ever seen. Lastly, it's also one of the most violent.Now I don't mean 'Princess Mononoke' is violent in the same sense most Anime' is. This is not a 134-minute gorefest; it's 'PG-13,' for crying out loud! But yes, people do get impaled, shot with arrows and bullets, forest animals transmute into swirling masses of life-sucking snakes and the blood does flow, but it is all done in a fashion that drives home the point of man's eternal conflict with nature.It helps to realize that Japanese animation is a lot more complex and daring than American animation cinema. The Japanese animators put forth enormous effort and strive for absolute perfection in their cinema, which places it on a level that will never be reached here in the United States.With that said, director Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the most revered animators not just in Japan, but in the whole world, personally saw to it that 'Princess Mononoke' made a successful transition from the drawing board, to the big screen, and finally to Japanese and American audiences. And in relaying 'Princess Mononoke's' epic vision of man's conflict with nature to American audiences, comic book artist Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and a fine cast of talented actors were brought in to voice the characters. Of course I'm talking about Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, Keith David, and Billy Bob Thornton.Set in medieval Japan, the film opens (after a lengthy narration by David) at a small village that's fallen under attack from a mysterious creature that emerged from the dense forest outside its borders. The daring and heroic Ashitaka (Crudup) takes on the animal, a giant boar amassed by hideous snake-like creatures. It's defeated but in doing so, however, Ashitaka is wounded - his right arm badly scarred.The wise woman in his village reveals to him that he's fallen under a curse as a result of his battle with the boar. The boar, which was once a forest god, had been transformed into a demon as the result of being wounded by an iron bullet found in its skeletal remains; the bullet then drove the boar mad, sending it on a killing spree throughout the forest. And because he had fallen to the creature's curse, Ashitaka is forced to cut his top-knot and leave the village forever. His journey: to venture to a far off place in an attempt to find a cure for his curse.Accompanied by his loyal elk-like steed Yakkuru, he goes off. He stumbles onto Iron Town, a mostly female-run colony that serves as an iron processing station, and it's run by Lady Eboshi (Driver), who has a sort of trustful mother-like relationship with the women workers (many of whom are mostly former prostitutes) and an uneasy alliance with the male workers.Lady Eboshi is a strong and determined female, the likes of which is rarely seen in Japanese animation. She has surrounded herself with loyal workers that she treats with the utmost respect, and she commands enormous respect too. I really like Miyazaki's treatment of her character, and a great amount of admiration can also be laid upon one of her most trusted women - Toki (Smith).But Lady Eboshi is at war with the forest gods, in particular the wolf clan (which is headed by Moro - voiced by Anderson - and her adopted human daughter San - voiced by Danes) and the boar gods roaming outside the colony's gates. Her iron works is destroying the forest and the gods living there are angry. Lady Eboshi thinks it will all end if she is able to capture the head of the Forest Spirit, the spectral entity rumored to control all life in the woods where most of this conflict is taking place, and she aims to do it with the help of a lowly hunter named Jigo (Thornton), whom Ashitaka had encountered earlier on his journey to the colony.'Princess Mononoke' is a wondrous achievement in animation. It's breathtaking, with an amazing story about the rise of technology, man's embracing of it, and the war it surely enough started with nature. 'Princess Mononoke' carries the same weighted messages you might find at any ecological protest here in the U.S. but it's done in such an even-handed and fantastical fashion that you can't help but be taken in.The animation is flawless, as I read Miyazaki personally redrew over 20,000 cells. The voice actors do a tremendous job of translating Miyazaki's words and relaying it to us for consumption and comprehension. I first saw this film back during the summer of 2001 and I easily remember the feelings I had when I viewed it. It was one of the most stunningly realized animated pieces I'd ever seen, as it made me understand the true power of animation, in any form.It's one of my top favorite Anime' films, as Miyazaki would surpass it in 2002 with his superior epic 'Spirited Away,' which rightfully earned the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Hayao Miyazaki is currently one of the greatest animators, as he has made one of the most beloved Anime' films of all time. It's my thoughtful prediction that one day he'll make a superior animation piece that could be the one to top them all off...10/10",10,2,4,12 August 2005
Beetlejuice," Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice! My number 8 movie.
","I always used to love those three magical words growing up. I've watched Tim Burton's best pre-'Batman' film over 100 times since I was a kid. I was only three years old when 'Beetlejuice' hit the theaters back in 1988 and though I didn't see it then, it has had a remarkable effect on me. No, I'm not morbid or 'strange and unusual', I just view it as one of the best movies I have ever seen. The special effects and make-up, though seriously dated by today's standards are still amazing. The acting is intentionally campy from what I can see. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are pretty convincing as the recently deceased couple forced to call upon the 'Ghost with the Most' (Michael Keaton) to deal with the obnoxious family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and a very good Winona Ryder) that has moved into their home. So what is so great about it? First off, MICHAEL KEATON!!! This is the movie that introduced me to one of the most gifted comic actors of our time.I would be blown away again by his second collaboration with Tim Burton a year later in 'Batman'. He is off the wall in this movie. You can hardly tell that it's him underneath that ghastly make-up, but only his voice gives him away. Second, Tim Burton. To me, 'Beetlejuice' is Burton's first great film and unlike many of his following efforts, really has that dark humor thing going. I mean, I love Tim Burton movies and I've seen all of them ('Planet of the Apes', being his only 'bad' movie). I consider Burton's films 'Beetlejuice', 'Batman' and 'Edward Scissorhands' to be his three greatest by far. 'Beetlejuice' is Burton's first outing, 'Batman' made him big, and he took a shot at critical-respectability with 'Edward Scissorhands'.Winona Ryder. My how she has grown up since this movie. Not caring too much about her recent legal troubles, I think she is one of the most underrated actresses today. I loved her character, Lydia in this movie. It's strange how her fascination with death suddenly rings home after she gets to know the Maitlands a little bit. 'Beetlejuice' is one of my favorite movies of all time and I love it.10/10",10,1,2,16 July 2003
The Simpsons Movie," 'The Simpsons Movie' - An event 20 years in the making
","For those accustomed to watching it on the small screen every weekday night, 'The Simpsons Movie' is a long time coming, a motion picture event that's 20 years in the making. I've been watching 'The Simpsons' ever since I was a kid growing up during the early 1990s, and I myself have waited for something of this magnitude. The creation of series originator Matt Groening, people who have seen the 400+ episodes of 'The Simpsons' know that a movie has been on the table for over a decade, but nothing has ever manifested itself. So, fans just had to revel in one episode after the other, knowing, that one day, their dream of a 'Simpsons Movie' would become a reality. And now here we are, 20 years after the cartoon first appeared as a short on 'The Tracey Ullman Show' way back in 1987. Groening definitely had a hand in this production, otherwise 'The Simpsons Movie' would have sucked big time. Unlike other theatrical adaptations of a television work, nothing has really changed, except that there's a bigger budget, better animation, but the characters are all the same. That makes for great animated cinematic entertainment. It's just nice to finally see a creator in control of his creation for once. Director David Silverman's 'The Simpsons Movie' finds America's favorite dysfunctional family the target of a lynch mob after Homer buys a pig, and he disposes of its waste in Springfield Lake, turning the already-heavily polluted lake into a toxic cesspool that causes multiple eyes to sprout on any wildlife that comes into contact with it. To make long stories short, the EPA comes in and seals off Springfield with a massive dome. When it's discovered that Homer is responsible for the Lake Springfield toxic cesspool, he, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are forced to go on the run to Alaska and start over (don't ask how they get out, just watch the movie). EPA man Cargill (voice of Albert Brooks) manages to fool President Schwarzenegger into launching an operation to nuke Springfield so that it becomes a tourist attraction similar to the Grand Canyon, since nothing will be left except for a smoking hole in the ground (actor Tom Hanks does an infomercial on the subject). Marge eventually discovers this and decides to head back to their hometown, sans Homer. Eventually, Homer gets the guts to return as well and save Springfield with his family. I literally could not stop laughing at 'The Simpsons Movie.' It gets you from the opening scenes (complete with a performance by Green Day) to the time the credits begin to roll. You'll be laughing so hard that you'll be barely able to catch your breath. I know I was laughing so hard that after a while I became tired and it got so that when something funny happened (and those comedic moments come at you left and right), it was strenuous to do so. That's an effect of a truly unique film experience. All of our favorite characters are here, some get more screen time than others (the film's only real weak point), but if that makes you mad, just watch the television show but still, don't hold that against the movie. I could tell that 'The Simpsons Movie' definitely satisfied the cravings of my fellow cinema-goers, since their response to the movie was overwhelmingly positive. 'The Simpsons Movie' is a simple culmination of 20 years worth of entertainment in 87 minutes. A cultural phenomenon has finally reached its peak and its core fans were overwhelmingly satisfied with a film experience they're not likely to ever forget.10/10",10,4,10,28 July 2007
Alien: Covenant," 'Prometheus,' it's not, but perhaps third time will be the charm?
","2017's 'Alien: Covenant' is my most anticipated movie of this year, so far. My expectations were high for this picture, and while I feel that I was somewhat disappointed, that may have more to do with the fact that I was expecting something totally different from what I had been lead to believe what the film was about.I hope that makes sense.I was not on the bandwagon of 'haters' for 'Prometheus' (2012), a film I liked, though I realize it was not without its problems and gaps in logic. Most disappointing of all, I guess, was that I wanted it to be a more definitive connection to the film it claimed to be a prequel for - Ridley Scott's infamous 1979 landmark sci-fi/horror flick 'Alien.''Alien: Covenant,' which was also directed by Ridley Scott - making him the only person to direct more than one 'Alien' film - is a better film than 'Prometheus,' if only slightly. I attribute this to the fact that 'Alien: Covenant' does contain a stronger connection to 'Alien,' but has a very open ending and still leaves some questions unanswered by the time the credits begin to roll.I'll avoid going into the plot, since the previews will more than likely provide a general idea of what's in store for prospective viewers. And while most of the extended cast members are nothing more than cannon-fodder for the grisly sci-fi/horror that's to come, three performers do stand out, one being Katherine Waterston as Daniels, another being Billy Crudup as Captain Oram, and Danny McBride as pilot Tennessee.Katherine Waterston becomes the strong female lead that has become so characteristic of this series. She's no Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, from the original 'Alien' film series), but Daniels holds her own. Early on, she experiences a horrific tragedy that's the result of a natural disaster in space, and she has to pick herself up afterward. And when she realizes the danger that they're in, she doesn't hesitate to lead her comrades to safety. Billy Crudup's uncertain Captain Oram has it much more difficult, being that he becomes the newly promoted captain of the Covenant spaceship through the same tragedy, and does his best to be a capable leader, which I thought was a nice touch. And Danny McBride, as Tennessee, was perhaps the most surprising of all. McBride, usually known for comedic fare, makes a surprising turn into science fiction with his role as the heroic pilot in 'Alien: Covenant.' If the audience is willing to cheer for anyone aside from Daniels, it's probably him.For me, the film really begins to pick up in its second half when the Covenant crew begins to see the danger that they're in. At this point, the film retreats to the frights that we've become so accustomed to when watching the 'Alien' series.'Alien: Covenant' wasn't a bad movie, as some of the reviews coming in here seem to be suggesting. As with any film of this sort, you need to watch it yourself, filter out all the external noise, and make up your own mind.8/10",8,55,106,19 May 2017
Dodgeball," 'Dodgeball' - A true underdog story?
","'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is hardly true in the sense that its plot line is based on an actual event or time in history. 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is only 'true' in that dodgeball is slowly rising to the top of the 'almost sports' world (presumably through the underground avenue of word-of-mouth) and what's more, a movie is made about dodgeball and it's directed by first-timer Rawson Marshall Thurber.My own experiences in gymnasium dodgeball were all short-lived in the annals of elementary school, as like most others surprised by the massive success of this picture last summer, dodgeball, or Extreme Dodgeball as it's called on sports channel ESPN, is close to earning a place in the most-watched sports arena on television. Whoa.But in the movie 'Dogdeball: A True Underdog Story,' hapless, borderline bankrupt Average Joe's Gym owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) comes up with a scheme to win $50,000 in order to save his fledgling business. Actually, he doesn't come up with the plan himself; one of his equally hapless, bizarr-o but loyal gym regulars reads about dodgeball in 'Obscure Sports Quarterly.'The catch is, they have all heard of and know how to play dodgeball, but they don't know how to play (play is italicized) dodgeball. As with any sport, officially sanctioned or not, there are rules and any advice that Peter and his cohorts come across is therefore invaluable if they are to get anywhere in the upcoming dodgeball tournaments being held in Las Vegas. And so with much pondering, a loose team is formed out of true societal misfits including a pirate, a wannabe cheerleader, and a guy who's never been on a date.One of them borrows a documentary sports video from 1938, and it features legendary titan of the game Patches O'Houlihan (played by Hank Azaria in the video, a wheelchair-bound Rip Torn in the present). Soon enough, Patches rolls into Average Joe's and shows these 'dogs how to play some dodgeball in some very effective if not totally kosher techniques. Peter realizes that lawyer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor), who has served him with the bank's foreclosure warnings and also gets wind of some of his lackadaisical business practices including letting his clients pay their own way, has a mutual disliking of White Goodman (a delightfully obnoxious, egomaniacal, and scene-chewing Ben Stiller), the owner of Globo Gym, and eventually asks her to join their team.Of course, she's at first reluctant but after White gets her fired from her job with the bank, she is left with little choice but to join at least in part to get revenge on White. White Goodman is another one of those deliciously manic, comic villains that Stiller specializes in, chewing up scenery nearly every second the camera's focused on him. He forms his own dodgeball team, the Purple Cobras (who all look like action movie rejects, even though one of them is from an obscure place in the former Soviet Union), and with the sports winnings, he aims to buy out Peter's gym and then demolish it (with them still in it) but they're obviously not going away without a fight.This is a movie that finally acknowledges its place as a wild, out-of-place, and self-referential sports comedy. No phony theatrics here, ladies and gentlemen, just a bunch of actors who know the material inside-out and look to make one hell of an entertaining picture. Vince Vaughn does his best to keep the plot on track with a cool game face and succeeds but Ben Stiller is a total maniac as White Goodman. Like the corporate fitness monster he played in 'Heavyweights' (1995), he's totally insane but goes a step further into playing a character who if it weren't for a shred of brains in that thick melon on top of his shoulders, would be a poster child for self-absorbed fitness gurus everywhere.Most entertaining are the actual dodgeball sequences, which eat up most of the film's second half. These are fast, brutal, and unflinching in showing various team members getting annihilated on the court with zingers to the face, to the crotch or any exposed area. It almost makes you want to sign up and form your own team and compete in Vegas.'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is an eager film from an equally ambitious team of filmmakers. It put a smile on my face, as any other sports film of similar theme would not have been able to do that. Sure it's silly, but the laughs are such that you won't be kicking yourself afterward for doing so.'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' - Don't dodge it. Oh, wait, catch it. Ahh, screw this, watch this movie, turn your brain off, and enjoy it.8/10",8,0,1,31 August 2005
Evil Dead II," More 'Evil' than the first; bloody fantastic!
","I didn't think it was possible, but 'Evil Dead II' surpasses the  original in nearly every way. It's scary, it's gory and lastly, it's  hilarious. It's pure, inspired comic mayhem and madness for 80  minutes straight! It's no secret director Sam Raimi loves to torment  star Bruce Campbell, putting him through the most grueling experience  an actor should ever go through. Essentially, it's a sequel/remake of  the first film, and Ash (Campbell) is once again battling the forces of  the dead, which have been resurrected by the reading of passages from  the dreaded 'Book of the Dead.' But unlike the first movie, the 'Three  Stooges'-type humor is rampant and outright, and it makes this entry  deserving. The funniest scene of all is Ash having to sever his  possessed hand, of course after it literally beat the living crap out  of him. Not to be missed.  10/10",10,13,17,27 September 2005
V for Vendetta," Killing In The Name of who? - 'V for Vendetta'
","For those familiar with former political rap-metal collective Rage Against the Machine, then you know that the song 'Killing In The Name' off of their self-titled 1992 debut is an anthem for those upset with our current state of affairs. More so, 'V for Vendetta' is a visual manifestation of Rage's innermost fears and rants, and, more accurately, the fears of those in power in our current administration. I'm listening to that song right now as I write this review and it's giving me the creative juices to express myself freely as my fingers reach for the keyboard.'V for Vendetta' is more spiritually akin to the liberal fears of the American conservative Right than it is the DC/Vertigo graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Moore created 'V for Vendetta' as a manifestation of his political paranoia over a sure-fire conservative victory in the 1982 General Elections of the United Kingdom. This big-budget adaptation, or, revision, is tailor-made for liberal Hollywood for their fears, doesn't take the courage to out-right condemn the powers-that-be, and instead just mirrors the climate without any kind of addressing whatsoever (reasons to which Moore has sought to disassociate himself from the picture).Most remember that code-name 'V' (Hugo Weaving) is a free-whelming anarchist instead of a violent freedom fighter. Weaving is acting his way out from behind a mask of Guy Fawkes - yes! - the same co-conspirator convicted and later executed in the foiled 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up both houses of Parliament in an attempt to assassinate King James I of England. Weaving's face is never actually seen, so he has to use his voice and mannerisms to define his character. He's exceptionally skilled with a pair knives, is expertly trained in the martial arts, likes reciting literature and poetry particularly 'Faust,' and using the letter 'V' in rhyme form and iambic pentameter. He also has a plan to blow up Parliament, just what his hero was unable to do.It's 2020 London; in Moore's novel it was 1997 (back in '82, 1997 WAS the future). Years have passed since a viral epidemic killed nearly 100,000 people. The United States is in a state of civil unrest and other political upheaval (geez, the filmmakers, despite their apparent lack of backbone in the political arena, really know how to stress a point of America and Britain's doomed authoritarian futures). And it looks like more war is on the horizon.The film gets underway when V saves the life of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from thugs. She's a civilian, a pale, sullen home-body who represents the ignorant Everywoman and is naturally unaware of her government's devious plans to subvert public opinion about a guy in a plastic mask who has it out for those in charge. The powers-that-be is a man who's straight out of a liberal's worst nightmare: a gay-hating, woman-bashing, right-wing Christian Hitler/Mussolini/Bush prototype named Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), Big Brother personified, and is never actually seen in person throughout the film but when he is seen, it is always from behind a video monitor.V has a plan to blow up Parliament on November 5, to mark the anniversary of Guy Fawkes Day, and sweet-thing Evey is going to bear witness over the next 12 months to the fireworks and celebrations. A cop named Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is on V's trail and as he digs deeper, finds himself questioning his own allegiance to his government. V is determined to live up to his vow to bring down that house. Is V a terrorist? Is he a hero? Has he found a kindred spirit in the newly enlightened Evey? Or, more terrifyingly, has he become the thing he has sworn to defeat?'V for Vendetta' was directed by James McTeigue, a protégé of the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry, who wrote the script and were the directors behind the insanely popular 'The Matrix' (1999) and its sequels. Those films too had similar plots of revolution and political retribution and heroes who were seemingly superhuman. But while they defied gravity, our V here defies clear-cut classification as some anti-hero archetype.The Wachowskis shy away the best they can from their works to give protégé McTeigue enough room to shine on his own. His film does have a rich visual style akin to what we saw in the 'Matrix,' though it lacks the technical skill and wonder of those films. I was able to sit through 'V for Vendetta' with a pretty open mind about its politics, (lack of) faithfulness to the source material, but something still didn't stick right with me. I don't know, maybe it's just because 'V for Vendetta' didn't stand up to my expectations as something groundbreaking or in-your-face about our current administration and its diabolical affairs. But that's just me.What I do like about 'V for Vendetta' is how it's still able to not represent any kind of clear-cut ideology or philosophy. It's not liberal-leaning nor is it really anti-conservative, despite my political musings. It stands on no moral high ground at all. It just shows us a guy in a Guy Fawkes mask trying to stop some really corrupt government types; V is one that DOES practice what he preaches. The film's ending will surely leave a sour taste in the mouths of many but one thing's for sure: never has the destruction of a famous landmark been a reason for celebrations, nor for sympathy.10/10",10,7,13,1 August 2006
Semi-Pro," 'Semi-Pro' is semi-entertaining to a fault
","Kent Alterman's 'Semi-Pro,' is a semi-true historical account of the Flint Tropics, from Flint, Michigan. The movie is actually quite funny. I watched it with my friend and his younger brother. I laughed, and so did they. And considering I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell, 'Semi-Pro' is much funnier than I thought it would be.Set in 1976, Ferrell is Jackie Moon, a flamboyant singer/songwriter whose hit song was enough of a success for him to become owner of the Flint Tropics and also become its star player. He's a motivational leader, if nothing else. Fan attendance has been on the decline for some time now, and the Tropics have yet to win a game.Things get worse for Jackie Moon when his corporate sponsors announce a merger with the NBA, which threatens the future of his Semi-Pro team. However, he manages to strike a deal that if his team finishes the end of the season within the top-four, the Tropics won't be disbanded and his players won't be forced to go back to meaningless, boring jobs in their ramshackle hometown. The team gets a leg-up when washed-up pro Ed Modix (Woody Harrelson) is traded to the team and eventually becomes the head coach.'Semi-Pro' is a funny movie, considering the talents of leading funny-man Will Ferrell. He manages to keep this project afloat, despite my initial doubts about his acting talents, but he works, giving his scenes with enough leadership and witty one-liners to be a truly leading funny-man. Another surprise was Andre Benjamin as Clarence, the team hot-shot. Most surprising about his performance was that rather than him being a ball-hog, instead he's a human being who is capable of recognizing his own faults and actually being a team player.'Semi-Pro' proved to be a solidly entertaining sports comedy, despite the fact I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell. I liked this movie. I think that because I saw the film in its unrated format, I got to see in all its comedic vulgarity. I guess that with the proper material, Ferrell is capable of being a lead performer and funny-man; he proved it with 'Stranger Than Fiction.' Ultimately, though, I think 'Semi-Pro' will be relegated to the usual comedic fodder that's coming out of Hollywood these days.7/10",7,0,0,19 May 2009
