The Blair Witch Project," (slightly) flawed masterpiece
","(Warning first paragraph may spoil - see the film before reading ANY reviews)OK so they should have followed the river downstream (note to film-makers - rivers sometimes go underground). But some of the criticisms thrown at this new-era defining movie are ridiculous. They didn't take a mobile phone - what into the deep woods where it wouldn't work? They didn't have a GPS system - 3 students in 1994? Surprise surprise, they didn't have a helicopter or Scotty's transporter either. They went south for 12 hours and ended up in a circle Â– it's difficult enough following a straight line in the dessert, let alone a wood.Suffice to say if you go expecting the likes of Freddie or Scream you will be disappointed, move on to the next multi-million dollar gore fest, predictable, safe and utterly tedious. This film leaks atmosphere, it enthralled the audience I was with - leading to a spontaneous round of applause at the end. Perhaps at first glance it does not sound or look that original, but the dialogue feels real (yes students do swear), the hi-8 footage draws the viewer into believing (or at least suspending disbelief), the never-quite seeing the horror leaves you questioning what is out there. This film is not about blood and guts or special effects; it is about a deep unease with the unknown, fear and ultimately, terror.",10,1,2,26 October 1999
