The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," WORST movie in a few years
","1. The pace is very slow. Literally nothing happen in the first 1.5 hour. 2. MockingJay is claimed to be 'unique and irreplaceable'. But she has absolutely no ability or leadership skills or braveness or what so ever. Basically a useless character in the movie. 3. No thrilling fighting except for a large group of people crying, shouting, or running for no reason. 4. MockingJay is supposed for fight for the whole district. But her action is solely based on her selfish emotion for her boyfriend. 5. Graphics and sound are mediocre. Absolutely the worst movie I have seen in the past few years.",1,26,37,7 February 2015
