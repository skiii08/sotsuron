The Blair Witch Project," UTTER TRIPE!
","I'm sorry, but, plain and simply, this is just not scary at all, in fact i couldn't believe the hype surrounding this junk.......i could have made better with my video camera, and my two dogs on the local westwood......all these people who say you only get out what you took into the film with you......RUBBISH...i like to be entertained, not bored.... 1/10",Null,1,2,14 August 2000
The Exorcist," my fave film.....EVER
","I love this film to bits, the acting, the script, everything is superb. Opinion is divided between my friends, some say it is not shocking at all, but the scene with the crucifix is quite disturbing even today. I can't really see why it affected people so much when it was released, but i still love watching this film, and while it does not live up to the hype {but what does}, it is still the greatest film ever made............10/10",Null,0,0,18 August 2000
Army of Darkness," Good fun, but not enough horror!
","I agree that this film is good entertaining fun, but i would have preferred the film to have been an 18 certificate, and shown some more gory bits like if the first evil dead, but it is still very enjoyable! 7/10",Null,0,2,17 August 2000
