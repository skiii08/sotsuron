Skyfall," I Just loved the constant references to previous Bond Films
","To start, I Just loved the constant references to previous Bond Films. I found it a gripping dirty thriller with great character arcs. Skyfall doesn't have the invention and the pure Terrifiedness your are feeling for bonds life like Casino Royale has, but i must say it is a great ride and entertaining all the way through. So while it was a very good Bond film, I don't think it deserves it's billing as 'the best Bond film ever' as it has a few too many flaws for that. It's not even Craig's best Bond outing as the superb Casino Royale still takes that honour but it is infinitely better than Quantum Of Solace, it's just a shame that they couldn't stick to their convictions about taking Bond in that new direction they had done with that gritty Bourne feel running through. Lets hope we have that back in the new one.",8,1,8,11 December 2012
Django Unchained," Probably my favourite QT film since Pulp Fiction
","Probably my favourite QT film since Pulp Fiction. To start with the minutes/film flew by. Surprised at any critical comments about the length. What a script and direction from one of the masters of Film Making. QT for me captured what a terrible time in history it was and to live in. Yes there were plenty of light moments but underneath there was a story which QT told fantastic. The stellar cast what was put together, was perfect, but would have been great to have seen Will Smith as Django. Again i think this was Jamie Foxx's best performance since Ray. Along with another great performance from Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz, the sly and eccentric bounty hunter posing as a dentist, Just faultless performance again from him. Samuel L. Jackson as the scene-stealing house slave who is foul-mouthed and scary, while every line of his is comically disturbing. If there is any snobbery that should be directed towards the Oscars, is that there is no nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio for his extraordinary performance as Calvin Candie who is truly terrifying and unlike any role DiCaprio has explored before. There was that dodgy Australian who gets blown up towards the end! LOL QT.",10,1,3,29 January 2013
