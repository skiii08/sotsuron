The Blair Witch Project," That's it???
","Watching a film is like taking a journey, and the primary thing that makes a film journey worth taking is the quality of the destination the viewer inevitably reaches.  In this movie, I found the 'destination' to be a profound disappointment.  Much of the movie is very effective in conveying the sense of dread it is meant to achieve.  However, the ultimate feeling is that the film is nothing but a big tease--a promise of delicious thrills that are actually never delivered.  In fact, if you watch this movie in a crowded theater, expect to hear murmurs of 'That's it???' as the credits start to roll.",Null,1,3,20 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," worthwhile in spite of flaws
","This film is an engrossing character study, filled with rich visuals but undermined by an often-lethargic pace.  Kubrick is prone to let his actors pause to 'act' between lines, and that becomes tedious very quickly, stretching out his scenes to tiresome lengths.  Kidman's interminable monologue in which she describes her dream about the Naval officer is a perfect example.  Still, I was definitely empathetic toward Cruise's character and his struggle between fidelity and sexual gratification.  It was fascinating to see him repeatedly drawn toward the abyss of sexual decadence.  If you like intelligent movies with sophisticated thought behind them, you'll probably enjoy this movie in spite of its flaws.",Null,0,0,20 July 1999
The Iron Giant," Visual style: 10......Story: 3
","One of the many rave reviews posted on this website contains the comment: 'I could watch the film time and again just for the animation.'  In my opinion, it is the beautiful visual style ALONE that makes this film work and makes it enjoyable.  Had the animation and design been as bland and pedestrian as the recently released 'The King and I', few movie-goers would be as fond of the film.  In fact, I think it would be a bomb.The characters are certainly likeable, but too one-dimensional to rise above being mere character 'types'.  We learn virtually nothing about them, other than what they are up to in the present moment.  It's as if they have no existence, no thoughts, no life at all other than what we happen to be seeing up there on the screen.  There is no depth to them that would suggest that their lives and their world extends beyond the edge of the frame.There's the precocious boy (Hogarth) that knows more than the grown-ups, the flustered but loving Mom who tries to understand her mischievous son, the friendly adult (Dean) who's really young at heart and serves as an ally to the boy, and on and on.  And how convenient that Hogarth lives on a farm where there's a big barn, suitable for storing a large robot.  How convenient that Dean works in an iron-filled junk yard and makes art out of iron--choices that come in very handy when one has a large iron robot to contend with.What I'm objecting to in this film is what I see as a lack of fresh ideas in the story and the script.  Clever, original thought has been sacrificed (as it usually is) for the same old cliches.  As a result, there were almost no surprises in this film.  Young people who aren't as familiar with the cliches will have a ball, I'm sure.  And adults who enjoy re-visiting the cliches that are comfortably familiar will love it, too.  But for those who want to be impressed with new perspectives, or delighted with clever surprises and unexpected turns in the story, this film will not satisfy.",Null,0,0,11 August 1999
