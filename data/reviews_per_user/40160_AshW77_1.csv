The Sound of Music," A fantastic family film for everyone of all ages.
","The Sound of Music holds a lot of childhood memories for me! My Gran was the films biggest fan and i have carried on her loyalty for this film for over a decade after her death. It is a film that will make you smile, laugh and shed a tear when you least expect it!! Julie Andrews is 'practically perfect' as Maria, as is the rest of the cast who compliment each other in such a magical and enchanting way. This film deserves no less than 10/10 and i thank the Sound of Music for many years of enjoyment and the memories it brings back to me of my wonderful Gran. The Sound of music should be watched by everyone at least once in their lifetime to appreciate the brilliance of the storyline and the cast.",10,3,10,10 August 2006
