Mission: Impossible III," Best of the 3
","Its not big and its not clever, but if you liked the first two you'll love this one. Its got more action than the other two more than adequately action packed offerings put together, it'll have you glued to the edge of your seat from start to finish. The story line and acting is not going to win anyone an Oscar but thats not why your watching the film! Its the sort of film that the lads will love and although they wont admit it the missus will too. I can only hope MI4 tops this one and with the possibility of Brad Pitt as Ethan Hawke's replacement maybe we'll get something extra special with a 'Fight Club' kinda twist!. All I can say is bring on MI4 and 5 and maybe even 6!",8,2,3,9 December 2006
