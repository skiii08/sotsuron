Ali," 2 1/2 hours of clips
","This movie entailed 100+ snippets and clips supposedly to be tied together with the sound track.  When you yearned for more information you were given little,  when you wanted the clip to end, it roamed on forever.  There was no character development, no story line to follow.  When Malcolm X died I felt no emotion,  the same when Ali would toss aside one wife for another, I didn't care. The upside that prevented me from demanding my money back was that Will Smith was terrific and Jamie Foxx was surprisingly remarkable. Both would have done better to have performed their roles in a coherent movie about Ali.",2,0,1,5 January 2002
