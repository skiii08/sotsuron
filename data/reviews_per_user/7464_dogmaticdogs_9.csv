First Man," Worth Seeing
","Ryan Gosling did a great job playing the stoic Neil Armstrong. Solid as a rock and never cracking under pressure. So many of our heroes seem to be absent from their family's lives, and Neil is portrayed as being no exception. A man that would give his life for his Country, but feels uncomfortable exhibiting emotion. I only wish the movie did a better job explaining what drove him to pursue this mission. To me that is the most fascinating piece of this puzzle. As usual, you give Ryan a person to imitate and he hits it dead on. The only thing missing from an Oscar winning performance was some psychological depth and darkness. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it. By the way, I also have to give credit to his wife Claire Foye. She was able to brilliantly display her emotions without using words.",8,3,10,13 October 2018
Requiem for a Dream," Perfection
","I watch a lot of movies, and this is definitely one of the top 10 movies ever made in my opinion. It is not easy to watch, and not a feel good movie. It will get under your skin, and make you think for days. Nothing is predictable or derivative. Rather, it is just mind blowing creativity. I watch most movies and can think of at least 10 ways they could have been better. When I watched this one, I realized this guy was a master, there was nothing I could have done to improve this. It was very humbling in that regard. It really takes you deep into the mind of an addict in a manner that changed film making for eternity. Standing ovations for this one. Be ready for a jarring emotional impact. It may be more than some can handle.",10,1,1,8 September 2018
A Star Is Born," Incredible Movie
","Gaga always puts in a world-class performance and this is no exception. The movie is a bit long and depressing, but the acting is phenomenal. She sings and gets Grammy after Grammy. She stars in her first major tv role and wins a Golden Globe, and now stars in her first major film and deserves an Oscar. Even if you don't enjoy her style, you cant deny she is iconic and helped define an entire generation. She is the rightful queen of sound and stage. She is also very bright, sincere and caring, and doesn't let anyone stand in her way. Such an amazing person and inspiration.",10,7,16,6 October 2018
Wind River," Perhaps the Best Movie of 2017
","This was hands down the best movie for the general public of 2017, as everyone I know could enjoy it without being offended or bored. I personally enjoyed Killing of a Sacred Deer a bit more, but that is an indie movie that was designed for the art house niche crowd. This was a story of brutality, isolation, survival and revenge of the highest caliber that everyone can relate to, and wouldn't turn anyone off. The cinematography is mind blowing and beautiful, yet also eerie and cold. It is essentially a modern old school western done to modern day perfection.",10,0,3,2 September 2018
"I, Tonya"," Give That Mom an Oscar
","The true story behind this movie was fairly and respectfully depicted. There was no judgment, only respect for the differences between people and the situations into which they were born and raised. The actress that played Tonya did a decent job. The woman that portrayed her mother, however, WOW. She did a mind-blowing job.",8,0,0,2 September 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Blew Away my Expectations
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but was blown away. It was timely, relevant, clever and witty. The characters were clearly one dimensional in that it was black and white as to who was good and who was bad, without any grey areas, but that's what Spike Lee does. It's satire people. This deserves to win many awards. The acting was sublime.",9,17,34,2 September 2018
Get Out," Extremely Disappointing
","Am I the only liberal intellectual that hated this movie? It seems Hollywood and the critics supported it only because the director was a connected minority and they were scared to tell anyone how bad it was out of fear of retaliation or being shunned by certain communities or social circles. Much like an 'artist' that draws a circle and tries to pass it off as brilliant modern art after giving it a two hour explanation of how it represents the internal struggle between good and evil, it was all hype without any substance. It was not clever, witty or enlightened. Rather, it was just a bunch of mindless clich√©s lumped together trying to pass for social commentary. I would have expected more from a first year film student. I found it rather painful to sit through, and insulting to all minorities and anyone that paid to see this movie. The emperor has no clothes. None. Zilch. Nada. It fails miserably in terms of both comedy and horror, as it did neither well. The only interesting thing about this film is all of the people that pretended to like it. Your gut was right, you should have walked out and saved a few brain cells. The title of this movie is a warning to all theater goers. GET OUT now while you still have time to salvage your day.",3,19,30,2 September 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Heartwarming and Sweet
","I loved this film. The story was complex, wonderful and sweet, and the scenery and cinematography was top notch. It definitely makes you think. Timothee Chalamet was brilliant and deserves every award he gets for his awe inspiring work. Although Armie Hammer tried hard, he wasn't nearly as good. He seemed like a straight guy trying really hard to pretend to be gay, which was kind of off-putting. I would hate to think they used any non-gay people to play gay roles. Could you imagine if they did that in movies for other minorities, and wanted to be taken seriously? That is the only reason this did not get a perfect 10.",9,1,2,2 September 2018
Midsommar," Ambitious Nightmare Examining the Male and Female Relationship Power Struggle
","I can't believe all the bad reviews, especially those relating to substance or lack thereof. It seems like many missed the point or didn't know what to expect going into the movie.This is not a horror movie (at least not in the typical sense like Hereditary was, and which I thought was easily the best horror movie of 2018 and is by the same director) although it certainly is horrific. Rather, it is an acid-trip nightmare born from the anxiety arising from the contemplation of a life-long commitment to a mate and starting a family, and familial pressure regarding the same. Much like Rosemary's Baby was a play on female anxiety arising from one's first pregnancy, this is a journey through the cycles of human life with special emphasis on fear of commitment and what it means for one's individual identity.The woman is portrayed as having a lot of family baggage and worried that her chosen partner's friends will not accept her, that he may be cheating on her, that her friends cannot be trusted, and that she will give up all power by continuing the relationship. Consumed with beauty and dreams of idyllic happiness replacing the chaos that is her current life. I should note that these traits are not always exhibited directly through her eyes or mouth but through the lens of her trip.The man is portrayed as doing his best to do the right thing but still wanting the respect of his buddies, tempted by seducers, and surrounded by women that want to lock him down. One friend, a horny but hopeless geek always getting into trouble. The other, a rival.The director doesn't pick a side (i.e., the female perspective v. the male perspective), but rather tries to show both sides fairly (including flaws) at the same time. You will have to watch the movie yourself to see who wins this power struggle for dominance and who is subsumed by the other.Don't go in expecting a simple-minded horror movie, go in expecting to see a brilliant manifestation of the complex emotions many women and men go through when finding a mate and trying to decide whether to commit. This movie will be too raw, graphic, violent and ethereal for many, but if you don't mind that sort of thing, what a truly brilliant piece of art this is. The visuals are absolutely stunning.",9,38,85,4 July 2019
