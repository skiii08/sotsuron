The Blair Witch Project," This is a Scary Film !
","I cannot believe all of the brave souls in here that are so quick to denounce this film and pretend that it was not scary. My guess is that most watched it at home with the lights on and a couple of their friends near by. This is a scary and innovative movie. What makes it scary is that it is different from 99% of other horror movies. In most standard horror movies you have a Freddy or Jason to embody terror or evil. You see Michael Myers an you know he is evil and supposed to be scary. However, real terror is terror you cannot see and that is what is so brilliant about this film. The Blair Witch is a mystery and she leaves our imagination to decide so much. I am a creative person with quite the imagination. If you are a lethargic teenager who shut the mind off years ago, you are not going to like this. Because you have no imagination to draw from. However, if you are a reader or someone that likes to fantasize, this will scare the hell out of you!",10,2,3,12 July 2004
Mississippi Burning," A Movie Classic
","I know that many historians have been critical of this film. They point to the fact that this was not a factual re-telling of the actual incident. Man, they don't get it. This was a movie. It was based on an actual incident, but in the end, it was a movie. As a movie, it portrays the South and the issue of racism better than any movie before it. Director Parker creates excellent characters that embody the different perspectives of those that were involved in the civil rights crisis. Whether it is the idealist FBI agent portrayed by DeFoe or the Southern FBIrealist so brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. This movie shows us why peopletried to change the South and why other people tried to preserve that South. The result is a violent and disturbing film, which both educates and entertains. OK, the FBI actually used huge cash payoffs to get Klan members to testify against others in the real case. No, the FBI did not have a black agent that helped them to crack the case. However, let us not forget, that's right, it was a movie.",10,1,2,11 June 2004
12 Angry Men," Will Always Be a Classic
","To me, this film is probably as close to perfect as any film ever was. The emotion, the story, the acting, etc. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb squaring off. Different jurors harboring different beliefs, goals, views, etc. And even though this film was made close to fifty years ago, it is still as timely as ever. That is why I was so confused that somebody tried to shoot a re-make? Blasphemy! And by the way, that remake really sucked! Of course, after the first couple of times I saw this film, I was confused. I really though the kid did it. I still kind of think he did. Of course, that is the whole point of the film. Maybe he did do it, maybe not. The point of the story is about everybody getting a fair trial and a fair jury. Moreover, I will always remember the courage of Fonda's character, standing up to those eleven others, will very little to cling to. And how the jury ended up having to do what should have been done in the court room all along, try the case. Perhaps the main point of the film was to indict a society and criminal justice system that had lost it's way, if it ever had a way. But the lasting legacy of the film, is the fact that it just might be the greatest movie ever made.",10,0,1,27 December 2004
The Usual Suspects," Somewhat silly in retrospect
","I remember seeing this movie at the theater and thinking it was great. In reality, all that was really great was the creative ending. I really did not see it coming. However, years later I watched this and really found my eyes straining quite a bit. The performance are overdone (Baldwin is terrible), the dialog is somewhat silly (laughable in many parts) and the story is often ludacris (why the guys pull off the crime). No, this is one of those movies with a great ending, which  really distorts your perception of the entire movie. The plot is lame. Many parts of the film lack even a remote sense of reality. In retrospect, this movies looks like the work of a first year film student. It just was more silly than good. As for the high ranking on this site, I just wonder, who really has examined this film closely? I think if you have, you would see that it really wasn't that great.",1,17,36,6 April 2004
Quiz Show," Old Time Film Making from Mr. Redford
","This film really does look like it was shot and made during the 1950s. Be it the sets, the dress, the attitudes, etc.. Moreover, this film also shows us where America start to go wrong. Right at that moment when the Beast that was television was starting to grow up. Based on the actual scandal involving the hit game show of the day 21, this film shows when producers made the decision to forsake integrity for ratings. However, what is really special about this film, are the performances, primarily from Fienes, Turturro and the real-life Charles Van Doren. They are so moving and powerful, especially Turturro. This is a classic film that asks the audience to take a hard and educated look at when TV went wrong.",10,1,1,22 December 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," It really does try hard
","Yeah, Will Farrell is funny. The problem is finding him a vehicle to convey that humor. For the most part, he has had co-starring and support roles. In them, you can see the humor, but you wonder if he could carry a film by himself. Well, he kind of can. Of course in this film, he does surround himself with some comedic talent, the cast is loaded. Moreover, there are cameos from some of his buddies, Stiller, Wilson, Vaughn, etc.. However, the film does start to falter and almost collapse towards the last thirty minutes. The story, which was somewhatsecondary to begin with, seems to have no real closer. Will this film make you laugh? Yes, it will, some of the one-liners are very funny. Is this a well crafted comedy? No, not even close. So in the end, I give it a mixed review. If you love Farrell and you want to see insanity, go see it! However, if you are looking for some comedy which is perhaps a little more creative, well, have you heard of'Napoleon Dynamite'?",6,1,1,23 July 2004
Dodgeball," Stiller makes it fly
","OK, this might be a paint by the numbers, summer flick. You have the routinegood guys vs. bad guys. You have the 'if only we could win this tournament, we could....' Yes, in that respect, this film is not creating anything too new. However, where this film succeeds, where so many others like it fail, is due to the great Ben Stiller. Stiller plays an outrageous, narcissistic, borderline homosexual, bad guy. When Stiller is on the screen, laughter abounds. Somewhat strangely, he is not on the screen as much as you think he would be. This movie is told around Vince Vaughn's character, who is trying to hold on to his sleepy little gym, which is being threatened for takeover by Stiller's 'Globo-Gym.' Vaughn reluctantly agrees to enter a dodgeball tourney to win the $50,000 Grand Prize. Of course, $50,000 is the exact amount him and his oddballs that call the gym home, need to keep it. Well, it is a summer Hollywood film, so you can guess what happens. There are some really nice cameos here and the film is entertaining. Is it as brilliant as 'Zoolander'? No, but it is better than 'Starskey and Hutch.' I guess that is something.",8,0,0,18 June 2004
