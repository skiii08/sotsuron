Blade Runner 2049," Excellent and Most Unusual Movie!
",Hello - quick comments on a really good movie.I think of that show almost every day since seeing it.Hard to criticize and visually stunning. Nice links to the past. True to form and clearly a masterpiece. Glad that I saw it. One thing I noticed during the movie - no one moved - glued to the screen.Thanks.,10,1,8,7 November 2017
