Blade Runner 2049," Reminds Me Of Why I Love Movies
","I saw Blade Runner 2049 on Sunday, October 8th. As of writing this, it is Thursday, October 12th and I cannot get this film out of my head.From the visuals to the storytelling everything is just so perfect. Literally every frame in this movie looks like it should be hung up in a museum. The way '2049' develops it's story and characters are really unlike anything I have ever seen. I found it ironic that a handful of the major players physically cannot show empathy. Yet I showed a whole lot for them.As the film's mystery unfolds it just gets better and better. It is constantly adding onto the original and itself. Every scene, every location, is absolutely riveting. It is a very long film (almost clocking in at 3 hours) but I never even felt a tinge of boredom. It flies by. Your just so immersed in this story, these characters, these visuals, this world, that the film, without a doubt, floors you. This is the best film I have seen so far this year, maybe this decade. This is the reason we go to the movies, and it embodies what I love about them so much.I do have a few issues with the movie, but they are so minuscule, I can't possibly take points for them. I think it is really only tiny aspects of 1 or 2 scenes that I wasn't crazy about. I beg you to PLEASE go and see this film in cinemas, because it deserves the attention more than any other film out right now. Don't see It, don't see Kingsman, see Blade Runner 2049. Thank you.10/10 (masterpiece)",10,5,14,12 October 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Better Than I Was Expecting
","Wasn't expecting much from this one, but this was actually pretty good! I'm not a fan of Marvel or really just superhero films in general but this was entertaining and even somewhat risky in some aspects. It doesn't really do anything exceptional, and there really isn't a protagonist or 3 act structure since this is more of an event rather than a film. For what it is it's good. Not a masterpiece, doesn't deserve that high of rating on this site, but it's solid.",6,3,6,22 May 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Entertaining But Pretty Much The Same As The First.
","The 2nd Avengers film is not that good.
I didn't have enough to say so here is a superhero movie copypasta:Why? I mean is it really a surprise that the most popular form of cinema, populist entertainment like superhero films, star wars films, fast and furious films etc. are shunned by the cultural elite? Who cares what they think. 20 years from now no one will remember moonlight except film students and people directly related to the film and maybe the .0001 percent of the population who saw it in theaters. But all the Marvel films and the Fast movies will still be playing on FXX2 and HBORussiaWest until we're dead. Sometimes winning isn't just about awards, but what's remembered. That's the ultimate test. Immortality. Populist films by and large, especially the best of them pass this test. The reason it's not worth discussing is because frick the academy. Who cares what a bunch of old septuagenarians think about Marvel movies. Why do you look to them for some sort of validation? They and their opinions will become historically irrelevant.",3,1,6,14 May 2015
Donnie Darko," A Surreal Masterpiece
","'So what do I tell the other kids when they ask about you?'Â  'Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.' If anybody said that they understood everything in the 2001 film, Donnie Darko, right away I'd know they were lying. I've watched the movie 3 times now, I and still don't fully comprehend everything. Donnie Darko is the type of movie that just reels you in from the first shot, and does not let you go for the next hour and 53 minutes. Everything is so expertly crafted, it is astounding that this was the directors first movie. The film blends pretty much every genre in film. A few examples are, drama, comedy, horror, thriller, sci-fi, and more. This is without a doubt on of the most original movies I have every had the pleasure of watching. Not only with its plot though, with includes a jet engine, a giant rabbit named Frank, and superpowers. It finds ways to be original like the way the story is structured, or the way the characters are developed.Speaking of character, lets talk about that for a little bit. The films protagonist is a troubled teenager named Donnie. I loved his character and Gyllenhaal's performance too. I found myself crying at multiple points in the film because I felt for this character so deeply. Other than Donnie, the supporting characters really are not that well developed. This doesn't really matter though, since the rest of the cast are really just vehicles to get Donnie to where he needs to be by the end of the film. Another thing I find interesting is if you take all the giant bunny rabbits and time travel out of the film, it operates as a high school teen drama. This is where the films gains most of it's heart and reliability.In conclusion I think Donnie Darko is a weird, quirky beautiful, masterpiece. Every scene gives you something to love and every line is quotable in some shape or form. I love how many ways you can interpret this movie. Some could call it a metaphor for all the confusion going on in your teenage years. Some could consider call it a wake up call for others to accept their destiny and finally gain a sense of fulfillment. I choose to think that it is telling the audience that eventually everything will alright. However you choose to interpret it, it is brilliant either way.",10,1,3,6 November 2017
