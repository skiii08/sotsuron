United 93," Breathtaking
","I thought this movie was very tastefully done. It displays one interpretation of what could have possibly occurred in the air that day. No major actors were used, which I believe made the film better. Without an A-list celebrity in the script, there was no need to center the focus around a particular passenger on the flight. In fact, the names of the passengers are not really mentioned. Regardless of political affiliation, I believe that many people will be able to respect the movie. No one can ever know EXACTLY how the events unfolded, but this movie makes it possible for us to see what could have happened.",10,1,2,30 April 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Amazing...
","I absolutely loved this movie. I've heard a lot of people (who haven't even seen the new movie) talk about how Gene Wilder's version of Wonka is so much better. Let me tell you something. I own the first version of the movie and I love it, but the new version is great too. You have to be able to accept that it is going to be different. After all, it is more faithful to the book. There have also been many comments about Johnny Depp's character being 'creepy' and Michael Jackson-like. You can't read that much into it. Depp is just portraying the fact that Wonka has been in that factory for 15 years, hasn't had much contact with the outside world, as has never grown up. I thought the film was great and I have already seen it twice; something I didn't plan on. Don't judge the movie and make comments about Depp's performance if you haven't seen it yet.",10,3,8,16 July 2005
