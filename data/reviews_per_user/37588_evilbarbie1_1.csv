Marie Antoinette," Sadly Didn't Live Up to My Expectations
","Although I enjoyed the film, and the music (I liked the modern music twist especially Adam Ant mixed in with a costume drama) I wasn't wild about it & felt distracted throughout the film, ninety five percent of the time, due the English & American accents, of all the French characters. If you are paid handsomely for a leading role, I think you should endeavor, to at least learn the accent, of the nationality, that you are playing. Especially, if you do not have the added stress, of having to speak the foreign language. A French Queen with an American accent,is just not credible, in my humble opinion. As an Ex, History of fashion student, I liked the costumes, hair & makeup, but for such a dramatic life, the whole thing seemed to lack drama, and felt it lacked lustre, especially the disappointingly weak ending.",4,1,1,21 December 2013
