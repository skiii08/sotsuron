Resident Evil: Afterlife," 3D, the only little savior for this otherwise dud...
","The beginning despite being 'inspired' from Matrix promised a lot. Though all good things come to end but it should not be this quick. The movie loses pace and viewers' interest as well. One does not expect acting skills in movie based on a game and in this you should not expect a 'script' either. Characters come in abruptly and have no defined role in the movie. Jovovich does what she does best but nothing even close to special or jaw-dropping. Miller & Larter are the biggest waste. But can't blame the actors when they have no script to display their talents.The few positives: 3D, background score and screenplay. Afterlife is one of the better 3D movies. Very well shot with appropriate camera angles, the screenplay is as per the requirement and the background score when the action begins is impressive.Go watch only if you are Resident Evil fan or have nothing else to kill time.",4,7,16,11 September 2010
