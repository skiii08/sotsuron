First Man," One of the best films I've seen in decades
","I'm a huge space nerd and have created a space related business out of my passion. I also have thoroughly studied most major space missions and know most of the details of the Apollo 11 mission pretty well.
But I also was not born American, nor do I have an annoying patriotic streak in me or the need to justify every action by putting hashtags after every tweet.Having said all that, this was bar none one of the best space movies I've seen in decades.It is made with passion, detail, love and incredible focus on human condition as opposed to trying to make a political statement.
There are no attempts to put down one nation or another or to try to create an image of something that many Americans want to believe. No, this movie follows a man, the First Man, the man whose family life became a part of the story and it's a story that needed to be told.Armstrong's sons from what I understand approved of everything the movie was trying to tell and were very proud of the image that was created of their father. And in all honesty, no one else's opinion on the matter really matters. The movie was about their dad, it was a biopic more so than anything else and it did an incredible job of delivering the emotions of a grieving father with a tough mission ahead.I absolutely loved every moment and definitely thought that the portrayal of Buzz Aldrin was spot on as well. He's always been a controversial character (sued his own kids, what a great family) and honestly his miniscule role in the film was the right choice.This is a must see for anyone into space, into human drama or anyone who enjoys watching an incredible journey of a man in pain. It didn't do well in the box office, but I'm sure it'll turn into a timeless masterpiece.10/10",10,3,8,17 June 2019
Alexander," how the Irish conquered the world
","Although the producers tried to present Alexander and classical Greece as realistic as possible, they still went a bit overboard in a few important instances. I was surprised that they decided to present Alexander as more fond of boys unlike they did in Troy where Achilles was never seen in any of his famous homosexual pursuits, but it did add to the realism. I also enjoyed the antagonist motherly figure that was presented as the hidden force behind Alexander's glory and his weaknesses, but just like the homosexuality, it was a bit exaggerated and was taken too far.The Greeks that speak with Irish accent was definitely not necessary. I wasn't sure if I was watching some sort of a Celtic conquest adventure or a story of Hellenic glory. The attempt at making the movie more artsy and inverting color during the best battle in the movie was out of place as well. For me at that point in turned into a cartoon. Some scenes were cut and pasted in the middle of the movie when even though they were quite important to the storyline made no sense in the particular context. Most important conquests and exploits of Alexander (e.g. his first conquest and first few victories as well as the story of the Gordian Knot) were not even mentioned. This disjointness and selective development of Alexander's story prevented me from enjoying the movie completely, but I thought it was still a lot better at presenting Hellenic world than the Hollywood's last attempt with Troy.This movie is far from a masterpiece of even a must see. It is too long, sometimes too pointless and often more than not drags its own feet in a circle without saying much, but it's still not a terrible movie and is somewhat entertaining on the first run.6/10",6,0,0,22 December 2006
The Lives of Others," Powerful and emotional. Brilliant script
","Das Leben der Anderen is an incredibly emotional movie that portrays the live behind iron curtain in the Federal Republic of Germany.We discover a life of a couple that is being watched by the East German secret police and how struggle for basic human freedom prevails for some, but fails for others. There are no real protagonists in the story, just the characters whose lives interconnect and people that watch them. So in effect, it is the story of people that strive and those that watch them do so. The storyline and script the movie is based on are very powerful. The music adds to the mood and overall presentation is amazing and will keep you hooked until the end. This along with other German movie, Der Untergang are by the far the best masterpieces of cinematography that came out of Germany in a long time. There are however certain things I was left not 100% satisfied with such as somewhat amateur camera work and certain scenes that were poorly edited, but they can really be ignored when looking at the movie as a whole. 9/10",9,2,4,10 January 2007
Children of Men," brilliant and magnificent
","This was by far one of the best movies I've seen in 2006. Although the fact that it's a sci-fi might deter some people from seeing it, this is one of those rare masterpieces that should be seen by anyone considering themselves a movie connoisseur.It begins as a story of despair in a world full of death and destruction, but ends as a captivating race of a man who found his hope and a hope for the entire human race and is trying to save it. Not only does the movie progresses at a perfect pace, but it also involves some of the most amazing shots I have ever seen captured on camera. These include an intense single scene shot of an urban survival in the middle of the war, truly magnificent in the way it was shot and delivered and a very rare and a very realistic footage of human birth that some people might find strangely disturbing. To present the story with as much realism as possible, director chose to implement footage that was shot with a constantly moving cameraman that gives us a strange feeling of being present wherever the battle is raging or whatever it is hero is doing. The movie sets are realistic and although simple in appearance, they deliver a great addition to the overall feeling of a dark future.I give Children of Men 10/10 the only movie I gave the highest score in 2006",10,3,7,27 December 2006
The Descent," Six chicks go caving
","This is by far one of the more amusing horror movies that came out in the past few years. It delivers a good performance by all actors, involves good drama and interesting horror techniques. When the horror drama picks up, we are amused with interesting claustrophobic shots and tons of unexpected scenes, as well as gallons and gallons of fake blood. Although most of the scenes are too dark to appreciate the gore, the sound effects create a necessary mood for most of the setting. Unlike the other cave movie of 2005 (ironically entitled The Cave), none of the character pretends to be something else. There are no sonar devices or million dollar equipment. It is simple and beautiful. Six girls go on a caving adventure with nothing more but the basic spelunking equipment. The idea and the premise is the same in both movies, but the simplicity of The Descent makes it a much better flick than The Cave. There are few shortcomings to this movie that could have made it a lot better: For one, the relationship between characters is not very well established. In most cases, you have to guess who is who and how they know each other and whether they are related at all. The protagonist's tragedy in the beginning of the movie seems to be absolutely pointless. It does not add anything to the storyline and seems like if taken out of a context, could have made a good movie on its own. The idea does revisit us throughout the movie, but it looks like it was added after the movie has been made just to add some footage time. Although there is an obvious conflict between the main character and her best friend, we have to guess as to what exactly it is until the final climax, which is not explained well either. Finally, the storyline takes too long unwrap; almost an hour is literally wasted on chick flickery which is sort of a waste. We are in a sense prepared for the horror to come and are kept on the edge with constant boo effects, but after an hour of these, a viewer might get a bit bored.8/10",8,1,3,18 January 2007
The Departed," 5/10 for di caprio
","I've watched this movie about a year after I saw Internal Affairs and was gravely disappointed with it.The production team that was working for Scorses did an awful job. The camera work was absolutely ridiculous, most scenes were disjointed and story progressed in pieces that were hard to relate to each other. The only reason to even consider watching this movie and the only positive thing I could find in it is a first-rate performance by Di Caprio who was absolutely splendid. His character was not just believable, but also gave a good impression of an undercover cop. He was the only thing left in the movie to keep the drama going. Other actors were mediocre and their characters were either very shallow or totally ludicrous.The original movie took a very personal approach, the two cops develop a special relationship between each other and everyone else plays a secondary role (including the mafia boss). In Scorsese adaptation, the relationship is non-existent. The boss played by Jack Nicholson becomes a prominent character, but is strangely portrayed as a demented old fool who's losing all sense of reality and why anyone would want to make him a supportive role in the movie is beyond me. In my opinion a lot of things were done really badly in The Departed and although Internal Affairs was no masterpiece either, it managed to deliver a much better crime thriller with a lot more attitude than Scorsese's adaptation.I give this 5/10, mostly for Di Caprio's performance.",5,1,2,21 December 2006
The Woman in Black," Daniel did well, but as a horror title, this movie...sucks
","I'm a huge horror movie fan and was looking forward to this title.Unfortunately, I got really disappointed with The Woman in Black for two main reasons: it's predictable, it uses tons of clichés.First, the storyline is reminiscent of so many other movies out there. The first few moments were quite original and I expected a few twists here and there, but as I continued to watch the film, I realized that I'm in for a big disappointment.Daniel does a good job in delivering his role, but the support characters are strange and out of place and the entire premise seems badly developed. The ending was quite predictable as well and to be honest, it could have been done SO much more interesting and scary.Second, all of the 'scary' scenes are not only very easy to anticipate, but they were almost literally copies from other ghost movies. The mirror ghost scenes, the screaming face scenes and a plethora of others were all blatantly copied. Unlike intense psychological horror movies or movies that use anticipation and the fear of the unknown (REC, Exorcist, Paranormal Activity), Woman in Black employs cheap thrills with the excessive use of atmospheric music, sound and special effects. Overall, Woman in Black is not a horrible movie, but if you're a horror movie fan and have seen your share of films, you'll be thoroughly disappointed by this title. It's quite predictable, uses simple scare tactics and dare I say...boring? 7/10",7,0,1,1 March 2012
300," Another incredible comic book adaptation
","What most people don't realize is that this film is based on Frank Miller's comic book and is made specifically to mimic the comic's general feeling. Just like the other movie that was based on his comics, Sin City, 300 is trying to capture the comic book and deliver it into another medium.Just like Sin City, it does a good job in doing that. The film looks incredible. The visuals are stunning and everything that people might have enjoyed in Frank Miller's animation is recreated in 300. The film does not claim nor even tries to be historically accurate, representing Persians as evil disfigured beings, but it still does a great job for Hollywood in presenting us with a heroic battle of epic proportions. I think if you are going in to see this movie with some sort of a historical expectation, you are not going to enjoy it at all. Similary, if you end up over-analyzing this, you might end up thinking this is some sort of an anti-Iran propaganda, which it is definitely not (but which did add some extra publicity to the movie). This is nothing more than an adaptation of a comic book and a really good one too. Watch it with an open mind and you will love this movie a lot.9/10 for great visual effects and incredible new cinematic techniques.",9,1,5,4 April 2007
