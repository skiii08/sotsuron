Ali," a movie for champions
","the first ten minutes of this movie drew me.  the camera-work, the music, and especially, the very first fight sequence where we see Ali (will smith in a role that will defienetly earn him the top spot in the run for the best actor oscar).  the movie has a special feeling to it.  the camera-work is very different from most other movies, but it works amazingly.  you get to feel the madness, and intensity from inside the ring as Ali boxes his way into stardom.  jon voight was also very good as Howard Cosell.  When i was walking out ofthe theatre i was asking people where was jon voight in this movie. i didn't see him. then they told me he was howard.  When that happens you know it is a great performance.  Mann turned what everyone thought was impossible into something that will acheive some great success. i mean, look at francis ford coppola.  with the godfather, I & II (i won't even go to III, cuz it is just to bloody bad), he was told it wouldn't come out good. it couldn't live up to anything.  it managed to win best picture and a slew of other awards.  that shows how much work everyone put into the movies. overall, this was a good movie, with funny parts from smith, and as well as great boxing sequences, that not since raging bull, a movie could live up to that standard. 9/10",9,0,0,6 January 2002
The 13th Warrior," An okay, timewaster.
","The 13th Warrior, was a short (or at least it felt like it) movie, copying the battle-scenes from Braveheart. Other than the stupid storyline and bad acting that Antonio Banderas did, The 13 Warrior, is an okay timewaster, if your in the mood for all the bad stuff above.",6,0,0,12 September 1999
L.A. Confidential," Never off the record, on the QT, and not very hush-hush
","This film can be described in many ways but my favourite way is the following. It is a hardcore crime film mixed in with a pinch of a thriller and a teaspoon of some film noir. Throw in some Spacey, Crowe, a bit of DeVito, and a dash of Basigner. Once all ingredients are mixed together, you get, L.A. Confidential. A smart, sassy movie that never lets you go all the way up to the end. A terrific movie that deserves all the recognition it has ever gotten.",10,1,2,29 October 2000
We Were Soldiers," not too shabby
","this film was pretty good except for some of the supposedely gut-wrenching scenes that involved the wives, and i thought it was great.  I've heard people say that the violence was the same or superior to Saving Privste Ryan, but it isn't.  The violence in that movie was used at appropriate times.  Although, some parts may have been more gory in this, Saving Private Ryan used the gore at better times, and in my opinion, it made the film better.  but overall, it was a great experience.",Null,0,1,12 April 2002
Pitch Black," Stunning in every way
","Pitch Black is a movie that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. It makes you really believe what actually makes all those bumps in the night. Brilliant uses of colours light up the screen (literally) and seems to exactly portray the environment that surrounded the characters in the film. From the pitch black darkness to the overwhelming light that the 'three' suns give off, this film is visually outstanding.
Acting, special effects, and a unique and interesting storyline, help boost momentum into this flick. A great movie, and is highly reconmended for sci-fi and horror fans.",10,0,0,12 November 2000
The Shining," Kubrick makes a masterpiece...again.
","Stanley Kubrick, one of the most inventive filmakers of our time, has made a thriling film, so astonishingly mastered, it has right to go down in history with his other films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange.Other than some weak points in the film, The Shining delivers a impact so hard, that most of us would be knocked off our feet. Jack Nicholson gives us a performance that is top notch.Brilliant cinematograghy, and a score that dazzles, The Shining is a film of a lifetime.",10,0,0,21 October 1999
The Patriot," Modern Masterpiece
","This film is a great movie that contains brilliant acting from all the stars (and surprisingly not just from Gibson), exceptional camerawork, and scenes so full of emotion makes this film, The Patriot, a film to be remembered. Even though one or two aspects of the movie were not exactly true (such as the exploding cannonballs), I believe it all had a purpose. Whether it was to bring more excitement during the great battle scenes or to show that these old wars that didn't involve guns  and artillery were still as deadly as our more modern wars. Humour accompanies you throughout the film that ranges from cracking jokes about the French, or how Benjamin Martin (Gibson) plays along the British. A twist near the end of the movie shows just how much thought Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) put into his script. A round of applause for the Emmerich/Devlin team for making a movie that is actually good and doesn't involve aliens or giant lizards.***** out of ***** 9.5/10",10,0,2,2 August 2000
The Usual Suspects," and like that... its gone...
","and like that... its gone. This movie just soared off into the sky from the very beginning. Very, very, smart writing and a masterful direction from Synger gave this movie a spot on my top ten list. Spacey, Bryne, Baldwin... all great. Not a single problem. Also, a very shocking ending that has yet to be beaten. There's nothing like it. And just think, by watching this movie again, you could've known all along who it was. 9.5/10= *****",10,0,1,6 October 2000
Black Hawk Down," heroes left and right
","I just saw this film and I heard nothing but good reviews from my friends and the critics.  So i wanted to see if they were right.  One column stated that you couldn't compare it to anything and that you'd have to see it to know the experience of the film.  Boy, was it right.  100% right.  This film blew me away.  it is easily one of the best films of 2001, along with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Ali.  You will never again watch a helicopter in a movie without thinking first of this.  You will never watch ER the same because this film makes it look like Sesame Street.  You will never hear a gunshot the same after you witness the amazing sound effects.  As soon as the Somalis begin firing, you flinch at every shot because they feel so close, it is amazing.The actors are great, but it still cannot compare to the action and effects and the hard work that went into this.  The scenes in the helicopters, flying over the city are breathtaking.  They look amazing, with the smoke and scenery, it puts you right there.  Even teh music plays a role in teh film, by speeding up its tempo with the action, and focuses on the Americans, everytime one dies, the music stops, but it is done masterfully.  I give this film a very diserving 5 out of 5 stars.  Absolutely, one of the best, or the best war films ever.  I said that about Saving Private Ryan, but this surpasses it.  Just great, but one question bothers me.  Why the heck did teh Americans want to get mixed up in all of this.  I mean, it defienetly wasn't worth 19 young lives, and the fighting hasn't stopped, has it?  and to quote the film and Plato, the only man who wsn't seen war is the dead.",10,0,0,20 February 2002
Shine," 1 more thing...
","i have just one thing to say about this film. geoffrey rush got an oscar. yes he did. but what he really deserved was another one for actually learning to become the character and one more for learning to speak like the character. i was forced to turn on my closed captioning on my television set because i was unable to understand. he talked so fast, it amazed me. well, thats all i have to say, even though it sounded stupid what i just said, i had to let it out.",Null,0,0,16 July 2001
The Replacements," Funny, and highly entertaining
","This film the replacements starring Keanu Reeves is a very funny, interesting, and entertaining film. A great cast was chosen. this movie never lets up. go see it. you will enjoy it. 7.5/10= ***1/2",Null,0,1,20 August 2000
