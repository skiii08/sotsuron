Alien 3," A little disappointing...
","I'm a big fan of the whole series,but this one is obviously not up to my expectations.Not comparable to any other one in the series..The whole story was set on a planet without weapons and,I have to admit, it's a creative idea.However the storylines are somewhat boring and dull..No surprising twists.Many plots have been simplified and similar scenes repeat and repeat for sooo many times.Monotonous!Those silly prisoners acted as if they were idiots and they were just asking for trouble!!No wonder they were all killed by ONLY one alien.Disappointing.

American Beauty," Masterpiece
","When I first watched this film,I quit half way-what on earth it wants to talk about?Ridiculous and preposterous and just typical black humor with unbearable vulgarity and eroticism(say the aberrant love with a child-girl etc.)However,when I have a second or maybe a third and fourth try,I find something different.
Conspicuously,this one is nothing of those ubiquitous funny,silly,superficial,comedic films that can make you brainlessly laugh to death and render you an unprecedentedly good frame of mindset after watching.This one is,in great contrary,rather complicated,unspeakably gloomy-much more abstruse and incomprehensible than any other film.Outwardly,it tells a droll and messy story of a family of three;inwardly,it recklessly,mercilessly,trenchantly reveals the most fragile yet authentic part concealed in everyone's life,hidden in everyone's heart.It may include those immoral desires for sex(Lester Burnham ),torturing despondency and failure(Carolyn) in life,trouble in puberty,irreconcilable conflicts with friends(Jane)...all of which most of us-'it's sad but true'-never dare to admit,and which everyone prefers to hide in their own secret nook forever.No one wants to face them,but,just as the film tells us,they are there,inevitable whether you want or not.So maybe a little vulgar,the film does tell the truth,which accounts for the controversy it arouses.Moreover,American Beauty teaches us a lot about what is reality and what is iridescent illusion.Anything that appears to be as placid as the transparent surface of a still lake maybe be deadly perilous.So it is with our life.While many of us are under the delusion that everything goes on smoothly,all is well,life is totally in control ,etc ,etc,the film obnoxiously shatters your dream:Oh Please wake up!Don't be so naive!Life is rather unpredictable and uncontrollable than you think.While we deem ourselves as masters of our life,actually we much more resemble the plastic bag shown in the film-at the mercy of the wind,the wind of life.Who knows when it will spin desperately out of control and dreadfully give you an unanticipated and fatal blow?(just see the Lesters )And when it happens,the only thing you can do is to return to reality.Wave adieux to your fantasy just like Lester does to his Angela.Go back to your real life,though it's not that snug and cozy!",10,0,0,28 March 2020
Resident Evil," Classical thrilling film with blood and gore..
","So GORY and repulsive!!l mean it! This one frightens me to death,absolutely.And I enjoy it that way.It's one of the most thrilling Sci-fi films I've ever seen,though containing some terribly gory scenes.(some people were sliced into pieces by the dreadful lasers!)Needless to say,this one also involves some other elements that are a must for sci-fi films.The unbearably weird silence in the Hive,the drab zombies,disgusting monsters and the sudden mutation of human beings nearby.....all those keep jarring and pinching my nerves !I nearly cry out: OMG !!as if all these were just happening in front of me!!True to life... definitely.
Also I have to say that the film may be a little hard to understand at first, yet you will finally find all the scenes and plots are carefully designed.No flaws!Perfect!
For this classical thrilling film,i will give 10 stars.Really good.",10,4,4,7 February 2020
Gone with the Wind," A great film rich in themes
","Very great!!!Definitely a one-in-million film with perfect plot ,vivid characters and a tear-shedding ending.Through the story of Scarlett ,the film,I think, mainly puts forward a question of changing or not.As a matter of fact,Scarlett has always been a controversial character ,deplored by sooo many people.Be that as it may,I still think highly of her.Indeed.Imagine that era in which Sac lived!Throughout the Civil War,actually everything was changed.Turmoil,invasion,deprivation,robbery,arson...those bygone days were definitely nightmare for everyone,forcing them to make a choice between changing and being changed.However,only Scarlett had the courage to rise up against challenges.Only she dared to change herself in order to fight against the uneven and miserable life(in ironic comparison with Ashley who only wallowed himself in the past!)To change is to live!By all means!Absolutely Scarlett was the master of her life ,a great winner despite all her deeds.You can call her cruel, you can actually describe her as crazy,sly,uppity,but all these should be attributed to the era.(she might be a little capricious in the beginning though) .Scarlett just changed ,transformed herself to live through it,anyway.It's not her fault...She was also innocent.
By the way ,the ending in which Scarlett found her true inner self ,revealed the misunderstanding and expressed her deep love to Rhett is really really touching...Of only the story ended not in tragedy....",10,2,3,6 February 2020
