Captain Phillips," Top class acting from Tom and Barkhad
",Gripping and immense acting from the lead cast. Has you at the edge of the seat almost all the way through . Only doesn't get a 10/10 because in a few places the screenplay and directing sunk to Hollywood cliches. The film could also have been a bit more profound and meaningful by leaning a bit more towards the Somalians side of the story as opposed to how almighty the US navy is.,8,0,1,17 October 2019
Argo," Oscars for Islamophobia
","As a westerner, I am truly ashamed of our general interference in the Middle East. However Ben Affleck appears not only unashamed of it but proceeds to glorify it. He takes a serious international conflict and twists it in American favour and profits from it claiming it as based on a true story. Truly self indulgent. I have to say that the film, as a piece of fiction, is gripping and would be very watchable (at a simplistic level), but if you are going to base it on a true story, you have to do that. Not twist the facts, glorify the Americans, and throw the usual Hollywood script cliches in. Okay, maybe all this is Ben Affleck's choice and fair enough if that's what his ego demands of his fame. However, the Oscars? For this glorification of Middle Eastern situation of which we should be thoroughly ashamed?",1,1,4,19 October 2019
Doctor Strange," Something stimulating for the mind
",On many levels this film is notably watchable. I like the scenario that a scientist is converted to a spiritual believer and the journey he undergoes. Also all the characters have a positive and negative aspects to their personality which makes it a whole lot more relevant. The last thing I'd like to praise is the use of time travel and manipulation. It has been so long since someone has done something new and exciting with it. The idea of defeating the undefeatable via trapping him in time loop was brilliant. Also the action sequences where time was travelling backwards yet the lead characters were still going forward we're really creative and fun.,9,0,0,29 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I struggled to leave this 4 stars
","Disney haven't completely ruined Star Wars, but nearly. Firstly is is a great thing that Star Wars has lasted this long and characters such C3PO have been played by the same actor in all 9 episodes. Back to the film. Seriously, Disney, with $200M can you not find someone that can write a decent script? This script contains literally a minute of relevant story, the rest of the film is just script for the sake of filling space. And if you look closer you see it's full of flaws and holes. Unbelievably poor. The only bit in the film that was good was the last five seconds of Ben Solo. I know the film is designed for kids but the old Star Wars films still managed to work in a decent story to the film. The producers at Disney should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the Star Wars name and the hard work of the lead actors on such an utterly poor script.",4,6,9,21 January 2020
Joker," A masterpiece on many levels
",Todd Philips has created both a masterful study of psychology as well as a masterful study of sociology. And both absolutely to point regarding modern society. On top of this the acting and cinematography is brilliant. It's amazing how the batman saga has been successful across the full spectrum of ludicrously unrealistic (suicide squad) to heart-stoppingly real (this film).,10,4,5,20 February 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese and DiCaprio should be ashamed of themselves
",Scorsese and DiCaprio should be ashamed of themselves for sinking so low. Putting their masterful talents into a film that practically glorifies everything bad. If you liked this film you are a sociopath. Wake up guys and make a positive change to the world. This was three hours of pathetic American junk.,1,3,11,7 October 2019
The Social Network," Informative and capturing film
","Overall, in purely film terms, this film was great. Great storytelling and great acting all round. And as a minor point it's a text book example of a great last shot in a film. Nothing deep but just gets you thinking about something other than money at the moment the film closes. My only fault with the film is that I wouldn't have made it at all. So it turns out that Mark Zucherberg became the youngest billionaire ever by being extremely selfish. That's probably not a surprise but the one good thing about Mark Zucherberg, the one thing that redeems him from creating social media, is that he could be an inspiration for young people to strive for success through education rather than through bullying. Maybe Mark should be exposed as a bad person, however in this case I think the better thing for humanity would actually be to keep that behind closed doors and let him at least be an inspiration for the next generation to work harder at school.",8,0,0,21 January 2020
