Howl's Moving Castle," Hah! Forget computers! ...CGI is so last year.
","I remember when I saw Red's Dream. That's one of Pixar's first shorts along with Luxor Junior, and I remember it because I was working in a computer graphics company in the UK and it was about 1986 ish. We all huddled round a small TV and watched awed as raindrops fell outside the bike shop (Red is a unicycle) and hit the puddles, rippling out and distorting the reflection of the shop lights. It was a magical moment where we first saw that never seen before water effect and all went 'Wow'....Hey mac. What about Howl's Moving Castle - What's your point? Move it along! Ahem, well... The animation in Howl's is of frankly awesome quality. I'm bleating about CGI water above and then I go and see Howl's and there are waves coming up the beach in one scene and they are translucent, perfect and get this ...hand drawn! There is just something about the craft involved in replicating an effect like that with a pencil and some colourists. No it's not CGI style realistic. It's better than that. There is sometimes a thing about CGI in that it is too perfect. That's why companies try hard to top Toy Story. Great movie but everything is so round, hard and shiny.The water in Howl's is like a poem about water rather than a slavish copy and therein lies the difference. ...Something like the essential difference between a painting and a photograph.That's just one item in one scene and things like that go on throughout the movie and my eyes just basically got wider and wider. I find the whole thing just astonishing and really must look up the other movies like Spitited Away and Princess Mononoke. To paraphrase another reviewer. (This ain't CGI) 'This is Art'.Ah... but you wanted to watch a film really didn't you? It works well enough but I'm going to have to give it an 8 instead of a 10. Quite simply there is something that probably makes sense in Japanese that goes wrong here and makes the story a little puzzling and disjointed in English in places. Other than that it's great. You'll continue to see some scenes in your mind's eye for months afterwards. This movie is not easily forgotten. (And my 12 year old daughter thought it was great too!)",8,1,3,10 March 2006
The Dark Knight," Sadly we need to keep giving this 1 star till it lands at 8.?
","Until it drops below the Godfather, the Good, The Bad and Ugly and any number of other films that are just that bit better in an historical context.This does upset me slightly as it is in itself a very good film as the other reviews say. The Ledger is Dead / Batman Fans just went a bit overboard with the 10/10 scores at the start leaving us poor schmucks at the back of the queue to mark it down to where it should be.What do I think? Honestly? Well 7's on IMDb are usually a good watchable evening's entertainment 8's are things you would make a point of staying in for, tipping or buying the DVD and anything 9+ is one of the best movies ever made. Yes, this one is an 8.something for sure as I would go out of my way to watch it again....But the scoring correction continues so 1 star it is :)",1,11,29,15 November 2008
