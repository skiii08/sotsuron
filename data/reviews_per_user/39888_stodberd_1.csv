Walk the Line," An amazing love story
","The love between him and June Carter was simply electrifying and this was one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever watched. From the minute he laid eyes on her, you could feel his emotions and that she had stolen his heart away. His life was a turmoil and such a sad and painful childhood he led, but all that I could feel through this movie was his love for June. I wanted him to run off with her the first time they met...but they didn't ....they kept it a friendship until the attraction between them was so strong that those around them could feel it as well. It's no wonder that he died just months after she passed away. I'm sure they're together somewhere making beautiful music together just as they did when they were here. I miss them.",9,0,0,20 June 2006
