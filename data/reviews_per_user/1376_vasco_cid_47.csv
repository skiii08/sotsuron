The Blair Witch Project," I'm sorry,... What? Scary, vaguely, but empty afterwards.
","I'm just still wondering why did someone ever believed this story really happened when it's so clear that it is acting! One thing is true, this movie followed the rules that almost every good scary movie does: leave some incidents to the suggestion like the witch's look. There were only two scary parts on the movie: the night when the children's voice are outside the tent and the last part inside the abandoned house. Just that. Wanna be scared skip this one and rent The Haunting. Would you give away 8 bucks to see a shallow home made video camera movie? Think again.2 out of 10",2,0,2,7 September 2001
Blade Runner 2049," A game changer.
","Everything the original Blade Runner did and everything the original Blade Runner touched upon, Blade Runner 2049 multiplies. Plus, just as the original Blade Runner (and whichever of its versions), 2049: 1) is infinitely more complex than its first viewing lets you to process; 2) it is revolutionary both thematically and stylistically and 3) it is a film for the ages. 1) When watching 2049 for the first time, it is impossible to grasp every single of its themes to the extent that material requires the viewer to. It is illustrated through (at least) temporal far-fetched settings and concepts that brazenly delve into an anthropological and sentimental exercise of human nature, solitude, feelings, discrimination and perseverance. 2) It is virtually impossible not to feel completely overwhelmed and positively oppressed by the opulence of the settings, the inexplicable beautiful and haunting cinematography of the ever genius, ever graceful and ever superior Roger Deakins and the bleak, heavy and complex eye of Denis Villeneuve.3) This is a film for the ages, the same way as the original Blade Runner was in the sense that all the aspects pointed out in 1) and 2) are mere allusions of how truly poignant 2049 is. Despite having its faults (the pacing is, at times, stale and some scenes and plot points are either redundant or unnecessarily overlong) it is a film that defies definitions; that does not invite convincing into liking; that is greater than the sum of its parts. It is a work of art that invites repeated discovery and constant debate and transcends the mere purpose of entertainment and escapism that cinema offers.",9,2,10,9 October 2017
Fight Club," What's wrong?
","Why does everyone overrate Fight Club as IF it was a masterpiece?Why is Fight Club considered one of the all-time best? I don't know! Maybe this is me. I don't feel very attracted to movies with many violence, maybe I don't like to be confronted with the dark side of society nowadays (probably not the dark side, but 75% of society. I'm sorry, maybe, I didn't express myself well enough. I watched and enjoyed many movies with violence, but my  point is I don't like  (I'm sorry again) movies depicting very much misery. I believe that Fight Club couldn't have been shown otherwise. Anyway, I told you already that I didn't enjoy many with this odd picture, but as your mind and costumes may be somehow different, you may enjoy it and since this is made out of opinions you may rate this almost piece of crap however you want, but I can't give anymore than 4/10.",4,2,6,3 May 2001
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One: Side story chapter I
","Rogue One is the film that The Force Awakens desperately tried to be and failed miserably. Make no mistake. Both films are short on originality, fall under the same plot schematics and cardboard characters, but where The Force Awakens did it ambitiously, Rogue One does it humbly: and that makes all the difference in the world.Star Wars is Disney's new big cash-cow milked left and right through expansions on prequels and sequels using as triggers not only major characters but also McGuffins. Don't be surprised if, in years to come, there was a standalone film centered on the Blue Rhinoceros that plays the piano on Return of the Jedi. Cynicism aside, Rogue one is a return to form on the great Star Wars films of the past; the sheer fun, excitement and engagement with the story grows as the film moves along, amounting to a been-there-done- that-seven-times-before third act, that I ended up not holding myself against at all. The film will go down in history perhaps as the one (or one of the only) case (s) where rewrites and reshoots worked out extremely well despite accentuating this on a much stronger second-half than a limp barely exciting kick-start.",7,1,5,21 December 2016
Passengers," CW's Passengers
","Marked by all kinds of promotional hype, whether the high profile lead couple, the steamy sex scenes, the gargantuous budget and the dismal reviews met upon release, 'Passengers' shall not be, in the end, remembered by any of the above. Talk about missed opportunities, Passengers had the potential to be a relevant piece of the modern revamp of the sci-fi genre would it commit to a single approach to the premise, instead of a diverse crowd pleaser. Fresh out of the success of The Imitation Game, Morten Tyldum embarrassingly helms a mammoth project evidently lacking experience or provocativeness it requires. The film never quite decides what it is or what it wants to be because evidently more time was spent on fancying up the production values rather than covering up Spaiths' plot holes. I found myself rather intrigued by the story, predictable as it is though, being a definite fan of the genre, never quite minding the clichéd lines, the almost unbearably loud and out of place score by Thomas Newman or the all around CW TV show look, because some films are just meant to be enjoyed as Sunday afternoon entertainment or a late night escape.",7,4,9,24 December 2016
Oldboy," Unmissable
","As controversial, violent (both physically and emotionally), relevant and unmissable as it has been pitched, Oldboy is one of those rare films that crawls under your skin while you're watching it and even more so once it's finished.Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive in a hotel bedroom-like prison until his release 15 years later. With absolutely no contact with the outside word, save for a TV set, he embarks on a quest for revenge and answers, while being regularly contacted by his captor teasing him with clues for his identity and the reason why he was held captive. Oldboy is a gut- punching tale of revenge, rage, frustration and anger riddled with mystery and an overabundance of twists and turns that despite borderline far-fetched, delivers an unmeasurable payoff.",9,2,4,29 December 2016
The Prestige," A Truly Intelligent and Gripping Piece of Art
","Over these last few years, I have been increasingly against the critics opinions on the quality of movies, whether it is on their criticism of blockbusters and lack of originality, or studio's greed for money on detriment of quality. These past year, i have to start to agree with them. That was until the Prestige came on. It has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that truly made me care about the characters and their motivations, and most importantly it has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that made me totally forget about the hectic life outside, and make me devout myself entirely without looking at my watch at least once. Obviously that isn't a coincidence, this only happens when true cinematic geniuses are behind the camera, either Christopher Nolan's passionate and intelligent direction and skillful writing adaptation capabilities, or Pfister's lighting and Julyan's score. That combined with a top-notch cast leading this peace of cinematic brilliance presented as a magic trick itself makes it a as enjoyable as possible. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman battle themselves character and acting-wise, because you never know which one has the advantage over the other, and to make the recipe perfect Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie support the duo not over shadowing them but composing a colorful and deep canvas. I guess what I like the most about the Prestige is the fact that the movie is about magicians composing magic tricks and the three steps to complete them; and the movie is actually presented to us audience in that way: You have The Pledge (Who the characters are, their motives and backgrounds), The Turn (you realize nothing is what it seems, twists keep on coming and you never know who has leverage) and The Prestige (the most interesting of them all, because you are given an explanation for the events, which explains all of its 'cientific impossibilities') But are they really impossible. Were all the explanations given to you the reality?.....Did you watch it closely? Make sure you did. Because the explanation is not what it seems. That is the real Prestige of 'The Prestige'.",10,2,4,1 January 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Perfect crime/mystery historical recreation all the way.
","If you are a crime/mystery story lover, than this is the movie for you. The movie tagline `Heads will roll' may seem a little excessive and may suggest a movie full of gore. Truth is that this movie is essentially  a 혩detective story' where everyone is a suspect, and the gore part come as a complement, it is just the style of the killer, who kills his victims the way he was killed, fast and painless. Constable Ichabod Crane, from a NYC in the late 18th century, is given the mission of investigating a group of homicides said to be committed by an headless horseman. These crimes are taking place at the small town of Sleepy Hollow. As soon as Ichabod Crane arrives at Sleepy Hollow, he is told the story of the headless horseman, and how did he lost his head. For those who haven't seen the movie, the mystery may seem to be the real identity of the horseman, but it isn't, the mystery relies on who controls the horseman by keeping his head (as the horseman's identity is revealed in the beginning). As crimes happen, we discover that the horseman doesn't kill by random, he kills those that the very person who keeps his head demands him. Says detective's prime rule 혩everyone is a suspect, and consequently the guilty is the less evident' Sleepy Hollow, fulfils this rule completely, furthermore, all those details seen throughout the film, have a certain explanation that is revealed at the end. Tim Burton once more share with us his most comprising view of the script and he makes us feel that we are really there and we are part of the story. Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en) writes a beautiful horror/romance fairy tale with Christina Ricci as its princess and Johnny Depp as her knight. Movies like this one, with this crew are to come!I rate it ------- 8/ 10",10,0,1,3 May 2001
Lost in Translation," Rapturous Masterpiece
","A striking, adult and poignant love story for the modern audience, Coppolla's sophomore effort demonstrates talent, intelligence and art way beyond her years.Everything from the title, the setting, the actions is designed for multiple interpretations and is filmed with such understated brilliance that conveys both the loneliness and the chemistry the main characters are going through. Lost In Translation might not be an easy film, but the way it asks you to discover, interpret and connect with the characters and their silent struggles makes the effort to make sense of it all the more rewarding. Udoubtly a film for the ages.",10,2,6,28 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not Only the best Star Wars, but the very best movie after the turn of the century...
","First, it is really important to say that I was never a truly devoted Star Wars Fan. It seems those days were over. Just coming out of my teenage years, I've always heard of the success of the Star Wars trilogy. When the Phantom Menace came out, I decided to go see it for what it was: a special effects and action SCI FI adventure, that managed to hit the blockbuster. I found it good but nothing Oscar like. Then I decided to watch the old trilogy that was really the old bang that we all know! I started to get familiar the overall story and I also realized that I found it really interesting. Then Attack of The Clones came. MAN! WHAT A THING!!! I can tell you, don't think of this as an exaggeration, 15 minutes into the movie, and it was already not only my favourite Star Wars film, but also one of my all time favourites.Everyone complains about the corny one lines between Anakin and Padmé, I won't disagree, since sometimes they were a little corny, but in no way spoiling. Some complained that the movie was a little slow paced sometimes. Which movie isn't? eventually when one of those scenes come, you feel a little bored, but then comes another action sequence, that pulls you right out of it! Normally, I don't do this but in this comment, I'll have to organize it in parts to be clearer:Story: GREAT! Fills some brackets left by the Phantom Menace, and leaves some others to be filled in the next episode. The characters relationships are more intertwined and all of them have an objective there even Jar Jar (seems impossible?! You'll see!)Dialogues: Not that good, but still there are some classics like `Anakin, why do I feel you'll be the death of me?'!;Acting: Better than before. If in Ep. 1 you wanted to shoot Jake Lloyd for once, and slap is mother in the face, in this one, there isn't a single bad actor, even Shmi is better. Unlike some said, Hayden Christiansen did a great job, showing action, drama and comedy whenever they were needed, even with Padmé  the always great and gorgeous Natalie Portman (God, how I like this girl...!)Action Sequences: Puts the great Matrix and Speed to shame! They are still classics (some of my favourite movies)  but the chase in Coruscant? The final Battle?  Figgin' great! Way to go!Fights: Like no one has seen before! Yoda vs. Dooku is already a classic (who could think that the old guy Yoda with a limp would kick Dooku's ass? I didn't after I saw it, I was amazed!) Obi Wan vs. Jango was also great, a little short, but great.Music: No one can deny that John Williams is a master, so his work on this one is nothing different. He still uses choirs a lot, and it works, he uses lots of drums, and it also works, however, sometimes I felt some Jerry Goldsmith's echoes in it, providing a more hyperbolic feeling to it  which was the perfect solution. Moreover, you can clearly tell that there are many parts where the music is from Phantom Menace, especially towards the end;Sets: Quite frankly, this, alongside the SFX and sound, were the best in the movie. My favourites were most definitely the planet Kamino. How I wanted t live there! It may seem like a horrible planet, but the internal sets, the aliens, Jango's apartment, put my jaw on the ground. You'll get me when you see it! All the other sets were astounding also  The Arena, Palpatine's Office, Padmé's dinning room, the Naboo city, the ships Every single thing!SFX: The best I've ever seen. Even way better than Hollow Man, Haunting and Matrix! I can't even say that one of them is corny. None! My favourite is most definitely and you have to agree with me, when the clones fire at one giant ball-like space ship and it falls to ground! AWESOME!Sound: The bombs in the Asteroid field made me want to hear that noise, time and time again. I mean, just great! The shooting and everything is also great.I can tell you, I never felt so pulled into a movie, like in this one. After I saw it the first time, I immediately reserved another ticket to the following day! That never happened to me before. This movie is now, most definitely one of my 5 favourite. You may think I'm stretching things too much, I'm not. It is perfect. I'm thinking of buying a DVD reader especially for this one. I can't wait to Episode III, which can only be worst, cause better than `Attack of The Clones' is strictly impossible!Go see for yourself, just like me! Perfect 10 out of 10!!

Lion," Intelligent, sensible and uplifting
","Slow, thoughtful and intelligent, Lion expertly and refreshingly avoids the typical clichés of the based-on-a-true-story-for-awards-season formula. The narrative, aptly split into two disparate narrative and linguistic halves, follows the real life events of Saroo, a young Indian boy who is lost on a train heading to Calcutta, wandering lost and alone for two months until he was brought to an orphanage and eventually adopted by an Australian family and relocated to Tasmania. Growing up forgetting is own mother tongue but never his family, his search for the exact whereabouts of his hometown and family, increasingly take a toll on his priorities. Garth Davis and Greg Fraser expertly capture the essence of loss and despair as well as familiarity and passion, in both Indian and Australian contexts, accentuating their intrinsic contrasting characteristics, while maintaining the characters' guiding thread. Films like Lion are hard to come by; the true story at the base is equally as important to the narrative as the way it is told: prudently and gratifyingly, supported by a minor yet powerhouse by Kidman.",8,1,2,23 January 2017
Notting Hill," Cheesy love story.
","First of all, I think that this movie was a bit overrated , in my opinion, it is not that good , and doesn't deserve the stamp of  `Perfect' on it, just `Normal'. Obviously the greatest triumph of this film, is of course Julia Roberts which is one of the most perfect and talented actresses nowadays. Of course, but that's me, in the opposite extreme is the most annoying than ever Hugh Grant. His lines (except one or two), his acting and his accent are unbearable, he plays a character that is supposed to be so normal', but centralized himself how center of everyone's attentions he is. Please better casting next time (Joseph/ Ralph Fiennes, Jude Law, Liam Neeson) The supporting cast, on the other hand is good and deserve praise for their work and for the way they acted their lines. Once more, what blew up the whole movie was Hugh Grant, and the inevitable perfect love story with almost nothing that stands on their way. CHEESY, but ENTERTAINING, BORING but  SOMEHOW INTERESTING.5/10",5,0,3,3 May 2001
The Bourne Identity," Jason is not the only thing that 'bournes'.
","Needless is to say that Matt Damon has been, for these last few years attached to great films, all of them made history for it's quality, The Talented Mr Ripley, most noticeably. However, the time came for a bad project to come. The wrongest thing in the Bourne Identity, is the plot and the directing, at points. The plot getss too confusing at times, maybe it was their wish, anyway when we discover what all of that was about, than it is much ado about nothing. Director Doug Liman is very effective sometimes, but can't keep up the rythm he put up himself. The chases and the fights are impressive and the camera movements are mind-freezing, but when the pressure be held, he forgets about it. Too bad. The cast, in its way is very good, Damon is a fine actor and always fits well in every role; German actress Franka Potente assures the comedy and the lovely good girl who starts with a good english, but by the end of the movie it gets worse and worse; Chris Cooper is good also, after American Beauty he is still looking for another memorable role. The biggest surprise is, however, Julia Stiles. To be honest I never really liked her but in this film, she proved otherwise. This film is not one of those that you can't say 'I loved it, its perfect', neither can you say 'Ew, what an huge peace of ****'. It has it's way of being enjoyable, unfortunately, it worked average for me.",5,1,2,17 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 178 of one thing, 30% of another.
","The Lord Of The Rings tells us 1- The Power Corrupts; 2- Even the simplest creature can save the world. All right, interesting premise. I took one minute writing it, the reader, took five seconds to read it, Peter Jackson took three hours to film it, that's the weakness and the strength of the movie. Truth must be said, The Lord of the Rings is 50% of boring and sometimes confusing dialogue, 20% of Discovery Channel landscapes and 30% of the most fantastic and breathtaking battle sequences ever seen, and are these same sequences, that drove the movie to its instant success. Visually the movie is stunning, production design, SFX, cinematography but facing it, length was a little stretched here and poisonous, also, the additional must have been taken out. Peter Jackson, didn't want to listen to it, once more three ours is the movie's biggest mistake, because there are movie's that are comprehensible to be three hours long, but not this one, alongside the ending. We haven't seen such an opened and hollow ending like this one since the Empire Strikes back, we all know there's going to be two sequels but shouldn't it be appropriate to put a `To Be Continued' on the middle of the screen, above the characters' head? The Lord Of The Rings is, anyway a good popcorn adventure, maybe, commercially the movie of the year, after Harry Potter, of course. Still 7 out of 10",7,0,0,14 January 2002
American Beauty," To everyone who likes to see a good satire and don't get impressed facing drugs sex or nudity.
","The Best: Annette Benning,  the smashing majority of the characters, the plot providing an actual satire and the touching directing The Worst: Kevin Spacey's office blackmail seemed came out of Fight Club'. The darker parts of the movie might be boring to some viewers, but those who think that are the ones haven't plunged completely into it. Rating: 7/10Alike millions of Americans, the Burnhams have a easy life in a nice house with green grass and a white fence in the outskirts of a big city. Lester, Carolyn and Jane Burnham are an attractive and kind family, but behind this apparent ideal life is hidden a big dysfunction. Lester, the narrator, reveals us that he hates his job, his wife ignores him and his daughter despises him. He feels his life completely on the ground but an encounter with his daughter's best friend wakes in him long time sleepy feelings that lead him into a radical change. This is the beginning point of a narrative that chronicles how a loser can become a winner even losing everything.
The major strength of American Beauty are the well elaborated character interactions, that besides the Burnhams includes a teenager drug consumer/ negotiator, his father a rude ex marine core, Jane's best friend, a real estate manager lover of Carolyn, etc. In his directorial debut, Sam Mendes creates a singular, powerful, and intelligent master piece, about unhappiness, loneliness in the middle age, which tone varies between realism and parody showing Lester's possible redemption of his life, following what his heart tells to reach happiness even if it leads him into a tragic ending. American Beauty his a blast of fresh hair oh the way Hollywood satirises the contemporary society aye resulting in its five Oscars; Best Picture, Director, Leading Actor, Photography and plot.",10,2,4,18 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," The ending worths the movie.
","When one sees the movie poster of Ocean's Eleven, one sees it is directed by last year's academy award winner director Steven Soderbergh, and it stars a fantastic cast, uniting some of the most talented actors nowadays. The story isn't new, everyone knows that, a man recently came out of prison, wants to rob three casinos. Starts hiring professionals to do it, but soon we know that he is not doing this work only by the pleasure of stealing. He is also doing this because the casino's owner wife happens to be his ex-wife, whom he wants back. Done. The movie itself is disappointing halfway in, I myself wondered in what mess I was, and how much disappointed I was, also, I became aware that Steven Soderbergh ISN'T the director they make of him.  He is not that great. There are some directors, which we recognize their work, miles away, by being unique. Soderbergh's work is recognizable not for it, but to be similar to many others: shoulder cameraÂ… Only when the end was coming I start thrilling myself. Twists. A worlwhind of twists one after another, all of them making perfect sense. By the end I could tell what elegance it was, not the beginning, not the middle, but the ending. All eleven characters working together at the same time. The robbing itself was great, and Brad Pitt's call was humorous but expiring charm and intelligence. After all, Ocean's Eleven is not what many expected of it. Is just us watching a talented cast doing something good and fun. Don't expect your life to change, don't expect an average action film, expect a movie that could have been great if the pace was always the same... 7 out of 10",1,1,7,18 March 2002
Spirited Away," Chihiro's room with a view.
","It's not something new that chinese and japanese animation has always inspire, dazzle and marvel all of us, westerns. Despite quality (in some cases good; in others, bad) the sets, the characters, the animation and the colors always made us want to plunge inside the screen to follow the adventures in their quest; most noticebly, in my personal opinion, the Tv Series 'Evangelion'. When the trailor to the voyage of Chiriro hit the theatres, not a single skeptical and even so called hateful eye, could manage to blame any of its excentricities and its obvious scientific impossibilities. but has we have seen in many other movies before, either animated or not, many of them are not attempting at plausibility, they're rather a metaphor. What this movie r is all about is love, and how we can step out of our fearful world to try to catch our beliefs, save the ones we love. In that area, the movie plainly fulfills its mission: it has emotion everywhere, being that same emotion supported by a dazzling animation. Mutch to my desmay, I truly wanted to like Chihiro, but it became somewhat of a bore: like many other movies it could have been told in half the running time, some scenes were totally expendable, and somewhere around the middle of the movie, it becomes a total compliment to gore and dirtyness. Sincerelly, over two hours of dazzling animation aren't enough to make a movie all that great. In the bottom line, as for me, the movie only was average worthy in the instrumental main theme; Chiriro 'flying' from room to room towards Yobaba and Chihiro's fabulous view from her room. It's eye candy, in fact, but it doesn't make us plunge. That's its main and fatal sin.",3,7,24,10 March 2003
Jackie," It's not a one woman show; it's a triumph on all counts.
","Biopics are a thorny undertaking. The usual old-school and conventional films attempted to re-count the subject's whole life ticking every required box both narratively and artistically. The proliferation of biopics or TV series, despite making the genre and the approach tiresome and unimaginative never really determined its disappearance or decline. In recent years however biopics are offered in different clothing, a characterization of the figure, focusing on a single defining event.The film depicts Jackie Kennedy's four days following husband and then President John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas in 1963. The film's biggest strength is however what might pull away most: it's very personal, circumspect, sombre and emotionally violent approach. As the film unfolds, you realise that there would be no better way of telling this story, of defining this figure and this event. Larraín's firm, precise and artistic lens doesn't leave Portman for a minute, catching Jackie's every emotion, from the most contained glare to every discomposure. Despite being an almost one-woman-show it is not Portman's competent yet slightly caricatural performance that defines Jackie; it's the amalgamation of comprehensive talent, from the spotless art direction and costume design, to the elegant cinematography and overbearing yet appropriate score that altogether elevate the work.",8,0,0,17 February 2017
Resident Evil," Satisfies the fans; and scares the others.
","As common knowledge has it, Resident Evil is based on a computer game from the same name, which, due to its success, and Hollywood's last fashion of bringing to the big screen wether it is computer games or comic-book heroes, Was brought by competent director Paul W.S. Anderson into a gore filled film. As I stated before two probable reasons stand to explain why the computer game was transformed into a movie: First, as Resident Evil was one of the most profitable computer games ever, a movie adaptation wouldn't take very long. Second as lately many computer games (Mortal Combat) or Comic book heroes have a movie adaptation (X Men; Spider Man), Resident Evil - The Movie should be coming any time now. Frankly, I've never played the game before, although I've knowledge of it, which is why I know how the main story goes. Perhaps what is more noticeable is the sense of claustrofobia that not only the actors, but the viewer feel 2km underground. When we get into a movie like this, we already know, we're not going to see some masterpiece, the screenplay will not be something amazingly deep, but one can tell that was never the intention of the producers. Their intention was undoubtfully to suck the viewers in, make them jump, scream, sweat tremble, laugh and become frightned. If that was the intention, congratulations, you made it. Kudos, mainly to the Director. If the intention was some underlined one, like character development or story's depth, they failed. But as the intention was the first one, then Resident Evil, is one of the most enjoyable and job fulfilling movies recently. The cast is not exacly big stars, with the exception of Milla Jovovich, but that doesn't matter all that much because the movie was an enormous success, mainly because of the talent of increasingly rising young stars, like Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Eric Mabius. Finaly, what probabily shocked people the most was the completely opened end. That doesn't mean anything else than 'sequel next year'. B-movie? Yes. Funny? Sure Enjoying?

Batman Begins," A Controversial Reboot, But a Won Battle.
","A lot has been written about this Batman sequel. Or Prequel. Or Reboot. Prior to watching the movie, you can think of it in either of these three assumptions. We can rule out the option of it being a sequel for a number of reasons: the story itself tells how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and how he learned to face his fears and create his alter-ego known as Batman; also because the pace, the approach and the lack of theatricals that characterized the previous four movies is gone. You can also rule out the option of it being a prequel since if that were the intention, the previously mentioned pace and approach would have to comply with the other movies. So that leaves us with this movie being a reboot. But is it a fair, genuine and faithful reboot? In my opinion it is. Very. The reason why is because this movie was able to make me a person interested in the Batman myth and saga, which I wasn't. Tim Burton (although one of the three best directors nowadays) made the first two movies a Saturday morning fun ride entertainment for kids very much in the line of what was the spirit of the comics. Than Joel Schumacher stepped in and simply assassinated, commercially and critically the good image that the Batman character had. So when Christopher Nolan came in, he not only had a huge responsibility on his shoulders being the one carrying the whole franchise either to forgetfulness or he could get people to love Batman and make them eager to watch its movies again. Fortnately it was the latter. Batman Begins is a very solid movie, more adult-orientated and explores Bruce Wayne's hopes, fears and memories without making a martyr out of him. Also the task is hugely favored by the fact that he has a stellar cast helping, with Christian Bale as the new Batman and people like Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache, Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy creating a strong film that makes you follow it in the edge of your seat, never losing pace and be truly interested on how the complex story develops either by the skills of the director or the performances full of complexity and chemistry of the priceless cast.",8,0,1,28 January 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," OK, let's (try) not to contradict it...
","The Best: all the most amazing fights (despite Matrix-like) but these were so good that the Matrix ones are bad when compared to these. And visually the movie results as eye candy, that was very well edited and the action musics were good, but the best was the cinematography, and Ang Lee succeded in transporting us to a China that everyone would be delighted to live in. The Worst:  despite of being passed in some kind of Fairy Tale (AH!, AH!, AH!, AH!, AH!), when they were flying you could really tell they were attached to wires, even though you couldn't actually see them, even by the positions they flied. The love story background was supposed to be short but actually it occupied 70% of the film. 4/10I think that in this film I won't even loose my time describing the plot (call me an idiot schmuck but halfway in the movie I was just thinking of the battle scenes nothing more). Kudos to Ang Lee once more by his job, and to Michele Yeoh. Chow Yun-Fat, I don't like him. Oh by the way the ending didn't like it although it was beautifully imaged, filmed and directed, corny ideas though.Oh I forgot.

Coyote Ugly," Just don't expect your life to change...
","Coyote Ugly is just another version of the old story: Interior girl dreams to be a singer, travels to New York to fulfill her dream. Things go wrong, and she ends up doing a completely different thing: a dancer in a night bar. The difference here is that we haven't seen a story like this lately, that's why it might seem new.

Jurassic World," We will always have Jurassic Park.
","Jurassic Park was not only a decade defining film, it was a technical wonder, wisely balancing fun, spectacle, adventure, horror and comedy in a sharp and sensible way. The sequels that followed paled in comparison to the original, but still retained a sense of fun and understanding. Cut to 2015. Thank you Colin Trevorrow. Thank you for uninspiringly and atrociously murdering an already quality declining franchise that land-marked my childhood. Jurassic World went through development hell, a roulette of screenwriters and directors that at one point or another were deemed unfit or felt the story needed betterment. It's all the more revolting that the final product we were given is such a lazy, blunt and appalling rehash or update of the original entry. Every plot point is uninspired, every single idea is pedestrianly realised and every look overly stylized and saturated. As a devout film fan myself, whose list of guilty pleasure or so-bad- that's-so-good films is almost embarrassing to admit, I found(ind) that Jurassic World cannot in anyway qualify to any of such categories. This is a franchise that I followed as I grew up, spawned by one of the most marvelous films ever made; this fourth entry though managed to shamelessly spit on its legacy, reduce it to laziness and banality, to a level of insulting dullness. Once more, let us thank and grant Trevorrow such honour.",2,3,3,21 February 2017
Logan," No comprende
","Wolverine has had quite a bumpy and uneven ride since Jackman took on the role back in 2000. He's been in the main trilogy, he's made appearances in the prequel-trilogy and has had also three spin-offs of his own. As charismatic as the character and the actor playing him are, all of his stand alone outings ended up lacking just that: charisma.While Origins is often pinned down as a disaster, The Wolverine follow up ended up being a truly catastrophic mess; and despite Mangold's efforts to make amends in this final outing, 'Logan' is not as strong as it should have been and also isn't the proper conclusion the character needed. The whole selling point was to adapt the Old Man Logan comic as the send-off to the iconic mutant with an R-Rating, an approach the character was craving for since 2000. The gripping action is there, the acting is unexpectedly superior for comic-book films' standards and there's enough character development to elevate the film. Nevertheless, Mangold somehow manages to have the film feel uncomfortably familiar, predictable and deficient denoting a weak directing pulse and sense of conclusion urgency. As an avid X-Men fan and Jackman's interpretation of Wolverine, I ended up finding all three of the solo outings lacking in a way the ensemble ones (even the weaker ones) never did; he has inhabited Wolverine from day one and it is quite astonishing how he's made 9 appearances in the franchise and none of those felt flat, phoned-in or tired. It was a fully physical and emotional commitment to the mythos that honestly doesn't leave much space left for anyone else to take on or reinterpret(although sadly, we know it's bound to happen).",6,4,17,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Another 200 plus million Whedon Self Indulgence porn fest.
","The assembled Avengers cinematic universe, as well as each character's standalone film(s) is intended as an homage to a long standing property, fore fronting entertainment and nostalgia above substance and development. That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the 'creative' liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clichéd and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.All his might seem a contradictory coming from a self-proclaimed summer blockbuster superhero film fan. It might even seem more contradictory review coming from a huge X-Men, a fan that manages to somehow find redeeming qualities and saving graces in the weakest entries (and there are nine of them). The case with The Avengers franchise though is that an already overcrowded ensemble unites for sequels upon sequels, not to mention their own parallel trilogies that also include mini reunions of sorts, with absolutely no originality or saving grace other than the massive wide spectacle of worldwide destruction. Call it cynicism, call it incoherence. I call it overgrowing exhaustion with this franchise.",2,5,9,8 March 2017
La La Land," Astounding. The title says it all.
","I've come to realize that current award season paranoia is more detrimental to the film industry than beneficial. Whether lobby riddled or tailor made, the very release calendar is designed to make the biggest splash for award recognition, rather than allowing every film, every topic and every discussion to have room to exist and grow. Or not.La La Land is one such example of a film that gathered momentum from its early premiere and rapturous reviews in Venice until a disproportionate attention worldwide - not undeserving (it is every bit justified) but because the attention was given for all the wrong reasons. Musicals are not an easy sell by definition; progressivists may consider it is way past its sell-by date and purists may consider the latest outings as travesties or lacking the charm of the classics.News flash: La La Land proves exactly the opposite. It is an unambitious, unpretentious, anachronistic love letter to old musicals, jazz, Los Angeles and love stories. It is a hard sell and specially not a product for everyone. Just because marketing momentum rubs a film in your face, it doesn't mean it is for you. An essential characteristic of being a film lover is understanding that every film finds its audience and not the other way around; and while some films appeal to a wider audience it doesn't mean that every film that sweeps individual award recognition amounting to a considerable number has to appeal to all. La La Land is a film that haters love to hate; not and for years to come. For those who don't deliberately walk into it with either cynical or preconceived disposition to destroy it, you'll find a heartwarming ode to a dying art (musicals or jazz alike), never mind thinly plotted, or with a sparsely uneven pace, that will pull you to a carefree make belief alternate world. Isn't it the point of the genre anyway?",9,2,8,27 January 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Well, upgrades; so to speak.
","Well, one thing is getting more evident as these few years pass by: while in the 70's Star Wars made millions of fans go to the theatres and buy merchandise; now, in the late 90's and early 21 st century, piles and piles of movies try up to be the inheriters of the Star wars saga: The Matrix, X Men, Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter. When the first Matrix came out back in 1999, it became an instant success: it had a provoking message, state of the art special effects and truly dazzling gravity-less fights. Within a year hundreds of movies referenced in bigger or smaller amounts, the fights that changed movie History. It isn't necessary to be the movie's Oracle, to understand that sooner or later the sequel (or maybe two!) would be coming with the underling of being truly essential to the story. And as they said many times troughout the movie, upgrades have been done. In every possible aspect... of technology. All the subtileness of the first movie is now gone to leave room for special effects fanfare and sound galore. However the storyline and provoking messages were lost among the four year lasting filming, that clearly only took that long for the sake of its dazzling action sequences and special effects; so it is sad to report that after four years of waiting, Reloaded is clearly inferior to the predecessor, because the Watchowskis pushed farfetched more than they actually could, so this sequel commits all the mistakes the lower sequels do: reference success movies as much as they can. Regarding that, Star Wars fans will rejoice, since the references to the galaxy far, far away abound -- the whole of Zion, the counsil and the counselors, the ships and the trio of heros. But the filmmakers weren't satisfied: they had to invade the comic books, specially the far better X2: Neo can take any hard hit like if he had an iron skeleton like Wolverine; he's telechinetic like Jean Grey; he controls bullets like Magneto, and if it wasn't enough he had to be superman either. The film can be nitpicked - as it is being gradually - but it is not that bad, popcorn at its most. So far the year has clearly a winner: X Men 2 over the Matrix Reloaded, Hugh Jackman over Keanu Reeves, and while The Matrix has dozens of fights and slightly better special effects, X Men 2 has Nightcrawler's homicide attempt on the president, that solely beats the entire Reloaded thing.7 out of 10.",7,0,0,23 May 2003
The Fountain," Beautiful Masterpieces just don't come by everyday
","Every year there's the more or less provocative and philosophical film, that naturally, because of its contents tends to provoke two completely different opinions. Either you firmly defend it and love it, or you hate it and attack it. There's no way of escaping this dichotomy for the simple reason that a movie like the Fountain is a movie that is character driven and their proof of love requires an elevate suspension of disbelief from the viewer. If you are not one of those, than don't even consider watching this movie, but if you are, if you let yourself be carried away buy the beauty of the images, the intensity of the characters and the devotion to one purpose, than you will most certainly enjoy and praise the Fountain as much as I did. Quite frankly I cannot imagine Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett taking the place of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. They took the characters and made them their own. Although Weisz is extraordinary in Izzy's skin, is Jackman's take on Tommy that is the true engine of the movie. He composes three different characters in three different approaches but with the same love driven obsession. I myself reckon that at the beginning the movie does suffer not only from unmanaged pace but also from the viewer's eventual detachment from the story. But although the movie runs for 90 minutes it is more than enough to tell three different stories. I reckon that Fountain haters might criticize it for narrative confusion and some questions left unanswered or not explained, but that's not its purpose. We are meant to believe and connect with these two characters and their motives, strengths, weaknesses and actions. And we do. Thanks to Aronofsky, Weisz but most specially to Jackmans true masterpiece and Clint Mansell. The Foutntain would not have been the same without him: his soundtrack is a poem of love, tragedy, loss and beauty that very rarely has Hollywood presented us.",10,7,11,18 March 2007
The Witch," Unsetteling
","The less you know about this film before you watch it, the better. The themes could find no better setting than the 17th century New England recluse scenery where this mythos has the precise place to exist and expand on its own.First time writer/director Robert Eggers is given (almost) full liberty to embrace and elaborate on the weird and the hypnotic, creating an ever-growing and unsettling atmosphere of fear and discomfort. The film hearkens back to those classical psychological frightening horror movies of old, such as Rosemary's Baby or The Haunting where more is made out of less: suggestion is key, actual display is minimal (but ever present and upcoming). When the time comes, the unsettlement is so severe that the Gothic-demented folkloric horror shown grabs hold of whatever composure is left. The Witch is a superior film, masterfully shot and executed, not designed for repeated viewings but intended for a lasting imprint of fear and homage to the mythology it is inspired by.",7,12,25,3 February 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Kong is not King anymore.
","Whether the world was in a desperate need for another King Kong or not seems immaterial after watching this. The underlying and rather obvious justification is to make way for a future crossover with another tired franchise (hello Godzilla) as money-making scheme - the same way Marvel has been doing for the past decade, revisiting, rebooting and ultimately exhausting Spider Man's and Hulk's properties.On paper I blamed this reboot, seeing as Peter Jackson's 2005 passion project was both overlong and over-the-top but fun and engaging in equal measure. He provided an ambitious scope, not only on a technical level, to an iconic property rendering a product that is proud and respectful of its legacy but also autonomous on its own.This 2017's outing however lacks both the same comprehensive talent and commitment and, just 12 years after that last successful adaptation, feels rather soon and unnecessary. For entertainment purposes though, all this reasoning and opposition could be waived if done right - and for a moment, as the first promotional materials started emerging (specially an astounding first trailer), it seem like it was. Nevertheless, Kong: Skull Island is guilty of not only proving those initial fears right, as it is of being utterly pedestrian and cheesy to an annoying degree.The story (save for the time setting), the functional autopilot characters and the motivations are the same and nothing shows a glimmer of originality or audacity. Don't get me wrong, that is not necessarily a bad thing - some summer blockbusters and recent entertainment tent poles have had the same approach with very enjoying results (Prometheus did that for me, for instance). I found myself continuously trying to find a saving grace for Kong: Skull Island, because the seamlessly magnificent cinematography and direction (of the action scenes particularly) kept me interested, kept me awed, kept me rooting - all to the point where the film had spiraled out of control into pure formulaic tawdry formula beyond redemption. The film knows it is cheesy and Vogt knows that's its selling point and that's what we came for but the forceful toleration of suspension of disbelief and exaggeration beyond reason implies we have ever cared for any of the human characters or for the central Kong, a misunderstood hero and protector. But no, we have never cared.",4,6,13,23 March 2017

Arrival," Thinking person's sci-fi.
","Villeneuve indeed has taken advantage of the latest trend of Alien's obsession with Amy Adams in which is, perhaps, the best film of either one's career. Building slowly and potently into the viewers mind, although slightly marred by a somewhat disjointed second act, Villeneuve's approach easily overtakes previous films with similar plot points by making the best use of an impeccable technical team in service of a sharp emotional script by Eric Heisserer. To further discuss the film without spoiling it is next to impossible. Everything from the premise, to the title and to the imagery are clues and spoilers to the film's purpose. Here's hoping, and it certainly is looking like it, that this venture into the sci-fi genre is justly rewarded come award season in more than the technical categories. Villeneuve, Adams and Heisserer certainly deserve so.",9,4,10,6 December 2016
Scream," I'll scream right back!
","The Best: Being the first  in the series of the over explored teen horror movies, the fact of being the pioneer. This first chapter as well as the third were the ones that scared more the viewer as well as were the more laughable ones relating to the black humour. The Worst: The movie has almost two hours but as well as any good movie it passes like it had only half an hour, which is something that can be not good. Rating: 8/ 10Two young teenagers have been murdered by a dysfunctional killer that took his love for scary movies one step too far the day after on the local high school of Woodsboro, the police is in a commotion, every student his being asked about their relationships with the frustrated students. This story is particularly interesting the young student Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her group of friends, her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Tatum (Rose McGowan), Dewey (David Arquette), Stu (Mathew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and the opportunist reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Sidney's relationship with Billy isn't the best currently as her mother's one year death anniversary approaches, having in the background all of these sudden and macabre deaths on campus. Deaths are becoming more frequent, bodies pile' up, Sidney gets attacked, never knowing in who to trust she realizes that the deaths are all coming each time closer to her The killer seems to be everywhere at any time, to scare everyone.As I said, after this movie movies with a killer with a knife chasing high school students and killing them start appearing countlessly. Although, the script and general quality of this movie started being insulted and imitated with movies trying to let themselves too seriously, of course failing Anyway, Scream always came out as a winner and it still remains so as a common know.  Not to be forgotten that this movie is considered one of the all time best horror films, and my God it deserves it so much! Like a declaration I heard sometime ago: ` Horror/ Scary movies are only good and really frightening when they can happen to anyone, at any place, at any time'.I was to write this review a few time ago, but I decided to go rent this movie again so I could be more inspired doing it. One tip: the perfect set is alone at house or with your friends at night lights off, closed doors, window(s) opened and curtains closed dancing in the wind! One last thing, a goof actually, one that really p***ed me off: when Casey Becker gets killed, and hanged on the tree, you can clearly see that she is a toy or a stunt as the faces are completely different, and when `someone' is killed on the garage and electrocuted you can clearly tell that it is a toy by the look of its skin.Don't wait and go see it, if you already have, do it again! 8/10",8,0,0,18 September 2001
Mother!," mother-load!
","I felt as lost, baffled, confused and astonished as Lawrence's nominal character throughout the film. I tried to hold on to any kind of narrative sense or to any parallelism to previous films in an attempt to get a hint of where this was going. It is by the time the film enters its overblown third and final act where all logic, common sense and rationality seem to go out the window, that I realized that this is a) no ordinary film b) no ordinary narrative and c) its divisive reception is being supported by all the wrong reasons. I've heard and read the words pompous, pretentious and conceited thrown around senselessly. I don't think mother! is any. The fact that this film is headlined by Lawrence pulls perhaps the wrong audience for this particular piece; but if an audience is pulled to a film expecting a product more akin to the star(s)'s previous work is an error that is all but uncontrollable, the finger of blame though should be pointed at the studio itself for selling a film for something it is not. Make no mistake, mother! is not the traditional horror film nor a suspenseful film. It is yes a scary allegorical and metaphorical film, in a genre of its own that entices - as it well should - split reactions and discussions. It is perhaps more of a discussion piece rather than a wide release audience appealing film. As thought provoking, visual and emotionally violent as it is, the film is a brutal exercise that is getting the attention for that misguidance. I truly hope that Aronofsky's latest gets all the attention, discussion and care it deserves, perhaps in time with a cult following an audience that wants to watch it, debate it and either praise or diminish it with substantiated arguments.",8,1,5,22 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Mild.
","Both Batman and Superman have had troubled depictions on film; some were great, some were terrible, some were mild. 'Dawn of Justice' as a sequel/ reboot/ re-imagining emulates just that: mildness. From its genesis, the film rampaged the internet first in anticipation, then awe, then complete and utter disappointment. Is it justified? It is not by any means a horrible film nor is it bad; it is a film that strives to be an epic touchstone and ends up as an all confusing stem of prequels/sequels, stand-alone and Avenger-style mash-ups that already has audiences fearful of the outcome. All hail Zack Snyder, (1) a Nolan disciple and wannabe, that values style over substance; (2) that managed to assemble an array of fine/serviceable actors and turning them into autopilot versions of themselves that seem to never fully commit to the roles at hand; (3) and mustered the courage to ignore the best days of Batman (Nolan's). What are we left with? A lost cast, a convoluted script, characters' childish and messy motives worthy of Nickelodeon special, and Gadot the only introduction that widely promising.",4,3,7,1 April 2016
Signs," Chilling ; Part 2.
","When someone, nowadays is shown a movie about aliens, than you should think : so far some of them were great, luring Independence Day away. But then you see it's a Shymalan film; than it becomes obligatory. Quite frankly, the movie started slowly, but great but in the mid part of the movie I was thinking that it was actually the worst movie of Shymalan. That was when the carpet was pulled from under my feet: as off the imminent attack warning, specially the ending and the basement sequence, I was shocked. I'm rarely scared in movies, but the reflection on the Tv screen near the end made me stop thinking. That only happened before with the Others. Than I knew, Shymalan didn't let us down. The whole suggestion of everything scares us. A lot. That's why Shymalan and Aménabar belong to the same school and restricted group of fear geniuses. Shymalan keeps his trademark, scary, suspenseful films with a major twist in the end. Sign's final twist is nowhere near as bombastic as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable's; but it is truly unexpected, and it isn't senseless. If you don't believe, go check for yourself, however take notice that as off the basement sequence, despite sublime it is also scary. Prepare; Beware; Behold!",3,1,1,3 November 2002
Speed," Unparalleled fantastic action film.
","Where can I start with? What makes me think that this movie is one of the best movies ever? So many things really acting, directing, script, tension, music and tons of action. But as James Bond would say: `First things first', Jan De Bont made his directorial debut in this film, what would be expected from a person with no experience in this matter was a lousy film, with story potential. But happened the opposite, the action scenes are so perfect that sometimes makes us think about nothing else and keep us in the edge of our seat every time we see it. Never leaving the extremely inventive plot behind, it is a movie that actually makes the actors show what they can really do, more than ever before. Sound and special effects were actually over the top and weren't showing us, that they were all that this movie had to give as many movies around show. Finally, I just want to call your attention to the fabulous score composed by Mark Mancina that is one of the best ever on movie industry and is one of the main factors that helps us feel so interested and affected by the movie's action scenes.I recommend this movie to everyone, no exaggeration, I give it a 9/10.",10,1,2,3 May 2001
X2: X-Men United," Wolverine:'It's good!' Magneto:'You have no idea!'
","That's precisely what, in the end, resumes all of this magnificent journey into the world of mutants for the second time. The sequel that took three years to make, with an ensamble cast of 12 leading characters had all the ingridients to fail; but Bryan Singer knew what he was doing. It isn't too much to say that this X2 actually manages to surpass the original movie in every single aspect you can point out. For our luck, both of Bryan Singer's versions of the X Men are, as Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart said, worthy of being Shakespearian. All the characters have depth, are given a background, and enough room to move around and show off without clouding anyone else. This time, the storyline goes in deeper than it was three years ago, so the plot isn't quite just an underlining matter for the special effects. While all the action movies lately that were worhty of recognition first built up in the first part of the movie so they could 'burst' in the other half. Well, X Men 2 starts with that 'burst', with one fo the best action sequences in recent memory: an homicide attempt on the President of the US, by the new mutant around, Nightcrawler, played by the surprising Alan Cumming. What we could all fear whereas the movie would drop down from there on, it didn't happen. It kept the pace, never leaving the plot behind. Anyway, the movie's big winner is once more leading star Hugh Jackman, that walks away once more with an extraordinary performance and a character compositing that makes us like this Wolverine personna even more. So we wait anxiously for the hopefully upcoming sequel with the whole cast returning, and Hugh Jackman's next leading role on Van Helsing.

","The wait is finally over for all the fans of the comic book saga from Stan Lee. The sequel from one of the major blockbuster hits of 2000 has arrived; and it isn't to much to say that it has surpassed the original. By that, this movie makes history being one of the first, IF NOT THE FIRST sequel to actually manage to be better than the original. The budget is bigger, the cast is larger and better, the plot is deeper, the action and the situation are more compelling and the special effects, although outstanding, do not treat the plotline or the characters as secondary. X2 picks up where X Men left wrapped up, so the characters have little evolution from the previous situation they were: still unaccepted by society and now with a bigger problem: General William Stryker, a cold hearted man full of rage by his wife's death due to their son's mutation problem, goes much further than Senator Kelly ever did. He wants to use Professor Xavier and his Cerebro to put down every living mutant on the face of the earth, so things can come back to normality. All the previous characters and actors are back, this time better looking and with expanded roles and screen time. It's not to much to say that X Men is everything Spider Man could have been and isn't. It is already a new Star Wars saga, because the wonder, the beauty, the action and the actors manage to attract unfamiliared viewers, what also contributed to this success was the fantastic trailer, that was undoubtely the best trailer of the year, and actually didn't steal to much of the movie, because it still had much to give. Every one involved in the project specially the actors  should be congratulated for their work, most specially Hugh Jackman for his excellent composition of Wolverine. Professor Xavier ends up the movie with one magnificent sentence that should be applied to the X MEN saga: 'We're here to stay'!10 out of 10",10,0,0,14 May 2003

Dr. Crowe is now handed a new case of a kid named Cole Sear which is said to have serious problems, not only at home, but also at school, and with his friends, which call him a big time freak. Cole's family background is not the best his father left and he is emotionally blocked by this, his mother is constantly depressed when confronted to her son's regular problems as well as stressed by keeping her two jobs at the same time. As soon as Crowe starts knowing Cole better, he realizes that he his no ordinary child, he has so much more depth that he could ever imagine, also Cole states that he has encounters and that he is surrounded by dead people. Dead people, How? `They are walking around like regular people, they don't know they're dead () Please make them leave.  I'm working on it.'

Final Destination," Loner Scream.
","Loner Scream, you may be asking whyÂ…. The meaning of this headline is maybe confuse but totally wrapped in sense, I mean since the fantastic Scream came out, we have been completely banged by some lame movies in the same line, trying to be as great or greater that Scream ever was, Urban Legend is an example. But this Final Destination despite of being a movie with the same lines as Scream, teenagers getting killed one by one, gallons of blood spilt and as much gore as Van Damme's bad acting. Alex Browning is a teenager going on a trip to France with his school. As soon as he gets in the plane, Alex over seas the plane exploding, killing every passenger aboard. Alex warns everybody but only him, five friends of his and a teacher get out. Everyone gets mad at Alex as they see the plane taking of without them aboard, while all of the sudden the plane explodes in front of their eyes just like Alex dreamt it would. They've cheated death, but death won't let them cheat it again, so they start dying one by one through a pattern that Alex later discovers. We may criticize horror movies for being always so much alike, but that's the way they are, it's a competition everyone of them is trying to be better that the other ones. The difference that this movie states it's it's own killer, it's not a Ghostface, nor a mad man behind a mask, is the death itself, it isn't a highly developed CGI creature, every time death was coming all you saw was wind or shadows. As to be predicted in the center of the story is almost the most intelligent being in the face of the Earth who always has an answer for everything, has always a plan in his head and bla, bla, bla, we all know that and is not a shock for anyone. What makes this movie a loner is that it is not as predictable as the other thousands, making it a loner however it is still Scream. Acting is averaged Devon Dawa wasn't the right choice while Ali Larter was (let's forget that this beautiful girl ever got into one of the worst movies ever made: The House On Haunted Hill). One of the deaths is gracious is completely unexpected and violent and also so great as the very last one in the movie.

","Yeah, the Replacements didn't have many hits with the public, sincerely, I don't know why, the movie is not lifetime changing, it's just really funny, and there's more: Keanu Reeves.

The replacements have a thin story, which may have been done many times before, only this time, was done better, it is clearly, the best football movie ever. It is very fun, you will certainly laugh at it, and it's also interesting, because the characters all of them have depth, all of them have a cause to fight for. It's worth watching, not one of those you see and get hugely disappointed, I would give it a 7, but Keanu Reeves makes it an 8!

Mad Max: Fury Road," Who CHANGED the World? Miller did.
","As fast, exhilarating, over the top and relentless as possible, Mad Max Fury Road is exactly the film that we want and that it needs to be. Visionary George Miller shows us that a two hour chase film can simultaneously be a jaw-dropping work of cinematic art in every visual and technical aspect as well as surprisingly deep and metaphoric story.Thirty years after the end of the iconic trilogy, Miller revisits the iconic dystopian world he created and inevitably defined the late 1970's and 80's, boasting a new cast and making use of the best modern technology in the way of practical effects and filming techniques demoting digital effects to bare minimum. Despite being a Mad Max- character centered franchise, Theron's Furiosa gets equal if not more prominence than Hardy's charismatic Rockatansky in a film that raises feminist issues left and right despite its high octane macho cover. Miller does this with such effortless insight and balance that we never feel any kind of unnecessary or forced agenda being rubbed in your faces.Fury Road might certainly not be a film for everyone but its instant classic and landmark appeal is undeniable. Gorgeously shot, impeccably acted and frenetically edited and scored (Brothers In Arms by Tom Holkenborg is one of the best cues in recent memory) Fury Road is an exemplary piece of filmmaking to remember for all the good reasons.",10,4,11,4 January 2017
Gladiator," Academy was right!
","-The Best: Russell Crowe, Connie Nielsen, the evil River Phoenix, the directing, plot, music, cinematography, the outstanding battle scenes which lead this film to be one of the best of all time. Synopsis: the whole movie. -The Worst:????????????????? -Rating: 9/10Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is chosen to be the new emperor of Rome after Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) instead of his son Commodus (River Phoenix), which becomes a corrupt prince by killing his father and claiming himself has the new emperor of Rome. As soon as Commodus has his hands on the power he orders the army to kill General Maximus and his family. It happens that Maximus survives the attack, but not does the family that is burned and crucified alive. Maximus is found unconscious on the ground by a group of nomads who turn himself in a gladiator called Spaniard specially known for his combat skills and are these very skills that take him to Rome to fight in the Colosseum as a Gladiator. Also in Rome Maximus calls everyone's attention once more by his combat skills which  moves the emperor to know who that Spaniard Gladiator is. It is in this moment that appears one of the movie's best lines:  My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix legions, loyal to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and now I will have my vengeance, in this life or in the next.'. Commodus is now frightened to see that his control of the empire is dropping and the people's love for him is each time dropping as well arranges some plan to make the new hero of Rome be forgotten in less than nothingOnce more, revealing the rest of the movie's plot would certainly be really boring and somehow useless because there's almost no one who haven't seen this masterpiece already. Regarding to the movie's evident quality there aren't needed anymore words uttered by another viewer like me, as this year's Oscar nominations speak for themselves. Start running to the Oscar ceremony as the clear favourite, Gladiator's final number of Oscars ended up being somewhat like a big disappointment (there were only five). However the awards delivered to the movie were all fair besides the Visual Effects one. I can tell that I am one of the biggest defenders of this movie, but if the recreation of one big city would have been done in some other movie it would certainly be forgotten or ignored by the academy to the nominations list, in my opinion what led to the big astonishment regarding to this effects was the fact that no one have seen the city of Rome in good old times of the empire so fully created before. It is clear to everyone's eyes that the Special Visual Effects are quite more flawless and astonishing in one of the other nominees Hollow Man. Due to it's acceptance to the big audience it is now a matter of opinion but you can't surely disagree that the effects were eye candy and all the work developed by the computer wise men should have been rewarded by the Academy (see for example the scene were Kevin Bacon disappears, only that about- five minutes scene will show all of you how right I am). Regarding to the other Oscars unfortunately Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stole almost all the awards that should have been given to Gladiator. It seems that critics and now the Academy are completely going nuts by those poor Tiger and Dragon that don't even appear on the movie But now getting back to the centre of the arena where movies like this one are considered minor when compared to movies that show a cheesy and ordinary love story that should have been water down along with the boat, we have to consider ourselves' lucky to have (only) five Oscars when we should have had 11 (Special Effects out  explained before-) Well, right now when there is lesser space for writing, before I will go back to my resting place, I should (of Course) congratulate all the ones that were responsible of bringing back Roman empire: Ridley Scott's aggressive and reachable vision, Russell Crowe's power which was capable of filling even more the Coliseum, an other powerful artist named Connie Nielsen, who by one single look meaned not what a thousand words could. See it, enjoy it, it might be tragic and get 5 Oscars instead of  11, but at least it is not tragic, ridiculous winning 11 Oscars when it should have been 5.Strength and Honour 9 out of 10.",10,0,0,18 September 2001
The Great Gatsby," Razzle-Dazzle Gatsby
","Luhrmann is an exceptional director. Not in the sense that he is extraordinarily competent, consistent and deep, but rather he is a one of a kind visual pioneer. His fast paced, unusual, anachronic dazzling and lush visual signature though are not suitable for every material.With Moulin Rouge! he gave us an extraordinarily unusual film where his ecstatic style could exist and had more than enough room to grow. While The Great Gatsby material allows for some of such liberties to exist, Luhrmann lacks editorial notion: while the partying flair is on point, all the rest is taken either too far or too short at times. The characters motivations and inner struggles are completely overwhelmed by the overbearing sets, cinematography and score (all of them amazing truth be told) and music video-like editing that never allows us to delve or empathize with them. Luhrmann even manages to make DiCaprio feel flat and out of place and Mulligan miscast. What we are left with is a 2-hour-plus long music video with talking passages, that while visually stunning and musically memorable, feels frustrating considering the source material's potentials and the talent involved.",6,0,0,16 January 2017
Sully," An ironical uneventful crash landing
","Clint Eastwood apparently felt the need to adapt the events of the Miracle on The Hudson into a feature film. After watching it, you might just wonder if you find that need too. Barely clocking in at 90 minutes, Eastwood prosaically rushes and stifles whatever material there is to transpose and work with, as Tom Hanks, playing another Tom Hanks' default role (who else could have played it anyway), does whatever he can with a by-the-numbers basic 'script'. When in such a short film a director and a screenwriter are required to repeatedly relapse into dream sequences of the could-had-been, you know you're in for a (figurative) crash landing. In the end Sully is nothing more than harmless, forgettable and ironically uneventful. If that's a capital cinema crime, I can't decide but I do know that I'm not part of the audience Eastwood looked to appeal.",4,1,5,1 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," How Many Times Can a Film be Done Over and Over?
","The devotees of Scott's 1978 and Cameron's 1986 masterpieces craved for adequate return to the beloved franchise following less than stellar further sequels and unnecessary crossovers. Prometheus promised that and ended up delivering a puzzling yet interesting prequel to the franchise that most found outright outrageous or just plainly disappointing. As much as such criticism, to some extent, might be understandable it is ultimately unfair: Prometheus was dazzling-looking origin story that raised more questions than answers, which left us (me at least) anxiously waiting for expansion/ explanations. What is more baffling is that Covenant lazily and inexplicably takes the very same premise and motivations - and character stereotypes, added a little Passengers (2016) plot points with Alien and Aliens stylistic choices and delivered a shameless formulaic, predictable, overdone and lazy sequel that could very well not be part of the cannon. Somehow, Scott's usual mastery made me not care one bit about that. I was entertained, interested and marveled at its sheer autopilot storyline. If that was Scott's plan all along, bravo. If the idea was to try and expand the mythology I'm fearful for eventual further installments.",6,1,7,29 May 2017
