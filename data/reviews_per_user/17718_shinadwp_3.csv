Blade Runner 2049," I just knew it..
","and I didn't follow my convictions... I knew this will suck and I was right. New rule: no more sequels, prequels, remakes and reruns. Hollywood get a life. I will.I.will.only.watch.original.films. Hollywood, go fleece retards who will pay for Star Wars VIII and other boring trash.BR2049 was completely meaningless. There were no crowded alleyways, throngs of people on the streets or Asian people to show why there is Asian language everywhere. In fact, we barely see anything of the world. What's more replicants can now have children. Why? Well because Ridley and the studio need 12 sequels and a reboot in a decade. What is the point of army of replicants when they are just in hiding and do nothing? What is that? I have to pay for the sequel to find out? No F'n thanks. I am not a suicidal Trump voter. Therefore, I have a brain and will learn from my mistakes and never watch another sequel again. Good for me.",3,5,10,30 November 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Which team do you prefer to play on?
","This film proves it. The human race has degenerated and devolved and its brain has atrophied to that of a lizard's. This explains why the less informed have voted for Drumpf against their own interests, why a fascist runs Poland, which was invaded and occupied by the fascists, a narcissistic dictator runs Russia, Japan is run by a pro-nuclear A-Bomb lover and a corrupt Israeli war monger yanks the chains of America and gets paid for it by its puppet. People are stupid.Let me see if I got this straight: it is the Middle Ages and 'in the middle of France' and there are black people?? And no, I don't mean as slaves, but as citizens, lords and guests of honor at the palace? If that is fair material then I would like to see a remake* of Coming To America where half the king's subjects are white or Chinese.Give me a break. I am truly done with remakes (which Disney does 6 times a year to prove its creative bankruptcy) and sequels. I am done.If Disney thinks I am buying any more of its DVDs or going to watch Star Wars (hahahahaha that reboot series is a big joke) then know I am done. BR2049 was the last film I saw that was a sequel and this is the last remake.From now on show me sane originality or go die of bankruptcy.",3,1,6,30 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Boycott Episode 8
",It will be as silly and spoofy and boring as this. The force Awakens is the most ironic title for a movie since White Chicks. Please do not walk into a cinema to be voluntarily pick-pocketed. I want to revert back to my childhood when there were only 3 Star Wars films and they were all beyond great.,1,11,16,30 November 2017
