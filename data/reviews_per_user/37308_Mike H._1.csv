Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A worthy addition...the Dark Side makes the mainstream critics say the things they say.
","By now, I would think that most of you who want to see TPM have...but for those of you who haven't, let me assure you that it is indeed a stirring addition to the Star Wars mythos.  What many critics have called a 'lack of involvement' in the story really has very little to do with the film; Episode I is not meant to be consumed purely by itself.  Unlike the original trilogy, which Lucas was constantly afraid he would be unable to finish while making the first one, this first chapter is merely a staging point for the events to follow in Episodes II and III, as well as being an enhancement to the original saga.  Those critics that claim a 'lack of involvement' are merely showing just how far the film's scope and purpose went above their heads.  Enjoy the film as part of the greater saga, and all the wonderful hidden intricacies of the Lucasfilm universe will be laid out for you in spectacular fashion.",Null,0,0,28 July 1999
