Blade Runner 2049," Comparisons to other films
","Compared to the original: this one has a very inferior script and not one quotable moment. The morality is unclear and often muddled and the lines spoken by the actors are trite. Q: why are you here? A: I have some questions. Er, Erm, OK!! Compared to the Batman reboots: this guy beats on the small fry and leaves the corrupt narcissist tycoon alone. Reminds one of Batman. It is indeed very populist/conservative a la Trump, Duterte, etc.Compared to TFA Star Wars: yes, it is an unneeded, undemanded, unwanted sequel. It will likely compete with the next Star Wars for the title of most useless film of the year.",Null,4,8,25 October 2017
Schindler's List," Let us all hope for a world where we care for the ails of others
","let us all hope for a world where we care for the ails and challenges of others and care beyond our very own issues solely. That is the way to improve the world: humanity looks our for each other and jumps into action for others without self-benefit or self-interest (other than when all humanity is set right, we are also set right alongside it).A world where Jews only care about the plight of Jews, homosexuals only care about the plight of homosexuals, disabled only care about the challenges of the disabled is selfish and inward looking.We are also not dumb. As we see the camera pan in Saving private Ryan we see a headstone with the star of David. So it wasn't only non-Jews fighting in WWII there was a dead Jewish person too. Manipulative. Self-centered, propagandist. I have little time for people who only care for their own causes. As if they wouldn't get involved if it didn't affect them... Schindler as portrayed here was good. Spielberg didn't learn his lesson though.",Null,29,72,25 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Terrible beyond belief
","This film is the cinematic equivalent of a pickpocket: it violates you with lies and steals from you the money you carry your pocket and gives back nothing.Why would Disney reboot a film and lie about it? Manipulation, shame, deception.Why would JJ Abrams, known as a reboot specialist ('here is the commercial analysis boy go make it') with no vision be given the reins. They do not care for Star Wars. They care for your cash.I laughed so hard when a secret map is hidden inside a robot that is strolling on a desert planet started this film. Erm, where had I seen that before? By the way, the person who created the map and started leaving clues and bread crumbs does not want to be found.I give up.",Null,23,85,25 October 2017
