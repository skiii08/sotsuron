Marie Antoinette," Well dressed but weak story based on a number of historical events
","Lately on Belgian TV I first saw this movie and than a French documentary on Marie Antoinette. What a relief to see the documentary after this glamorous but boring impression of Sofia Coppola. The movie is mostly entertainment and has little to do with 18th century Versailles. It is rather a compilation of moving pictures, that repeat themselves for most of the time, than the moving story that should have been told based on the same historical events. A story that could have entertained me a lot more than this film that is lost in clich√©s and superfluous details. Certainly not my way to approach history and in this context to portray an idiosyncratic woman like Marie Antoinette.",3,0,1,20 November 2008
