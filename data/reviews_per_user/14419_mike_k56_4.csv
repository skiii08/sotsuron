The Ring," a decent movie... not horror in my book
","this movie was very entertaining, although not scary.i found myself laughing at the faces of the people the ghost girl killed, and that ruined the entire horror mood for me. i also didn't like that there was no explanation as to how she actually killed them. if she had come up to me i probably would have rolled my eyes and laughed at her until she went back into the well.the best parts of this movie were naomi watts (sooo sexy), the parts that made me laugh, and the bit from the video tape.other than that, i wasn't impressed.if you want a real horror movie try watching the saw movies. if you're anything like me you'll laugh during them as well, but at least they make more sense.",6,0,0,7 April 2011
Star Trek," Not too bad at all, even for a semi-die-hard ST fan
","This movie has been out for a couple years and, being the Star Trek fan I am I had reservations about even giving it the time of day. I finally watched it today! I had those reservations because Rick Berman has gradually gone farther and farther from Roddenberry's vision, ending with the horrible Enterprise series. Voyager was far better, but not by much.Berman bowed down to pressure to make the series more sexy and likable to young boys, thus the transition to believable smart women to over-the-top sexuality.This movie didn't suffer from that at all. It got back to its roots in most ways and really effectively portrayed how a lot of the early Enterprise crew might have been in their youth.I wasn't overly impressed, but I was still impressed!! 8/10!",8,0,1,23 May 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," What can I say?
","This movie was entertaining! But if you've ever seen T2 you'll notice numerous instances where the director tried to steal from Cameron and failed.The only reason Arnold agreed to semi-star in this film is because he got a gigantic paycheck. I know he is a billionaire, but he still likes to make money. If he had any integrity as a 'real' actor he would have turned this role down. But we all know he's not a 'real' actor.The girl terminator they sent back in time could have been better cast by most people on the street, as her only real dramatic skills involve tilting her head in every other scene.Good movie if you aren't looking for a good movie.",4,0,3,23 May 2012
Drag Me to Hell," a very annoying movie
","the storyline was illogical and childish; the actors were not fit for the parts; and there were many boring segments.it's hard to understand how this could ever be considered a horror film considering i spent a lot of the time gagging in my mouth at how idiotic it was. i still don't understand how i made it through the entire movie.the only thing that made the movie worthwhile was seeing the main character get sucked into hell at the very end. by that time i had built up such a hatred for her character that it was a relief to see her go. i only wish her boyfriend could have received the same fate -- in the movie, and as pertains to his acting career.this movie is NOT worth anyone's time.",3,0,2,7 April 2011
