Requiem for a Dream," Great yet DISTURBING movie
","I highly enjoy this movie. Yet i will never recommend it to anyone. Not without warning them first. This movie so emotionally disturbed me and awakened me on the same levels that it is hard to describe what this movie actually is. On a film buff level this movie is magnificent. Cinematography and production are top notch. The story is amazing. Yet it touches me in such a way that it is hard to describe. Aronofsky does things with cinematography and soundtrack i never thought possible. But in doing so he touches depths of your senses in ways that in themselves should not be possible. While this movie is wonderful in every aspect, i still cannont believe such a movie exist on such merits. It is beautiful and horrible at the same time. The Balance of which rest upon filmaking at its best and storytelling beyond comprehension. I love this movie. I just cant decide where to put it in my brain.",10,0,1,28 August 2004
