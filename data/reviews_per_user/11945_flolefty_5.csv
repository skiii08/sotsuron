Alien 3," Don't give it a pass
","Sure, it's the lowest rated in the franchise but there's still a lot to really like about it. Better character development than the norm, eerie prison sets, the cult vibe embraced by all the inmates, the absence of guns as defense, the sprinkling of grim humour all add up to a cool entertaining flick. And yes, it's tense & scary.",8,1,1,13 May 2020
Alien: Resurrection," Sigourney Just Wants To Have Fun
","Blame this mess on the artsy fartsy director, prepare to watch the brilliant proceeding films morphed into a bad comic strip. No subtlety, no suspense, and character development? Forget about it! Just have an alien rip there head off, easy peasy.
Pros? Weaver DID have fun, she plays basketball don't ya know, she made this film watchable. I shed a wee tear when ugly baby alien died , he had nice eyes, and those jars of failed human cloning attempts did creep me out.
Plan on watching 'Aliens' again, that'll bring back the love.",5,0,0,14 May 2020
Horrible Bosses," It's just not funny
","After all the rave reviews I was so disappointed. Not because it offended me, I give comedy a ton of rope. No, because it broke the cardinal rule, comedy is supposed to be funny.
To be fair it has it's moments but they are few & far between. Not the cast's fault. With Charlie Day the one glaring exception they were all decent, Spacey & Foxx were standout's. Day's performance ruined this for me, his frantic, silly comic style reminded me of Jerry Lewis (shiver)",5,1,3,10 March 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Really good 'light' Marvel flick 7.5 stars
","This satisfied my fix for a marvel superhero film after watching Infinity War, went digging & found this. I'd always passed on Spider Man, gave it a shot & glad I did. Bonus that it stars Andrew Garfield, hooked on him ever since his performance in 'The Social Network', he's terrific in this as well.There's lots of action, enjoyed the lightness provided by humor, I've moved on from the grimmer 'Dark Knight' films I used to go for. The romance between Garfield & Stone is sweet, and perfectly offset by a truly nasty villainous Lizard.Learning poor Spidy's backstory was enjoyable as well. No mom & dad growing up but a big bonus having Sally Field & Martin Sheen for grandparents; they both play the roles really well.The director's name is Webb ...guess I'm easily amused but that cracks me up.",7,0,0,3 March 2019
Ex Machina," Hard to tell the robots from the humans
","Disappointing. Acting was so wooden it was hard to tell the robots from the humans, no wonder Caleb ( Domhnall Gleeson - just awful) was questioning himself. Partial blame goes to the script, saw the big ending coming a mile away. To make matters worse he pace was so slow that mile felt like a 100. Alicia Vikander was okay I suppose, her bloodless delivery fitting, at lease she WAS an actual robot. Oscar Isaac's performance the only redeeming part of this, but honestly even he seemed to be bored. Decent special effects but nothing to write home about. Being generous with a 5",5,1,2,17 March 2019
