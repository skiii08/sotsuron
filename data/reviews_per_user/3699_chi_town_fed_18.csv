Ford v Ferrari," What a great movie!
","The acting, casting, and writing are superb. I enjoyed this film from credits to credits. I could write about all of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. Why waste time when all you need to know is the writing and acting makes this film feel organic and authentic. The pace is perfect too.If you watch this film you will not be disappointed.",9,1,1,17 February 2020
World War Z," Cool adaptation of your typical Z movie. Fast pace.
","Good casting (with a couple of exceptions). Good plot. Decent writing. Some scenes are a bit over the top and impossible to survive, but somehow someone did.Writers get mad kudos from me when they don't inject jokes every five minutes into a movie like this. The exception is when the movie is suppose to be a comedy or comedic.WW Z caught me completely by surprise and kept me interested from credits to credits. Also, unlike other Z movies the focus was not just about victims being devoured and intestines being munched on. Rather, people were basically being 'recruited' into the Z ranks at a fairly rapid pace. The globe-trotting added a layer of depth that was totally unexpected as typical Z movies are filmed in one home or town. I did not read the book. Thus my expectations were a blank slate.Also, the Z actors deserve major kudos for twisting and contorting their bodies into the scary creatures. I think their contributions are often missed by some viewers.",8,2,3,28 July 2018
Us," Very interesting theme. Mad potential. Overall, the movie sucks.
","The family dynamic was the most appealing aspect of this film. Initially, the writers seemed to be on the ball. Once the creepy people were introduced, the plot became disjointed and grew more ridiculous with time. Worst and most ridiculous ending of a movie I have ever seen.",4,17,26,30 June 2019
Interstellar," Excellent film. Casting and writing could have been better in some areas.
","Strong film! Almost perfect. The premise and the conceptual solution were amazing. I did not know what to expect from credit to credit making this film anything but predictable.The few things I did not care for (which are subjective) is they cast Anne Hathaway as a lead scientist, which I could not buy into. I did, however, like Jessica Chastain as 'Murph.' I think she was a good pick for the role and played it well. I have nothing against Anne Hathaway. I just feel the role she played would have been a better fit for someone else. Again, this is very subjective, and she did a good job, not epic.I also did not care for Matt Damon's dialogue (I love almost all of his movies). The writing for his role turned me off. It just seemed wooden and inauthentic. I think they should have kept the dialogue short when they were walking on the ice and or during the fight versus continuous dialogue. Even after the fight he was still talking about human reaction to blah blah blah. I just wanted him to shut up and get on with it. 'What you are feeling is this and that because of this and that.' He made my ears hurt. I blame the writers for this.The action scenes involving his character were cool and very dramatic. The dialogue for his character sucked IMHO. Also, the way Matthew McConaughey sent the message(s) in the end and how he arrived there is utterly ridiculous in my opinion. For such a great movie, they should have come up with a more plausible explanation and message delivery system. It was like a scene from children's fantasy film versus authentic science fiction.Beyond these short comings (which are few, slight, and short lived), this movie was spectacular!!! The music score was perfect as it drew me into the moment. The concept and the plot were gripping. These aspects help to offset the few shortcomings in this film.This is a must-see movie!!!",9,1,4,31 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Bias in full effect
","If you are a biased Star Wars fan this poor excuse for a film will enthrall you. If you are an unbiased movie goer, you will likely dislike this film. Even if you are bored out of your mind and watch this film just to kill time, you will still not like it if you are not a biased viewer..Many of the lightsaber fight scenes are slow and clunky. To be such an elite fighter the two, star opponents were mainly swinging their sabers wildly versus with speed an finesse. It looked as though they were swinging bats at each other versus lightsabers. At times they also made certain the other person placed their saber in the right blocking position before swinging.As with Transformers, The Avengers, etc. writers and directors today have no clue on how to produce engaging seamless trilogies here in the US. For some reason the Brits seem to do a great job of doing so. Possibly because they place more emphasis on the story versus special effects (just speculating).",3,13,16,13 June 2020
Cast Away," Awe Inspiring!!!
","I watched this film years ago and the imagery is seared into my memory. The movie is pretty long but worth every minute. Hanks transforms his body in this film to match the situation of his role. It is very challenging for a single person to keep an audience engaged over the duration of the majority of a film, especially a long one. Hanks pulled it off and he makes it seem so effortless.Hanks carried this film on his back, up a mountain, through a blizzard while being struck by lightening. That is just how awesome he is in this film. The writing is flawless. The location is perfect. You gotta love the other star in this film, Wilson. Wilson had attitude and played his role well. Wilson took no guff and gave as good as he got. Bravo!Hanks acting was so on the mark throughout this film, even if you didn't speak English and subtitles were not available, you'd still get the gist of every scene because Hanks was just that good.
<ul><li>My Braven Review Quiz Spoilers: b, a, a, c</li></ul>",9,3,4,4 August 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A horribly, boring and goofy installment. Worst one yet.
","This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society.This was one of the worst Avengers installment ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) buffoons, they failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons. The PC man-hating writers of today have devolved the franchise into an Everybody Loves Raymond-esque sitcom. However, Everybody Loves Raymond is better written.",4,190,329,15 August 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Lot of potential. Only thing missing is a 1980s sitcom laugh track for the poor writing.
","Writers, producers, and directors simply suck today. They mask their massive incompetence with a plethora of special effects. It is hard to ruin a movie filled with characters who all bring a massive, built-in audience. Yet they managed to do so.They turned the Hulk into a joke. The Hulk!!! One of the most beloved and sympathetic characters in Marvel. I was waiting for the Hulk to have round two. It never came. Moreover, I don't understand how so soon after Thor's people are mass murdered right in front of him, he starts cracking jokes within minutes of being rescued by the GG. Why do writers today feel the need to turn dramatic scenes into a Friends sitcom? The only thing missing from this movie was a laugh track.I fail to see the comedy in an all powerful being brutally mass murdering from credits to credits. This could have been a powerful and more dramatic film. Yet writers never fail to inject jokes at the most inappropriate times, which distracts from the movie. Thor cracking one-liners right after what was left of the Asgard race has been annihilated made absolutely no sense to me. Portraying the Hulk as Abbot and Costello throughout the entire film also makes no sense.Another irksome thread in this film was the weakness of the Vision. Vision is as powerful as they come yet they basically made him a symbol for First Alert 'I've fallen and I can't get up' from credits to credits. In the comic books Vision is no joke. In this film, he is the weakest Avenger of them all. In my opinion today's society prefers to portray women as powerful, and men as weak buffoons. I have no problem with a powerful woman. I do have a problem with the weakening of men in the process. Both can be and should be powerful.Additionally, this movie is all over the place and never brings the Avengers together as one cohesive team. They are basically scattered across the cosmos each small group doing their own thing completely oblivious to what is going on with the other members.Its similar to how they ruined the Transformers over time. How do you manage to ruin a franchise that has a built-in audience? Unlike most other movies the audience for the Avengers and the Transformers existed for years, if not decades before the movies were made. How do you blow it? Simple, try to squeeze three movies into one by jumping around all over the place. Also, toss in an abundance of jokes that only serve to ruin dramatic scenes because you think the audience needs to laugh every five minutes.If all you care about is death, destruction, special effects, and jokes you will love this movie. I rank this ridiculous film up there with Freddy versus Jason. If you seek a thrilling story filled with heart ache, triumph, and characters that really draw you in, this movie sucks. I gave it some stars due to my love of Marvel.I am glad I waited to rent this movie or I'd really be upset.",6,2,5,25 July 2018
A Quiet Place," Thank God for Fast Forward. Consistent-Plot Goggles required.
","I am giving this movie points for an interesting premise and some good suspenseful scenes. Other than that this was a fairly stupid movie. As bad as the movie is the ending was worse. The death-girl character made a bad movie worse. I felt absolutely no connection to her character even though I wanted to feel bad for her pain and sense of guilt. After about 30 minutes I was hoping she would run away or get snatched by a creature. Not out of anger, just to get her out of the way. Her character was a bad distraction wrapped inside a bad movie. I eventually fast-forwarded whenever she appeared in the film, which lowered my frustration with this film.Please consider the creatures hunt by sound. There is even a scene where a person purposely yells to attract the creatures. Also, sound from a simple toy attracted the creatures. Yet when the family sets off a major and lengthy fireworks display that rivaled the 4th of July and New Years to draw out one creature creeping around the house (and it worked), absolutely no additional creatures were drawn to the numerous extremely loud and frequent sounds from the fireworks show. How did all but the one creature inside the house suddenly lose their hearing? After that, at the lame ending one shotgun blast in the basement lured hundreds of creatures to the house from every direction.What was also odd is somehow creatures who hunt by sound wiped out humanity to include tanks, battleships, F-22 Raptors, and every professional military on earth, AND at no time while humanity was being destroyed did anyone at MIT or in Germany, Russia, Middle East, Asia, etc consider sound as a weapon against creatures who hunt by sound. Just think, all they needed was a signal or test-tone generator and a microphone to turn the tide of the war. For all we know a dog whistle may have worked just as well.Even less believable is one lady with a shotgun, who just expended a ton of energy giving birth with no one to assist, accomplished what a few billion people around the world with 100 percent of their strength and armed to the teeth with weapons such as AK47s, grenades, night-vision goggles, etc. could not do, which is kill the creatures. I view this as more of Hollywood's feminist propaganda. Please do not get me wrong. I love strong women, but Hollywood is just ridiculously over-the-top with their portrayal of what a strong woman is. Strong does not equate to super-human.If you are wondering what I consider to be very good sci-fi horror movies; Alien, Aliens (2), Terminator, Terminator 2, Forbidden Planet (classic), etc. Overall I had high hopes and moderate expectations but I did not enjoy this movie. I wanted to due to the unique aspect of sound being the greatest threat, which I thought was interesting. Fast forwarding helped a lot. I did really enjoy a few individual scenes in the movie. The suspenseful scenes captured and held my attention to the point I didn't even want to blink for fear of missing something. That said, a good movie requires more than a few good scenes regardless how good those scenes may be.If you choose to watch this film I recommend watching the first ten to fifteen minutes (up to the first scene of someone getting snatched). Then fast forward to the last thirty minutes or so where a creature is stirring inside the house. If you watch this film in its entirety, keep the coffee hot because you are gong to need it. I am a tea drinker myself. You are also going to need to put on a pair of Consistent-plot goggles in order to not see the holes in this film. Enjoy.",5,2,6,27 July 2018
1917," Dunkirk/Midway Wannabe
",Unimaginative film with many false high IMDB ratings. False high ratings are becoming common on IMDB.,5,5,9,28 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What a load of feminist crap. Horrible casting. Horrible writing. Horrible plot.
","Dumbest version of the series to date. Hollywood is a one-trick pony. Hollywood feels the need to make 18 year old yuppies heroes beyond their years. You see the same one-trick-pony in Maze Runner, Divergent, Hunger Games, etc. Basically, 18 year olds with next to zero life experience saving worlds and defeating entire well trained well supplied armies.In the original Star Wars films, the yuppie (Luke Skywalker) had mentors e.g. Yoda (wisest of the wise), Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, etc. People with experience basically protected and mentored the newbie throughout the film. The villain in those days was also a serious person with years of experience making the story more dramatic and believable.Today, according to Hollywood's one-trick-pony, teenage yuppies are basically on their own and must trial-and-error their way into saving the planet or the galaxy. Those 'old' people (26 an older) are mostly in the way with their so-called experience. Even the villain is a bullied looking, spoiled 18 year old yuppie throwing temper tantrums as though his parents just punished him by telling him to clean up his room. I did not know a person could act so poorly in such a major film. He must be related to someone high up in the business.Add to it more horrible casting, the horrible writing, and horrible plot. Not to mention this is a lame, feminists movement film that happens to contain Star Wars. From the feminist bomber, to the feminist commander, to the feminist Guard, to the feminist Jedi. This movie is born of the man-hating, neutered society we live in today. The males are portrayed as either pure evil, or bumbling idiots, unsure of themselves and constantly screwing up. Meanwhile, Leia is so powerful, she gets blown into space, survives 450 degrees below zero. (Look it up), zero pressure (vacuum), and zero air to breath. She then wields the force and flies through space back to the damaged ship. What an utterly stupid scene. That had to be the worst scene in the entire franchise of Star Wars films ever made. Even Yoda never pulled a stunt like that. Oh, he was male. I understand.The Last Jedi's only charm is the comedy, which says a lot as to how far Star Wars has fallen. The ridiculous villain looks like a spoiled kid who is still being bullied by the captain of the football team. The Last Jedi is more poorly written, cast, and directed than Girls Gone Wild.The entire plot consists of the teen hero (Rey) with zero life experience walking around behind a neutered Luke Skywalker. as the fleet is running away in a slow speed chase through 95% of this awful movie. The BS astral projection discussions between Rey and the bullied (looking) extremely childish villain was the worst made-up garbage I have ever seen.Yoda comes back from the dead to strike a tree with lightning (what was the purpose of that scene?). Skywalker mystically fades away after astral projecting himself to fight the horribly cast, no acting, bullied (looking) villain.The reformed storm trooper (Finn) raised for battle from a child, is unsure of himself and every thing he does. Somehow he meets a young Asian lady (another 18 year old) and appears to trade Rey in for her as a love interest. Hollywood in its infinite racism hates the thought of a black man being with a strong white woman. Yet they love casting white men dominating strong black women. I simply wish they would be even handed with their portrayal of cross-cultural relationships.Anyone who gives this garbage high marks is easily entertained and are likely a sucker for a shiny twirling object dangled in front of their nose. The only version almost as bad as this is the one with young Darth Vader played by that non-acting, wooden actor who played Anakin Skywalker in an earlier episode.",4,9,12,2 August 2018
Ip Man," Bruce Lee opened the flood gates. Donnie Yen carries the banner well.
","This is one of the, if not the greatest martial arts films ever made. The casting, writing, choreography, and story line are all in sync. I was in awe with this movie when I first watched it and have watched it several times since. That said, I feel it dragged on a bit too long but it is still an astounding film. I think I went through every emotion at my disposal watching this film, which says a lot about the writers, actors, and directors. What a ride!!!'Karate flicks' have been around for decades. Bruce Lee transformed 'Karate flicks' into a global phenomenon. His influence on-screen opened the floodgates of respect for the Asian culture and made Martial Arts mainstream around the entire globe. This amazing film is the product of Bruce Lee's achievements. In it, Donnie Yen does not disappoint!!!Donnie Yen's skills are beyond belief yet so believable. His demeanor brings a level of civility, humility, love, and courage that is unmatched. Almost everything in this movie is just right at every moment in the film with one or two exceptions. The hero is heroic without being over-bearing. He is powerful yet gentle.The wife is simply drop dead gorgeous. She was cast well and played her part. I enjoyed her various scenes and enjoyed her expressions such as her look of 'Boys will be boys even when they are grown men'. When she was ticked-off her husband knew it and had that 'uh-oh' look on his face. She basically kept her hero husband in check. When things got rough, she was the glue that held the family together. This film captured many nuances without going off track which is simply amazing.I love true martial arts, always have. Ip Man's character is the embodiment of what martial arts is to its core. There never will be a perfect film. When it comes to a film about martial arts and more, Ip Man is as good as it gets. They are not running up walls and jumping 100 feet into the air on top of trees. The speed and agility displayed in this film without all of that stuff is incredible.I deduct one star for a somewhat clumsy sub-plot that was added but did not add to the movie and only served to make the film longer than needed.",9,0,0,4 August 2018
The Descent," Pretty good action-horror film for 2005.
","I watched this film many years ago. It totally rocked when it finally started moving. One must consider this was a 2005 film cast with all women cave explorers. How unique and sexy was that? I absolutely hated the woman that lied and got them trapped in the first place, Juno. I wanted to kill her myself, which means the writers did their job by making me emotionally vested (good or bad) in their character. Not to mention, she was fine!!! I absolutely love brunettes.The whole cave dwelling creatures plot caught my attention as I am a city-rat from birth. I have never been in a cave. After watching this film, I never wanted to go inside one (lol). What often gets overlooked are the actors who play the creatures. They did a phenomenal job and brought a lot to the suspenseful scenes.Although this film isn't epic. It was a cool change of horror especially for 2005. I don't know how they filmed some of the scenes but they had me convinced they were deep inside a maze riddled cave.As a horror flick, the blood and gore is on par with the bloodiest goriest flicks you can imagine. Its horror. What do viewers expect? One scene involving basically a swimming pool of blood and muck, took gross to new levels.I gave this movie an extra point for the setting, the creatures, and the human villain (she is fine!!!).",7,1,2,11 August 2018
Arrival," A bit underwhelming. Gets points for a different kind of alien encounter.
","This was not the worst movie I've seen. I connected with the linguist and the aliens (to a lesser degree).The lasting effect on the lead character is a tiresome, overplayed concept. The linguist did a decent job at carrying the movie and pulling me into the story. Although I like Forest Whitaker, I am not certain he was the best actor for the role. His quirks and nuances are unique unto him and do not fit well in certain roles. Those same nuances are why I like him in general. Why not make him one of the scientists instead where his quirks may have been a better fit? Just a thought.The alien crafts were very cool in their uniqueness as were the aliens themselves and their method of communication. I would have preferred more exposure to the aliens versus the mental travels of the professor.Reviews are rightfully all over the place (to an extent). I think the extreme (1-2 , 9-10) ratings are not representative of the movie by any fair perspective. I can see a 4 to 8 range of objective ratings. I think it depends on your mood and style preference when you watch this film. A more relaxed mood and nuanced style preference when watching this film might generate a higher rating. A more hyper-mood or need for constant action while watching this film may make it seem more of a disappointment as the action is fairly infrequent. To call this film a 1 or a 10 isn't practical. If you think this is a 10, this means no other movie can top this one and can only, at best, be equally good. If you rate it with 1 star, you are claiming no movie can be worse than this, only equally bad.I think this film was a bit too heavy in the cerebral arena and fails to give enough exposure to the very unique aliens as well as their technology. I would have preferred more glimpses of them and their perspective versus a few cameo appearances.",6,0,3,3 August 2018
Green Book," Well written. Great casting. Extremely well performed. A slight liberal bias (but that's okay).
","Really enjoyed this film. Unfortunately it portrays everyone in the south as mouth-breathing racists and most people in the north as accepting and willing to grow, which is a lie but that is okay. I am from Chicago. I guarantee that I experienced racism in my city. However, I did experience racism more overtly in the deep south to the point of a coward spitting tobacco on my car when I was in a store. I was in the military at the time protecting this country, which speaks volumes.In my view, this film also fails to portray how the average African American would have likely viewed the lead with more disdain as an 'Uncle Tom.' They touch on this aspect very briefly during a scene involving a game of horseshoes. Other than that it appears that he is embraced and admired by other African Americans versus shunned for his mannerism and success. That said, no film will ever satisfy everyone 100 percent. Overall, I give the writers, actors, and directors a huge 'thumbs up' for this film. Bravo! However, considering the character of the driver and his associates, I sometimes wonder if Italians get tired of seeing themselves portrayed as mobsters and hustlers.I applaud this film. It is a fresh, must needed reminder of reality. Too many people today seem to think this centuries old issue doesn't impact our lives anymore.I personally hold no grudge against anyone simply because of their ethnicity. I don't care what 'color' you are. If your heart is in the right place that is all that matters. Although there are still many cowardly racists in this country, there are far more people of all ethnicities who oppose their ignorance.This film struck a good balance in broaching a very serious and emotional issue without being divisive. It shows the growth of some of the characters along the way.Last thought. This film included a scene for the sake of pushing a lifestyle agenda that I could have done without. I am simply tired of Hollywood injecting their personal views in virtually every film today. Even so-called news networks are nothing more than political propaganda machines. It would be nice if the industry would keep their personal viewpoints out of their business just like I do when I go to work each day.",8,1,1,6 July 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Void of substance
","In John Wick 1, the story unfolds with major tragedy. Wick's wife died. he is in mourning. Then a useless thug kills the dog his dead wife left him. In doing so the writers created an instant, sympathetic connection to the character.In this sequel, I have absolutely no sympathy for, or connection to any character in the movie. Moreover, to the director, writers, and producer I ask how many times can you show someone shooting people in the head before it gets old?John Wick 2 is a Groundhog Day action movie. One man with a pistol shooting people in the head over, and over, and over again. I do not consider this statement to be a spoiler because the previews indicate as much. Even action movies require some foundation such as good writing, a compelling story, and a hint of plausibility. This movie is simply a man with a pistol killing a never-ending supply of villains.What is even more astounding, the never-ending supply of 'professional' villains are bad shots with poor reflexes. In John Wick 1 he was not invincible, making him more of a more sympathetic character. He was captured and would have been killed had he not been rescued by a fellow assassin. In this version he is basically wearing a red cape and leaping over tall buildings in a single bound.That said, if you just want to see a bunch of people getting shot in the head time-and-time again, you are going to really love this film. John Wick 1 spent a little time building the characters including the villain. John Wick 2 has chaotic character development, a sloppy plot, and doesn't contain even a grain of plausibility.",4,3,11,9 July 2017
Annihilation," Interesting Alice in Wonderland meets The Thing concept. Falls a bit flat.
","I support producers and writers who try to push the sci-fi envelope into less frequently traveled paths. I think the right directors, writers, and producers could have made this film better than it turned out to be. Unfortunately this group missed the mark.Casting could have been better. Writing and story line were horrible. I tried to stay engaged versus just watch the film go by. It took will power to do so due to the pace and a host of relentless disjointed flashbacks. Also, I get the whole doppelganger vibe. Unfortunately it was portrayed like a Michael Jackson music video. Would have made a cool video but falls short for a film.They had a blank canvas allowing them to paint anything one could imagine. However their imaginations were more focused on shocking the senses versus writing a cohesive, well paced story. The flashbacks with the husband (or boyfriend) character became increasingly annoying because they served no purpose and the film was already disjointed without the added flashbacks.Another aspect that I found disconcerting was people simply wandering off making the story even less coherent. Initially they have the semblance of a team. I was beginning to buy into it. Pretty soon it was every person for themselves as they wander off so I stopped caring about the 'team'. Just when they almost had me hooked, they blew it with the everyone simply do your own thing regardless of this potential end-of-the-world stuff we have been entrusted to look into. Also, some of the nuance scenes in this film seemed forced and in your face as in 'Hey! See this nuance!'There are a couple of decent shock-and-awe scenes. There were also one or two interesting and somewhat unique creatures that held my attention. I give them that. That said, I have absolutely no desire to watch this movie ever again. For me not to want to watch a sci-fi movie again speaks volumes because I love sci-fi. Always have. Always will.",4,2,5,3 August 2018
The Martian," Great movie. Great concept. Good casting. Great writing.
","Although there is room for improvement, this movie hits well on all cylinders. People need to accept their will never be a perfect movie, which is why I gave this one such high marks. Two movies I consider a 10 are Titanic and Avatar. There are more but these are two examples of my version of a 10,The Martian provides an excellent blend of drama, sci-fi, and comedic moments that are not over the top. The casting was great with the exception of a few roles. There were a few space scenes that are a total farce, but overall they did capture the essence of what it will take to go to Mars.My rating is actually a toss up between 8 and 9 stars.",9,0,0,29 July 2018
