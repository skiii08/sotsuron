Deja Vu," wonderful
",only one wonder exist on human's life up to now 'going to past' and watching it but we only have two eyes and we can see only our place but MR. Tony Scott showed us 4 1/2 days ago. is it possible? if you have a good director and a excellent actor of course. it is a good scene even you saw a murder. but there is a big sacrifice example from denzel w. after the film my girlfriend ask me that if i could do this sacrifice if i had a chance of course i answered it like denzel w. 'i would try' i know it is so early but i think one of the best film of tony scott. he can't do better than. but denzel washington he is the best of 2006 if i had a chance for it i'd give Oscar to him.,9,0,1,29 January 2007
The Departed," masterpiece
","it is a masterpiece. i have just watched it and i came to the net for voting. Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, jack Nicholson and mark Wahlberg how can it be bad? from beginning to last i don't guess what happen and the delicious final like an ice cream after a perfect dinner. director makes the best of life. you can have smells from 'spy game' and 'the recruit' but good smells doesn't be on the near your nose. 'if you are first you are first, if you are second you are nothing' this film is the first the others are extremely nothing. take your girlfriend and watch it there will be a lot of chance for hugging because of the scenes you will see.but you have a phobia on blood take some pills and watch it. no more ways to see a excellent film.",10,1,4,4 December 2006
