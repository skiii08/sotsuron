Walk the Line," Beautiful and engaging
","Being a country fan all of my life, I grew up listening to Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, etc. All of the old greats. I was really impressed with how well Joaquin Phoenix played his role. Not only did he sound so much like Johnny, but his mannerisms were right on the money. You would almost believe it was Johnny Cash himself starring in his own movie. I remember the 60s and 70s when he looked so much like Joaquin did in the movie. I certainly hope he gets an award for the part he played. I don't believe I've ever seen anyone do a better job. Being a great Waylon Jennings fan, however, is the reason for this email. In the movie when it showed Waylon and Johnny living together, it portrayed Waylon with long hair and a beard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty certain that at the time that scene was taking place, Waylon was still clean shaved and had wavy hair that he combed back. The movie ended in 1968 and that was when Waylon made his Hangin On album at which time he was still clean shaved and had slicked back hair. It wasn't until he was in the hospital a few years later, ready to quit, that he decided to try it one more time, 'his way', that he changed his look, took control of his music and the rest is history! Was this just Hollywood or was there another reason for his appearance in that scene. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't detract from the quality of the movie at all. Most people who aren't lifelong Waylon fans, like myself, wouldn't even know what I'm talking about. Anyway, this was a great movie with a great cast and although I only saw it two days ago, I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. Keep up the good work!",9,1,1,29 March 2012
