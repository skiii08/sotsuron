The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Overrated and pretentious
","Sorry, guys, I felt no emotions during the whole film though tried. Pretentious is the best word. The plot is poorly articulated, characters have no development, editing is illogical (what happened to the heroine's witnessing against an unknown man in the court?  did I miss something while yawning?).  The rare engaging moments to me were those with puppets - wonderfully made, with exquisite movements...  Irene Jacob is beautiful, so what?  Do you know anything about her character?  Did she provoke any intimate memories of your life?  Did you identify yourself with any of the characters?  Or were you just watching an emotionless variation on the subject, 'what if...?'  Risking to sound blasphemous, I admit I see all Kieslowski's movies that way... emotionless, calculated, cold, though beautifully shot and starring strikingly beautiful women.",Null,12,31,22 April 1999
