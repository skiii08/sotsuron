The Blair Witch Project," couldve been so much more
","Over 1000 comments on IMDB all ready?  Then theres not much else I can add except what some others have said.  This couldve been a lot more if they had cut some of the blah blah blahing and threw in a few more scares.  I know you have to have some talking in movies but how many times are you willing to watch the same people say the same stuff day after day.  Each morning starts with 'lets go this way' and by afternoon its 'you blankety blank you got us lost!'  Then by nightfall we wait for a witch that never comes.  It wasnt till the third night I think, that the kids tent gets attacked by 'something' in only one of two really effectively scary scenes.  Theyre sent screaming into the woods and its pretty creepy stuff.  Not much happens till the final 5 minutes when the filmmakers think theyve found their lost buddy in an abandoned house.  Though the film disappointingly ends so abruptly, it does give you a lot to talk about 'what Mike was doing in the corner.'  Id say yes it was an extremely unique idea for a terror film but no to the uniqueness of the setting.  I mean, havent woods been spooky in movies for years?  It couldnt help but add the films eerie atmosphere.  And be forewarned about the dizzying camera movements at times, where the actual filmmakers wanted to add realism to the documentary style idea by having the shots not be perfect at times.  Though not a great movie, still very interesting.",Null,1,1,17 August 1999
Gremlins," childhood fave
","I had to wait 2 years and see this on cable after it came out, but I found out why my friends were hyping it so much.  Late teens Billy gets a gift from dad at Christmastime, an adorable little 'mogwai,' a furry, barely bigger than you're hand creature.  But oops Billy gets him wet and out pops several new mogwais, all just as cute.  This new group is a bit more mischievious and coax Billy into feeding them after midnight.  The dudes unaware that if you do that the little guys turn into ugly, destructive monsters.  They get loose from the house and run amok downtown, thrashing a club, a movie theater, and many homes.  Writer Chris Columbus interjects enough humor though to make them lovable villains, having them breakdance, sing Christams carols, and attend a screening of 'Snow White.'  Its all a lot of fun, with a very memorable score, and even time to tug at your heart. And if you dont at least smile from Gizmos 'bye, Billy,' youre made of stone, man.  You may as well be related to Mrs. Deagle.  'Deagle, Deagle, Deagle!'",7,0,1,21 July 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Oppurtunity...
","Classic scenes abound for sure, but unfortunately they're spread around some of the most lull-inducing moments ever.  Somehow most of the general world overlooked my problems and cherish this thing.  I can almost see how: the huge rolling boulder; the truck chase; and of course, the snakes.  Which makes me not hate this, but really look at it as a missed oppurtunity.  It starts when Ford retrieves a small statue in the opening moments of the film, painting himself some sort of adventurer.  It ends up that he's an archaeology proffessor who makes the occassional globe trotting adventure to pick up nicknacks here and there.  His college receives information on the Lost Ark, which is, as one character puts it, 'a radio for talking to God'. Ford's motto for most things is that it belongs in a museum, so he sets off after it.  But in between some dynamite action sequences are far too many dialogue passages that just lose you (or just me, I guess).  Take the scene in the college auditorium that goes on and on and on and...  Arks and staffs and myths and locations.  Just get on with it!  Then there's stuff with the Nazis and Allen's character, showdowns in pup tents, among other things. Plus a suprising amount of gore at the end, with melting faces and suctioned bodies.  John Williams contributes another classic score which I still whistle twenty years later.  I have found a few like me who must fast-forward a lot of the time, but don't take my word, most everyone adores this.",Null,1,3,15 February 2004
Minority Report," report: D+
","We have amazing visuals!  A truly ingenious story dealing with time-travel to prevent crimes!  And what do we do with these two great qualities?  We plug our mega-star into a recycled 'Fugitive' episode where he's framed and on the run.  EH EH!!  WRONG ANSWER FILMMAKERS!  Imagine the possibilities! Going back in time to figure out who really killed JFK!  Or preventing attacks on the US!  No, instead we get Cruise set-up by someone in his huge company which gives excuses for the makers to use an array of gadgets.  An example is one of the dumbest 'fight' scenes I've ever watched as Cruise battles guys with jet backpacks.  Watching him hang off a balcony while he and this person's legs swing phonily in the air was painful to watch.  Then on the script side, it trying to be too deep and layered.  You really have to pay attention to understand what's going on.  Stevie gives us a little too much to digest, especially with those jumbled screens with the information all over them early on.  So glad to see others were annoyed by this as well.  C'mon Stevie, go back to your 'Poltergeist' or 'Indy Jones' days, nice simple action-entertainment.",Null,0,0,13 January 2003
Erin Brockovich," Erin Brocko-bitch
","This made a 100 million bucks??  A film about a pushy, arrogant, trash-mouthed, slut dressing mega-bitch?  I've heard of 'the bad guy you love to hate', but NO WAY could I do that here.  I wouldn't use the line 'I was rooting for the bad guys' (not after what they put the town through) but I wasn't rooting for the heroine either.  More so for the victims, the standout being Marg Helgenberger, the main plaintiff in the story.  She's one of many homeowners battling a power company that has knowingly contaminated their water.  I also sympathized with Finney, having to deal with 'I need, I want' Brockovich, and his performance was the one I more related to.  But Roberts is unbearable, and tries to come off SOOO superior to others.  The speech on her porch to the conveniently placed guy next door just came off totally unbelievable.  And her showing up of an attorney by reciting memorized phone numbers, addresses, names and ailments is great for her...BUT WHAT ABOUT OTHERS ON THE CASE WHO NEED ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION??????  What do you expect them to call you every time they need it??  NOOOOO!!!  Common courtesy, Brockovich!  Give them the damn info! That was the most infuriating scene I had watched in years from any movie. You wanna-be badass.  Say this for the film, it only stalls here and there, until it runs on fumes to its conclusion that we know is coming because of the 'based on a true story' element.  But a totally unlikable lead character will kill any film in my opinion and that's what you get here.  Best Actress?  How 'bout Best Attitude.",Null,0,1,1 April 2001
The Fan," big time strikeout!
","As a die-hard baseball fan I'll probably pick this apart more than anyone else.  Yes, the storys not about baseball really, but I must point out the glaring mistakes.  As far as the story its one we've seen before: obsessed loony follows and spies on a stranger.  Knife salesman (ooh, scary) DeNiro has a thing for Snipes, a ball player who just signed a big deal with the S.F. Giants.  After all the usual threatening and psychotic behavior, theres a big confrantation in a rain soaked game where DeNiro wants Snipes to homer so he can have his kidnapped son back.  At one point Snipes just comes out and asks (more like screams) 'what do you want from me?!'  To which DeNiro replies...nothing! He doesnt say a word.  Thats when you know the film is a total waste as he doesnt even have a reason for his behavior.  Another annoying aspect is how Tony Scott shoots EVERY scene in close-up it seems like.  Every characrter is right up in our face in virtually every shot and it makes the screen so claustrophobic like youve been crowded into a room with bodies shoved up against you.  And now for the baseball scenes, so unproffesionally put together.  I mean a player wearing a visiting uniform hits a ball to the outfield...in his home stadium!  Now all of a sudden hes wearing a home white uniform as he runs the bases.  Or a ball is pitched in Candlestick Park and after its hit the outfield becomes that of Coors Field. Or fans doing the wave in every shot, or the final game played in nearly hurricane like conditions.  Oh, what a mess.  What can you expect of a British born director?  Big surprise that DeNiro would take this.",Null,2,5,30 August 1999
Finding Nemo," Finding it distressing...
","Hmm, let's start with the death of a mother fish, an overprotective, wimpy father fish, jr. fish who says 'I hate you', then have jr. kidnapped.  And all in the first five minutes!  Throw in big, scary fish and tons of melodramatic search and rescue action, and you've got...a 'kids' movie?? They don't know any better, so this becomes their only alternative at the theater, which in turn makes it three hundred million dollars.  Usually these family films pack jokes for the older crowd that only they'd understand to keep them awake, along with the kiddie stuff.  Not here.  No fun of 'Toy Story', with characters and imaginitive action passages to keep you engrossed.  Here we're saddled with a dull hero (voice of Brooks), a quickly annoying 'dumb funny' fish (voice of DeGeneres) and a slew of not even recognizable celebrity voices who you'd be hard pressed to guess who it is.  The only, only, plus is the always reliable Pixar imagery, colorful and striking.  Otherwise, run.  'Nemo!  Nemo!  Nemo!'  Shuddup and get me outta here!",2,11,27,21 March 2004
Superbad," k, had enough....
","More perverted teenagers, more forced vulgarity. If you liked 'Knocked Up'....That would be the total sum of my review if it weren't for the ten line requirement. So let's see...As with 'Virgin' and 'Knocked Up', endless, jokeless, hard-core sex references; completely spit-out-of-a-computer movie smart-asses; a pair of keystone cops that make the ones from 'Police Academy' look like decorated CIA agents; a deplorably stupid daydream sequence involving a character's throat being slashed; a character obsessed with drawing male dongs?? Not to mention the most plot less screenplay since 'Beer League'. This features three high-school dunces spending an entire night trying to get to a party. Yep. That's it. And their numerous run-ins with hilarity which include standing outside a convenience store for a half hour and getting menstrual blood on their clothes. No, really.And 'McLovin'???? This is high-grade humor to people??!! Plus a glaring annoyance: what's with a group of early-20s filmmakers being obsessed with the 70s and 80s? Disco-ish soundtrack is out of place, as are the anachronisms; a kid who was 11-years-old in the year 2000 *COULD NOT* have had a Ghostbusters lunchbox. Get friggin' real.I will say this: the character of Evan is the only thing close to resembling a realistic (or *remotely* likable) character, who actually speaks with sincerity and thoughtfullness. When he FINALLY lays into his buddy detailing what a dumb-John he is, the film got (gasp!) authentic for a second.But the character of Seth is one of the more hateful and intolerable since Stiffler of the 'American Pie' films. A nauseating drone who YELLS his dialogue at everybody, which is nothing but a series of desperately profane insults and imbecilic bodily nicknames. Seriously, this refuse reeks of having been written in less than 24 hours.*ONLY* redeeming trait is the retro Columbia Pictures logo at the start, along with a kicky groove to begin things. It's quickly undermined (and erased) as soon as the script kicks in. But as mentioned in the summary, I'm done with the Apatow assembly-line of redundant vagina-inspired comedies.",2,6,13,30 December 2007
Home Alone," where Hughes went wrong
","Too bad for John Hughes, my favorite writer of the 80s.  His first offering of the 90s was this blockbuster, not a bad film, but one that started him on an unfortunate trend.  The storyline is ingenuis if you're trying to lure kids to see it, and releasing it during the holiday season made it an easy option for parents who wanted something PG rated for the little ones.  It concerns Culkin being left behind by his family during a mad dash to the airport.  When he awakens to an empty house, he stays unrealisticly calm. Most kids would probably be scared on their own, but he's unphased and makes the best of it, eating junk, jumping on his folks bed and staying up late watching R rated films.  His family finally notices him missing halfway to Paris and mom O'Hara takes the rest of the films running time to get back to him.  In the middle of living it up, Culkin discovers that a pair of hairbrained burglars plan on robbing his house.  He's ready for them, arming the entire home with an array of painful traps and devices.  Up until this point the film was slightly amusing, as Culkin, though not a great kid actor, was cute to watch go thru his little adventures.  But Hughes, writing genius that he is, waited till the end to hatch his goldmine idea that he knew kids would eat up.  Youngsters,  most of which who don't understand prolonged pain and find it funny, lapped up the cartoonish injuries heaped upon Pesci and Stern.  Watching as an adult, though, it just makes you uncomfortable, watching men scream in pain scene after scene. Hughes tries to cancel out the violence with a sappy happy ending, but it does nothing to erase the damage done by the unpleasantness.  And as said earlier, because of the 800 million dollar success of the film, Hughes would mire himself in a clone mode for the entire decade of the nineties! Constantly remaking this formula with even worse results each time.  It all went to show that even your best success cannot be the best thing for you, and all we can hope is that real John Hughes who we loved in the 80s will come home again.",Null,1,2,7 November 2000
Scary Movie 2," scary how bad this film is...
","What a step down from part 1.  I didn't totally enjoy that first installment, but it only just barely missed being on my DVD 'to buy' list. I knew about 15 minutes into to this one that there was NO WAY I'd have to consider whether or not to add this to my collection.  Aside from the fact that it's not as funny, the direction and editing are atrocious.  Angles where the actor is nearly out of the frame or shots that last literally half a second.  Wayans has directed a number of movies, so who knows why he dropped the ball here and made this look like a student film.  But, of course, above all else, you have to focus on the lack of laughs.  The targets this time around were either too old ('Poltergeist' was damn near 20 years ago people!) or too unknown (did more than 10 people actually see that crapfest, 'The Haunting'?).  Then when they stray away from horror all they do is copy something instead of parodying it.  The 'squeaky cleets' basketball commercial is basically just re-shot, and the 'Charlie Angels' stuff looks like that movie's scenes.  Or they just throw in confusing and out-of-place moments like the idiotic wheelchair battle (what the hell was that supposed to be anyway??).  Only three cast members return, like poor Anna Faris, a cute and talented actress, who is reduced to bugging her eyes and dropping her mouth every other scene.  The unfortunate young girl appears to be trying hard, given the junk script she's working with.  And when they can't come up with witty lines for her, they reduce her to getting put downs, or touches, upon her breasts, as well as masturbating a guy till he bombards her with gallons of sperm.  Yep, that's right!  They even resort to ripping THEMSELVES off here!  Everyone else is reduced to swearing (even a trash-mouthed parrot), or is just wasted, like cult fave Curry.  This whole thing smells of 'rushed into production' as over 10(!!!) writers couldn't come up with more than 2 or 3 good jokes.  The opening 10 minutes featuring James Woods in an 'Exorcist' spoof actually provide a bulk of the film's big laughs, but don't seem connected to this movie, seeing how awful the rest of it is.  And even they ripped off THAT too!  An 'Exorcist' parody was done over 10 years ago in a film called 'Repossessed'.  Just one last sign that this belongs in the crapper of the year's worst.",Null,0,1,21 July 2001
Knocked Up," please, make these films stop...
","Any thoughts of Apatow becoming the 2000's version of John Hughes -- several top-flight projects over a short period -- is pretty much officially dead. Sure, the prolific stream of scripts cranked out is there, but the quality? Hoo, man, not even remotely close.In what seems like his umpteenth telling of a group of one-track minded slacker idiots, we're treated to yet another underdeveloped hero who we'd never associate with in real life. This time it's the candidate for worst new leading man of cinema Rogan and the results of an utterly unlikely one night stand. He spins his wheels, trying to cope with his new predicament, all the while immersing himself as yet another failure to the 'just say no' program. But let's get to the real issues here...1. An absolute lack of chemistry between the leads. Heigl is totally unlikable as a one-note, demanding career woman, who garners zero sympathy for her moodswings....and that's before the hormones kick in! And Rogen, if I have to listen to that stoned-out, grating cackle of his one more time, I'll beg for my death.2. The supporting couple who annoy even more, Mann as an unbearable whine-machine, and Rudd in another one his sleep-walking roles as a hapless guru of life (who sneaks off to fantasy baseball meetings?? What in the living hell???).3. People complimenting Apatow's ability to touch on 'those sensitive and telling true-to-life comments about marriage and children'. Uhhh, when a majority of the characters are portrayed as not even slightly lovable, the pithy ruminations on their lives come off as false and unaffecting. Are these people you'd really want to spend one hour with??3. A tired, tired, TIRED screenplay approach where F-bombs and female anatomy discussions that seem so painfully forced, not containing a shred of reality to them.4. And the frigging ENDLESS pop culture references that just magnify that absence of creativity at the screenplay level. I watch movies to live through the lives of the characters, NOT to listen, and listen, and listen ad naseum to their ridiculously stupid amount of movie and music mentions. The infamous comparisons to the bearded buddy character alone were enough to elicit groans and a swirling head from me.Unfortunately, what made Freaks and Geeks so good to Apatow, is what's killing his film work: the freedom and ability to rely *strictly* on near NC-17, bodily and gross-out humor. The restraints of television actually caused him to -- gasp! -- write competently and engagingly. But after the 'Anchormans' and 'Virgins' and now this slop (plus the fact those and this were hits) sadly signals a trend he'll probably leave on his tombstone.",2,5,11,15 December 2007
Predator," 'Friday the 13th' action-style
","Basically an action version of 'Friday the 13th'.  You have your leafy-green surroundings, brains splattered on the camera lens, arms detached from bodies, and chests opened up (this got pretty good reviews in its time, which always amuses me: critics beat up horror films, but when it's presented in another format, it's a good movie.  Whatever).  For an 'action' film, most of the bullets are wasted on trees and plants of the jungle! Doesn't mean it's a bad film.  Scwarz and several other buff dudes venture into the jungle to find some baddies, only to discover some sort of wacko alien has shown up to disembowl people.  The rest of the film---again in Friday the 13th fashion---consists of the soldiers being stalked and blown apart.  When only Arnold is left, the film slows down a little too much for its finale.  Scwarzeneggar pretty much takes the place of the final female in a horror film to do battle with the sicko killer.  Unfortunately this wraps up disappointingly---with a suicide!  But along the way are some good scares and effects, so it should provide enough for action-adventure....and horror fans.",Null,0,0,4 January 2004
Cast Away," nearly hits the mark
","For a film that features basically one actor for an hour and a half, this delivers pretty well.  Hanks is some sort of air courier whose plane crashes in the middle of the ocean.  He manages to find an island and do the old 'live off the land' thing for awhile.  One of two things I didn't go for was the length of time he supposedly spends marooned.  Others have spoiled it but I will leave it to you in finding out, it just seemed too unreal.  I feel he would've lost his mind after just a few months if he didn't die from the elements first.  Hanks really manages to hold the film together pretty well, as they interject a good amount of comic moments.  The filming style is a bit odd, as Bob Z.  uses a sort of documentary style, using no music and shooting Hanks work activities mostly in close-up.  It's all well photographed, especially a very dramatic plane crash.  But that other thing I didn't like about the film makes a real difference: the totally dissatisfying ending.  After about 90 minutes on the island, the screenplay only dedicates about 15 minutes to Hanks homecoming (yes, that could be considered spoiling, but you probably saw it in the previews anyway).  Not enough of his return to society was explored, and things close out with a dull stare into the camera that doesn't resolve anything.  Also look out for shameless plugs for 'Federal Express' and Wilson volleyballs, which Hanks actually befriends(!).  That could've done with a little trimming as well, his wacked out love for the ball.  I know he's lonely and needed a 'companion', but they should've said enough already with the tears after he loses his buddy.  But I would suggest you go for the survival element, which totally shocked me with its pace.  I usually check my watch a few times during a film but was amazed to see it was the 2 hour mark when I first did it with this movie.  Zemeckis directed the most excellently paced movie ever (in my opinion), 'Back to the Future', and he doesn't fail here, keeping things going with engrossing vignettes of what Hanks goes thru.  The meager other cast members are good, like barely seen Hunt, who found herself in big holiday movies two weeks in a row.  But look out for that ending, which sinks 'Cast Away' from being great (couldn't resist).",8,0,0,25 December 2000
The Thing," many Things wrong...
","Wow.  Of the near 400 reviews on IMDB, I'm only one of about four or five who didn't go for this.  Sure the effects are mind-blowing and the score's pretty good, but so much more was needed.  Start with the pace.  In between some pretty good scares and gore, are painful lulls that drag forever.  The set-up is intrigueing, but then goes on too long.  Later it's far too much talking that does the film in, 'Is it you or you or you or...'.  An unidentified 'thing' happens upon an unidentified research team to inexplicably devour them from within.  Tack on one of the biggest loose ends in film history, and you've got a plethora of annoying unanswered questions. And of course this is better than the original.  That film came out in 1951, far from the advances of Rob Bottin's awesome transformation effects. But that's all this has going for it, and that's not enough to recommend this Thing.",Null,1,6,7 June 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," warning: NOT your average slasher experience...
","Not just for a remake, but for any horror film, this was not your typical set-em-up and knock-em-off time at the movies. Director Aja really went above and beyond for this remake of the 1977 tale of a family driving through the desert, only to be set upon by a group of wackjob, homicidal cannibals. The film has an odd look to it, sort of retro but in the current age. There's cell phones and nubile young blondes, but also a travel trailer right out of the 70s and a ton of oldies featured on the soundtrack. That's all moot compared to the mayhem that ensues during this gruesome, relentless bloodbath. There's choppings, gunshots, people set afire, rape, and even an icepick planted into a man's testicular area. But Aja brings out a more emotional element by extending his terror scenes. The audience is no longer laughing and munching popcorn. They're murmuring and hiding their eyes. One passage in particular features one girl being raped, another having her breast sucked, and finally an unexpected moment of shocking violence. Unfortunately, some of the seriousness is taken away because some of the actions are committed by mutants. It becomes all too aware we're looking at actors in make-up (laughably, one villain looks like Sloth from 'The Goonies'), which somewhat takes away from the believability of it all. As well the above-mentioned fire scene, which just looks ridiculous. Plus the fact the hero takes so much abuse before finally standing up for himself, your patience runs thin. And if you've seen the original, one really effective scene is dropped, involving using a dead body in a lawnchair as bait. But for hardcore gore fans, don't you be worried for a second. This features more brutality and nihilistic carnage than the original. Which doesn't make it any better than the first one, though this a decent film. Technically it looks awesome, with very fluid direction from Aja, and a great recurring musical sting that has a subtle 'bong....bong' to it. Though at times that standard, pounding 'CLANG!' to scare an audience is overused when a character is only passing in front of the camera or scaring another. I can't say it's a great film overall, but is much better than the other remakes out today, but be forewarned again: DO NOT buy any food before going into the theater. You'll save $10 bucks, too.",6,7,15,12 March 2006
American Psycho," Bale-out....
","Over 800 comments, so I usually don't bother, but I must speak...This is one of the more ungodly stupid movies I've watched in a while. From Bale's first line-delivery where he seems to channel Jim Carrey, to all of the blathering murder sequences (with endlessly needless dissertations on 80s music), I was fidgeting pretty quick. Then it totally lost me minutes later when he inexplicably stabs a homeless man and stomps a small dog to death. And this after both encouraging the man and then telling him what a waste of life he is. An anti-hero if I've ever seen one. The entire tone of this film is insanely awkward, at times seeming to be a comedy dealing with a self-absorbed narcissist, who happens to sprinkle in blood-drenched murders here and there. No, I haven't read the book, and no, maybe I don't get the 'satirical' approach others love. Either way, it was just jumbled garbage. Bale is a chameleon of sorts, sometimes resembling Cruise or Hart Bochner, but that unbearable, irritatingly pompous voice grated on me pretty quick. Only saving grace is some great 80s period atmosphere, right down to a keypad on an ATM machine with the BIG WHITE numbers. Other than that, cultists will be sure to keep this alive and well for years to come.",Null,3,6,10 March 2007
The Shining," spooky ghost story
","Again I am too late to provide any new insight for a film, with it allready having been commented on 80 times on IMDb, but the only new thing I can add is give this film time to get going.  Yes, the beginning is a bit talky, but it didnt bother me cuz it was pretty interesting.  And thats basically what will make this work for you, if you find the hotel and its history intriguing or not.  I was very drawn to the story because of the huge scale, like the BIG hotel, the looong running time, the climax that took about 45 minutes.  It will all depend on what grabs you the most.  There's plenty of memorable moments; redrum, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, the creepy twin girls, bloody elevators, heeeeres Johnny!, and that yucky old lady in the bathtub...ewwww.  The finale is really drawn out and takes a while to unfold, but it just makes more time for spookiness.  I mean when Duvall is running through the hotel and keeps encountering twisted image after twisted image, coupled with that chilling music, I was freaked.  I'd also have to say this will take multiple viewings before everything makes sense (I had to explain a lot when my girlfriend watched it for the first time), with some of the characters not clearly defined enough.  Like I'm assuming that bartender was one Nicholson knew from his drinking days.  And for those who think this is boring, just read the book and tell me whats better.  Kings novel is even moooore blah blah blah, with the ending here much better.  Jacks and Kubricks best.",Null,0,0,21 July 1999
American Beauty," yeah, it'll grab ya
","It always surprises me how when stuff like this ends up on 'The Jerry Springer Show' (and he does have TONS of stuff like what's in this film), it's touted as 'trash'.  Yet, when it finds its way to the big screen, it can win Oscars.  Hmm.  And number 6 on IMDB's top 250 list?  Wow!  Anywho, a working stiff loser (Spacey) decides to spice up his life with hasty decisions.  Meanwhile, his perky-beyond-belief wife (Bening) shakes things up as well, and their sad sack daughter (Birch) begins a fascination with a peeping Tom (Bentley) next door.  That's basically it, but writer Ball juices up the proceedings with trendy, 90's explicit dialogue and outrageous situations.  That was my only problem with this.  In terms of pace and entertainment value, the happenings were fine.  In terms of believability, I didn't think for a second this could take place where it's all set.  Upper class suburbia?  Not-uh.  Where Jerry Springer's guests reside, maybe.  The fact that two families, equally mentally unbalanced, could be living next door to each other, was too unrealistic for me.  At least the performances should grab you.  Spacey, doing yet another rendition of his soft spoken, cool, confident type characters, is terrific as the sarcastic Lester. Bening, I would guess, purposely overdid the phoney, smiley housewife well enough.  Birch, a looong way from her child acting days, does nicely as the alienated teen.  Supporting them were Suvari, the sexy teen bimbo obsession of Spacey's, and Bentley as the creepy guy next door.  They give you lots to chew on, plus an ending with a couple of surprises.  But as we usually see in films, after the big climax, the credits roll and we never find out the fate of some of the characters.  Always annoying.

","Funny what packs the crowds in today, with this box-office hit another head-scratcher. Put four guys in a roundtable, have them talk like one-gear hormonal high schoolers, and ka-ching! Endless references to vaginas, breasts, conquests, along with F-words tossed in every other line of dialogue, and you have this dead excuse for a comedy. I'm not a prude by any means, but when jokes aren't mixed into the language, it looks more desperate than anything else. A bit of steam is picked up around the speed-dating montage, but not nearly enough to give this any life. Heavily populated by unrealistic characters and ridiculous outcomes, it was trial to sit through the whole thing. Sure, credibility is stretched in movies, but when every girl's a slut, employees are allowed to smash flouressent lights, videotape their butts, and get into car accidents with no repercussions, you only yell at the screen instead of laugh at it.

","What a relief the 'Superman' movies didn't start off like this.  They manage a decent first half hour here with some good jokes and a fair set-up, but then things run drastically off course.  First off, the film is totally plotless.  For some twenty minutes McGuire just zips all over the city shouting with glee as he finds out what his new body can do.  The tone is much too goofy for what happens next, the carjack-death of his uncle.  The killer is quickly dispatched, paving the way for one of the more truly dumb villians in movie history.  It's a rich guy, who while testing a product, has things go wrong with it unleashing an evil alter ego of himself.  Big screw-up, creating an UNWILLING villian.  This guy has no passion for destruction or dominance like Lex Luthor or Jack Napier.  He's a man posessed by a being FORCING him to be bad.  Watching a villian not really want to pull of the stunts he's doing makes it hard to hate him.  To top it off, his side of the visual effects are extremely cheesy.  I absolutely DETEST CGI as it just looks totally false, which much of the film does. The Spidey stuff is fairly convincing, but the Goblin on his air thingy look completely phoney.  His zips around much too quickly like he's on fast forward, with bad backgrounds for his victims as they're dangled off balconies or buildings.  Throw in horribly outdated lines like 'We'll meet again, Spider-Man!' and you've got a pretty lousy flick.  McGuire at least carries it nicely, though I feel he's way too young (more like Spider-BOY as his character is barely 18).  Dunst really breaks out in a very sexy role as I could look at her forever.  Everyone else is kind of bland and doesn't really stand out.  My biggest beef comes early on after McGuire discovers the powers.  Now imagine this: that in the original 'Superman', when Clark discovers his powers, he enters a wrestling contest to make money to buy a car so he can impress a girl.  It would've totally ruined the film.  Well, that's what they did here!  They even dug up Randy 'Macho Man' Savage and put him a steel cage with McGuire, killing any chance at an emotional dynamic in the film, and playing a lot of scenes for dumb jokes. THANKFULLY 'Superman 1 and 2' did not take this route and gave us lots of drama to chew on.  This?  Lots of bubblegum nonsense to chew on.",Null,0,0,28 January 2003
Die Hard 2," die-ing for more!
","Superior action film that drenches testosterone all over the damn place. Explosions, gunfights, fistfights, and even time for lethal icecycles.  You don't have to have seen the first to enjoy this either, as it's pretty straight-forward: a team of wackos wants to rescue their drug-dealing leader from a jail term in the states, so they stage this huge, elaborate takeover of a Washington, D.C. airport where he's about to be delivered.  Willis is waiting around for his wife's plane to land and catches on to things, thwarting himself into one delirious moment after another.  I didn't enjoy the first film, had too many needless characters and dialogue, part 3 was a massively annoying wild goose chase, but this is how action films should (and unfortunately used to) be made.  Well-paced, multi-layered plot but not too much so, a great twist toward the end, and probably the biggest way you could finish it all save blowing up the entire planet earth.  I really look forward to the long awaited part 4 due out next year....FINALLY!",8,0,1,15 February 2003
Remember the Titans," tries to be too cute
","Forget the fact that this is billed as a racial underdog drama, and focus on the real plot:  play oldies every 3 minutes and have big, bad football players sometimes sing these oldies every 5.  Ugh, got old real quick.  How many friggin' times do you expect to be able to fall back on the same damn thing and not end up in the desperation category?  Here, let's try and look cute by throwing in a bunch of dancing and singing.  What is this, sports movie or musical?  And as far as the sports element, aggrevating as well. Washington, in his most unlikable role ever, works to death a team of high school pigskin kids.  He quickly turns into a jerk, and I didn't care what happened to him or his team.  And the constant, constant, CONSTANT in-fighting between the black and white players.  Such tired, tired, tired scenes, and it's gosh damn endless!  And of course the team kicks butt and Denzel is looked at as a Godsend...enough.  The performances are decent enough (how the hell did journeyman Patton get a 2nd billed role in a film?!) but this predictable, cutesy fluff has been overpraised.  And it's based on a true story?  Doesn't make it any better.  One smile I got from it was from the title.  Made for a good joke: 'Remember the Titans'?  What is that, a film about condoms?",Null,0,1,20 May 2001
Good Will Hunting," good God, good Will....
","Over-praised melodrama of a gifted math-whiz who loves to flaunt his gift, but when approached about it, plays it off with an annoying 'Don't bother me' attitude. After a street fight, the whiz (grumpy Damon) is actually given exemption from sentencing, provided that he dazzle a teacher as to why he's so good with numbers. The kid is so closed off that he's actually remanded to counseling with a hot-shot shrink to help open him up. The rest is a dull exchange of dialogue over several sessions until (lo and behold) the kid opens up and becomes a better person. Yay. Another one of those 'realism' scripts, where they think the F-bomb dropped every other word is effective character building. Please. Plus some painfully forced macho moments, such as Damon spouting an endless deluge of analysis on the art of the pick-up, and his lackluster taunting of a rival. 'Do you like apples? I got her phone number. How do you like those apples?' Congrats, gasbag, you got some flat-chested Englishwoman's phone number. Someone call the Smithsonian.

I Am Legend," You Are Not
","I've long loved post-apoc movies. The filmmakers shutting down roads, towns, showing us normally populated meccas as baron and remote. Allowing us to peek in on 'what if we were the last person of earth?'. My first memory (hey, I grew up on the 80s) of this was a teen entry into the genre with 1984's 'Night of the Comet'. That ran out of ideas after 45 minutes and threw in zombies to complete the running time. And he we are 23 years later, with the same result.Yes, I know this is a based on a book from a LONG time ago, but it doesn't diminish the same sad fact. That why do all of these catastrophe movies have to ALWAYS exclusively involve a variation of blood-thirsty bizarros roaming the streets, looking to kill? Can't anyone just focus on a lone survivor, and what one would do with so much time? 'Cast Away' came the closest to getting it right, and 'I Am Legend' can be lumped with the 'Night of the Comet's and '28 Days Later's.But that's only the half of it. When Smith isn't dodging wack-job CGI geeks, his 'down-time' is handled in the most embarrassing fashions. Setting up mannequins in a video store, interacting with them, listening to Bob Marley(??), delivering pablum to a German Shepard such as, 'If I'm not back by nightfall, leave'. Think he can't top himself later? Grab hold of somethin'.In the film's most inexcusable, deliriously moronic moment, Smith actually recites lines...to Shrek!! No, not one line, not two. He delivers nearly an entire scene's worth of dialogue as he freaks out a woman and child he's discovered. I had felt like the filmmakers had switched genres mid-way through and had decided on slapstick.The CGI...is well, the CGI. Monsters look fake, move fake, overly artificial refuse. But we knew it would be, so enough on that subject.The ending then suggests that Smith be regarded as some kind of saintly warrior with a deliberately nauseating voice-over that had me throwing pens at the television. Not to mention zero resolution to main plight of the characters (I guess that's in the second book?) Smith is good as usual, but he can't pull this underdeveloped, shoddy screen adaptation out of its own mistaken direction. Netflix 'Night of the Comet' instead. And hate me later.",4,1,2,20 December 2008
Back to the Future Part III," good finale
","Us BTTF fans hated to see it end, but it had to sometime as Marty ventures to the old west to rescue Doc from being gunned down.  Though Id rank this the third best in the series, that is in no way saying its bad.  The writing is still strong, the action is still very good and the characters likable as always.  Like with part II there are a handful of scenes reminiscent of the first film ('Mom is that you?', a chase out of the local hangout, spinnning license plate, etc.).  The difference here is that time travelling is out of the question with a disabled DeLorean, with the main focus being finding a way to get it moving fast enough to beam them back.  They figure out a scheme that could work, but both Marty and Doc must avoid certain death if they wanna make it happen.  As with the other two films, nothing goes smoothly with several complicating factors finding their way in. The biggest one, Doc falling in love with a school teacher (Steenburgen).  And no matter what time zone your in, theres always trouble with Biff, who this time is represented by his uncle, Buford.  The conclusion nearly matches part 1 for drama, with an extremely exciting race down a railroad track on a hijacked locomotive.  The only real disappointing moment came in the last five minutes, with Marty and Doc just ho-hummingly shaking hands to say goodbye. After all they've been through, they couldnt at least hug?  Seemed a little impersonal, but not a huge misstep, so not too much harm done.  Good ZZ Top song 'Doubleback' used as the theme and of course the great Alan Silvestri provides another terrific score.  And I am like others whod love to see the series continued someday, but unfortunately it would take something really special to do that.  So I never get close to holding my breath about seeing film histories two most famous time travellers back in business.",Null,0,0,26 August 1999
Casualties of War," gripping tale of war
","The odd thing about this film, is that it could've taken place with any background.  War, college campus, neighborhood gang.  The real plot is about the affects of rape and murder on the good guy and the bad guys.  The Vietnam war just happens to be where it really took place, so we are entered into that gritty world of sudden violence, if not sudden death.  Fox is a rookie soldier joining Penn's squad.  Penn sort of casually mentions that they're gonna find themselves a girl to 'keep up morale' while they are on their journey.  This involves abducting a young farm girl from her villiage in the middle of the night, not affected in the least by the girl's hysterical mother.  Each man (it's a group of 5) has his different reaction, Riley as the dumb 'go along with anything' soldier does exactly that, Harvey, in a terrific wacko performance, loves the idea, with Leguizamo and Fox opposed.  But Leguizamo, feeling the equivalent of teen peer pressure, does not back Fox when the two want to approach Penn about his antics.  So Fox is left in an awkward position the rest of his stay in the field with his squad.  There is of course, a confrontation, in a drawn out scene, where toughies Penn and Harvey accuse him of being gay and not doing to the enemy what they deserve.  This is the core of the film's impact, as they quarrel, the girl is raped, and then Penn demands that Fox kill her!  When she becomes ill, Penn fears her coughing may give away their posistion, so he berates Fox to stab her.  He refuses, and in an ensuing arguement, the girl tries to get away, which ends up leading to a chaotic scene in which she reaches a slow, painful demise.  The rest of the film deals with Fox trying to bring attention about what happened to his mostly deaf and incompotent superiors.  That brief summary, though, barely scratches the surface of the emotionally charged scenes you will experience in the movie.  There are many sad moments even before the girl is introduced.  And then audience anguish when we think that maybe these men will get away with what they did.  The key to the impact is, of course, the performances.  Penn is his usual out of control self, who you may feel bad for, seeing how he's such a dedicated soldier and even decent guy before the kidnapping.  An underrated and hardly known Don Harvey, I think somewhat outshines Penn with his always angry, scary corporal whose dark eyes and contant scowl give him a great intimidation factor.  Riley makes you roll your eyes with his convincing moron, a guy who baffles as to why he'd get into the army, with his I.Q. seeming to be below 40.  Leguizamo you try to forgive because of how he's afraid of being attacked verbally, or even physically, by his partners. You can understand his dilemma.  Le, as the girl, as expected has little to say, but in her facial expressions, shows us the fright and terror that's enough to jar us.  And as far as Fox is concerned, a PERFECT performance and choice for him to show us his dramatic side.  He did so sometimes on 'Family Ties' and in a couple of cinematic bombs (i.e. 'Light of Day', 'Bright Lights, Big City') but those works did not nearly approach the powerful scope that this film exhibits.  And he puts his dramatic talent on full blast, displaying the mental exhaustion so well, from the disturbing events he went through. It was a very big key to his career when he decided to take this.  Some might say how can you make entertainment out of rape, but the one scene of it is only 2 minutes long, with the real story here of how people handle themselves in crisis.  The only mis-steps were the sometimes overly violin-ey score, getting a little too weepy here and there.  And also the fact that even though Fox is the one good guy of the film, we never find out his first name!  But there are too many hard hitting moments of realism to sink this, with the best highlight being the strong acting.",Null,41,49,17 November 2000
The Evil Dead," overpraised silliness
","For years I had heard this thing hyped to the hilt and finally the other night I rented it to find out if I would love it as much as everyone else. I know its inappropriate to compare a sequel to an original work before the sequel came out, but I had been a relatively big fan of 'Evil Dead 2' for many years so I looked forward to this.  Unfortunately, this thing takes forever to get to the much heralded gore, and when it does, it's just plain ridiculous.  There's the usual blood, but director Raimi also shoots white, green and an assortment of other colored goo at us which eventually ends up looking dumb.  Especially in the last five minutes, where it is literally non-stop disembowling on a couple of the bodies that seemed to squirt anything Raimi could think of.  Stuff I would venture to say doesn't even exist in the human body.  One character even appeared to be shooting cottage cheese at one point as his (or her, the body was so badly deformed I couldn't tell anymore) innards were displayed endlessly.  And for the first time in a film, and I would guess the last, a woman is even forced to have sex with a wooden stick!  This is all happening because of wacko spirits who have been released from an ancient book in a remote mountain cabin where some college students have gone to unwind.  Instead, these spirits, which REALLY delight in possessing and then opening up their victims ad naseum, show up to ruin their fun.  The cast is ok, there are some good spooky shots, but the over the top and ultimately silly gore moments make this solely for serious bloodhounds.",Null,0,1,14 November 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill *Me*...
","Your typical overstylized, bloodsoaked Tarantino talk-fest is sure to wow some but make others fall asleep. Upon awakening from a four-year coma induced by a gunshot to the head, does Thurman rehibilitate? No, she flies all over the world slicing and dicing about two-hundred people, including those responsible for her near death. I enjoyed the first ten minutes, which actually contained a little realism (something lacking in any Tarantino effort). Then there's dialogue lulls, an endless Japanimation sequence, sword battles resulting in more dead bodies than any 'Friday the 13th' film, and those patented, asinine kinds of lines only read in a Tarantino film. 'When do you want to die, b*tch?', 'Silly rabbitt, Trix are for...' (other character finishes) '...kids.' Again, the first few minutes seemed grounded in at least a bit of reality. Unfortunately this is followed by people flying and severed limbs that shoot gallons of blood while the victim rolls and screams and one person killing an army of men....enough. At least cheesefests like 'American Ninja' kept the hero somewhat able to be doing what he was doing. Here Thurman so effortlessly hacks away at people in live-action video game style that you just roll your eyes. It is far, far too long after the fact of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But again, Tarantino's fans (and sadly bandwagon critics) will feel this big-budget studio horror film should take away an arm full of Oscars.",Null,0,1,22 June 2004

Way too many slow spots, gags so ridiculous you're not laughing you're rolling your eyes while muttering an 'oh puleeeze.'  The infamous zipper moment I've seen before in episodes of 'Wings' and 'Picket Fences,' though it was dragged out to excruciating length in this film.  And as far as the 'hair gel' scene, how the hell did Stiller get the 'stuff' on his ear??  If you're gonna do a dumb gag, at least make it believable!  After rewinding a few times to check I found NOOO concievable way for Stiller to achieve that and therefore it distracted from any laugh they were aiming for to get from me.  Only way I got through the whole 2 hours was cuz of Diaz beauty and Stillers likability, but other than that, this completely baffles as to why so many people adored this so much.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," hughes continues his plummet
","Hughes first installment was decent up to a point, before the violence erupted.  Here he somehow was greenlighted even though he used the EXACT same script, at some times right down to dialogue used in the first film. As others have pointed out, the title is a misnomer as Culkin ends up on the wrong flight and wanders New York for a couple of days.  Some said his acting improved, I still found him stiff in his delivery, but that didn't stop Little Mac from netting 6 mil for this.  His adventures this time around are a little duller, as he basically spends money all over the place and dazzles adults with his outlook on life.  It's all filler to lead up to what the kids came for, more painful burglar bashings, even more extended and tortuous than the first movie.  How many times can these take a hit and have it be funny?  After one or two, it just gets unbelievable, and then uncomfortable.  Again, Pesci and Stern squeal their lungs out as they're dropped, slammed, electrocuted, torched, bonked, etc.  At least the gags in the first film had a shread of credibility.  Here, Hughes concocts such ridiculous means of slapstick that you roll your eyes in disbelief.  Take for instance the scene where Culkin magically (thats the only word to describe it) gets Stern to jump on a plank placed over a barrell so he can hurtle Pesci several feet into the air, and land on top of a car, smashing its windows to bits.  Or the dumbest moment that others have mentioned, when Culkin flings brick after brick from a rooftop into a dumbstruck Stern's face.  Didn't anyone on set say 'ok, come on, now this is kind of stretching it.'  This is one of the most depressing 'comedies' to come along in awhile, that has no idea what Christmas should be about.  But more infuriating for me, is that my writing mentor Hughes has truly sunk with this crap.  Only bright spot is a terrific theme song by Darlene Love, 'All Alone on Christmas'.  Otherwise, nothing of value, except the few hundred million suckered into turning out for this waste.",Null,0,1,7 November 2000
The Fly," swat this bugger
","I tried once before and my review didnt go thru, so I must try again to warn people about this film.  Im sure most have already seen it or at least heard about it, but for those who havent, this is one of those films that has one scene that entirely destroys the whole film.  A film where everything is so good but one moment towards the end negates all the terrific qualities about it.  The plot is pretty basic as Goldblum is a reclusive scientist testing a transporting machine.  At first he uses food items or animals, but one night out of anger he dares himself to go through, which he does successfully.  Unaware to him was that a fly was in the booth with him and their genes get spliced together causing him to slowly turn into a big bug.  We watch him deal with the sadness of seeing his life dramatically change and how he loses the love of his sympathetic girlfriend (Davis).  You'll really pull for this guy, hoping he finds the cure and can reverse things.  But just as you think hes about to in the films climax, he turns psycho and does something so unbelievably cruel, that he turns into the bad guy and you say screw his cure, let em die.  Thats when he gets ahold of John Getz's character, who is trying to rescue Davis, and vomits acid on his hand, melting it in a truly disgusting, disturbing sequence. We have to listen to Getz scream in pain for some 45 seconds (at least) until his hand is reduced to a stump.  Goldblum sets him down and just when you think thats it...he vomits on Getz foot, dismembering it from his leg!  You think 'why the hell was that necessary?' until you remember David Cronenberg, who likes to torture his characters, co-wrote and directed the film.  Only undamaged thing to the film was the great, creepy Howard Shore score.  But thats what I meant when I said one scene killed the whole film for me.  And if youre like me, you'll be glad when Davis.................",Null,1,4,21 August 1999
Reservoir Dogs," somewhat interesting
","There's sort of an unwritten rule that you shouldn't review movies before their time, but I gotta break it here in saying this is the only one of Tarantino's films I remotely liked.  Everything he followed up with disinterested me, the dialogue laden, near 3 hour yawn-fest 'Pulp Fiction', the meandering 'True Romance', the dull vampire offering 'From Dusk till Dawn', and '...Fiction' wannabe/clone 'Jackie Brown'.  His pacing here (most of the time) is frenetic and the characters always have something interesting to say.  But what didn't make it recommendable for me was Tarentino's usual overwriting in some scenes.  An example would be the moments in the office of the head honcho, which go on way too long.  And some of Roth's undercover nonsense should've been trimmed, but after knowing of this film for years and avoiding it because of Tarantino's other offerings that I didn't go for, I got stunned at the watchability here. There's lots of tension, some action, time for laughs, and plenty of moments that pop outta nowhere and stun.  Oh, the plot?  A group of thieves get screwed over during a jewel heist and hold up in a wharehouse trying to figure out what went wrong.  But via flashbacks, we are given a glimpse into other activities of the men.  It manages to stay engrossing enough, though it's too bad about the longer moments that drown it, either from too much dialogue or Tarantino lingering on one shot for an entire seen like he revels in doing.  As far as the infamous cop torture scene, he wisely pans away from the goings on to avoid too much unpleasantness, and just shocks with the aftermath.  But be warned, there is a lot of bloodletting throughout the film, I guess the amount you'd expect from a crime movie.  So even though it may not work for most, this'll still give you a lot to chew on.",Null,0,1,28 December 2000
Pretty Woman," Pretty Average....
","I remember this hitting home video about six months after its whirlwind run in theaters. $100 million bucks, the return of Gere, the juggernaut of Roberts. And not even halfway into the film I had a surprising reaction....people fell in love with this? Such a slight, unaffecting little story involving a 'hooker with a heart of gold!' (as she was dubbed in the trailers) and a near-comatose businessman who seemed like he was on quaaludes. It's a pretty safe bet that the financial returns of this film were driven by young girls yearning for that White Knight and couples choosing a movie as a first date. Guys were probably bored crapless, and women swooned at Gere's money-spraying nice guy.But even with that a major component, the film's vignettes are not that spectacular. Polo match, opera night, fancy restaurant dinner. Not exactly jets to Paris and moved into a mansion (a majority of the film takes place in a hotel room!). I guess the gals had reason to coo over Roberts' wardrobe fiesta, with the various dress-up sessions and flashy gowns she parades around in. And for the guys? Well, there is that polo match.Not to say the film is totally worthless. Roberts obviously conveys a charm that appealed to both sexes, she wouldn't have become a superstar without it. Gere is a decent enough guy, so subdued that he doesn't pose any sort of threat. And the age difference (19 years!!) shockingly has no hampering effect on their chemistry together. Others supporting them such as Elizondo and Larry Miller's infamous suck-up salesman provide a few grins.But the 'comedy' side of the script is so light and harmless ('I nearly peed my pants'; mishandling of shellfish) you're nearly lulled into oblivion by the excessive breezniness of the story. Add on some cutesy 'Bwahahaa!' bursts of laughter from Roberts childlike character, and a forced bad-guy climax involving Alexander's lecherous lawyer, and the cookie-cutter should be nice and broken in.",5,1,3,11 October 2008
Psycho," Hitch's best
","What else can I add about this film?  One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay.  Leigh embezzels money and skips town.  She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins).  Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background.   They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering 'mother' (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother).  She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman.  The mother?  You'll find out if you haven't seen it.  The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh.  I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies ('Frenzy' was ok).  Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career.  He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time.  A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film.  There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.  As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked.",7,1,3,12 January 2001
Wedding Crashers," audience thrashers....
","Movies are about escapism, yes. But what the frig world did this gas-brained comedy take place in? Weddings that have the atmosphere of one of those overblown Academy Award dance numbers; where every sexy woman is a no-nonsense slut; and rich families portrayed not only as dysfunctional, but that would require sixteen closets to hide the skeletons and black sheep.As far as the cast, Vaughn, he's an okay actor. He has that puffy, charismatic every-guy quality that can work at times. Wilson on the other hand...a short, youthfully-faced dweeb who looks like he has a 30-year-old wig on his head. Walken (as usual) can just make you laugh with his now patented vocal approach, and Seymour now officially qualifies as a GILF who could steam up a teenager.But this dead, wish-fullfillment screenplay gives no one anything unique to do in the slightest, and leaves you raging your fists at the skies as to why it made so much money. When you constantly see major league athletes listing this as their favorite movie of *ALL TIME*, you know the fabric of the universe is in a catastrophicly failing flux.We've all been to weddings, right? Let me follow that up with this: when have you *ever* come close to experiencing anything like this? If you have, write a book, I'd love to read it. For me, been to about 15 weddings in my life, and allow me to summarize *my* experience: *EVERY*, every woman comes with a date. There are no hot, single, promiscuous bimbos hoping to get nailed; nobody takes to the dance floor in frenzied abandon to hoist people into the air; the food sucks; and everybody wants to leave the reception after about an hour.Now, make *that* into a watchable film.

Hitch," clever, but there's a 'hitch'....
","After a razor-sharp, if a bit unbelievable, opening sequence, this settles into a slightly humorous tale of a dating specialist. If you have the patience to wait five minutes between laughs, then you may be all for it. But there was something just a little too breezy about the whole thing, that I just didn't fall in love with it. At first you think Smith is pulling a 'Ferris Bueller' by addressing the camera. But this is suddenly dropped and only referred to again in the final shot. But Smith is given some insightful material on dating, men and women, and the tricks used to acquire such. Some on-target, like a guy offering to buy a tired female jogger an ice-cream. Or implausible, with the opening nonsense involving a dog in a bag(??) and a faked accident. They then set up the James/Smith partnership, which I was surprised was not the core of the film. Because it's Will Smith, I guess the makers felt necessary to give him a romantic sub-plot as well. The James bits, though a bit ham-handed and too reliant on slapstick, had a certain charm because he and Smith click on screen. But the woman James is chasing---a dead ringer for Cameron Diaz---doesn't evoke that 'dreamgirl' quality that an audience would root for. Later it's time to delve into the Mendes/Smith courtship, which is more sluggish. Mendes, an oddly faced actress (sometimes she's cute, sometimes she looks like a guy), is one of those spit-fires who seems like it'll take a crowbar and some dynamite to get into her heart (punctuated by an incredibly forced 'meet cute' in a bar, laden with annoying third-person chat).Which leads to another problem with Smith's elaborate dates. Yeah, it would be nice if we all had thousands of dollars to go jet-skiing around the East River, or have a private tour of Ellis Island. And don't get me started on the 'everybody forgives everybody' happy ending. Plus movie-junk where everyone is connected in some way or another. He knows her, but she finds out it's him, and he didn't know she talked to that guy...ugh. Or the fact that Smith is outed as 'The Date Doctor' and it turns into tabloid fodder all over Manhattan. Like anyone would care there's a misinterpreted player out there trying to coach guys on how to score with women. Snore. But if you're a viewer who can disregard that and suspend disbelief, you'll at least laugh here and there over the course of the running time.",5,7,11,25 September 2005
Ray," 'Ray' could be called 'Jamie'...
","Unfortunately, the only thing to keep you engrossed in this standard biography is the wonderment of Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the late crooner Ray Charles. The actors behind Foxx are so typical of a bio-film---melodramatic and plain---that Foxx has to fight to keep the film afloat. His uncanny resemblance and talent at the piano keys draw you in right away. The flashbacks, for once in a film, don't distract, as we are able to kick off with Charles adult life, but intersperse experiences from his past every now and then. But after about an hour the film stalls, stuck in the late '50s and on Charles' heroic addiction. I wished they would've pushed the story forward and not lingered on this 'till I was saying, 'Ok, I get it. He was hooked on the stuff'. Plus the fact Charles becomes an anti-hero halfway through with all his marital dalliances. The director, Taylor Hackford, was much more captivating with his masterful 'La Bamba' from 1987. The supporting characters in that film weren't assembly-line, as one of them almost stole the show. But here his approach seems to stall out halfway through, causing you to check your watch for when it'll finally move. And at two and a half hours, that's a lot of glances at your wrist. If for anything else, watch it for Foxx's bang-up performance.",Null,2,3,20 February 2005
The Waterboy," a few big laughs
","Sandler's last offering 'The Wedding Singer' spread little laughs througout, this one gave me big laughs but only a few times.  The old standby, affecting a funny voice for the sake of laughs, actually worked here. Sanlder's southern accented kiddie voice made me smile most of the time. Though at 31, he's obviously playing the character as a child, as when he lowers his eyes and mutters 'stop makin' fun of me' and then plows into somebody.  The football coach of the team he serves water for (the still recognizable former Fonz', Winkler) talks him into joining the team because of his prowess at flattening players.  His traditional mother objects as he's thrust into a party/slutty girls everywhere/reckless lifestyle.  As mentioned earlier, they hit the mark a few times, (like the goofy Colonel Sanders tackle) but not enough for me to recommend.",Null,1,1,25 November 2000
Halloween," not too bad
","In going through the 100 or so reviews posted on this site, I was glad to see I wasn't the only one who felt this film was only ok.  Yes it started the whole slasher phenomenon, but it just wasn't slam bang enough for me.  The killings are tame (strangled, knifed) the scariness is decent, (a very good finale) and the music is spooky enough.  I just needed more, which I got in future dead-teenager movies (love my Friday the 13ths).  I can say this is the best in the series, with a final shot that is creepier than hell.  So a not so bad start to the genre.",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
Back to the Future Part II," lot more shakin goin on
","The first time I saw this I was extremely disappointed.  Not as many laughs, not as much heart, and so many problems for the characters to fix.  But after watching it 5 or 6 times it became one of the better action/adventure films I'd seen.  The main appeal for me was how it picked up right where part 1 ended.  Though four years later in real time, the actors had to put back on the same outfits, do the same lines and be in the same setting (Martys driveway).  Most of us remember Docs 'theres gotta be something done about your kids' that ended the last movie.  They head off to 2015 and after Martys business with his kids is taken care of in an elaborate chase on flying skateboards (I loved those things), he buys a book detailing the outcomes of sporting events from the previous 50 years.  Doc is outraged at Martys desire to take it back and place bets to fatten his bank account and throws it away.  It ends up in the hands of our favorite bully Biff (now 77) and he reeks havoc with it after commandeering the briefly unoccupied Delorean.  All the mayhem Biff causes leads Marty and Doc back in time to fix it, and oddly enough...they end up back at the exact same week in 1955 of Martys first adventure!  How convenient!  It was the only way the filmmakers could use the truly clever idea of re-witnessing the first movie from another angle as Marty has to do work out of view of his 'other self.' Though totally unbelievable that Biff would choose that date to go back to so he could give himself the sports book, its extremely well done and something we've never seen in a movie.  But as soon as the problem with Biff is squared away, theres a dramatic set up for a third movie!  The groan let out by the audience I was with was warranted as it was a little annoying. As far as the future scenes go, they were pretty impressive.  The expected high tech gadgets are featured and they'll definately raise your eyebrows. The overall effects are great as many of the actors have to do scenes with themselves sometimes, like when Fox plays 3 at once.  Theres also a lot of scenes from the original film parodied here and the only way to get em is to have seen part 1 numerous times.  From what I heard Shue replaced Wells as Jennifer because of 'personal problems' and Glover didnt show up because he wanted Michael J. Fox type money.  He got it when he sued Speilberg for using footage of him from part 1 without permission.  What a weiner.  So though not as good as the first trip, this is still enjoyable for film fans who like movies that keep them on their toes.",Null,0,1,25 August 1999
Vanilla Sky," STUPID! BORING! INCOHERENT! SHOULD I GO ON??
","Here we go:  another one of those twisted, incoherent, and just plain weird movies that actually find an audience.  It's scattershot, it's talky, it's confusing.  Yet somehow critics and a small group of movie-goers dig it. I'll never know how.  I can't even attempt to describe the 'plot', but it concerns Cruise getting in a car wreck, ending up charged with a murder, meandering about city streets in a haze...ah, enough.  People calling the ending 'amazing', even though it's an old fallback idea that's been used in stories for a hundred years.  Once again a trailer and advanced buzz rope us in.  'A masterpiece!' 'Spellbinding!'  'With surprises no reviewer should give away!'  Well, this reviewer is gonna give something away (and I'm normally not this childish): IT SUCKED!",Null,0,1,16 December 2001
Signs," these 'Signs' go the wrong way...
","We've seen it a million times.  A trailer that doesn't live up to the actual film.  All the laughs are revealed, all the scares are revealed, all the whatever is revealed.  But never has a trailer so unfairly disguised a movie as what it's not.  An earlier poster brought up the old sales terms 'bait and switch', which is exactly how you'd describe this.  Here, let's show crop circles, and spooky figures lurking, and a creepy little girl who has a funny line.  But once they're in the theater we'll make the movie about something else.  Something totally monotonous.  I was all keyed up that 20 years after 'Poltergeist' we were finally going to get a genuinely scary haunted house (or at least near the house) flick.  Even the opening music sounded Jerry Goldsmith-ish like in 'Poltergeist'.  Instead it turns into an affirmation tale where a bunch of references earlier in the movie weave themselves into important moments near the end.  Too easy.  And talk about your false build-ups with ZERO payoff!  Oh, boy, finally the big showdown with an alien and...a three-minute flashback by Gibson.  Momentum buster!! I mean, I actually enjoyed the opening twenty minutes of COMEDY more than anything else!  Although I will say that Shyamalan is masterful at getting the most out of his kid actors.  We all know Osment and 'I see dead people'. Well, here he introduces us to Breslin, a terrific little actress who provides most of the film's good moments.  And Culkin, though a much more impressive actor than his infamous brother, is hugely unbelievable as the equivalent of an Einstein in a ten-year-old's body.  But, of course, good kid actors are never enough to propel an uninteresting drama to a recommendation.",Null,1,1,18 August 2002
Identity," identify something good about it...
","Normally a film with a twist like this is tough to review, because some of the events are now...different. No such trouble here. Even without the colassally moronic surprise in the middle of the film, this muddled mess of a suspenser would've still tanked. Take ten or so people from different walks of life (through flashbacks which are then inexplicably abandoned) and seclude them at a rainy motel with a wackjob and watch the fun ensue. Even minus the twisty center, the dysfunctional mystery portion doesn't even come off because of abounding implausibilities dealing with characters. Toughest to take of all is the lengthy, lull-filled build up to the main 'plot', if you can call it that. Throws in an ending where you'll be muttering 'Noo, noo, don't end it on such a stupid note...', and sure enough, it does. Earns one point for the obvious near-replica design of the Bates Motel from 'Psycho', but nothing else performance or story wise. Useless.",2,1,5,4 October 2007
A Nightmare on Elm Street," the only horror film that scared me...
","Ok, I was only ten at the time, but of all those classic horror films of the 80's this is the only one that kept me awake after it was over.  The fact that it deals with dreams had a hand in that as well.  I know that it would have the same affect if I saw it for the first time today.  Everyone knows the story by now, but here's my two cents:  a group of four friends are being tormented at night by a creep in their sleep.  Now, it's undetermined how long this has been going on, which would've been interesting to know, so we could contrast how long it lasted before he starts killing them!  Yep, in their sleep, he has someway of manipulating time and space, and physically slashing them with knives he has affixed to his hand (the famed 'glove'). The ability of which was something that was never determined either. Heroine Langenkamp realizes what's going on when one of the menaced kids says it looked like four razors were cutting his girlfriend at once.  She tries to mastermind a plan to bring the killer from the dreamworld, into the real one.  A truly innovative premise for it's time, which included elements from more convential horror films, made this a memorable and heavy hit. Aside from your usual dark and spooky imagery, one of the more overlooked effects is the absolutely chilling music.  Lots of slow screeching, bongy noises, then shocking keyboard stingers to help jumpstart your heart.  They contribute to the eeriness as much as anything else.  And anyone who says the film is dated must be in a dreamworld of their own, as buckets of blood spewing everywhere (though TREMENDOUSLY overused in the silly bedroom death involving Depp) never go out of style.  The film has really held up well, as nothing like it has come along since.  The performances still work, Saxon's doubting dad, Blakely's boozy mother, cute and spunky Langenkamp, and then the man of your dreams, the hardly heard, but coarse voiced, giggly Englund as Freddy.  One downspot is the 'second' ending, a confusing moment designed to finish the film with a scare, that made no sense.  But overall a fine beginning to a series that would spawn 7(!) movies.",7,0,0,15 August 2001
The Matrix," f/x cant carry empty story
","Looks like everyone loved this, which is astounding me.  Only one or two people didnt go for it either so Im almost alone in not thinking it was so amazing.  Yes the effects are something we havent seen before, but thats all I saw over and over.  Reeves gets strapped in, has some apparatus or another invade his body, he squirms and vibrates about in pain, then hes chased by dudes in sunglasses.  Countless times, till I'd had enough.  Seems he's been living in a world that doesnt exist, or something.  Mysterious folks in tight outfits with shaved heads try to show him the truth, or something. The performances are decent, seeing how dialogue was scarce with the actors giving way to the visuals.  When the film was released it had the tag line, 'What is the Matrix?'  After seeing the film I still wasn't sure.",Null,0,1,16 December 1999
Casino," odds in favor of Marty fans....
","'Goodfellas' takes Vegas sees Scorsese's usual players meandering their way through the expected labyrinth that is Lost Wages, Nevada. The mob portion is kept very brief near the front end, with DeNiro then heading West to man a mob-run casino. There's your basic dealings with skimming, teamsters, the feds, cheats, and whatnot. Pesci is then thrown into the mix as an enforcer to keep everybody who threatens DeNiro, in line. For good measure Stone arrives as an all-flash bimbette who placates well-to-do men with her wiles.My main problem with the film lied mostly in the Scorsese going shockingly against type. First, we have one of the most passive DeNiro performances of his Marty career, as a (Jewish??) guy I kept screaming at to take some freaking action. He allows those who pose a threat to his world to just walk all over him at an alarmingly high rate. Namely, Stone, whom he inexplicably has some undying love for, despite her personality not going beyond a hot blonde of opportunity. That he could be so incessantly forgiving, made me nuts. I kept praying for the explosive Bobby D. we all know and love to show up, but he never arrived.Then you have Pesci, basically aping his own 'Goodfellas' character, as a leprechaun-esque tough guy whose main fear-striking device is drop F-bombs at top volume. Or kicking the sheeyit out of guys as long as he (Pesci) has others there to watch his back. At least his character takes an unexpected turn that we're told is a huge no-no in the mob culture.People have always been vastly divided on Stone; some hated her, some were surprised and vaunted high praise. I was pretty much on the fence with her, as her two-note (sexy or drunk) offering had your standard indifference to it.James Woods is wasted (and realizing who his co-stars were, seemed to go into Pesci mode for the one scene he was allotted), Rickles and Smothers are thrown in for some Vegas flair, with your usual assembly line of reliable Scorsese Italianos rounding out the supporting roles.Then there's Scorsese himself as they guy at the helm. I've never really been a fan of forced or tortuous violence in a film (the Freddys and Jasons were always quick about it), but where was it here??? Where's the Marty Scorsese of old who covered his filmstock in off-putting gore? The fact that he (finally) shoehorns in some toward the last reel was a real let-down.The film hardly drags, and the narration was an acceptable technique, but in the end I couldn't have cared less whatever happened to any of these people. Unlike 'Goodfellas,' where, though the main characters were 'villians,' I felt so awash in their journey by film's end, that you feel you've really been taken to another place by the actors. Casino, not in the slightest.At the very least Joe Bob Briggs had more than one scene. Because the drive-in will never dah!",5,6,8,16 March 2011
The Breakfast Club," Another Hughes Classic
","Hughes follow up to 'Sixteen Candles' is an even better effort, dealing with five teens stuck in a Saturday afternoon detention together.  None wants to be there, of course, but by the end of the day they come to like each other. Not without the usual threats, anger and tears, which is what makes the film great as Hughes delves deep into each character.  Though all the performances are great, the film really belongs to Nelson, who has the best lines, be it funny or antagonistic.  Estevez is strong as well, Hall is pleasantly understated, Ringwald good at the emotional, and Sheedy a perfect neurotic.  Hughes wisely trimmed his original script, dropping a silly subplot involving a teacher (Gleason, who watches over the kids) spying on a female co-worker throughout the building.  And also to omit Vernon's change of heart that the kids are not so bad after all, as it would have been totally unbelievable.  But for whats on screen, its all great, with a dynamite soundtrack, and a great final shot.  One of three(!) great Hughes films from '85.",Null,0,1,5 September 2000

Slow, uninteresting, goes on forever, with its 'Roman times' time period veiling it's many 'Friday the 13th'-ish type moments of slashings, gashings and blood spurtings.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," change in tone, same results...
","I'm not a lover of the series like most anyway, but still gave this a chance.  Writer Boam, who has penned superb stuff like The Lost Boys and Lethal Weapon 2 and 3, is brought on to shake up the tone of the films. Unfortunately it does no good.  More of an attempt at humor and silly action don't come off.  They also succumb to a 'famous guest stars' syndrome, kicking things off with Phoenix and later adding Connery.  At least Ford's death avoidance was somewhat believable before.  Here, he and dad escape far too often, far too easily.  Unmanned speedboats faking out killers, unmanned motorcycles *happening* to crash into bad guys, conveniently.  Then there's the Three Stooges nonsense, such as Connery blasting apart the tail of he and Ford's plane, Connery charging at seagulls while pumping an umbrella, or the fighter plane that slides through a tunnel with a dumbstruck pilot staring at the two heroes.  And like Temple of Doom, bad blue screen strikes again, with phoney planes crashing and pilot's flying unconvincingly into the camera.  Plus the lack of a true heroine and another hecticly filmed ending, and I've been disappointed yet again.  Very, very, seldomly Boam manages a poingnant moment between father and son, but much more was needed. Along with the succumbing to a typical final few minutes of a lamebrained laugh and a ride into the sunset.  And something just doesn't seem right when one of the main characters has died and levity is attempted, creating a feeling of uneasyness.  80s nostalgia will bring me back for part 4, but I'll go into the theater hanging my head in advance.",Null,0,0,15 February 2004
Back to the Future," all time fave
","July 3rd, 1985.  My all time fave is released and although I know most everybody knows about the film, I must recap it one more time.  Fox is Marty McFly, a cool, confident teen who plays a mean guitar, rides a skateboard like nobodys business, and has a sweet, pretty girlfriend.  One night in a mall parking lot his life is disrupted while helping his older friend, Dr. Brown (Lloyd, in a truly memorable performance).  The Doc is gunned down and Martys only escape from his own demise is to take off in Lloyds newly created time machine, an awesome looking DeLorean.  He ends up in 1955, when his parents were his age and oops, he interferes with their first meeting. And double oops, his mom has a crush on him!  Yuck!  The core of the film is his attempts to get them to fall for each other so that he'll exist in the future, while avoiding run-ins with a bully named Biff (what else?). The film is packed with one terrific scene after another; the skateboard chase, Johnny B. Goode, George standing up to Biff, the clocktower sequence, I could go on.  Two great songs from Huey Lewis and an exciting score from Alan Silvestri add to the films greatness.  Fox, replacing the fired Eric Stolz as Marty, is great, Lloyd is perfectly manic, Thompson is cute, Glover is a crack up, and Wilson's bully is right on target.  Two sequels followed, one in 89 one in 90, also an ok cartoon series and a lousy video game. Though most might not be with me that this is the best ever, youd be hard pressed to find anyone whod say this isnt one of the greats to come along.",9,0,1,24 August 1999
Evil Dead II," slightly improved
","This one towers over part one, but only by a little, because of the sense of humor they decided to put into it. Campbell, who obviously hasn't learned anything about venturing into the woods from his first adventure, does so again here, with the same result. This time he only takes his girlfriend, with others popping up later, one of them the daughter of the professor who's audio speech released the demons last time. Some, of course, become possessed and havoc insues in and out of the cabin. Even Cambell's 'Ash' is taken over for a brief periods of time, the first occurence coming early on in an amazingly shot sequence. We see the evil force racing through the woods, crashing past trees and doors until it finally comes upon Campbell. Unlike the first movie, which ended with this shot as it cut to black just as it arrives at Campbell, it's continued here as he's hurtled into the air at warp speed past a number of trees before plunging into a huge puddle. There are other moments from the first film that are re-done but the main change is the comic tone. There is, again, a lot of blood, but mixed in are some hilarious possessions. The funniest being a hideous woman in a fruit cellar who looks like she has the hots for Campbell. Or living room items that begin laughing in unsion. And even when there is a moment of violence, it's done so comically, like a popped eyeball flying into a girls mouth, or the infamous moment when Campbell takes a chainsaw to his possessed hand! The cast this time around is as adequate as the last, with Campbell providing an even better performance. One downside is that we are again left with an inconclusive ending, but it's not enough to bring down this better than the first movie follow up.",Null,0,1,14 November 2000

Unknown songs (and I LOVED the 80's) are constantly referred to, Cusack is totally unlikable and miserable, and a guy I'm really gettin' sick of seeing, the pudgy, utterly annoying Jack Black didn't help either.
