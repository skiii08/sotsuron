Angels & Demons," Not quite disastrous, but dangerously close
","Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, dedicated cryptologist and all-around smartest guy in the room, just in time to save Catholicism from conspiracy and MacGuffin alike. The film moves at a rapid pace, and excels at white-knuckled, buzzer-beating thrills, but it's got problems. Not the least of which is Langdon himself, who spouts like a broken nozzle atop the fountain of knowledge for the duration. OK, we get it, he's exceptionally smart and this is what he does best, but his act quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Not only does he know all the answers almost as soon as the riddle presents itself, robbing the audience of the joy of working anything out for themselves, he's also immediately ready to fire off a lengthy dissertation about the relevant historical figures, masterpieces and religious movements while muscling about various set pieces. That evil becomes necessary when the film quickly paints itself into a corner, setting a merciless time limit on each puzzle that pushes suspension of disbelief right out the window. Now, not only are we unraveling mysteries older than recorded time in less than sixty minutes, but we're also visiting libraries, slicing through political red tape and effortlessly navigating the whole of Vatican City, swamped by humanity in the midst of a papal election. Despite all that, I still held the film in good graces until the calamitous final act, which is capped by exploding helicopters, ludicrous swerves and a parachutin' pilot priest. More generic than The Da Vinci Code, it places a much heavier emphasis on nail-biting than convention-challenging, which is a shame because that's precisely the trait that set the original apart. .",4,0,1,18 April 2020
First Man," An excellent balance of humanity
","A frank, pull-no-punches look at the personal and professional life of the failed test pilot and famed astronaut, Neil Armstrong. His is a tale of grand success and global recognition, of course, but also one of frequent, intense tribulation. From routine near-death experiences at the office to a mortally sick young daughter at home, Neil's life seems like a constant source of tension and immense emotional pressure. A quiet, reserved man, he internalizes most of that pain, but it's still evident. Ryan Gosling does a remarkable job at conveying this inner trauma, roiling behind a stoney poker face and a collected physical presence, and the film backs him up by presenting several situations in which that strict sense of cool personal composition literally saves his life. First Man spends a lot of time gazing inwardly, but that's balanced by a series of riveting, high-pressure scenes inside the cockpit. These are utterly insane; barely-contained chaos set to the tune of a constant, deafening roar, all kept in check via a series of well-timed switch flips and a whole lot of white-knuckled prayers. Space movies need never want for great action scenes, particularly when they're inspecting this particular age of DIY floundering, and this one provides yet another impressive step forward in that department. An excellent balance of humanity, practical science and death-defying physical risk-taking.",9,1,3,17 April 2020
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Chalk up another smash for Spielberg.
","There are some unsatisfactory elements-slow spots occur during the middle stretch, the mild anti-establishment stance is getting to be a bit cliche and one never knows whether E.T.'s mortal illness is physical or psychological in nature, or both. But, as with 'Close Encounters,' the truly lovely and moving ending more than makes up for everything. Chalk up another smash for Spielberg.",9,2,3,29 September 2019
Rocketman," It's a nice musical
",Falls victim to many of the usual biopic cliches and the ending is a little too romantic but it's a nice musical anchored by the success of Egerton for a long time.,7,3,4,10 October 2019
Meet the Parents," It's funny enough.
","Awkward humor has never been my cup of tea, but in 'Meet the Parents,' the two leads have such great chemistry that it makes the awkwardness somewhat bearable. Ben Stiller has a couple of great scenes to himself, but it's Robert De Niro in a memorable role that gets most of the credit. This is one of the best parts he's played in years, and most of the humor stems from his character. 'Meet the Parents' isn't well-made or 'classic' in any sense of the word, but's funny and quotable and has some scenes that won't be forgotten.",7,0,1,17 April 2020
The Birth of a Nation," The Birth of a Nation is practically a perfect movie
","The glorification of the Klu Klux Klan (AKA KKK) and the stereotypical portrayal of African-Americans with blackface actors have intensified racist hate crimes that have endured for ten years. And while that's a weakness in its own right, The Birth of a Nation is practically a perfect movie with groundbreaking filming techniques and special effects that are still gravitated into the cinema.",9,4,7,13 October 2019
Captain Marvel," The whole thing feels a tad unnecessary
","Space-themed superhero action that's reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy, minus the wealth of charisma and the groovy, well-placed musical cues. Captain Marvel tries to carve its own little niche in that last respect, with a heavy load of popular '90s radio hits spewed all over the place, but they feel far less curated and personal. In a few important scenes, such heavy-handed soundtrack choices actually detract from the action, rather than enhancing it. The Captain herself, former test pilot Carol Danvers, is reserved and composed by design, a different cut from the brash Marvel template that takes inspiration from her military upbringing and fits her eventual role as a sort of galactic peace officer. This makes for a less colorful lead than we've been conditioned to expect from the mighty mega-franchise, and I can understand how that might rub a few fans the wrong way. Personally, I didn't have an issue so long as we were slowly unraveling the tangled threads of her origin story, but she'll need to find a richer supporting cast to thrive in future solo outings. Lighter fare than I was expecting, and rather small in scale despite the veiled implications of a long-running interstellar war. Its throwback setting places this film in a unique position to explore and enrich the stories of several MCU playthings - Fury, the Tesseract, Ronan, the Kree - but even with those little curiosities, the whole thing feels a tad unnecessary.",6,2,4,17 April 2020
Happy Gilmore," This one remains a simple dose of energetic fun, twenty-odd years later
","Recipe for a prime Adam Sandler comedy: dream up a ridiculous, one-note concept, plaster it with silly side gags, stretch the whole thing to fill ninety minutes and... somehow succeed in spite of yourself. There's no way this rudimentary formula should work so well, but here's Exhibit B, and I'm still laughing. Sandler in the mid-90s was a roiling ocean of slapstick brilliance, totally superficial and meaningless but all the more endearing for it. Here, of course, he's the brainless hockey player turned golf pro, capable of driving the green on a par five but allergic to any semblance of a short game. It's a role catered to his strengths - quick temper tantrums, wacky fight scenes, childish infatuations - and he still plays them well. All the fleeting extraneous bits land, too, from Carl Weathers's absurdly long false hand to Lee Trevino's frequent, often wordless, cameos to Christopher McDonald's delicious overacting as the stuck-up front runner, Shooter McGavin. It doesn't look great (actually, the budget must've been pretty tight) but that's hardly the point. This one remains a simple dose of energetic fun, twenty-odd years later.",7,0,0,17 April 2020
Us," I just hope his next is a little more solid.
","As a sophomore horror effort, Us is pretty godamn good. It doesn't follow a lot of the standard horror tropes, it's something a little unexpected, and it tries to say something. For that, even when it's unsuccessful, I do give it a lot of props. I do have to acknowledge a couple things that do sort of hold it back. For one, the pacing is a little off. The first half hour for one is honestly pretty boring. I get that it's establishing mood and character, but it just drags and it's really a waiting game to get to the main event that we know is coming. Even when the big moment does come, the movie really does seem to stroll along in telling its story. This is fine in principle, and even admirable, but it just doesn't quite work as well as it could. A bigger issue for me though is in some plot holes. An interesting thing I've found with Jordan Peele's brand of horror is he really is interested in telling you how things work, and why the weird horrific stuff is happening, and for the most part he actually gives good explanations. However, in Us, there's a couple points where the more we know the more it starts to kind of fall apart. In particular there is a late movie twist that, for me anyway, seemed to betray a lot of the character motivations that happened up until that point. I tried to justify it in my head, and maybe watching it again will make it work, but for now it really bothered me. I mention these problems because otherwise, Us really does work. The interesting thing is that while it never really scared me, there is a genuine sense of dread that holds throughout the whole movie. There are no false scares or jump scares, the horror is very matter-of-fact, and it unravels slowly. It takes you a while to really realize what type of movie it actually is but once you do, you're deep in the thick of it. I also really have to talk about the acting, especially from Lupita Nyong'o. She's one of those actors I always knew was good but never really saw a movie that showcased just how good she was. This was that movie. But all the actors are great, and most have to play two very different characters, often sharing a screen with their alternate selves, and they consistently nail it. Us didn't quite work for me as well as Get Out did. It's not a movie I can see myself returning to and enjoying as much as I can Get Out, and its problems are much more transparent. But in a way, I feel like Jordan Peele has already established himself as such a great director of horror that he's instantly held himself to a higher standard. Us is good, it's original, and it's got some great acting, but I just hope his next is a little more solid.",7,0,2,8 October 2019
Superbad," Generation-defining comedy, tremendously written and utterly unstoppable when it's in a groove
","Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are precisely in their element as a pair of hyper-awkward high school seniors, attempting to delicately navigate their way around virginity before college. Snide, sharp and effortlessly witty, it's an absolute howl, even for folks who may not have worked through the same problems at that age. Hill and Cera have great chemistry, bouncing insults and muttering puns at a machine-gun pace, and they get a ton of help from the supporting cast. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader damn near steal the show as a pair of irresponsible cops out for a joyride with Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who is himself unforgettable as the eccentric uber-geek 'McLovin.' I just wish it could've hovered in its zone of meaningless shenanigans the whole way through, because the last twenty minutes - when the plot suddenly realizes it needs to get going - are something of a chore to push through. Still, it's great enough that I'd call it a generation-defining comedy, tremendously written and utterly unstoppable when it's in a groove. Extra kudos for introducing the world to Emma Stone.",9,0,0,18 April 2020
The Jungle Book," One of Disney's vault-dwellers that probably looks better in the memory banks than it does on-screen.
","He well-worn tale of an abandoned infant, found and raised in the wild by a caring society of jungle creatures. In this specific case, it's a pack of wolves who look after the boy, though they quickly fade away when an elder insists the child (now half-grown) be returned to human civilization. A fatherly panther and carefree bear seem much more attached, guiding him through danger and belting out various songs as they progress through the densest bits of occupied brush. The pieces are here for another true Disney classic - excellent character designs, cheerful music, superb voice acting - but the plot is watery and overly simple, while the animation largely isn't up to snuff. In contrast to the studio's famous knack for experimentation, The Jungle Book's visuals are a dull, two-dimensional affair with all manner of seams and shortcuts left in view. It's a workmanlike effort, smooth but not especially interesting, which leans on the studio's name more than it adds to it.",5,0,1,17 April 2020
Spider-Man 3," And the story of three good franchise movies wasn't true of course.
","We've had two incredible movies and then we had this one. This is certainly the least of the three and that says a lot, because we are crazy about its predecessors. The film fails to figure out what it really is all about, and we get a film packed with so many villains who don't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any. This time around, the acting is a little edgy but I guess it's because of the script and its endless revision. It bothers me a little, as this could possibly have been the definitive 'Spider-Man' if Raimi had only omitted a few items from the movie and even added a few more good lines to the script.",6,0,1,17 April 2020
Molly's Game," I liked it, I didn't love it.
","Aaron Sorkin writes and directs this adaptation of an underground poker entrepreneur's almost-tell-all autobiography. As Sorkin's style is typically very polarizing, I figured we might as well get his name out of the way first. He's got his fingerprints all over this, especially (as ever) in the film's breathlessly snappy, long-winded dialog. As a fan, I'll gladly eat that stuff up, though I'd rank this one near the bottom of his extended portfolio. It lacks the thick tension of A Few Good Men, the untamed energy of The Social Network, the relentless motor of Moneyball. In conforming another writer's work to the screen, Sorkin's writing feels restrained, less electric. It brings us one great, big, passionate speech - powerfully delivered by an impassioned Idris Elba - but there seems room for two or three more. A protagonist who's generally cold and unlikeable, withdrawn and specter-like in her own story, doesn't make things easy on the first-time director. Molly is a complicated character that we never completely figure out. When she enjoys a brief emotional breakthrough near the film's climax, it doesn't quite feel like she's earned it. She has a few tough run-ins with shady characters and uncaring g-men, but it never feels like she's seriously at risk. Things just always seem to turn out in her favor, which leads to a rather flat ending. It's an interesting story, and the plot is well-structured to keep audiences from feeling pummeled by the thick splashes of word soup. It avoids most of the major pitfalls of a film that revolves around Texas Hold 'em, too, though in fairness the game itself is never actually the focus. I liked it, I didn't love it.",6,0,1,18 April 2020
Horrible Bosses," It's just too bad this genuinely funny comedy ran over a nail going into the final reel
","Talk about riding a wave of success, Jason Bateman (who should have been Gil in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris) is in everything these days. It's just too bad this genuinely funny comedy ran over a nail going into the final reel, because otherwise there is a lot to like here. The set-up is enjoyable, showcasing the villainy of the three bosses; Colin Farrell is a particular standout as the hilariously detestable son of Donald Sutherland, who begins the pillaging of his father's company while Sutherland's funeral isn't even over yet. The break-in of his 'lair' was the comedic highlight for me. A lot has been made of Aniston's break from her usual girl-next-door roles to play crude-talking, sexually harassing dentist Julia Harris, D.D.S., and she does well, but it has to be filed under 'as expected' from someone with her comedic resume. Unfortunately the wheels fall off near the end while trying to deliver main baddie Kevin Spacey his comeuppance.",7,0,1,14 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," How disappointing that it's come to this.
","Evidently upset by Rian Johnson's contribution to the series in The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams has returned to the Star Wars universe to set the record straight, often directly contradicting the plot points and character arcs set in motion by the preceding film. That makes for an awkward sort of arm wrestling competition, as Johnson himself often seemed intent upon bucking the conventions established by earlier chapters in the franchise. In other words, 'you undid my work, now I'm going to undo yours.' The result, in this case, is an overstuffed mammoth of a film that tries to do too much while also, somehow, accomplishing very little. Not the first time a Skywalker film has been messy, but the lack of enthusiasm and excitement is certainly new. Even in the much-maligned prequels, there was something unique and special about seeing a Star Wars movie. This time, despite the enormous budget, eight films' worth of lead-in, tons of new environments and alien races, plus constant callbacks to please the die-hards, the final product is rather bland and pedestrian. And that's probably the most damning thing I could say about it. This isn't the grand conclusion to a generations-long space epic, it's just a nondescript, run-of-the-mill science fiction shelf-filler with a billion-dollar sheen. It's a mass of writer's room concepts, tossed into a tumbler and belched out onto the screen without much connective tissue. Episode IX does have successful moments. The law of averages says, given enough options, something's bound to stick. Yet, even when they hit upon a winner, Abrams and company's lack of conviction, their reluctance to take a risk and get firmly behind any one direction, lessens the meaning of the whole. How disappointing that it's come to this.",5,20,32,17 April 2020
Glory," True dramatic powerhouse
","A Civil War epic, following the trials and tribulations of the first all-black regiment in US history. At first they face enemies on both sides of the battlefield, but through such adversity comes dogged perseverance and they gradually convince their peers that not only is the cause a just one, but they all merit a role in the fight. Matthew Broderick is an unusual choice as the squad's tough, dedicated commander, only a few years removed from light-hearted comedy roles, and he isn't always convincing. The really meaty parts come from the troops themselves, anyway, and those ranks are filled out quite well. Morgan Freeman is excellent as the weathered voice of reason, a man who's seen the remnants of battle and tries to prepare the recruits for what's to come, but the standout performance belongs to a young Denzel Washington. As Private Trip, an escaped slave with a lifetime of pent-up anger that frequently threatens to swallow him, Washington's outbursts, protests, inner turmoil and ultimate vindication make up the film's lifeblood. Some of the battle scenes show their age, but that's not what it's about in the end, really. Heavy on the emotions and just a bit sappy, it's an important story done justice and a true dramatic powerhouse.",8,0,0,18 April 2020
Rocky II," Close isn't always good enough
","Picking up right at the conclusion of the first film, the Rocky sequel follows our thick-witted (but lovable) prize fighter through the lesser explored consequences of his life-changing title bout. It's a struggle for both participants, with Rock suffering both physical and emotional scars while champion Apollo Creed grapples with a crushing sense of inferiority. There's a great point to unearth here, a deep dive into the unseen trials that occur after the crowds have gone home, but Rocky II never quite hits that paydirt. It asks the right questions, spends a lot of time digging, but lacks the raw, self-aware poignancy of the original film and ultimately falls back on many of the easier tricks that served it so well the first time. We get a laundry list of reasons why the inevitable rematch shouldn't even be competitive - lack of motivation, physical shortcomings, personal distractions - but that's quickly smoothed over by a reheated training montage and the climactic fight scene plays out like a well-rehearsed dance number. It wants to be potent and powerful again, to hit just as hard as that loaded first punch, and it gets close. But close isn't always good enough, especially when you're trying to one-up an all-time classic.",7,0,0,17 April 2020
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," a-ok for a light genre comedy
","Andy Samberg owns the spotlight, playing a Bieber-esque swooner who abandoned his old bandmates, springboarding their early group fame into solo superstardom. Samberg is right on the money as the essentially deluded wunderkind, set adrift without a life jacket when his sophomore album is met with universal disdain. His elaborate stage performances are a big highlight, spinning the band's notoriously loony lyrics (the 'Bin Laden Song' production must be seen) into a heavily-funded, bombastic concert experience that's pitch-perfect. Lampooning the inherent idolatry of pop music is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's intrinsically shallow fun, but the laughs are pretty consistent. I didn't sense very much bite in the original music - most of the lyrics are scattershot and random, which is mildly disappointing - but the beats are still great and there's a hidden gem or two in the deep cuts. 'Legalize It,' which plays over the closing credits, was my favorite of the bunch, as berserk and ridiculous as TLI's best. Stuffed with celebrity cameos to lend credence and unpredictability, not to mention effortlessly hilarious, it won't surprise you or strum your heartstrings. Which is a-ok for a light genre comedy. I could do with more like this, actually.",7,0,0,18 April 2020
Hot Rod," It's precisely how the trailer makes it seem: really, really stupid
","An overlooked bit of screwball comedy from the members of The Lonely Island and a few of their mid-2000 SNL cohorts. Andy Samberg grabs the lead as the titular Rod, a misguided but confident would-be stuntman whose efforts always climax in a spectacular disaster. Rod is about as one-dimensional as any recurring sketch comedy character, which is to say he's got one note to play and he milks it like a rancher with idle hands. Along for the ride, Bill Hader, Danny McBride (playing, surprise, another version of Kenny Powers), Ian McShane (grievously underused) and a white-hot Isla Fisher, are even narrower. After five minutes you'll know exactly how it's going to play out. This kind of movie isn't usually about character development, though, and as a playground for comedians to wear silly t-shirts and frequently cut away to questionably-related asides, it's suitable enough. Good for a few loud howls, but it lacks consistency, substance and identity. Its greatest sin is taking a decent gag and riding it wayyyy too long, a'la Family Guy's most indulgent moments. In short, it's precisely how the trailer makes it seem: really, really stupid. Points for an excellent butt rock / hair metal soundtrack, though.",5,0,1,22 April 2020
Grease," It's a delight to watch, still 20 years after it first appeared on the screen
","Grease was a big hit and the musical remains one of its kind's most popular movies. After the Grease and Saturday Night Fever pair came out, John Travolta was catapulted to the top shelf of fame, and hiseasy to see why-the guy is charming, can sing well and has the gestures. Grease boasts what all successful movie musicals have: fun actors, an easy but not insignificant plot, and lots of enjoyable music. Undoubtedly, familiarity with the soundtrack is one of the reasons for the success of the film-several of the songs have reached pop hit status. Grease works in the 1950s as a musical, comedy, a light romance, and a gentle satire of adolescent life.It's a delight to watch, still 20 years after it first appeared on the screen, partially because of its enduring high spirits. If you enjoy musicals, Grease is a great movie, even though it's decades old-nothing has changed over time, and the movie is as entertaining today as it was in 1978.",7,0,0,11 December 2019
Lilo & Stitch," Consider it a lighter entry in the catalog
","Disney steps outside its comfort zone with this mashup of Hawaiian culture and alien invasions. Like the toothy, sharp little blue furball at the center of all the drama, the film is loud and impulsive, recklessly chasing stray plot threads and then abruptly abandoning them for another distraction. It's far less careful and composed than the studio's usual feature work, which serves as both a positive and a negative. On one hand, it's fresh and different; a necessary (and welcome) new direction for a company that had been making movies for six-plus decades at the time. On the other, well, it just feels like something produced by the competition. It lacks that certain bit of polish, that magical sense of balance. Stitch, the aforementioned extraterrestrial beast, is a far cry from the standard Disney archetype, even in extreme circumstances. His audacious, violent nature lends itself to some impressive action scenes and a few laughs, but damages the character's sudden, climactic transition into a concerned, invested member of the family. He effectively flips a switch and wakes up, and that's not much of an arc. The human characters fare a bit better - their story has more emotional heft - but they, too, leave a lot on the table. Still, despite all that, I enjoyed myself. The film's got personality and heart, its unique locale plays an important thematic role and factors directly into the climax, the action bits work very well and the visuals are stylish and interesting (I like the trend toward minimalism).",6,0,1,17 April 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man was all right.
","Personally, as much as I was with the Raimi trilogy, I was not very emotionally involved with that film. I thought this movie was sort of soulless to me. First I'm going to go through some good stuff then I'm going to go into the negatives. I think the cast is really good at first. I think Andrew Garfield is very fantastic as Spider-Man but as Peter Parker I don't like him. I just don't see him as this dork, he should be rolling it with the cool kids in real life with that character. Yet as Spider-Man he is very good, he is on par if not better than the depiction of Spider-Man by Tobey Maguire. Martin Sheen is doing a very good job as Uncle Ben, Sally Field is good as Aunt May while I feel she doesn't have anything to do, Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy, even though she's pretty underdeveloped. And even though he's the most underdeveloped character in this film, Rhys Ifans is presented excellently. The visuals and the cinematography were a further plus. This film has a smooth glossy look to it. The battle scenes are also enjoyable as hell, one of the movie's favorite elements. The film is messy though and I will go through it now. These are my negatives; I haven't liked the depiction of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker again, I felt he was too sweet and stunning to buy him as that character. Another drawback is Gwen Stacy's lack of growth, she has some romance with Peter and supports him with the antidote in the end, that's it ... Another bad aspect I have is that once Curt Connors is The Lizard he tries to turn all of New York City into Lizards, that's horrible writing for a villain. Some villains want vengeance, kill the planet, rob something, these are schemes of legit motivation that I can get behind, but his plan is awful! The death set up for Uncle Ben was always too messy and badly managed. The death of Uncle Ben was properly set up in the first Spider-Man movie and you understand that. I hated the fact that the clerk is such a * * hole and gives Peter a hard time for 2 cents, just felt so pressured here. A clerk would let you off the hook in real life for that, but it's so ridiculous and terrible here. Peter then attempts to trace the murderer after Uncle Ben dies. Sadly he can not locate him, but then the subplot is never discussed or resolved again. Laughter writing right there. Last but not least I didn't like Peter's setup getting his powers, he's just sneaking into a room without any security and then heading into the biocable with the spiders all over the place like an fool. I genuinely thought it was a lot easier for Peter to get his powers in the first film, here it makes no logical sense to me. There are also other contradictions in which I can go on and on, but those are the key ones which bugged me. The Amazing Spider-Man is an average movie overall. It's got a lot of issues but it's still a fairly enjoyable movie, it's got a nice main character and some fun set pieces. I dislike this film not, it was just disappointing, I truly wanted something as spectacular as suggested by the title but I was truly let down. I wasn't pumped up or set my hopes too high, I was disappointed frankly. If you're a Spider-Man fan you may like or may not like this movie. Yet if you're critical of game, with this game there's a lot to nitpick.",6,0,1,17 April 2020
The Fast and the Furious," The testosterone reaches critical mass quite early in this ridiculously self-indulgent nitrous oxide orgasm.
","Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting. The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many 'cool point' boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance. It's a true 'what you see is what you get' experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy. On this first go-around, at least, the action retains some passing association with reality. Points for that.",2,0,2,17 April 2020
Now You See Me," This is a very deceptive movie.
","This is a very deceptive movie. It's a film full of great actors trying to play some roles that are badly written and underdeveloped. This works for Mark Ruffalo and Isla Fisher who excel in putting some energy into their characters, but we're mostly amused for everyone else because they're actors we know and love. There are some good things, such as the scenes where the Four Horsemen perform their acts, which are scenes I really like, and I think Louis Leterrier really directed those scenes very well. There are several action scenes that are really poorly done, and there is also a twist in the film that has been so bad and hasn't had any setup during the whole film. This is a movie that could be a great movie, but unfortunately it didn't really work that way.",5,0,1,26 October 2019
The Conjuring 2," To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat
","To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat - a genre for everyone it ain't - so kudos to 'The Conjuring' and its sequel for pulling an 'Exorcist' and turning even the most hesitant members of the general public into temporary aficionados of the macabre. Three years have passed since the original and nothing's much changed; still intact are lean, mean, and very devilish thrills not to be messed with - James Wan could turn the adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren into a franchise and I wouldn't much be bothered by his audacity. This year's follow-up to the 2013 juggernaut expectedly pales in comparison to its predecessor - how could it not - but it's unusual in that it could very well stand on its own and still be regarded as a solid piece of terrifying exhibition. Success is rare for any sequel to a critical and commercial triumph, especially for the horror genre, and 'The Conjuring 2,' against the odds, delivers the goods without attempting to outdo or undermine the beast that made it. As the film opens, we find the movie's previous protagonists, the aforementioned Warrens, recovering from the psychological wounds left by their 1976 investigation of the Amityville murders. Ed, per usual, has quickly compartmentalized the case into the deepest pits of his mind, figuring it better to abstain from unhealthy dwelling, but Lorraine, a possessor of psychic powers, has become immensely disturbed by the events experienced in the wretched home. She's considering quitting her self-made profession; she's not so sure she can continue carry the weight of someone else's literal demons. But before she can give her skepticisms too much serious thought, the Warrens are drawn to an intriguing case across the pond. Due to overzealous tabloid coverage, the recent hauntings of the lower-class Hodgson family has become all the rage in town gossip and in news stories. According to several reports varying in their authenticity, Janet (Madison Wofle), the second oldest of four children, has been suffering from strange bouts of sleepwalking and, most dramatically, instances of possession. The flat in which the family's living seems to be tormented by a poltergeist unwilling to leave - and as time drags on, malice increases. Naturally, Ed and (a hesitant) Lorraine take the long flight over in hopes to dig deeper. All that surrounds them, of course, is much more complex than anyone could ever realize. And so retained is the fun of the first 'Conjuring' in its sequel; it's a skillfully designed and executed horror show with more than a few whodunit undertones lurking underneath its jump scare tactics. We grow to care about its characters just as much the solving of the central mystery, and the Warrens, already such likably offbeat heroes, are provided with increased depth that reminds us that in front of us are not pulpy ghostbusters but genuinely vulnerable people who just so happen to have extremely difficult jobs. So while I'm easily able to admit that 'The Conjuring 2' is not as spine-chilling as the film preceding it - there's a higher reliance on slammed doors, too-quickly-revealed foes, and generalized possession tropes (and there's certainly no equivalent to the first film's memorable clap supplemented basement scare sequence) - there's no denying that on display is an intelligent horror blockbuster more than likely to satisfy the thirsts of fans of the 2013 film and horror pundits alike.",6,0,1,13 December 2019
Meet the Fockers," There is not one joke in Meet the Fockers.
","There is notone joke in Meet the Fockers, the sequel to the horrible Meet the Parents (2000). Oh, there are references to dogs humping people's legs,vasectomies, circumcisions, toilets, small children repeating curse words,people getting injured and octogenarian sex, but nothing resembling thestructure, setup and payoff of an actual joke.Wallowing in the mire of this frat boy noise is an assembly of fine actors. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner return as Jack and Dina, the right-wing parents of Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), while Pam's fiancé Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) introduces the whole crew to his parents: sex therapist Roz (Barbra Streisand) and lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-dad Bernie (Dustin Hoffman).One set of parents is embarrassingly liberal and the other embarrassingly conservative. One thing the movie does well is to ridicule both sides equally, but that's about where it stops. Imagine what Preston Sturges could have done with this setup.During their careers, these actors have worked with the likes of Vincente Minnelli, William Wyler, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Now, here they are with Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers films, as well as the horrible Meet the Parents.Whereas Meet the Parents had one or two funny, organic moments that arose within the moment, this time Roach sticks to the script like rancid glue, allowing for not one second of life or improvisation. It even uses the old scene in which Greg makes an ass of himself in front of everyone, this time under the influence of a truth serum. Even Stiller looks bored and tired with this aging shtick.Of the film's high-class actors, only Streisand avoids embarrassment. She has sunk into her role -- her first screen appearance since 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces -- in a way that lets her enjoy it. The other actors can barely hide their shame, but Streisand appears not to be too concerned about this outing. Her easy grace is the film's only selling point.",3,0,2,17 April 2020
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Mercifully short
","A pair of simple-minded backwoods types run into trouble when their vacation plans overlap with those of a great, big carload of college party animals. It's shallow - no, really shallow - but so are the slasher flicks it's sending up, so par for the course I guess. Problem is, Cabin in the Woods is already more comprehensive, Scream is wittier and Scary Movie is more profane, so there's not a lot of room to find a fresh niche. The titular duo have a good thing going, and the core script-flip of teens doing the terrorizing is fun in concept. There's just so little to it beyond the bare bones that it's hardly a filling meal, so the good laughs and splatter effects can't find enough meat to sink their teeth in. Mercifully short, it gets in and out in under eighty minutes, and even then seems a little bloated.",5,0,2,18 April 2020

Ghost Rider," The Devil Made Me Do It
","Is the world ready for a flaming Nicolas Cage? After a long string of financial flops, this idiosyncratic actor is placing his faith in a comic-book character with a combustible body and an addiction to jelly beans. In 'Ghost Rider' Mr. Cage is Johnny Blaze, a daredevil biker who once made a deal with Mephistopheles (an orange-eyed Peter Fonda) and is now required to hunt down wayward demons while shooting flames from every pore. No wonder he listens to the Carpenters.But Johnny's emasculating musical tastes are not the only problem with 'Ghost Rider,' a movie that betrays the promise of its first 30 minutes - when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long - with an increasingly witless script and a star who simply allows the movie to unfold around him. This dissociation leaves the supporting cast to its own devices, with no one suffering more than the appealing Eva Mendes as Johnny's true love, Roxanne. If Ms. Mendes ever finds a director willing to allow her to perform with her shirts fully buttoned, there will be no stopping her.With its sequel-ready resolution, 'Ghost Rider' embodies franchise hopes that may be dashed by a central character who's more funny than frightening. As for Mr. Cage, the only thing he should be firing is his manager.",3,0,0,1 September 2019
The Man Who Would Be King," A fine example of old-style filmmaking
","Sean Connery and Michael Caine play a pair of razor-sharp scoundrels, scamming their way through an east Asian joyride during the twilight of the 19th century. On a thoroughly unpredictable adventure, the duo constantly converts lemon to lemonade as they meander from a publisher's office in India to a fictional holy land in the desert. There, intending to conquer a few villages and live the high life, the stakes suddenly spike as they find themselves anointed saviors, kings and (eventually) gods. Connery and Caine, good friends away from the screen, bubble with chemistry throughout. Their relationship is essential, and that obvious bond lifts an already-ambitious screenplay into something greater than the sum of its parts. When viewed with contemporary eyes, the pace is a little slow, akin to similar films of the era, but that deliberate tempo reaps unique rewards. By lingering in the atmosphere and dutifully setting the stage, director John Huston expertly depicts the vast cultural differences between our conniving, almost-modern Brits and the ancient ways of life still at play in turn-of-the-century Asia. A fine example of old-style filmmaking, loaded with snappy humor, surprising plot turns, high stakes and creeping peril.",8,0,2,18 April 2020
Big Hero 6," It's well-made, good natured, unique in a very crowded crossroad of genres, but too complacent and vanilla with its storytelling
","Anga-influenced, team-based teen superhero antics with an emphasis on engineering over fantasy and mysticism. Nobody's struck by a meteor or experimented upon by the government, they're all just classmates at a prestigious technical school with a very specific set of strengths and passions. That's refreshing, both for the way it keeps the story grounded and for the limitations it places on the core characters. They're each decidedly human, even the cute inflatable robot whose personality is dictated by a memory card. Paired with a bright, friendly sense of style and a spacious, unique world that's loaded with fun little surprises, it's a visual and conceptual triumph. Unfortunately, the greater plot runs a bit generic, its well-worn twists and turns telegraphed a mile away, so those quirks and design touches are leaned on quite often. It's well-made, good natured, unique in a very crowded crossroad of genres, but too complacent and vanilla with its storytelling.

There were hundreds of movies about young music stars and their parents, their early promoters, their first major breaks, and so on, most of them with more range and detail specificity than this one. This film only takes his hero to the moment he walks away, showing he can be a star. The entire focus is on his personality and his quietness in particular.

Everest," Powerful and arresting
","A stunning, moving dramatization of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, drawn from the accounts of several survivors. This incident actually involves author Jon Krakauer, who documented his own experience in the '97 page-turner Into Thin Air, though some disputes have been raised against his work and it's not cited as a reference for the film. As one might expect, there's no shortage of breathtaking scenery and bowel-shaking peeks down into the gaping abyss, and those are clearly a high priority for the production. They're a grand mix of CGI and on-location footage, real IMAX-quality eye candy that should scratch a giant itch for lovers of the outdoors or fans of air-sucking Earth porn. The film's dramatic turns, surprisingly enough, are just as effective. Though it's overloaded with big names, from Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal to Keira Knightly and Robin Wright, each effectively fades into a more pedestrian role and none, save a few appropriately loud-mouthed scenes from Brolin, threaten to take the production over. Though the passage of time is occasionally a bit underplayed, especially as the climbers acclimate to altitude, it works very well as both a pulse-pounder and a gut-punch. Powerful and arresting, it reaches brazenly for the heavens without losing track of its human origins, which is far easier said than done.",8,0,0,18 April 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," An enduring masterpiece.
","A classic, scathing lampoon of every successful rock band that's ever been guilty of taking themselves too seriously. Rob Reiner directs (and plays an important supporting role) but it seems like all he really needed to do was point a camera in the right direction, then edit several hours' worth of golden improvisational delight into a concise, intelligible ninety-minute package. It's a roaring parade of nonstop laughs, some blunt and easy, others sharp and witty. Famous bits like Christopher Guest's 'this one goes to eleven' have been played to death but still elicit smiles, while deeper cuts, such as the band's reaction to contemporary critics or their infamous Stonehenge performance, land as if they were brand new. And the music is great, too, not just as a cutting satire, but as a convincing love letter to the days when power rock was all the rage and flocks of buzzed, well-feathered teens would still pack a stadium to hear the loudest noise on the planet.",9,0,0,17 April 2020
Groundhog Day," Worthy of annual viewings
","Doesn't everybody know this one? Bill Murray plays a generally bitter, unpleasant weatherman who turns on the charm while the cameras roll but tumbles backward into mean, icy sarcasm just as soon as he's out of the frame. Forced to relive the same day on an endless loop, a much-loathed Groundhog's Day on-location report, he slowly works through his issues, loses the chip on his shoulder, finds personal fulfillment and learns how to share a meaningful moment. It's a simple idea, thoughtfully explored, that doesn't run short on heart, ideas or surprises. Murray is perfect in the role, able to convincingly evolve from contemptible jerk to charismatic goofball, but it's the in-between steps that really make his journey remarkable. His growth doesn't come without pains and struggles, missteps and setbacks, and we share his agony over those tough lessons and bitter disappointments. By the time his sentence in that circular purgatory is at an end, he's hit rock bottom, explored his darkest impulses, reached out for salvation, failed, improved and found peace within himself. Andie MacDowell is adorable as Murray's co-star, the ever-optimistic, spritely target of our affections, while director Harold Ramis gives the whole package a warm, friendly sensibility that keeps things on the up-and-up and still allows some wickedly dark material to sneak through.

In spite of the fact that the film tones and slows down after its intense introduction and first act, the story pushes to its conclusion. The work of the camera and the visuals selected help to animate what would be a very monotonous and laborious setting. The action keeps the film from becoming a bore, although not in gigantic bundles.

Joker," Cinematography, art direction, and the performance of Phoenix are the draws here; the story is so derivative, drawn out, empty, and vapid that it drags the film's biggest faul
","After his big surprise win in Venice, a big splash (and some backlash) in Toronto, a storm (in a teacup) of opinion on social media, self-generating fear of cinema violence and even an incel insurrection, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by Todd Phillips of The Hangover, arrives at a resounding 'hm' on our screens. Indeed, if you've seen both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, there's really nothing for you, as Joker doesn't even update their concerns for our own troubled age, aping those movies and squatting between them in 1980.Cinematography, art direction, and the performance of Phoenix are the draws here; the story is so derivative, drawn out, empty, and vapid that it drags the film's biggest fault. There was wit and style in Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy; Joker has no wit and his style is stolen. His tale of a poor down-trodden urban comedian descending into violence has often been told, with minor variations, and resonance to real-life events, most specifically to Bernhard Goetz's 'subway vigilante,' comes with no insight. Ugliness is just for its own sake on display here.This film's best takeaway is as a set-up for a future Batman (like we need another one).The final scenes are suitably baroque, appropriate to the origin story of the Joker as being operatically linked to the story of Bruce Wayne; try as Phillips, his marketing team, and everybody else at Warner Bros. may have to deny it, this is just another comic book movie, in a darker key than usual.",6,6,18,7 October 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Much more than your usual yay-rah, blow 'em up wartime picture
","A struggle for morale, camaraderie and general human compassion in the dregs of a harsh, tropical POW camp during World War II. The cruel conditions and flagrant disregard for prisonersÃ¢(TM) rights cause conflict between the guards and a new troupe of British captives, but the pride and determination of leadership in the face of such adversity gradually earns the men a measure of due respect. Alec Guinness won an Oscar for his portrayal of said leader, a determined military man who takes no quarter despite terrible punishment and still harbors the notion of brotherhood with his captors. Therein lies the moral conflict, as Guinness and his men develop a strained kinship with the Japanese officers while an escaped American works in secrecy to undermine the entire operation. Tricky waters to navigate, since we feel a mix of enthusiasm and reluctance for both perspectives. Everyone has a distinct, relatable motivation - even the seemingly-merciless captors - which makes this something much more than your usual yay-rah, blow 'em up wartime picture. An astonishingly even-handed take on a racially charged historical conflict that was still very fresh in national hearts and minds at the time of its release.",8,0,0,17 April 2020

Step Up," Even if the picture breaks no new ground, the verve of the actors and their fancy footwork is half the battle.
","Watching 'Step Up' for the first time almost six years after its surprise sleeper success in theaters, what's most compelling is how such a standard, cliché-happy dance film has spawned three sequels to date (at the time of this writing, 'Step Up: Revolution' is days away). Maybe each generation needs its own love stories set in the midst of learning steps and cutting a rug, but this isn't 'Dirty Dancing' or even 'Footloose.' Nevertheless, Channing Tatum (in one of his first leading roles) and Jenna Dewan (his future real-life wife) don't have to falsify the obvious chemistry they share as two opposites divided by class but united in their passion for dance.He plays Tyler Gage, a foolish Baltimore teen living with foster parents who is sentenced to 200 hours of community service after breaking for the arts at the Maryland School and destroying property. She is Nora Clark, a school star pupil who sees Tyler scrubbing floors and takes him under her wing as she prepares for her big recital (she lays down her former partner after hurting herself). Together, the two start to gradually combine the street movements of Tyler with the ballet of Nora while gradually falling for each other.Anne Fletcher (2009's 'The Proposal') made her directorial debut with 'Step Up,' crediting her with capturing the dance sequences with a cohesive editorial style that doesn't feel the need to cut each half-second to a different angle. Screenwriters Duane Adler (2001's 'Save the Last Dance') and Melissa Rosenberg (who would continue to adapt the 'Twilight' series) are responsible for mucking things up with a script that couldn't be more predictable and derivative if it was attempted. There's a friend of Tyler's Mac (Damain Radcliff), who feels slight when his buddy passes out playing basketball with him instead of playing Nora.There's the impressive younger brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington) from Mac, who starts stealing cars with tragic consequences like his sibling. There's Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths), the school's tough headmaster, who doubts Tyler has it in him to pull through and succeed. And there's Nora's harping mother Katherine (Deirdre Lovejoy), who fears that her daughter is heading for disappointment if she's not focusing on education as much as she's dancing. Any guesses if she's going to end up coming around?'Step Up' culminates in Nora's big stage performance and the 'will-he-or-won-he?' non-suspenseof Tyler showing up in time for her to go out. Of course, by the end, more will be rekindled than just Nora's shot at a university scholarship. Inoffensive but old-hat, anybody with a cursory history of this subgenre of cinema will feel familiar with the film. Still, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are an attractive pair, and the on-site shooting at Baltimore by Michael Seresin (2003's 'The Life of David Gale') supports the story well. By going vintage (you know, with movies from the 70s and 80s), teen audiences could do better, but they could do much worse as well.Even if the picture does not break new ground, half the battle is the verve of the actors and their fancy footwork.",5,0,0,9 October 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," I didn't see the movie as a love story

Occasionally it makes fun of itself and can genuinely deserve a smile. This film is quite well shot visually, with balanced, eye-catching frames and beautiful Seattle landscape visuals. The soundtrack and songs were really tonally perfect, although I didn't see the movie as a love story as much as an off-balance portrayal of a group of people already degraded and misunderstood.",4,0,1,5 October 2019
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God.
","It's not specifically what he asked for; cursing the Creator over a particularly bad day (humiliated during his flunky comic-relief-TV-reporter job, fired, beaten up, etc.), Carrey just wants to know why God hates him so. It's the suffering of Job reloaded for the media age (will many Americans sympathize with the angst of a presumably well-paid TV personality?), and God, in the person of Morgan Freeman, calls Carrey to Him and offers him a job. 'I'm going on vacation,' God says, blithely leaving the universe in Carrey's jittery hands. The message is clear: If you think being God is easy, you try it.Bruce Almighty is interesting only insofar as it proposes God as a basically well-meaning if remote deity, not the maddening Shaper who drove William Blake to wonder if the same God made the lamb and the tiger. Fundamentalists whose noses are forever tilted for the scent of sacrilege won't find much in the movie to object to. Morgan Freeman, for instance, embodies God as a hip update of George Burns' avuncular, amused Lord in Oh, God. Both actors are a stroke of casting wit, but a wilder, funnier movie might've given us, say, Danny DeVito or a tipsy, irritable Eddie Izzard as God (heck, we've already had Keanu Reeves as both Buddha and a neo-Christ, no pun intended).Essentially, this is another of Jim Carrey's surefire vehicles that can be whittled down to a phrase: Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God. I like the guy, and I wish his box-office failures with The Majestic (understandable -- that was a stiff) and Man on the Moon (I had the poster hanging on my wall for years) hadn't scared him into such bland, unchallenging material. What would Jim Carrey do if given ultimate power? The question provokes a grin of anticipation, but he pretty much does what you see him do in the trailer. There is one spectacularly funny bit when he sabotages the newscast of snotty rival Steve Carell, but the big laughs in the scene belong to Carell, not Carrey.The movie seems squarely aimed at a large audience (check the opening-weekend figures) that might be wondering, in these harrowing times, if God knows what He's doing. Bruce Almighty is here to reassure doubters and put them in their place at the same time. The godlike Carrey fritters away his power and can't even hold onto his girlfriend of five years (Jennifer Aniston, being a good sport). Only God, the movie says, knows how to use the power, and He uses it mostly by not using it: 'You all have the power,' He lectures Carrey. What should be a wild, unruly, possibly sacrilegious fable think Life of Brian becomes a didactic companion piece to The Truman Show, with Carrey as hapless puppeteer instead of hapless puppet. And it says essentially the same (humanist) thing: Take your life into your own hands.Carrey does get off some good riffs, mostly in his pre-God fits of pique; I enjoyed his obscene jazz-pantomime gesture, destined to be copied by giggling kids from shore to shore. The subtext, though, shows us a man with the power of God who's still insecure and, as the movie spells out, wants to be loved.",4,0,1,17 April 2020

Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," It's one of those films that defies logic, succeeding in spite of itself, and there's something of value in that
","If you weren't around in '89, when this became a surprise cultural phenomenon, well, you kinda had to be there. Looking back with critical eyes, it's a rather thin, desperately low-budget production that doesn't probe beyond the superficial layer and constantly winks and nudges the audience to ensure they know when to laugh. Yet, recognizing all that, I found myself wrapped up in its oddly naive warmth and charismatic magnetism. The jokes and gags are hammy and contrived, but I still snickered. The most memorable lines are clumsy and blunt, but I gladly recited them (surprising myself, as I hadn't seen the film in twenty-plus years). Bill and Ted themselves are the narrowest of stereotypes, basically the male equivalent of Frank Zappa's valley girls, yet I felt a rich tingle of satisfaction when they saved their academic careers. It's one of those films that defies logic, succeeding in spite of itself, and there's something of value in that.",7,1,1,17 April 2020
Moon," 'Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired.'
","I have to confess, I'm a little underwhelmed / disappointed that I'm afraid of all the critical praise this film receives. But that doesn't mean that this film is a failure in any way, it's actually quite the opposite. Let's start with the positive ones. First of all, Sam Rockwell can act, he's playing Sam Bell (TOO MANY SAMS), an astronaut who holds harvesters on the moon, giving the earth energy back. His performance plays out like an absolute fever dream, particularly as the deteriorating version of himself. It's excellent pretty damn it. This film's score is stunning. Combining a dark tune of the piano with the mysteries scattered in the film. Cold, simple, yet cold.What I think is capitalizing on the film's own color scheme, black and white. GERTY, played by Kevin Spacey, is a great help (perhaps a great deal of support, as I will explain later). The layout of the cinematography and the stage is on par. Yet Moon has lots of wafer-thin plot devices that weigh it down unfortunately. Through his perspective, the emotional connection between Sam and his daughter is absolutely appalling, but through the eyes of the audience I feel as though Duncan Jones could have done more visually to interpret his mental breakdown as a clone. While enigmatic, the dramatic elements of this movie are sadly largely unincidental.Yeah, there's a' big reveal' somewhat, but it's purchased by how it's described. A robotic GERTY present. Sam's condition could have been illustrated a little more, there are some gross indicators of his body whiting away at himself, but psychologically I feel like instead of perhaps using an analogy that is also grounded in reality, Duncan Jones could have used the idea of' perception vs reality' hinted at around the time when Sam pours hot water on himself. Moon is unfortunately not the ice chilling movie it might have been in what might have been a fever dream of uncertainty.There are some great moments of brokenness, but the motivation and reaction of the character to the thinly advertised essential twist of the entire film is done very poorly. Nevertheless, Moon isn't a tragedy, and atmospherically it's very well made. It's just all else is a little meh in an attempt to make up for the lack of ideas to do with the harshness of isolation, especially in a cruel environment like space.",6,0,0,11 December 2019
Warcraft," Over-ambitious and flawed
","Orcs and humans try to find common ground, both on and off the battlefield, in this sweeping, large-scale attempt to bring Blizzard's best-selling video game to the big screen. The thing I appreciate most about this effort is its even-handedness. Unlike Lord of the Rings before it, there's an admirable amount of grey-shading on each side of the struggle and a very small number of either irredeemable or infallible characters. The menacing orcs, towering and tusk-mouthed, worry about their children and maintain honorable traditions within their own ranks. Their human counterparts show trepidation and uncertainty, nearly coming to blows as they debate their defense strategy behind closed doors. This makes the simmering war feel more two-sided and honest; no faceless horde of pitch-black bad guys here. Unfortunately, that meditative tone never allows the plot to gain much steam amidst so much pontification. It's overstuffed with characters, bearing complicated names that might be familiar to fans but only blur together for the uninitiated. There's probably enough room for three or four really good character arcs, but instead the narration hops around to cover more than a dozen. The acting is stiff and wooden, whether provided by flesh-and-blood humans or fully-CG orcs, which probably has a lot to do with the abundance of stilted dialog. In a lot of ways, it feels like the first disc of a Playstation-era RPG. A whole lot of setup and world-building, a few mini-bosses and a surprise death or three; maybe a good teaser to keep us on the hook for the next chapter, but only the earliest hint of a resolution. Over-ambitious and flawed, it's an effective CG showpiece but far too slow, wordy and self-important for its own good.",5,2,2,18 April 2020
Draft Day," Weak, run-of-the-mill, pandering, brand-friendly fodder
","If we assume the money printers behind the NFL saw Moneyball and thought 'hey, we should totally do that too,' this is almost precisely how I'd picture the end result. Polished and slick, loaded with team insignias and familiar Sunday morning fringe-dwellers, and superficially authentic at best. Behind the glamour is a hollow pantomime, stuffed with eyeball-rolling character moments and bland dialog, completely missing the points that made MLB's effort click. It does manage to get some things right - the frequent nods at league history are interesting, and the production values are dazzlingly first-rate - but it all feels so pre-approved and chest-puffing that I had a hard time buying it as more than just a long-form bit of promo fluffer. Kevin Costner, at his most washed-up and wooden, doesn't do anything to move the bar, and the climax may as well have flashed the words 'dynasty' over the Cleveland skyline... subtlety is not its forte.",3,1,2,18 April 2020
