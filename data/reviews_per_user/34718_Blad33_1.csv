Lucky Number Slevin," How to make a film: Include none of this film's dialogue; you'll be fine.
","'Total complete garbage.' -- I'd agree. A film in a cliché a cliché in a film. Using tired subjects, homosexuality for instance. Trying to be profound by using pseudo-intellectual/philosophical dialogue. I've heard almost every line before. They talk quickly a lot of the time because there's too much of it. It drones on and tells stories within stories. A film of mostly subplots. Going after each others sons in revenge? Lol, haven't heard of that one before. He's 'not Nick Fisher'? Lol how trite can it all get? Terrible.3/10 Hollywood 'garbage', as you say.'over-stylized' -- exactly, you hit the nail on the head. 'Why do they call him a Rabbi...' followed by an almost identical gay reference? Didn't see that one coming. Trying to edge out 'Sin City' and 'Revolver' for most overused references and dialogue of all time.The romance scenes? With the music? It's not the sex that's gratuitous, it's the entire 'romance' scenes. The whole film even.How many times did he get punched in the stomach? How many times did I see it coming? Ten out of ten. Want to know how not to make a film? Watch this. Don't use any of the lines.'Somebody's trying to kill you'? I said 'me', he said 'me'. Get it yet? When they break through the wall and Bruce Willis knows? lol.When people hear things in films which are similar or even identical -- e.g. lines of dialogue -- it tends to be unimpressive. Unoriginal. Which is what this film is. A bum.Then the 'twist'? Another brilliant, inventive device nobodies seen. Where did the writer(s?*) pull that one out of? * I'd like to believe that production ruined an originally taut, inventive, masterpiece. That writing quality is, at least to start of with, of a higher standard than this.Do they know that the 'bag over the head' ending was in House of Sand and Fog? Ben Kingsley was in that too. Was that a reference to a film that's only a few years old or a mistake? I honestly think it was a mistake. The very ending had no tension, however I was hardly surprised that they couldn't come up with anything better. I liked the credit music. It was OK.",3,8,18,24 November 2006
