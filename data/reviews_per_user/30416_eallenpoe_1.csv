The Ring," Arguably the best thriller of all time.
",WOW!!! I have to say that I am a 33 year old man and not easily freaked out. I loved this movie because it did just this. Unexpected turns and an unpredictable plot made this the best thriller I've ever seen. The advertisements are right to the bone. Before you die..you must see the ring. It will chill you to your bones. Great acting good camera angles and lighting. Truly a masterpiece of this genre and a classic for the next millenium. Go and see the ring!,Null,0,0,19 November 2002
