Your Name.," An exceptionally beautiful, truly unique movie.
","It's difficult to talk about this anime's content without any spoilers so to keep it short:Just watch it. If you are in the mood for a mysterious, philosophical story with some comedy and romance elements that evolves around a very interesting, intelligent and just astonishing story then trust all the other positive voices, read as little about the plot as you can and just give it a go.The only non-spoilery disclaimer I want to give is that the first ten minutes are really 'weird' and confusing but make perfect sense very quickly so don't get turned off by that.9/10, heart-warming and really unique. Kimi no na wa is surely one of the best animation films in its genre of the last few years.",9,3,5,3 July 2017
The Village," This is actually a Shyamalan movie and doesn't deserve 1/10 stars? What a surprise!
","I saw this on TV a couple weeks ago and since my expectations towards it were really, really slim due to it being a Shyamalan flick (let's be real: the last 5 movies of this guy were unbelievably terrible from start to end), I was actually kinda surprised that I didn't have to fight the urge to hammer the 'off' remote button after a few minutes.Don't get me wrong, it's not an 'amazing' story that will stick with you/leave a lasting impression just as some of the early works of this director/writer did, it's an okay horror movie with an interesting setting and trying actors.The movie unfortunately gets kinda 'meh' towards the ending, but one might surely watch it anyways if you are a fan of the horror genre.",6,2,3,24 January 2014
Dark Shadows," A bad movie with a big budget to cover up its flaws.
","If it wasn't for the obviously enormous budget that went into hiring stars and starlets as well as the CGI efforts and special effects (which by the way look idiotic at some points), this movie would be categorized as a B-Movie at best.The story is flat and uninspiring (bad witch curses everyone, yaaaawn!) and flat out predictable. The end doesn't make any sense at all and seems completely rushed.Seeing Johnny Depp as yet again another make-up-overloaded 'weirdo character' gets boring by now as well and all of the other actors except for Eva Green seem to not give it their best at all. The acting is laughably corny in a lot of the scenes.This movie tries sooooooo hard to be funny it is painful at times and rarely successful. The obvious product placements throughout the story are annoying as well.3/10, unwatchable disappointment and a waste of time.",2,2,4,16 December 2013
Wonder Woman," Over-hyped, far too long and for the majority of its run time plain boring.
","All those ratings have got to be fake. I can and will not believe that most people ACTUALLY thought this movie was good. It took literally until one hour and 14 minutes, half way through the whole film, to FINALLY get some action sequences that are longer than 5 seconds! Everything beforehand is boring preparation garbage and stupid dialogues by uninteresting, clich√© characters nobody cares about mixed with some dad-jokes even immature teenagers would heartily yawn at.The end was also really, really cheesy, completely 'ex machina' and bad... seriously, who wrote this crap?Compared to other action hero flicks this falls super flat on all fronts: Uninspired story and antagonists, far too little action, too much blabbering and cringey PEGI-13 fillers and jokes.2/10, this movie is utter trash so don't waste your time.",2,272,544,18 July 2017
