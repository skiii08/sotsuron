Alien 3," very underrated
","This film is definitely not as good as the first two Alien films, but it stands on its own as a powerful artistic vision. The story is pretty weak, and much of the dialogue and some of the characters are pretty lame.  BUT, director David Fincher is, quite simply, a GENIUS.  Enough said.  He took this material and made it into a powerful, artistic masterpiece.  Several of his scenes are brillantly done.  For example, the autopsy scene (watch the different shots), the funeral scene intercut brilliantly with the dog scene (I won't give too much detail but good god it gives me chills) and the final scene.Now that final scene is something that either people HATE with a passion or LOVE.  I think it's great and the series should have stopped there.  But I suppose too many people were too upset by how depressing and dark it was and couldn't take it.  The fourth Alien film is interesting as well, but I think this would have made a good ending.So definitely check this film out for the way it is filmed and the style of it.  Also, I forgot to mention the brilliant opening credits sequence...damn it's cool!!",8,0,4,18 February 1999
Fight Club," fantastic movie
","Fight Club is amazing, brilliant, shocking, original, provocative, and entertaining.  I loved it!  I've said it before, David Fincher is a GENIUS...plain and simple.  Enough said.  The script of this movie is brilliant, his direction is incredible, the acting is amazing, Brad Pitt is incredible, as is Ed Norton of course.  So is Helena Bonham Carter, the only other film I have seen her in was 'room with a view', so yeah, there's a slight difference!The layers of meaning to this movie are so deep, I saw it twice and it still leaves me thinking hard about all the little things in it.  The way it is filmed is pure eye candy, truely brilliant, typical Fincher actually.  The music by the Dust Brothers is great also.  I won't say much about the story because it's probably been described enough in the other reviews and I don't want to say much to ruin it either.  It is simply an original and fascinating piece of cinema.  One of the best films of the year.10/10",10,0,1,28 November 1999
The Terminator," fantastic
","Jim Cameron's first real film (I'm not counting Pirahna 2: the spawning). It started when he had a severe fever during the filming of Pirahna 2 in Italy and he came up with images of the endoskeleton which would be used in this movie.  It is truly great.  The special effects are somewhat primitive, especially when compared to the awesome efx of the sequel..good god...But they are decent.  And they have a great story to back them up. There are some truly unforgettable images in this movie, and some very memorable scenes.  If you haven't seen it yet, by all means go rent it!!!",Null,0,0,18 February 1999
Alien," Dark and disturbing Sci-fi film
","Ridley Scott's Alien is a truly horrifying horror/sci-fi film that really brought that genre back to life of 50's alien movies.  The music, cinematography and sets are astounding. Most of the performances are mediocre with the obvious exception of Sigourney Weaver, although Ian Holm is interesting.  There are several extremely scary sequences in this film, one of the more brilliantly staged ones being Tom Skeritt's hunt for the alien in one of the air shafts.  It is truly terrifying.  This film does have its flaws however.  The small bit of nudity at the end is totally ridiculous and really makes the power of the film drop at the end.  And some of the dialouge isn't that good.  But overall a great movie.  And the music is incredibly scary...especially during the opening credits.  It sets you up for the terror that is soon to follow!",8,0,1,18 February 1999
The Shining," Kubrick at his best
","Stunning horror film that could only have come from Stanley Kubrick.  It is a terrifying, artistic, brilliant experience that has never really been equalled by any other horror movie.  Definately one of the scariest, if not THE scariest, I've ever seen.  It is also the most stylish horror film I have ever seen. The perfectly symmetrical shots, are much like those of 2001, as is the very slow pacing in parts.  I've read many things about this movie where people speculated on the hidden meanings of it. Who knows what is the truth, since Kubrick is such a master it could mean anything, but it makes the film more interesting and mysterious.  I've noticed many things about this film.  For one, notice that Jack is shown very often talking while looking into a mirror - when Wendy brings him breakfast, at the bar, in the bathroom, when Danny comes into his room - and almost everyone else is shown talking with a very bright window behind them, so bright that it glares off the lens (usually considered a mistake).  The only times Jack has a window behind him are when he has the terrible nightmare, and when he is chasing Wendy with a bat, and they are especially bright.  Who knows if this means anything, but with Kubrick it is very possible, so watch for things like that in this film and his others.  Highly recommended!",9,0,0,27 March 1999
Being John Malkovich," wow....um, wow
","Quite simply put, this movie blew my mind.  I came out of it laughing with disbelief at how incredibly wierd and cool and brilliant it was.  It is a stunning film that is one of the most creative and original pieces of work EVER MADE.  The sheer genius of the script brought to life with Spike Jonze's masterful direction coupled with wonderful performances, especially that of John Malkovich himself...what a cool guy!  The fact that he let this get made and had a part of it really makes me admire the guy more than I already did.  I am not going to say anything about the plot, not a word, because it's better you have no idea whatsoever what will happen, going into it.  It is genius!!  One of the freshest and funnest movies I've ever seen, one of the best movies I've seen this year definately.  This better win some awards, or I will lose faith in every movie awards ceremony in existance. 
Um...wow.  That's all I can say...oh, well that and 'go see this movie as soon as humanly possible.'  It will twist your mind around and leave you giddy with a smile on your face afterwards. A true piece of brilliant art. Wow. 10/10",10,0,0,28 November 1999
Aliens," oh my god.....
","Oh my dear god this movie is unbelievable...the first Alien was a great movie, this is an astounding triumph of moviemaking and one of the greatest sci-fi, horror, and action movies ever made. It combines all those genres into one hell of a movie that will blast through you like nothing you've ever seen.  And I can only imagine what kind of force this thing has on the big screen.  It is very different from the original, which was a stark, somewhat slow movie where it was scary for the most part because you would never know when the alien would strike.  In this movie, the aliens are EVERYWHERE: popping out of the walls, air ducts, floors, ceilings...hardly gives you any chance to catch your breath.  The last hour or so is nonstop intensity.  It is definitely not for the faint of heart let me just warn you.  Not to mention that the story is also very good with very strong characters.  See this now if you haven't!!!",9,0,0,18 February 1999
Mission: Impossible," wow...
","Wow, this movie is incredible (and very underrated).  Yes, it's true, the plot doesn't make much sense when you are watching it or even when you think back on it.  BUT WHO THE HELL CARES!!!  It's a brilliantly filmed, stylish, and original piece of work by a true master of cinema, Brian De Palma.There are several sequences in this film that blow my mind.  1) the first job near the beginning...2) the ultra-stylish, eye-popping, breathtaking, nail-biting, brilliant computer room break-in sequence, with Tom Cruise hanging from a cable on the ceiling---woah..3) the scene in the restaurant with the fish tank (notice how the angles on the characters when they're talking get increasingly more crooked...)  4) and the mind-boggling finale on the bullet train, you won't believe your eyes.Don't watch this movie and expect it to be realistic, because it isn't.  It is totally over-the-top and implausible, but it's supposed to be.  And that's what makes it fun.  Just realize..IT IS A MOVIE...and enjoy it as a fun, amazing, stylish, brilliant thrill ride.",9,1,2,24 February 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Very powerful movie
","This is an amazing movie.  The acting is incredible and the screenplay and direction are amazing.  Extremely powerful and pretty depressing, it actually has a pretty heartwarming kind of ending and the way everything ties together at the end is simply brilliant.  You must see this movie, definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.",10,1,2,9 March 1999
