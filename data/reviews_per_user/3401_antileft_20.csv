Changeling," Incredible cinematic achievement
","Finally , a movie with A. Jolie, where she gets the chance to show all her acting talent,after years of laughable material ( Wanted being one of my favorite turkeys ) . Truly , this cinematic emerald ,entirely based on a true story from the 30s , and this is DEFINITELY NOT for the week  hearted !, brings Miss Jolie back to her anonymous early beginnings , namely to her first leading role in the fantastic GIA ,for which she was proclaimed one of the most talented young actresses. Changeling is the proof that in order to have a great film with teeth you certainly don't need 50 million worth of mediocre F/X and senseless explosions , car chases and unbelievable camera rotations and twists, dubbed unique artistic perspectives thanks to the sub - moronic latest couple of Bond movies , first and foremost what you need , is the simple magic of a cohesive story and logical , slow storytelling,where the inevitable horrific is palpable and lurking just behind the corner , ready to pounce on everyone , where the consequences will be devastating , and the first victim will be human sympathy and motherly love , which - let˙s face it - are the basic building bricks of our society .But for that , you need to have Mr. Eastwood behind the helm , and suffice to say , the older he is , the better he is !Briefly , one of the best dramas ever , where every shoot , every camera angle ,every word , every silence counts.",10,3,5,30 March 2009
Star Trek," The hard core science fiction is back in the saddle !
","If this is the future of science-fiction genre, then Thank God for JJ Abrams.The new Star Trek is a rare achievement , as its too numerous individual parts are simply astounding, read, never has a film of this genre reached a quality of ultra-real photography, and being a science fiction ,this means a whole new ballgame ! Namely , the attention that the wizards from ILM have given to the most minute details is beyond belief ( i. e. - The Enterprise entering the battle zone smack into the countless floating debris of other ships , the concept design of its interiors - slick , but still ' ungainly ' , as based on the existing technological solutions - pipes , tubes , valves and counters, the lack of room , the bustle and hustle , too bad you can't produce the smells !- simply , the transportation of present into the not too distant future is visible in every shot ,the smart restaurant menus with familiar logos on them ,etc.etc.) .Even the choice of mostly unknown actors , at least to me , is superb , as every one of them shows a great talent , love for the past series , and brains ! On the negative side : the storyline gets a little bit confusing with the warping of time and singularity effects , but , hey , surprisingly , it won't kill your love for the film.And for the end : pay special attention to one of the wackiest scenes in history : the ' space diving ', incredible idea,and its execution!",6,2,7,11 May 2009
Pirate Radio," Love is on the boat
","Finally , a movie with a soul that is ,well, as big as the Rock 'n 'Roll .The story about the illegal pirate station that was broadcasting 24/7 at the end of the 60's somewhere in the North Sea ,and the material , o boy , the music that has endeared this genre to practically everyone on this planet .And the fact that the government forbade this music in Mother England , that was something new to me ( talking about the democratic gene ? ) .Simply , everything that we want from a movie : simplicity , off-beat acting by everyone ( S.P. Hoffman ,E.Thompson in a hilarious cameo ,K.Brannagh- watch him closely , he must be brought to bigger budget movies , he is simply incredible –I deeply recommend Conspiracy ) , and music galore. If you are utterly disgusted with politics and your favorite economists and their silent counterparts – politicos – expecting God and Gods to come to the rescue in these direst of possible times ( Is there the smell of gunpowder in the air ? ) , then do see this little British surprise of the year !",7,5,8,14 September 2009
Terminator Salvation," The fate of Chrysler is too tangible here too!
","It is very difficult to properly evaluate the fourth part, but it is definitely NOT the good old Arnie' s vehicle- he does pop up for a brief moment though! - and one of the essential Sci-fi movies ever . Its brightest side is undoubtedly the scenery ,i.e. the movie takes place in the future when the nuclear war has devastated almost everything, and more or less unconnected bands of humans are roaming this radioactive wasteland in the veritable Mad Max fashion , thus becoming easy prey for all kinds of robotic enemies , from very flexible ˝ biker ˝ ones , to some sort of nasty looking quasi-fish entities ,to 'HQs' and my favorite ones , namely giant human harvesters. But , and this is its main flaw, you barely get to see the standard T-800, and only one T-600 that soon gets hilariously whacked off , and where are the waves of aforementioned T-800s that we are so familiar with from previous installments anyway ? And , secondly, humans have not fared so poorly , possessing choppers , Thunderbolt planes, an intact and quite a modern and fully operational airport and ,yes, even a sub ,acting as their headquarters! Nuclear destruction would look much more thorough and terrifying, as is depicted in other Terminators! Acting is rather average, and the only one standing out is H.B. Carter as a Cyberdine-Skynet scientist with a secret , and if there is to be a sequel to this , I expect her in a leading role!Briefly, visually stunning , thanks to ILM and Stan Winston Studios, otherwise too much Sarah Connor Chronicles , it should have been branded 18 , as this is NOT your standard Saturday afternoon TV fare!!",5,0,2,10 June 2009
The Beach," Perfect for the unbearably hot recession-hit summer months
","After seeing the movie for the first time , I must conclude that it is a very good product by D.Boyle , perhaps the most popular and financially successful British director to date ,whose film canon includes an impressive array of various genres , ranging from comedies ( Trainspotting ) to Sci - Fi with Sunshine ,and his last academy winner The Slumdog Millionaire .The Beach is a most welcome film for this Indian summer, as it deals with ,well, a last strip of paradise ,whose precise location is a sort of modern tourist legend, and the arrival of three youngsters ,led by Leo De Caprio , who discover a sort of modern hippie commune there, where love – read -sex and partner sharing – soft drugs –the island is virtually ideal for growing opiates !, briefly- carefree ' joie de vivre ' are the only rule ,and where the only contacts to the Thai mainland are restricted to the monthly procurement of necessities done only by the select few .The eternal bliss is , of course, doomed , as the inevitable ,namely the forces of nature ( diseases ,injuries –there are no doctors there ,and if the need be , you cannot - once on the mainland – return or disclose the location ! , and the most destructive one ,that is the most human one , jealousy ) dictate the lives there as well .This movie shows the true nature of modern tourist industry that cares not a fig about national , religious or cultural sensibilities( observe the depiction of now infamous Thai sex tourism ,making one wonder if there is really nothing else except girls and the indulgence of the most perverted sexual whims and proclivities !) , and draws its power from human gullibility , and , first and foremost, vacuous, meaningless and jaded human lives under the slogan of ' Enjoy '.",6,0,1,6 August 2009
The Bourne Identity," An excellent thriller is back !
","This is perhaps one of the best crime-thrillers , itself a remake of a mini-series in the early 80s with at that time one of the most popular actors R. Chamberlain and J. Smith , both ,again , based upon the eponymous novel by R.Ludlum . In the movie , we can spot similarities with Bond movies and the other like The Heat , Collateral , except that Bourne has perhaps introduced the genre of almost completely real storyline and fast-paced , non-stop action set in European capitals ( here Paris ) ; the main idea is to discover the identity of Bourne , who is in the beginning found floating in the sea . What follows is breath  taking action , claustrophobic chases , elements that are coming together slowly like in a jigsaw , and the final , nightmarish realization of one's life and mission ( 'You are nothing but a 30 million $ government property ! ' ) . Acting by everyone is top-notch ( From Mr. M . Damon , to Mr C. Cooper to , in my modest opinion , Mme F. Potente , who is , perhaps , one of the most underrated acting talents in the world cinema  recommend Elementary Particles , not to mention her girl-next-door magnetism . The movie was a big surprise hit , understandably followed by two sequels of a lower , but still acceptable , quality ( Why did his heartthrob have to die , no !! ) . Briefly , the movie brought back the good old story-telling , where shocks happen all of a sudden , and before you know it , here comes another surprise ! It would be interesting to see some more Ludlum's novels turned into movies ( like Matarese Countdown ) .",8,2,2,29 August 2008
Knowing," Eco – warning wrapped in Christian imagery
","It is obvious now that the idea of the end of our dear planet is popular, but until now it seems to me that only R.Emmerich has got it right ( The Day After Tomorrow , 2012 ),older movies to be disregarded ( e.g. Meteor , The Earthquake ) ,as everything else is simply more or else vacuous , with a storyline that sends you shivering , or ,as this is the case with Knowing , has too much empty space in between three well-depicted scenes of disaster . The idea here is in the best vein of Nostradamus' predictions , here discovered on a piece of paper in the form of numbers that the main hero N. Cage decodes easily, realizing that it is about the dates of accidents and major disasters with the Apocalyptical end nigh and unavoidable ( the major solar flare , original !) , and the group of children ,hearing inexplicable voices ,his son , of course , being among , what turns out at the end ,the chosen ones , and having been selected by the 'angels' , sort of energy –looking creatures tasked to save specimens of humans and transport them to another habitable planet , and that scene is to be looked at closely ! Christian symbolism is here more than tangible ,but there is just too much empty walking,talking and soul searching,and Mr.Cage is just too darn extra dramatical ,tragic and glum. Why do a lot of H-wood movies have to have heroes whose darling ones are deceased ,and ,the new trend , having only one parent ,who has to be a scientist no less –watch The Day the Earth Stood Still and wonder, this is just too stale and boring ?! Visual side is acceptable ,but only three scenes ,done by unknown nosy upstarts, where the angels uncannily resemble the creatures from The Close Encounters of The Third Kind ,while the rest is monotonous cinematic boredom ! And a poor commercial for Mazda vehicles , and I strongly doubt that this film will do any good to the company in terms of sales !",4,0,1,8 July 2009
District 9," Slovenian ' film – makers ', learn from this ( fat chance ! )
","A South-African Sci-Fi with photo realistic effects made by perhaps the second best effect company – Weta f/x , a film that was a financial and visual surprise of the year , a film that has infused the genre with new stylistic approach ( i.e. –just watch the first thirty minutes made as a sort of documentary ( in sci-fi genre , no less ! ) , where the whole story with the arrival of a gigantic space ship with more than a million creatures ,who look like a hybrid between a cockroach and a shrimp ,emaciated and having been eating on each other in order to survive, is explained ,as the huge human clean-up operation to relocate the very same 'shrimps' away from the encircled area near Jo-burg ( and that's another beauty of the film , namely ,forget about aliens razing downtown Washington , New York or , in a few cases Paris , it's the South Africa's turn now !) , is about to commence ,as the residents have soon become fed up , sorry , hostile towards the new arrivals , who have not done anything wrong , except that they look 'ugly ', i.e. too non –human , and are eating all the time ,and ,presto facto, the bustling trade with the Nigerian gang members selling ,mind this , the aliens' favorite food – cat meat, and , another original creations , namely an interspecies prostitution is also taken care of and in full swing !! But as is to be expected , the whole day bureaucratic stroll turns out a bit differently ,and the whole truth about the alien race and human desire to relocate - decimate – incarcerate – get hold of their weapons is slowly revealed with the surprising twist at the end !A psycho-social study of humans , racial tensions , lies ,greed ,domination ,unsolved historical black spots still painfully lurking in the background ( concentration camps – aliens'holding ground if you prefer - were first built in South Africa ), exploitation smack in your face ! A debut of highest quality for Mr. N. Blomkamp !",7,2,3,18 September 2009
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg is God
","Even thinking about this film gives me the chills , well,like practically everything Mr. Spielberg has done in his career , lifting the American movie into the cinematic heaven . Hopefully , many movies are still ahead of him , the greatest artist ever, no doubt !There is nothing new to say about Saving Private Ryan , after so many years , except that perhaps it ought to become the must study subject for anyone interested in military history or history as such , because ,friend,it cannot go any gorier than this , that is, any more realistic than this ( watch Rambo 4 , When Trumpets Fade , Windtalkers ). Saving P.R. has somehow created a new genre of films , that is ultra-realistic war movie that transcends anything solely written, in fact , as has always been the case with Mr. Spielberg, literature gets its visual manifestation, where even Shakespeare would pipe down and bow in reverence ! Even 10 is not enough , simply no numerical quality, unit , exists to describe the sheer power of this cinematic experience , not even the designation 'film 'itself can do this ! Angelic, stratospheric , out of this dimension , Mona Lisa in cinema !",10,13,24,18 April 2008
The Mist," Typical quasi - King boredom
","This movie may be based on a good science fiction idea , e.g. the military ( who else ? ) 's secret dabbling with different dimensions that , clearly , goes haywire and envelops the small town near-by in a form of a mist ( thank God , they did not decide on The Fog by good old Carpenter )And then a pretty large group of customers is trapped in a local supermarket , left to itself to figure out what the heck has happened , and in the process fractions , squabbling , and a necessary religious fanatic that seems to be a regular staple by Mr King's ( check Carry ) ensue , while the idea of survival becomes somehow moot . All well , except that the movie looks straight for TV , acting especially by M. Harden as a apocalyptic nut seems wooden , while the effects ,if this was to be taken seriously , should have been done by ILM and not some nosy upstarts ,thus creating a visually laughable material that makes this flick a regular 80s video-based on something by Mr King ( e.g. Christine, Cujo...)- junk ! All this has been told and retold on too many occasions , boring !",3,2,6,4 April 2008
Transformers," Transformers
","This is again the strongest summer action sci-fi movie of the year , and I hope that Spielberg - Bay cooperation will continue as we need quality stuff that dreams are made of ! It is funny to see how important are certain things for young generation , as are the action Hasbro Transformers toys and figures . After seeing the movie , my younger brother immediately went to buy himself one of the toys ,soon the whole collection will be created , I am afraid ! In short , this is , thankfully , a film for boys , although the romance between two main characters is pretty believable , not to mention the music in the older Camarro with the sun in the background , mystical ! Again , the cheapest summer movie( believe it or not !) with incredible special effects, perhaps THE BEST EFFECTS EVER ( Oscar without competition ! ) , and the story that is a) not trying to find another artistic and deep - rooted traumas and meanings, thus making the whole business senseless and brainless b) is funny and simple and makes this what a summer flick is supposed to be : a brain relaxation and an eye candy ! Get behind the wheels of your GM vehicle and enjoy the ride !",7,1,4,25 September 2007
The Dark Knight," The most overrated film ever
","This is by far the most overrated film ever , and this is supposed to be even number 1 on the IMDb 250 best films ever ? Better than Star Wars , American Gangster , Starship Troopers , Indiana series , Aliens to name but few ? On the basis of well-paid film promoters and their 'opinions '? Unbelieavable! What is good in Batman : it is , rightly centered on the character of Joker , and the performance of Mr Ledger is , rightly, great ,as he is portrayed as the sadistic scum , who likes to destroy , maim , generally blow up everything , not for some ideology , or , even worse , money, but for the fun of it ( He even says : I like simple things , like a stick of dynamite ), and other performances are also acceptable , but when the idea of a character Two face enters the spiel , the fun abruptly ends and falls into the philosophical abyss, consequently extending this film to the unbearable 2 h 30 minutes, ending with the , mind this , Batman as a main villain ?! Has Mr Nolan become a great fan of a modern philosophers like Zizek from Slovenia , where the most illogical and inconsequential is the norm ? Fie to this ! And visually , besides a minor 3 minutes of car chases with the Batmobile , there is virtually an empty space !Bring back Jack and T. Burton !And the famous bat dance with the Prince's tune !",4,8,17,25 July 2008
Avatar," This WILL NOT create a new Sci – Fi cultural movement
","It is amazing that the movie of this sort gobbles up at least 300 million bucks in the middle of a financial meltdown, a product ,whose costs could support a whole set of economies , not to mention –even countries ? And Mr Cameron still believes that he is on top of the world ,e.g. that movie industry's calendar begins with before and after Titanic ? OK , the visuals are breath-taking , mind-boggling, absolutely amazing , and kudos to him for having engaged / commissioned the best and the brightest in the field, viz. ILM , Weta .etc. ,and the Oscars here are a given , but the idea of the movie – The Navis race , uncannily resembling the black Earthlings, on the distant Pandora , an Earth-like planet , living in total harmony with their planet and in direct communion with their ancestors , are to be wiped out by us , the ugly white - Christian – read – brutal – uncouth - dirty – and materialistic, egged on by the insatiable thirst for profits and profits alone , all encapsulated in the greedy boss in the form of G.Ribisi and ,who else but the ,again ,crazed military commander with an axe to grind with the Pandora's savages ? Am I to understand the message that this white brutal ugly Americans and oppressive western European males are always messing up with the ways of , say – Iraqis , Afgans or their separate tribal habits and heritage ,and foiling ,worse, desecrating their ' innocent 'ways, their absolute love they have always had for everyone ( Funny , I have never heard Soviets – e.g. Russian commies apologizing for their 'cultural ' proselytizing ?! ) .And the planet itself is teeming with life ,all again bearing a conspicuous resemblance to the one on Earth ,say ferns ,trees ,a sort of Jurrasic feel permeating the film , but I had expected to see some original,ugly ,Giger-like , terrifying forms and creatures ,but no dice ,it is a multi-million dollar investment ,and , kiddies , come in mighty droves ,it is your beloved hippo , a bit changed and coloured , and the horsey ,a bit changed and coloured , and there are dragons aplenty ,and they can be tamed ! Mr. Cameron should have followed his own gut-tearing Aliens , but ,alas, it is those ugly investors again ,demanding the cash torrent,not , god forbid , a trickle , so have no fear, kiddo ,and bring your mommies and sisters as well , we'll have fun ! The final battle is astounding ,but the Navis winning with spears and arrows against robotized walkers, jet helicopters and all sort of various mean-looking killing machines ,that's a long one , I really hoped they might throw dragons ' urine on soldiers ! All in all , a visually perfect Sci-Fi odyssey ,but erroneously based on the Gea's theory of the mother Earth , Al Gore's pseudo-scientific babble ( we had fouled up the Earth ,but lost on Pandora , and , sadly we are going back to the oceans of black and grey goo !) ,and I really wonder if there weren't some Greenpeace beatniks involved in this ! I would recommend District 9 more , incomparably cheaper and more up-to-date with current problems worldwide ( racism, criminal genetics etc. ) .",6,2,9,21 December 2009
The Happening," Stay away from this !
","This is one of the most boring movies that this summer has produced; it is clear now that Mr Shyamalan's magic touch is no more and another proof that banking only on one talent - in this case supernatural thriller , unknown and terrifying around us , with as little visualization of this evil , unknown and in all of us as possible , cannot work forever; the movie is also a painful slap on the face of Mr Walberg ,as no one in this film in fact knows what he /she is doing .An interesting basic idea ,but horribly presented , plants as evil force and bunch of people running somewhere , and dropping dead , and that's that !",3,1,4,8 July 2008
Downfall," Insanity at its worst
","Only rarely do we get to see a European war movie , but when we do , it is certainly a little gem , like this one based upon the memories of a former Hitler's personal secretary of his last days in the bunker under Berlin . The end is nigh , but no one , especially Hitler himself , wants to at least once in his lifetime accept the inevitable , namely , the defeat , even worse : he and most of his entourage like Himmler still dream of the magical counterstrike by now virtually non-existent German army , for which even children are now senselessly giving lives, being torn to pieces by the incessant Russian barrage . Hitler's personal psychological ruin , probably a delusional maniacal paranoia in the last stages , is incredibly portrayed by Mr. Ganz , as are all other characters , like the Himmler couple  the infanticide by madame Helga H . , otherwise the emblem of a true Arian mother , president of a Nazi women's association, immediately after their savior's suicide is , perhaps , one of the most shocking scenes in the history of cinema , then E. Braun , who at one point confides to the author , that in spite of having lived with Hitler for many years, she still does not know him , and all others as well . In one word : if you want to learn about the insanity , which is the basic idea in this movie , to which everyone can easily succumb , then this is the definite cinematic must see!",8,0,1,12 August 2008
Inception," Number one turkey of the year!
","This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my expectations that I might have had before like this being the most original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least. This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal expectations, now even the illiterate are writing  Just horrible",1,42,79,2 August 2010
WALL·E," What a cartoon!
","I have never thought that a cartoon , done in a classic ,e.g.-Disneyan way, by using the armada of talented artists and their drawing ,sketching etc. hand skills ,or , all these on the rows of computers , could be more humanistic that a non-animated product , a feature film , but , what Disney - the Pixar geniuses have achieved with this , is simply, beyond words ,and I have to reiterate here that what stands out is the basic building block of any work of art , that is the need to tell , describe , warn ,where talent simply lashes out ,and as is the case with Wall-E ,where the story carries everything, and the perfect digital animation ,voice characterization ( the main computer's voice is no other than Madame S.Weaver's ,and the same goes for her as for Mr . C.Eastwood , namely , the 'older' she is ,the better she is !), musical scenes are all fused into this cinematic evergreen ! Yes, as an adult and a sort of a movie buff , I simply cannot believe what kind of satisfaction and personal hopes of a better world in the middle of an interpersonal , financial and moral crisis this cartoon has reignited in me , again stressing the most basic cosmic and religious rule that love is possible ,that a better world is possible , that peace is possible ! And , what more can you wish for !",9,4,7,26 October 2009
Prometheus," Too average a movie
","Prometheus comes to me as a sort of major disappointment, or better said, a par on the course of this year's movie offerings, all over- hyped,budget-sucking behemoths that have suspended the most crucial element, namely, logic, a simply story-telling art, that has obviously been dealt a coup de grace once for all. Well, boys and girls, as this is the case, and you like watching your Phds in some arcane type of anti-knowledge in say sociology,economics and public relations, neatly dangling from the wall of your cushy H-Wood's offices, do not be surprised if the overall profits are the lowest in the decade,well, you know, I ain't paying for this intellectual manure any more-Avengers, Immortals II, John Carter,The Hunger Games, the latest Resident evil,sorry, IMHO, this year has been by far the worst in my living memory as the quality of your products is concerned,when that product is rotten to the core. And the aforementioned film is only a tad better, namely, the initial 20 minutes are any Sci-fi freak's virtual wet dream- the idea of the humanity's beginnings,encompassing religion and Darwinism ,the design of the Prometheus space craft,its interior, equipment,based on the possible future development of present-day technology, the character of David, Ash' distant precursor, the setting of the LV planet, really eye-catching and simply beautiful. But then, problems star piling with the hyper-speed,and they are, unfortunately, galore, namely, the selection of actors-the main one, somebody named Naomy or something,she is atrocious, unwatchable, completely unsuited for the breeches of the likes of S.Weaver, even though P. should have nothing to do with Alien series, she hasn't convinced me at all, and the same can be said for that geologist dude with the horrible Scottish dialect, Jesus on the pogo stick,you would never select such a character to go on such a dangerous and expensive mission. Then the remaining story line, once the crew discovers the life creators' base, is utterly predictable– bunch of running to and fro, a dynamic duo that gets trapped in the dark corridors,and then– as a horror moment for modern day teen girls,raised on The Hunger Games and Twilight series,then you know how uneventful, even hilarious this movie is, gets attacked by some sort of a snake-like creature,about which you are told zilch,and then the meeting with one of the makers, and the required completely unnecessary overextended 20-something minute finale, and you are left with that empty feeling-and an even emptier wallet. And P. is, imagine this if you can, a better product of this year. Well, the future really looks bleak for the studio's moguls, but its their own fault",5,1,7,17 September 2012
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Ultrasuperficial love boredom
","This is unfortunately by far the worst movie made by W. Allen , indisputably one of the greatest masters of comedies , and one of my most favorite directors , actors , writers , but this movie simply falls flat on every count , namely , what the heck is it even about ? Love story , menage -a- trois , even four , is so frivolous , so unrealistic, read , boring , that this makes it the rock bottom of Mr. Allen 's career . Having decided to make the movie in Barcelona just because he happened to get to like the city bang on the spot ,and then inserting a typical Latino artist , who is - what else ! - an irresistible magnet for two ,again typical American flirtatious girlfriends, and the lonely island , and the arrival of his ex , who is , what else , neurotic and repressed genius , but of course unrecognized ,artistic talent , and all these dames falling in love head over heels ,and that is that ! No humor , no coherent story , poor acting , a narrator ,who is driving you nuts with his atrocious commentaries , in one word : a cinematic catastrophe of highest proportions on par with the other feminine gem of this kind : Sex and the City !",2,27,46,11 February 2009
Casino," Modern gangster saga
","One of those movies that will surely withstand any test of time , a modern gangster classic that is also a must-study material for any student of drama ,for any acting school, or a necessary reference for the quality adaptation of a high quality literature by N.Pileggi on par with M. Puzo's The Godfather! Everything in here has its place , meaning , reason ,the characters have their psychological depth ( e.g. : Ginger's pathological dependence on her low-life pimp, who doesn't have to raise a voice for her to fulfill any of his junkie whims combined with her obsession with jewelery , expensive clothes , cars, drugs ,and consequently her indifference towards her own daughter ). Las Vegas is shown as hell on Earth ,where all the glitz , music , the most beautiful dancers and most popular entertainers are but a dream , a facade , that must lure as many 'suckers' as possible ,who simply cannot win ,and even if they do , measures as taken to bring them back to the pools and tables ,where they are destined to lose more than they might have won the previous night , and no cheap gambling tricks of any kind are possible ,as everything is constantly watched by ex-cons now in employ with the casino, with the god himself ,Mr. Sam Rothstein , flawlessly portrayed by R.DeNiro,while the money is coming,and the casino itself is but a money-churning beast with areas sealed off even for the manager himself, and when the coffers are on time and full, 'cappi de tutti capi 'are smiling and satisfied regardless of the number of unmarked graves in the desert around !And this dream has to come to an end ,and when this happens ,everything goes , the guilty and less guilty are disappeared ,as is the case with one of the most disgusting graphic scenes ever towards the end !
