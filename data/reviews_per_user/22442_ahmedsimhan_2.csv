Hereditary," I never enjoyed
",This is not a Horror movie. It just shows cult possession to bring back their own god to worship. I never enjoyed watching this. I can survive very boring one's but this one is not for you if you are looking for a horror movie. Just go for another one. Not worth your time.,4,1,3,31 December 2018
A Quiet Place," One of best horror this year
",There is not too much talk in this movie but very suspenseful. It will be worth your time. Just stay with it.,8,0,0,19 November 2018
