Blade Runner 2049," Too Slow and Loud Sometimes but Cool Sci-Fi Elements
","The movie has a lot of slow moments. Sometimes these long moments are cool but other times it just makes the movie boring and hard to sit through. Nothing wrong with slow scenes if they are done right (see The Naked Island).The movie's music is sometimes too loud. It reminds me of the movie Interstellar. It's hard to appreciate certain scenes when the music is too loud. The music overall is okay.I enjoyed the science fiction elements in the movie. Also, I liked how there are multiple languages in the movie.Finally, I didn't like Ryan Gosling in this movie or La La Land. I didn't mind him in The Notebook.",7,0,7,7 October 2017
