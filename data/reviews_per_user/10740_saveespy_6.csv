The Blair Witch Project," My dog could have made a better film.
","I hated this with an absolute passion! I felt nothing but contempt when I saw what all the fuss has been about. The film looked like it was shot by an epileptic having a fit on a trampoling. Lesson to all aspiring filmakers - don't try to pass off incompetence as being all moody and atmospheric. In the words of The Who, I 'won't get fooled again'! A complete waste of time.",Null,1,2,2 May 2000
Scarface," De Palma's, Stone's and Pacino's finest hour.
","I recently caught up with 'Scarface' on DVD. The three main people involved in this film, I feel, have never come close in their subsequent careers to matching what they achieved here.First of all, the script. Absolutely flawless. Stone has always been too didactic and preachy for my liking ('NBK', anyone?), but here he was spot on. What amazes me now looking at the film is the way that it comments of the attitude and mentality of greed and materialism that was very much part of the 1980's while the film was still of that time; no flippant irony like films of ttoday that look back on that period. This is probably one of the reasons why it failed at the box office; people of the time didn't want to see the truth of what they had created.Secontly, De Palma. The film is very much in the style of an opera, a Greek tragedy if you will. De Palma has always had an arrogant, ballsy visual style. It was a perfect marriage in 'Scarface' with its subject matter. Even a small sequence like the one where he is left alone in the bathroom watching his T.V.'s, the way the camera pulls back to reveal physical emptiness, says so much about Montana so beautifully that words feel completely unnecessary.Finally, Pacino.Like Jack Nicholson he is at times in danger of becomming a self-parody and lazy as an actor. However, this couldn't be furthur from the truth in 'Scarface'. The fact that Tony Montana is such a repellent character and yet you, as a viewer, are totally rivetted to and compelled by him is a major achievement on Pacino's behalf. I'll never forget the scene where he's on the phone to Mani after Elvira's left him and he asks Mani that, if she calls, to tell her that he loves her. Just that brief dlas of humanity within the monster that he has become.'Scarface' is a modern classic of cinema. If you haven't seen this film, do so as soon as possible. This stands along side 'Once Upon A Time In America' and 'Goodfellas' as a film that completely trandscends its genre limitations and has so much, much more to offer than mere vicsceral thrills. In other words, a brain behind the brawn.",Null,0,0,14 August 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Devastating
","'Requium for a Dream' cements Darren Aronofsky's place as one the truly great new directors of the new century, along with David Fincher and P.T. Anderson. This is a film that will shake and move you very, very deeply. In only his second film, Aranofsky illustrates his truly incredible command of the medium; this is the first film that, for me, managed to honestly and perfectly capture the psychology of a drug user via its images and sounds. The four main leads - Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes and especially Ellen Burstyn- act with a sense of honesty and conviction that you very rarely see in cinema. Thier collective belief in the film and what it has to say is up there on the screen. Visually, this film is truly astonishing and proves that 'Pi' was no fluke. Case in point: the split screen sequence with Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly ,post-sex, talking and saying how much they love each other. The way that the screen is split is a truly compelling and powerful foreshadow of the way that their relationship disintergrates once addiction takes hold. This is shown later in the film the way that Marion,hungry for a fix, flips the photo of her and Harry in happier times, to see the number of the dealer that will give her drugs in exchange for sex. It's a very quiet, but completely devastating moment in the film.Some of the film's most gut wrenching moments are its quietest, such as where the two old ladies are crying and hugging outside the hospital while the smow falls after they see Sara. Although he just about sets the screen on fire with the way that he visually depicts his story, Aranofsky's trump card in 'Requium' is his use of music. Clint Mansell and The Kronos Quartet have perfectly married their vision musically to what Aransofsky depicts on screen. Best example: the very final sequence in which we see where the four main characters have ended up both physically and emotionally from where we first met them. The combination of aural and visual is one of the most perfect and completely heart breaking moments ever committed to film, particularly the very final shot with Sara and Harry telling each other that they love each other, imposed over Sara sleeping in her bed in the hospital. I left the theatre physically shaking both times I saw 'Requium' It is a pity that no one under eighteen in Australia can see this film. It is one of the most important film about drugs and drug abuse ever committed to film. 'Requium For A Dream' is the rarest of bests; a film about drugs that neither glamourises nor preaches. It is the first truly great film of the 21st century. If this film manages to make even one person change their mind about using hard drugs, than that is the greatest recommendation that 'Requium For A Dream' could possibly receive.",Null,0,0,2 March 2001
American Beauty," Excellent. Beautiful script.
","Godd so see intelligence and depth returning to cinema ('Phantom Menace', anyone?). Kevin Spacey is a truly incredible talent. The entire cast just fit together so perfectly - best performances for my money, apart from Spacey, were Wes Bently and Alison Janney as his mother. Beautiful, beautiful script. My only problem with the film is that I feel that, although it is brilliant and the themes and issues it deals with are timeless, is that this film might date somewhat as years go by. But we'll wait and see. A film that came out the same year and adressed similar issues but in an entirely different way was Paul Thomas Anderson's truly mindblowing 'Magnolia'. Personally, that is a film that virtually jumped off the screen and touched my heart so much. I will say though that 'American Beauty ' is indeed a classic film. It will be interesting to see how time treats it.",Null,0,0,28 June 2000
Mulholland Drive," Lynch's finest hour.
","Where to start? David Lynch has well and truly excelled himself with 'Mullholland Dr.', a haunting, mind-bending, poetic masterpiece that is, dare I say it, better than 'Blue Velvet' (which, until I saw this, was my all-time favourite film).While still very Lynch in its attitude and character, it shows him maturing and exploring facets of human emotion that his previous films have only explored superficially. 'Mullholland Dr.' sees him move into the rarest of cinematic fields, along with Bergman and Kubrick, in the way that he adresses and looks at the human condition, psychology and the question of identity. I've only seen this film once, but my head is still spinning from doing so; every so often, images or scenes from the film, particularly the 'Caberet Silenzio' sequence, repeat in my mind and make me want to rush off and see the film again. I had a similar experience a few years ago with P.T. Anderson's 'Magnolia'. In the nicest way possible , it reminded me a great deal of both Bergman's 'Persona' and Roeg/Cammel's 'Performance' in relation to the question of identity and who we are as people.The film also serves as a vicious satire on Hollywood; this is obviously Lynch venting his frustrations at trying to protect his sense of personal vision in his work within the Hollywood 'system', the most obvious moment of which would be the 'coffee' sequence which, to me, was quite possibly a thinly veiled shot at Dino de Laurentis, and Lynch's treatment by the 'system' after 'Dune'. One of Lynch's strenghts as a writer/director has always been his ambiguity; he once said about 'Eraserhead' that if six different people saw that film and had six different interpretations as to what it was about and trying to say, that he would have achieved his goal. 'Mullholland Dr.' feels very much like this notion amplified. To me, this film can be 'seen' and interpreted in so many different ways. Everything about this film (acting, cinematography, sound and, particularly, use of music) just fits together so beautifully. Like 'Fight Club', the less you know about this film before you see it, the better; all you need as a viewer is an open mind. A truly inspiring film that can remind you of why you love movies and what writer/directors are capable of if they refuse to become lazy and actually push themselves in new and different directions.A truly compelling film that will not be forgotten easily. A career best for Mr Lynch. Bravo. Can't wait to see what the man does next.",Null,1,2,29 January 2002
Once Upon a Time in America," Extraordinary.
","People ask me why I love cinema as much as I do. I usually reel off a list of titles and say 'Just watch this film'. 'Once Upon A Time In America' is such a film. Sergio Leone was an absolute master of cinema and unfortunately, this turned out to be his swansong. And what a swansong it is. I can never get sick of watching this film. Without a doubt, this would be in my personal top five movies of all time. Luckily in Australia, we never encountered the two hour version. That would have been a fate worse than death. Some films, like 'Gone With The Wind', use this length merely to show off. Everything in 'Once Upon A Time In America' counts. Even the slightest line or gesture, like the running discussion between Max and Noodles about swimming. This is a film that lets its characters breathe rather than follow a set pattern. More than once, this film goes totally against what one expects it to do.Personally, I found the whole question of truth of dream that permeates the film, particularly in the 1960's sequences, one of the most compelling aspects of the entire film. I still have'nt decided where I stand as far as the ambiguity the film displays in this respect. The amazing way that aspects of these sequences, such as where Noodles comes face to face with Deborah's son, also named David like Noodles, are plausible, but at the same time exaggerated. For a director to even attempt to combine such conflicting emotions, let alone make it work as well as Leone does without detracting from the story, is truly remarkable. This is a gangster film that goes where few others do. 'Once Upon A Time In America' is a film that relies on charcter and story, rather than mere visual 'tricks' or shock tactics. However, it can be extremely brutal when necessary. This Gemini-like change in mood can be seen as a mirror image reflection of Max, particularly as the story progresses.I could talk about this film forever. I'll conclude by saying that you can not call yourself an afficionado of cinema unless you've seen 'Once Upon A Time In America'. The words 'modern classic' don't even come close to describing the sheer unforgettable beauty of this tour de force. Cinema is a little bit poorer without the presence of Sergio Leone.",10,3,7,9 May 2000
