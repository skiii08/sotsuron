Skyfall," I went into this film having high hopes...
","It's been a while since I've went to a movie with sky high expectations and the movie met and exceeded every single one. That's exactly what this movie did. The opening sequence was great, followed with great visuals accompanied by an amazing theme song by Adele. Within those short 20 minutes I already knew I was in for a treat. Don't let the long run time fool you, the pacing of this movie is well done and I didn't find myself wondering off during any parts of the movie there was always something that kept the interest there and left me fully engaged. Which brings me to the story which I found to be one of the best executed stories in a bond film. Some may say it has been done before, but believe me it hasn't been done like this, there was an added sense of urgency that made every scene seem that much more important and I have to say the last 30 to 40 minutes of this film were extremely tense more so than I've ever seen in a bond movie.I don't want to spoil anything, but I want to say GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It is great for old and new bond fans. I personally believe it is the best bond to date and in 10 to 20 years will be looked back on as the best bond movie.",9,2,12,11 November 2012
