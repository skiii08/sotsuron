Alien 3," 'Sucks to High Heaven'
","This is the response I received from a friend of mine when I asked his opinion of this film before I went to see it; he paused a long time before replying, then said:  'I'm sorry; I was searching for the most appropriate words.'  The bizarre part is, that most people I have spoken to, both guys AND girls, have chosen a very close approximation of this phrase after seeing this movie.  Either there is a subliminal message in this movie the audience picked up on, or this really is the only way to describe this movie.  After finally seeing this movie years later, I have to agree wholeheartedly.Deliberate spoilers ahead:I liked `Aliens', and wanted to see where the characters would go after the movie.  Unfortunately, they literally go nowhere.  Newt (the little girl) and the robot are destroyed when the escape pod they were on crash-lands on a prison planet (we see a still photograph of the little girl, horribly burned beyond recognition), conveniently saving the studio a few grand in actors' fees.  `Aliens' showed these two struggling valiantly against death for most of the film, and here they don't even make it to the planet alive? Did the producers think the audience wouldn't care about this?  The movie begins with this scene, and if I had seen it at the theater, it would have inspired the quickest walkout in history.   My friends and I cared about the events 90% less after this.Weaver miraculously survives, as you can't kill the hero or any actor who is commanding $2 million to appear in the film.  Apparently this sucked up most of the film's tiny budget, as it was made for only a few million including Weaver's salary.  If the producers couldn't do better than this budget for a sequel, they should have waited for more money, because the effects are seen in the claustrophobic prison planet and sets they are on.
Apparently, one of the aliens (resourceful little buggers) manages to stow away on the escape pod for the trip (by this time you'd think they would expect this before headin' out. 'Computer, have any aliens come on board lately?'  'Why yes, there's one hiding under the third manifold in fact. Funny you should ask.)'   After Ripley heals up, she discovers she is on a prison world surrounded by male cons who have found religion.   She meets Charles Dutton, playing a charming character:  `I am a former rapist and murderer of women', he boasts.  `Don't I make you nervous?'  `No', she replies.  `Do I make you nervous?'  This scene doesn't create dramatic tension, but does induce nausea.Sigourney Weaver is a gun  opponent, and allegedly only agreed to do Alien3 if the producers would eliminate the use of guns in the film to make an anti-gun statement.  In this film, she says `You mean you have absolutely NO WEAPONS on this base??'  The one alien proceeds to shred most of the male inhabitants with ease.  In Aliens, Ripley was blowing away dozens of aliens with her machine gun.  Nice, um, anti-gun statement there, Sigourney.   The NRA could not have made their point better than this film.
Naturally, the evil mega corporation finds out about the alien and high-tails it over to the planet to capture Ripley and the critter.   We also find out that Ripley has been implanted with an alien Queen larva, who is about to emerge, and will surely create thousands of more aliens or worse, thousands of sequels like this one.  Somehow the bad guys know about this as well.  It is never explained how she got implanted with the larvae, but this is one of too many story holes to count.In the final scene, to prevent the bad guys from getting the queen larva she is infested with, Ripley leaps into a convenient pit of molten lava to sacrifice herself for the sake of humanity, just as the queen larva bursts from her chest, in slow motion.  This scene has to be seen to be believed. Then again, don't see it.  Just believe it happens.I didn't see Alien 4, because I had lost interest in the series after this. The only way they could have induced me to see it is if number four had started with her waking up in the escape pod, shuddering and saying `God, what a horrible nightmare.  What a horrible, cheap, underproduced nightmare.'Unfortunately for the audience, the nightmare was real.
In honor of the movie's title, three out of ten stars.",Null,501,540,6 October 2000
Batman Returns," Batman Returns to the Wrong Comicbook
","Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns series in the 1980's gave us a darker-than-usual world for Batman.  Tim Burton carried this over in his first Batman movie, but the story was clunky and too mean-spirited.  This movie is even darker and more mean-spirited than the first, and does not follow the comicbook history of the characters, mostly in the villains.The penguin in the series is *not* a deformed freak; he is an obnoxious thrillseeker, who was more of a pain in the butt to Batman than a deadly threat.  Likewise, Catwoman was a mysterious villain whose motives were never explained; the origins of both these villains have been re-written for this movie, which is fine, except that they are ludicrous and change the entire character of the villains to something one-dimensionally mean. Devito and Pfeiffer are perfectly cast as the Penguin and Catwoman, but they are never allowed to breathe as the characters.  If the film-makers had lightened up and gone for an intelligent script, Devito could have had a field-day as a dangerous but lovable munchkin, and Pfeiffer doing much more with her role as Catwoman.  Instead, both are lost in ten pounds of gloom, darkness, and leather.  The story is ludicrous, but that's ok, it's a comicbook, so plot doesn't matter.  This is *not* the attitude that Frank Miller had when he wrote the successful series; readers didn't buy it because of the look, just as audience's don't buy this movie because of its look.  If Miller had sat down and wrote out a story in 15 minutes, it would have been much better than Batman Returns.  Would he have written a story about penguins with rockets attached to them attacking Gotham City, while the Penguin tries to escape on a giant motorized Rubber Duck?  I don't think so.  This movie was a tremendous, painful waste, all the more so because of the actors involved and what they could have done with an intelligent script. ('An intelligent script?  What are you talking about?  It's only a comicbook!')   Tim Burton is the wrong director for this series.  It needs someone with a handle on the story and characters foremost, not the scenery. Whenever a movie is based on a comicbook (except for the first two Superman movies), the producers only look at the art, not the story...because they don't understand the stories.  They only understand how to recreate the image.  And to assume that comics readers only look at the pictures.  That Tim Burton would make such a mistake is what depresses me.  I haven't been able to stomach seeing another Batman movie after this one.Three out of ten stars.",Null,3,8,20 October 2000
Man on the Moon," Not a Kaufman Bio
","This movie will tell the viewer absolutely nothing about Andy Kaufman; all it does is rehash the external accounts of his premeditated self-destruction during the late 70's and 80's.  Carrey's performance is wasted in a useless script by someone who either did as little as possible to research Kaufman's life, or tried to and discovered it was impossible, or more than likely found his real life too boring to write a script about, and so we have this. The song, Man on the Moon, will tell you more about Andy Kaufman in three minutes than this film will.  He was a performer who seemed fascinated by actors' self-destructive tendencies and seemed to want to recreate them, or just had such anger toward his audience (a common trait in actors) that he wanted to alienate them more and more in his acts.  We will never know, but the big question is, why would we care?This movie gave me absolutely no insight into Kaufman's life, and whoever gave it glowing reviews read into it whatever they wanted to see.Kaufman would either have hated this movie or loved it.  My suspicion is that he would have loved it.  He was a man who wanted people to know as little about him as possible, and this movie gives the audience exactly that.  Two stars.  Carrey gave a great performance, but I'm disappointed in that he had the power to demand and wait for a much better (i.e., real) script, and didn't use it.  It's a shame.

Pi," Repetitious to the Nth Power
","WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD.I saw this film when it first came out at an art house in L.A.  It's about a mathematical genius who gets worsening headaches and I got a worsening migraine while watching it; not because of the theme, but because of the use of the same footage no less than 20 or 30 times of the man opening his medicine cabinet, popping some pills, closing his cabinet, ad naseum.The man is obsessed with finding the Universal Constant,(the film never fully explains what it is), and is not a very likable guy.  He wants to be left alone by everyone, and its hard to watch a film about a non-likable guy that wants everyone, including the audience, not to watch him. I kept wanting to honor his request.   Naturally, the world won't leave him alone and proceeds to bribe and threaten him into giving the secret info. he hasn't even discovered yet.  How they know he is researching this since he speaks to no one is never explained.As he gets closer to the truth, his headaches worsen, as do the repetitive scenes of him popping pills and injecting himself with a hypo gun.  There are many David Lynch-like unexplained visuals that are either too obvious or don't work, like him finding a living brain on the subway tracks and deciding to poke it with a pen for the hell of it.The ending is appropriately nonsensical.  In the last two minutes he decides to take a power drill (apparently he can't afford a gun)  and drill a hole in his own head, to end his suffering, or our suffering, it's not explained. I think I've seen every drill-in-the-head movie both in the United States and the Ukraine, and of the seven movies I've seen that end with a man drilling a hole in his own head, I felt that this one was the most anticlimatic.Pi is a transcendental number that never ends.  This movie is not transcendental, yet I thought it would never end.",Null,4,7,30 April 2000
For Love of the Game," For Love of the Lame
","Spoilers Ahead:If I had to choose between watching For Love of the Game or the Postman twice in a row, there would be no contest. At least the Postman had characters you can empathize with and dialogue from this planet.  Costner plays a highly-successful 40 year-old pitcher whose team owner tells him his team has been sold and Costner has been traded to the Giants.  This first scene is played with intense melancholy, as if the audience is expected to have empathy for him; it's hard to forget the fact that his character is a highly successful lifetime pitcher for a major league baseball team (how much $$ does a lead pitcher make over the years?), and who has had a career most would envy.  I wanted to go 'AAwwwwwww!' in the theater.  I wondered how many single parents on welfare would have felt sorry for the lug. Kevin's 20-something girlfriend dumps him over the phone, but in the next two scenes he befriends another 20-something, an attractive if angry woman whose car won't start on the side of the road, and without saying much more than 'aw, shucks- want to go to a baseball game?'  has changed her from yelling 'go away',  to sleeping with him in the next few scenes.  She makes a speech about respecting each other's space, then surprises him in his apartment later, only to be surprised to discover he's been sleeping with his personal masseuse (guess when you're the pitcher it comes with the massage), another 20-something perfect 10 who is more attractive than the love interest.  I swear, there must be something about turning 40 that turns men into babe magnets among the under-30 crowd.  If Costner was portraying a magnetic type of Casanova we could understand, but he is played like a manniquin.  Again, Kevin is given a huge closeup in slow motion as we are expected to feel sorry for a millionaire who gets laid every 30 seconds. This would be tolerable if there was a plot, but there isn't one that I can discern and the dialogue is so incredulous you wonder if the writers care if the audience is actually listening.  'You want to come to a baseball game? A game. Do-you-want-to-come-to-a-game...with me.',  No, I want to throw a baseball at Kevin for saying these lines, and sue the 'writer' for mental cruelty.  I don't know what happens after Kevin is sent on an errand to retrieve his girlfriends errant rebellious teenager daughter from a bad party; I walked out at that point.  I hear that some baseball actually occurs later in the movie, some well-choreographed scenes in fact.  If the movie had started with this and been about this, it would have been an enjoyable, if not deep, movie. As it is, it's completely contrived with random 'plot twists' thrown in without rhyme or reason;  Two more relevant titles for this movie would be 'For the Love of Money' (explaining why it was made), or 'For the Love of Costner'.  Costner fans won't be dissappointed or care about the plot, as the closeups of Costner are slow and sweet. To us guys, they are slow and sickening.  I didn't intend to be this vitriolic about an actor who has done mostly great work.  I have to wonder what Costner really thought of it?

Eyes Wide Shut," Strong, but incomplete
","Possible Spoilers:Eyes Wide Shut makes some very heavy statements, and has a strong beginning: a happily married, successful couple in the prime of their lives, a doctor and an art curator, have a full life and a close marriage.  They attend socials and enjoy the occasional light recreational drugs together.  What can possibly go wrong?   Everything; and all based on a simple argument.  A suave European comes onto the wife at a social; she mentions this while they are both stoned after the party.   He gives his wife a compliment that of course he would find her attractive, because she is so beautiful.  Wrong thing to say.  She takes this as a deep insult that she cannot be attractive because of her mind;  also, she gets the impression that he is quite complacent about her fidelity.  As revenge, she proceeds to tell him in detail of a strong fantasy she had about a naval officer she saw at a distance on their honeymoon, not realizing how damaging this would be to him.  The next morning, she has forgotten about it; he has not, and starts questioning his entire marriage, seeking revenge on her by intending to go out and have a quick affair.  He comes across hookers, who he pays money to but can't go through with it; he loves his wife, and knows this will damage their marriage, and besides, she hadn't actually cheated on him.  Still, he cannot get the mental infidelity out of his mind, which makes a very strong comment about the expectations we have of our partner's faithfulness.And then things really go to hell.  He gets a tip about a wild party, and goes to it in disguise, only to discover it is a hedonistic orgy with possible satanic overtones.  He is caught and revealed as an outsider. Threats to him and his wife are made.  During these journeys leading up to this disaster, there are many disturbing scenes as he discovers the difference between sexual fantasy and sexual reality.  In one scene he buys a costume from an austere man whose 16 year-old daughter is an uncontrollable nymphomanic.  He tries to control her by locking her in the house, but never seeks professional help.  Later, the doctor discovers the man has decided to profit from his daughter's nymphomania by pimping her out.  This scene, short and quick, is more disturbing and with darker implications than anything else in the movie. 
After being left a rather obvious hint that he and his wife are being watched and followed, and terrified of possible violence to his wife, the husband confesses to his wife what happened; she is devastated, but they make up in the end, which is the movie's biggest problem:  after the messy betrayal, hurt, and damage they have done to each other, mostly by non-communication, they wrap everything up while Christmas-shopping with their daughter.  The movie's most potent statements concern what we take for granted in our relationships, what we presume, and how our emotions which begin relationships can as quickly and stupidly destroy them.  It also shows how thin the line is between sexual fantasy and sexual nightmare, and how close sex, love, and trust are tied.  The problem with the movie is that after these elements are laid out, they are not pursued fully.  They are left where they are while convoluted story elements take place, such as a possible murder that may have happened, and other subplots.  And the ending wraps up threads way too disparate and tangled, way too neatly and quickly, leaving for a very unsatisfactory ending.  The most that could be hoped for in this mess would be the couple's willingness to pick up the pieces and communicate their feelings more honestly.And perhaps, giving up the recreational drugs that started the mess in the first place.  Seven out of ten stars; it had the possibility of being ten out of ten.  One wonders what Kubrik might have changed about it if he had lived longer.",Null,0,0,18 September 2000
