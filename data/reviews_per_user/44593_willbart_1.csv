Spartacus," Greatest beginning/Greatest ending
","Spartacus should be on everyone's Top Ten list. It's a classic that has held up very nicely after 45 years. The entire movie is great and, even though it's three hours long, you'll savor every minute. Two comments though on the beginning and the end. First, I believe the opening credits, along with the Alex North opening musical score, are the greatest opening credits in movie history. And the ending is still the greatest tear-jerker in movie history, with Verinia (the gorgeous Jean Simmons) and her newborn son at the feet of the crucified but still breathing Spartacus (Kirk Douglas in his most memorable role). I hate sounding like an old fuddy-duddy, but they truly don't make 'em like this anymore!",10,3,7,14 June 2005
