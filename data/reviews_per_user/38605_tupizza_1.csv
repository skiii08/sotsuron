The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I enjoyed the film
","Finally, I enjoyed the movie, after a successful first, I was bewildered appeared for on the second and bored the third, apparently Summit Entertainment took pity over the viewer and in tandem successful director and screenwriter, has given birth to something that gave birth:) I know the specifics of film from the inside, so here I was just happy to relax and enjoy, even the little bit drawn out moments could not spoil the euphoria descended on me. I was pleasantly surprised and my score 10 out of 10 for what could I return, the warm feeling of butterflies in my stomach. Thank you, I hope that I will not disappoint continue",10,6,18,19 November 2011
