Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," more of the same
",More of the same...but what is wrong with that! You will never have a better time than when you watch Pirates of the Caribbean. This movie was blessed with a super cast. I'm always surprised at how good the story lines are. Johnny Depp owns the character of Jack Sparrow. They will never find a replacement for him. I chose to see the showing that was not in 3-D. I'm not a 3-D fan because it has never justified the $3.00 extra per person. I hope that everyone gets a chance to see this film and have the chance to enjoy it as much as I did. You will not be disappointed with this film. I can only hope that they have a fifth installment in this series.,9,0,0,21 May 2011
Gremlins," This was THE movie in 1984
","Back in 1984 I was a 11 year old just starting to learn to appreciate movies. In 1984 Gremlins was THE movie. It is the first movie, other than E.T. that had a strong commercial tie-in. I had all kinds of things that were Gremlin, specifically Gizmo related. My favorite was the the little Gizmos and Gremlins that you dropped into water and they grew really big. Man were those things slimy after they grew. No telling what kind of toxic chemicals I was touching with my bare hands. Oh the good old days, I can't help but give Gremlins a 10. It just wouldn't seem right if I gave it anything less. I normally don't like remakes, but I think this one would have potential with all the cool CGI out right now. Maybe Spielberg would even help with it.",10,6,9,23 November 2010
Sucker Punch," Visual effects galore
","First of all you don't go to this kind of movie expecting an engaging storyline. You see a Snyder movie to watch the visual effects. I wasn't too sure about it at first, but it really grew on me. There were some questions that went unanswered and I really wish they had developed the characters more so that I had more invested in what happened to them, but like I said effects... not plot was the focus. It seems like in the move industry it is either effects or storyline, but never both and when there is a tinge of the two it is because there was a book or graphic novel first and it isn't an original story. I might be the only one that feels that way, but I don't think so. I had a good time watching this. I just hope that Snyder does a little more with the plot next time so that I don't leave scratching my head about some scenes.",8,2,9,26 March 2011
Source Code," Good storyline
","First of all I was intrigued with the trailer for this movie when I first saw it. It was on my list of movies to see. So while the kids went to see HOP with their mom, I went to see Source Code and was not disappointed. This movie had a terrific storyline. I think I was glad to see a movie with a good original idea. Most movies I am looking at my watch 3/4 way through, but not with this movie. I was wanting more. There were some unanswered questions, but for the most part I was okay with that because with this kind of storyline I would think it was impossible to fill all the gaps. I thought the ending was good and wasn't left open like some movies do today hoping for the numbers to bring back a sequel. If you want to see a good thriller and a movie that has a good plot then see this...I don't think you will regret it.",9,1,5,2 April 2011
Argo," Best This Year!
","I see A LOT of movies. This is definitely the best I've seen in 2012. Ben Affleck has found his niche in the historical movies genre. It was extremely well made and should earn an Oscar in many areas. Kudos to the cast and the directing. The imagery was outstanding and was magnificent. The 'feel' of being in the late seventies, even the old Warner Brothers logo at the beginning, was spot-on. I hope this movie does well in the theaters so that there will be more like this one. I'm not sure how much money this film cost, but it was worth every penny. Perhaps the studios will focus more on these types of projects than some of the stuff that has been coming out recently. Argo should go down in the books as the way a movie should be made.",10,1,4,13 October 2012
Tangled," Thanks Disney
","I must admit that I enjoy Disney movies. They are always trying to push the envelope and outdo themselves each time they make a movie. You can always expect quality, after all they have been making movies for a long time and should know how to make it work by now. With that said Tangled will be a Disney classic. I was really happy to find a good movie dedicated to what Disney is best at...Princess movies. Rapunzel has never been one of my favorite fairy tales, so I wasn't too sure about this one. Well I'm glad I took a chance. They took the Rapunzel story and really built a great storyline and the characters were definitely likable, as they should be in a Disney movie. I took three 9 year old girls and an 11 year old boy to see this movie. They all enjoyed it, including myself. There is something for everybody. You just can't help but enjoy this new animated classic.",9,3,6,27 November 2010
Rango," A real surprise
","I want to put this as simple as I can...Rango was great. I'm surprised that this movie came out so early in the Blockbuster season, it easily could be put into that category with a little more promotion. The animation was top notch and the voice-overs were spot on. They could not have had a better cast to voice the colorful characters in this adventure. While watching the movie I couldn't help but think of Blazing Saddles, of course for kids. The one thing I found upsetting was some profanity in the film, that really spoils some of the scenes. I wish films would't promote this language to kids, we have enough of it in society as it is, but now to start including it in films geared toward children is a little over the top. I am glad of one thing...it WASN'T in 3D. I was getting a little cross-eyed with all the 3D lately. I actually prefer to see films that are not 3D. I can't find the $3 overcharge justifiable. If you are looking for a great movie for kids or adults then Rango is the film you will want to go see. Outside of The King's Speech, this is the best movie I've seen so far in 2011.",9,3,7,6 March 2011
