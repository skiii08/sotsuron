The Blair Witch Project," Not As Original As It Sounds
","Despite all the hype leading up to this film, I can't help but look forward to it.  Having been a producer of lots of low-budget television fare, and having worked on a LOT of public access shows, it always tickles me when someone manages to make something special on this kind of budget.Now, I haven't seen the film yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  My biggest gripe about the film so far, hype aside, is all the claims of this film not being like anything ever seen before.  This film was actually beaten to the punch by a remarkably similar, though less frightening film called, 'The Last Broadcast.''Broadcast' was originally shown in theaters nationwide in limited release in October, 1998...nearly a full year before 'Blair Witch'.  'Broadcast', too, dealt with amateur filmmakers working on a project in the woods who disappeared under 'mysterious' circumstances, and was also shot on video as opposed to film.Where 'Blair Witch' is a terrifying, horror mock-documentary, 'Broadcast's' mock-documentary did not focus on mysterious sounds or shadows in the woods - it was more of an intriguing 'whodunnit'.  The fact that they are extremely similar may be due to simple fate and circumstance, but the fact remains that these two very similar films are separated by nearly a year, with 'Broadcast' getting first blood.Which film is better?  I've seen 'Broadcast', but the jury will still be out on 'Blair Witch' until it comes out in wide release.  See both films for yourself, and you decide.  Until then, I'll keep waiting...and watching the shadows in the woods.",2,1,4,17 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," I Still Know What the Blair Witch Did to Me Last Summer...
","Okay.I've seen the hype.  I've seen the documentary on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I've seen the movie.  I've seen the movies that 'Blair Witch' is either based on or similar to.  I've seen the reviews.  I've bitched about how similar it was to 'The Last Broadcast'.Now, the good things and a few more bitches.'Blair Witch' was a creepy flick.  Heather Donahue did an EXCELLENT job. The lack of music score keeps you from becoming detached, and the fact it's on video leads you to fool yourself into thinking it's real (i.e. - film is fake, television is real).It was NOT an original movie, at least, not for an indie film or a public access project.  I've seen similar shows done on public access.  The producers of 'Blair Witch' just used what they had to make a movie that would have required a MUCH larger budget otherwise.As a film, 'Blair Witch' is adequate.  The only thing in this movie that made people queasy was motion sickness.  The movie starts off promisingly, moves along ploddingly, then lurches to a halt just when it's getting interesting. The ending, which is supposed to show us a hint of the terror that awaits our intrepid filmmakers, instead betrays the buildup the producers worked so hard to craft. I understand that it relates to something said earlier in the film, and that the ending is SUPPOSED to leave the fates of the characters to our imagination, but there's TOO much left to our imagination.  This film has no real conclusion, no real closure or satisfaction at the end.  Creepy? Maybe, maybe not.  I guess it depends on how easily frightened you are.  I found it to be obvious and unsatisfying.For those of you who say that the similarity between 'Blair Witch' and 'The Last Broadcast', a film nearly identical in it's story and motivation, is irrelevant and pointless...think again.  Most of what the critics who love this film have to say about 'Blair Witch' is with regards to it's originality.  'Last Broadcast', whose tone is less eerie and more of a documentary, is superior in that it doesn't treat the viewer like a child. Small wonder that 'Blair Witch' is so popular with the teen crowd.  Take away the claim that 'Blair Witch' is an original idea, and you have a moderately scary supernatural suspense film.Check out 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'The Last Broadcast', and 'Man Bites Dog' to see just how 'original' this movie is.Don't get me wrong;  my last post notwithstanding, I thought that 'Blair Witch' was just fine...but it was NOT original, it was NOT scary, and it was NOT worth the hour-and-a-half of my time, and the eight bucks I spent to see it.  If not for the hype on the Sci-Fi Channel, it would have gone straight to video.",2,0,1,6 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Suspenseful and scary, but hardly original
","For those of you who went to see 'The Blair Witch Project' and gasped in both horror and delight at how 'original' it was...listen to this. 
I saw 'Blair Witch', and thought that it was a fine bit of filmmaking.  It told it's story well, the performances were adequate, and the film was interesting visually.However.This film almost seems to rip it's plot element-for-element from another independent mock-documentary entitled, 'The Last Broadcast' releasedlast year.  That story also involved a group of filmmakers who went out into the woods to shoot a documentary and were mysteriously murdered.  The film also made liberal use of 'documentary' footage taken from video cameras to tell it's story.  The problem is that 'Last Broadcast' was filmed and released nearly a full year before 'Blair Witch'.  In my opinion, 'Blair Witch' is both a blatant rip-off of the same essential plot and construction used for 'Last Broadcast', and that irks me.What irks me more is the fact that so many people have said over and over again just how 'original and inventive' this film is.  I thought 'Blair Witch' was merely adequate.  Where 'Last Broadcast' was thoughtful and sneaky in it's approach, 'Blair Witch' is loud and obvious.  I found many of the visuals used in 'Blair Witch' to be remarkably similar to those used in 'Last Broadcast', to the point where 'Blair Witch' almost seems like a sequel or spin-off.In the end, there will be many copies of 'Blair Witch' released by rival studios, trying to cash in on it's success.  But in my opinion, the producers of 'Blair Witch' cheated.  'Last Broadcast' stands as my favorite between these two nearly identical films.",2,0,2,5 August 1999
