Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Awful boring movie
","I walked out half an hour short of the end. The first movie was bloody, pointless and disturbing. But it was action packed and if you are into movies by this director then you may enjoy it.But this movie had three action scenes in the space of 2 hours. It was boring and drawn out with bad empty dialogue of no consequence.Once the bride gets to meet bill - and he starts telling her a story about her daughter - reality is completely suspended - the plot is thrown out the window and the movie (for me) gave it's last gasp.This movie is rubbish and I recommend that no-one sees it. It is neither entertaining, interesting or thought provoking.",Null,2,3,1 May 2004
