The Blair Witch Project," Quite 'Simply' Brilliant
","Yeah, yeah, heard enough hype yet?Were you depressed by 'Phantom Menace'? Did 'Hannibal' make you squirm--because it was so goofy?I guess third time's a charm.'Blair Witch' is an amazingly successful film, and one that I had high expectations for (given the LOADS of hype, who wouldn't?). All of my hopes were destined to fall. And dammit, they didn't. Not one bit. This movie is terrifying.All of the actors are AMAZINGLY convincing. I guess that's becasue they're not acting, or at least not in the Hollywood sense, they're honestly being messed with in the middle of nowhere in the still of night, so the reactions are real. In fact, the only fault I could find is the absence of total wackaloon freakouts. (I probably would have hit myself in the head with a heavy tree limb repeatedly until I calmed down or passed out).One word of advice: If you are the type of person who equates 'scary' with 'gore', or are a HUGE fan of 'Scream' (you know, the nod-and-a-wink film that so many folks thought was sooo good) you will NOT like this film. No gore, no maniac with a knife, and no nudity. 'Dernit, ah guess they dinnit haf enuff munny to get that Heather chick to skimper down to 'er undies. Nuttin like a nekkid chick about to giddit'<-- If this is you, stay away. This movie qualifies as art, and not everyone likes art. (How much has 'Big Daddy' made?).However, if you enjoy good, tense, and damn frightening films (or have never seen one) line up...it pays off in spades.Happy camping.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
