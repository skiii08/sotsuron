Blade Runner 2049," Intense
","One of the best-waited sequel ever, the action, the adventure and of course the legendary star Ryan Gosling at its best along with Harrison Ford. Ryan Gosling is as bad ass his coat now popular as the Blade runner 2049 Ryan Gosling coat with shearling inside. Seen a lot of people wearing it while watching the movie. The movie rated 'R' and I think a new sequel will be there as well",10,3,15,6 October 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Intense
","One of the best movies I have had the chance to watch a movie and enjoy it. The cast, the acting and above all the story line was phenomenal. The producer and the directors must get a heads up for writing such a great story, so realistic and dramatic that I watched it twice.This is a much watch movie for every adult and I guarantee the suspense and end of the movie will shock you",10,0,0,11 July 2017
