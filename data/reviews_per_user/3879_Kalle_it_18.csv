Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Politically incorrect doesn't equal smart
","Borat is by far the worst piece of cinema (and I use the word VERY loosely) I've ever had the misfortune of watching.The 'movie' is basically a sequence of candid cameras and pranks made at the expenses of unaware people who are trying to deal, in good faith, with Borat's over-the-top antics.Not only the whole thing is overly mean, but it's also brutally disgusting, disrespecting, raunchy and racist.Cohen uses the 'Kazakhstan' excuse as a way to 'expose' America's racism and ignorance, while in reality most of the persons he meets and makes fun of are genuinely polite to the unorthodox foreigner.It's just when Borat gets really really really annoying or rude, they react.But Cohen's agenda, i.e. exposing the 'good' Americans for what they are, fails miserably. In the end Borat-Cohen looks like the biggest tool in the movie. Not even the drunk frat-boys can make us forget it's all a dirty trick.A weird foreigner you don't know is talking trash about women/random ethnicity, what would YOU do? Would you confront him or you would just stand in puzzled silence, letting him utter his incoherent rants? No, really... not even the most progressist mind would embark himself in an actual debate with a man like Borat. But of course those who didn't in the movie are racists or whatever we're supposed to label them.Borat is the epitome of reversed racism, something that has become very hip lately. The poor excuse of 'social enlightening' doesn't hold. The movie is cheap and nasty under every possible aspect. Sugarcoating it with a thin layer of (non-existent) social criticism is giving it a role and a dignity it doesn't deserve.Borat is an appalling and sanctimonious 'smart movie', who'll be appreciated either by toilet-humour fans and by those who crave so much being hip and cool who'll like anything that rides the coattail of the hypocritical 'America is evil!' movement.",1,5,9,2 December 2009
The Hangover," Awful beyond words
","I'm astonished by the high ratings and the positive feedback this movie has been getting. The characters are unlikeable, childish and brash while still remaining painfully uninteresting and generic. Their drunken adventures are so over the top you can't help but shaking your head and wonder what the writers and the producers were on when they green-lighted such a mess of a movie. I mean, we expect outlandish adventures from four drunken guys in Vegas, but what they go through in the movie is so ridiculous it requires an insane amount of suspension of disbelief to vaguely buy into the possibility of such events happening.Or are we supposed to believe you can pretty much thrash a very expensive suite at the Ceasar's Palace without getting caught? Nobody asked questions about the bed on the roof? And since when can you sneak a freaking TIGER in and out of a luxury hotel without anyone noticing? Not to mention the stolen police car and the ludicrous taser scene.But all those loopholes could have been forgiven had the movie been genuinely funny. Instead it was a predictable sequence of trite gags and jokes so old even your 9-years-old cousin has already heard them before. The only 'first' in the movie is the cringeworthy baby-is-masturbating gag, repeated TWICE in case you missed it the first time or didn't find it offensive enough. Stay classy!The characters have no redeeming qualities so there's no empathy and it's really hard to care about them finding the missing friend, making it back to the wedding or dying in the middle of the desert.A special mention to Zach Galifianakis'es character: seriously, the moronic and awkward man-child isn't funny, it's just annoying. The fascination Hollywood has with such character is baffling, although probably it represents a fair portion of the core audience for unfunny and inane flicks like The Hangover.Bottom line: if you're not into low-quality 4th grade toilet humour and/or into road trips involving adults with a mental age lower than their shoe size just avoid this movie.Or use it as the measuring stick for your friends' skills in movie-recommending. If some of them speaks highly of The Hangover never follow his advice about another movie. Ever.",1,8,17,10 December 2011
Ghost," A very poorly aged 'Ghost'
","What we have here is another 'modern classic' which looked much better when it came out, but failed to stand the test of time. Or probably it depends on the age of the audience, who knows...Anyway, 'Ghost' is a rather long and predictable story about supernatural love and vengeance from the grave. However the best part of the movie is what was probably meant as comedy relief, to build up the tension for the romantic moments.It's not a good sign when the secondary plot takes the cake, relegating the core of the story to a role of pretty-but-shallow dressing.Furthermore, the 'mysterious killer' story was so predictable it ruined whatever interest it might have had.And the love story, sorry, but I just couldn't find a good reason to care about Sam & Molly... Who are they? Why were they in love to the point of getting involved in a threesome with a potter-wheel?'Ghost', as a love story, falls short in terms of characters' development. As a murder story is too predictable. So it's at its best as a comedy. Not totally intentional I suppose.Whoopi Goldberg as the charlatan-medium is really funny, and she manages to give some depth to an otherwise stereotypical 'fat black woman'. And Oda Mae is the best character of the movie, by a mile, just to underline how poor the effort in character creation was.The production is fine, and the script paved the way to a plethora of 'romantic dramas' and 'romantic comedies' in the following decades.To this day, 'Ghost' enjoys a vast popularity, despite its obvious shortcomings. A tribute to the smart people behind the movie, or to the gullibility of the public, always ready to reach for a Kleenex at the first hint of a troubled. yet formulaic, love story?Either way, 'Ghost' looks good but tastes worse at every further screening.",4,4,10,2 January 2010
Hostel," Justified 'hostelity'
","I can totally understand all the negative reactions Hostel has received.The idea behind the movie is just half-good, and for sure nothing revolutionary... It could have been developed much better, but the premise, and the whole unfolding of it, are still deeply rooted in the land of horror/slasher cliché.But well, in all honesty, a good movie (whatever its genre) doesn't necessarily need to be groundbreaking or innovative to be good. There are many 'predictable' movies which are good, okay or just enjoyable for what they are.Sadly, Hostel fails on that ground too. Let's see how.1) DULL PLOT: Horny teenagers looking for sex end up in a creepy God forsaken town and get kidnapped and tortured by some sick rich bastards. Wow, color me surprised...2) CARDBOARD CUT-OUT CHARACTERS: As if the plot wasn't predictable enough, the characters are so unidimensional it's impossible to empathize with them. And even the bad guys are left at the typical 'evil for the sake of it' state. Just one, the wannabe surgeon, is given some sort of weak personality and 'reason' for his violence.3) PLOT HOLES GALORE: Sure, it's just a movie, but for a movie which claims to be a true(ish) story, there are just too many plot holes and weak/inconsistent events.* Let's follow this creepy stranger's advice and leave Amsterdam to go find a fabulous brothel in the middle of Nowhere, Slovakia. Urban Legen anyone?* The brothel exists indeed, it looks more like a 4 Stars Hotel and it's filled with Centerfold Material who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, for free... In the middle of Slovakian wasteland. No, not suspicious at all.* A seasoned slaughter apparently can't handle a chainsaw, or stand on a vomit-wet floor.* No, severed fingers won't be hindering your escape from the 'fortress', and you'll look good enough to fool one of the Elite Hunters...* The bad guys will allow you to escape, with an unknown Asian girl at tow (real heroes don't leave alone), without putting up much of a fight... If I was an Elite Hunter, I'd fill a complaint... For that kind of money, I'd expect a better security service!* A semi-disfigured girl walking around won't draw attention on you.* And most important, even with some fingers missing, you won't bleed to death, faint, or experience the slightest distress. And will have enough strength to kill your torturer, after a nice train trip.5) EURO STEREOTYPE: So, according to this movie, Afghanistan is Disneyland compared to 'Slovakia'. I don't care if it was a tongue-in-the-cheek portrait of what many Americans think of Eastern Europe... Beautiful women who'll sleep do anyone for a drink, poverty and violence on the streets of dull, grey towns, crooked police, evil foreigners (better if half-Nazis) using the place as a private playground... That idea of Eastern European countries is outdated by like 25 years...I'll stop there, as such a disaster of a movie doesn't deserve more attention.Awful plot, awful execution, passable-at-best for the 15 minutes of torture. But not even some decently shot torture scenes can salvage such a train-wreck.1/10, just because it wasn't possible giving it a lower score",1,2,4,12 November 2009
Dead Poets Society," A corny teen melodrama passed off as a masterpiece...
","I loved Dead Poets Society. When I was 14...Professor Keating looked indeed cool and awesome, the poor kids suffocated by the gloomy and dull school, the frustrated ambitions and the unfulfilled dreams and so on.Which teenager hasn't dreamt about writing immortal poetry, about having a cool unorthodox teacher, about pursuing his (childish) projects?The problem with Dead Poets Society lies right there... It's not a deep and insightful movie about teacher-pupils relationship, it's not even a pedagogical movie, it's just a long and plodding teen drama, pandering to an audience of angsty teenagers and angsty parents.Professor Keating is a fairytale teacher who would and should be kicked out of any school on Earth. Public or preppy, it doesn't matter.For starters, encouraging to rip some pages off a book just because the teacher doesn't agree with the writer's ideas is not 'good teaching', let alone 'encouraging free-thought'.Some would call it fascism, I'll just call it ignorance and arrogance. Even assuming the theory is ridiculous (and I really wonder if such a 'mathematic approach to poetry' really existed), who does Keating think he is to dismiss a published, and supposedly widely accepted, critical system?But let's just pretend it's totally fair game having an unknown teacher, or a well-known troublemaker if you wish, trashing decades of teaching/critical theories... The awfulness of the movie doesn't end with that.Professor Keating isn't teaching a thing. He's just messing with the kids' heads, with the poor excuse of 'living poetry' and 'expressing themselves'. How THAT will make the kids pass the class of English Literature is beyond me.Not to mention the fact the teenagers eat up whatever cheesy 'romantic' drivel they get fed by their Mentor, thus leading to tragedy... Suicide, the cheapest way to garner sympathy for a mono-dimensional character. A suicide that has little ground to stand on, and that seems like a random tool to trigger the even cheaper final.Poor enlightened Keating must leave the school, and his loyal pupils will just salute him with an emphatic yet empty gesture.Just empty, formulaic and corny like the whole movie. The whole movie is basically a cheesy teen melodrama, something that could have been written or recycled for a TV Serial like 90210 or the O.C. The only difference is this movie got Robin Williams and a couple of sappy catchphrases.Actually the catchphrases are the common thread of Dead Poets Society, the most 'memorable' and dramatic moments involve a catchphrase... Just like slapstick comedy and teen flicks. Or pro-wrestling...Dead Poets Society is cheap Hollywood neo-romanticism for teenagers and adults who are teens at heart, or for conformist anti-conformists.The basic idea could have been developed in a much better and more delicate way, but Hollywood just can't help but going full gas with Manichean stereotypes and situations. Thanks to that, we got a very overrated 'masterpiece' filled with cheap sentimentalism and dime-a-dozen 'thought-provoking' situations.Horace is rolling in his cold grave hearing his Carpe Diem being tossed around in such a trivial manner.Carpe Diem doesn't mean 'do whatever stupid thing you want to', but more like 'enjoy what you have now, because you don't know what the future holds'Quite frankly, the suicide goes AGAINST Carpe Diem... The kid kills himself because his (stereotyped) dad doesn't want him to act in a play, so BANG! While the Carpe Diem philosophy would have had the kid to enjoy every second his stint as high school actor, for how long as it would have lasted.But I'm aware I'm expecting too much from Hollywood...",3,13,29,27 December 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Gimmicky 'masterpiece'
","Had it been a man-woman love story, it would have been labeled as a boring and predictable TV-movie. But since it was about 'gay cowboys', and the director was Ang Lee and not some random guy, Brokeback Mountain got the immediate Masterpiece status.Let me get this straight (pun intended): it's NOT a movie about homosexuality, coming out or same-sex relationship.The whole 'gay' theme is an excuse, a gimmick if you will.Honestly, for being homosexuals, both Jack and Ennis did get more than enough (female) tail. Are we supposed to believe they could live a lie for 350 days a year, just being the real them in the one occasion they went 'fishing' together? For all those years?Sorry, I don't buy it for one second.Brokeback Mountain uses the homosexuality like a promotional tool, while in the movie itself the issue almost gets treated like a secondary topic.Moreso: the sexual intercourse takes place early in the movie, so the cat is out of the bag when there's still plenty of time and the rest of the movie is devoted to a dragging and tiresome hide-and-seek game which has really no reason to be... They are attracted to each other, we KNOW that... And if that wasn't bad enough, the characters have a rather sloppy psychological evolution, if any.Since they pretty much pretended to be straight, getting married and having kids, the dramatic tension goes out of the window. Even the 'revelation' to the wife is, at that point, sterile.I'll gracefully gloss over the melodramatic ending.So in the end Brokeback Mountain suffers from the typical 'much ado about nothing' syndrome. The allegedly shocking topic gets treated in a very stereotypical way and doesn't even get developed like it could have been. The rest of the movie is visually pleasant, but too glossy. The acting ranges from overdriven to just fine, surely nowhere near Oscar material.My final impression was Ennis and Jack weren't more gay than J.D. and Turk from 'Scrubs'... It was just a very deep bond, with the occasional 'episode' of homosexual intercourse. But hardly a revolutionary take on same-sex love.Those who hailed Brokeback Mountain as a milestone for the movie industry and as a milestone for homosexuality awareness either didn't watch the movie, or just wanted it to be so and didn't bother to actually see if it was the case or not.A wasted occasion, because the basic idea had so much potential. Too bad they took the cheap way.",3,2,17,2 December 2009
Orphan," A pleasantly disturbing surprise
","I have to admit it, I was a bit skeptical about Orphan, as it had written 'formulaic evil-kid movie' all over it.Instead I have to eat my words, and give credit when credit is due. And lots of it actually.The plot is standard enough: a couple decide to adopt a child after the tragic death of their unborn kid. They go for an older kid, and choose Esther, a charming-yet-odd girl.Esther comes into the movie like many other 'devilish kids' we've seen before: gentle and condescending, but already with a little bit of darkness showing through. Things start to get worse (for the family, but better for the audience) when Ester 'settles down' at her new place. The interesting conflict with her new Mom is well-played and makes us really uncomfortable when it appears clear (to us at least) that the little girl is playing dirty. Everything is well-executed, and most important, well acted.The swerve is really good (not 100% new, but still head and shoulders better than most of what we had to sit through recently) and caught me off-guard.The finale, however, is a bit of a letdown, as it goes back to Final Struggle 101. We can't always win...All in all, Orphan is very enjoyable, and Esther (the character and the young actress) is a joy to watch: adorable, creepy or downright scary with no drop in her performance. Also, the rest of the cast worked pretty well, kids included (actually Aryana Engineer, the little sister Max, is very impressive too).As said, the plot is solid, with some peaks, and even the lows are much more than okay in the big picture.Esther gave me the creeps and made me highly uncomfortable, something that very few characters (or movies) had managed to do in recent times. And all that without needing a truckload of fake blood and bowels.Someone in Hollywood should take notes.P.S. If Isabelle Fuhrman doesn't fall victim of the usual 'Trobled Teenage Star' syndrome, we might have found a top-flight actress for the future.",8,2,3,12 November 2009
Juno," Your typical 'oh-so-smart' indie movie
","Juno suffers from the very typical 'indie movie syndrome'.Obscure and outdated pop-culture references, over-the-top jargon, smartass and typical characters...The 'aren't we cool, eh?' vibe can be felt throughout the whole movie, while the story itself ends up being little more than a platform where to build a mountain of self-referential jokes.Also I have severe reservations on Juno herself...The wise-cracking, anti-conformist 16 years old Juno is supposed to be smart to the point of being obnoxiously smart, yet she gets pregnant with the blissful idiocy of your random airhead bimbo.And here lies my main issue with the movie... Juno isn't a realistic portrait of a teenager. Juno talks and acts in a way which is just not the way a 16 years old would talk and act.It's quite easy seeing through her and finding her character is a projection of the screenwriter's ideas and thoughts. Also the pop-culture references are out of context and clearly out of Juno's time.Juno is not a realistic, cool-anti-conformist teenager, she's how the screenwriter thinks a cool and anti-conformist teenager should be.The rest of the characters are off the same mould. The ditzy friend, the awkward-yet-supportive family, the oblivious boyfriend, the rich-but-unhappy couple..It's a shame, because the topic and the story itself had potential, but the excess of witty self-complacency killed the movie, basically making it some sort of CollegeHumor project.Underage pregnancy, abortion, adoption, single parenting and immature adults are topics that deserved a better and more insightful development.Instead Juno treats her pregnancy as if it was just a severe case of excessive gas... Annoying yes, but a goldmine for jokes and odd situations. Once the burden is disposed of (be it by abortion or adoption) let's just carry on as if nothing ever happened.A final note, of course she could NOT find a normal family to give her child to... It just had to be an odd couple of a fretful woman and a man-child. A man-child who is into the same things Juno is (shame he was actually ALIVE to remember them, while Juno has apparently spent years on OldFads.com) and the presence of the young girl triggers his midlife crisis.All in all Juno fails because it's unrealistic, clichÃ© and smug. None of the characters are endearing due to the excess of 'smartassery'.Passable at best, clearly not worth all the hype.Also I bet it'll age horribly and in a matter of few years nobody will get the majority of the references",5,2,6,19 April 2010
Zodiac," Based on a true story, for good or for worse
","After millions of thrillers and horrors based on 'true' stories, we got Zodiac, which is indeed based on an actual serial killer.That's a huge plus for a thriller, and knowing the murders were real adds a lot to the psychological tension of the movie, and it helps keeping the curiosity high also during the long and drawing investigation.The obvious downside is there's little room for embellishments and hoopla, and that, at times, goes to the detriment of the rhythm and of the narrative tension.Zodiac is more like a movie about the investigation than about the serial killer himself, so it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's not meant to make you jump on your seat, it's meant to make you uncomfortable on a much deeper level. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, of course.",7,0,0,30 November 2009
Forrest Gump," Repulsively cheesy
","So... a guy with an IQ of 75 is the man behind pretty much every important event in American History from the 60s onwards? And all of that while being blissfully UNAWARE of that? Please... I would have almost bought it, had it been a comedy, or a parody.But Forrest Gump is damn serious, or at least it looks like everybody took seriously that stinking pile of feel-good garbage and its cheap message.I even fail to see a clear political agenda in that god-awful movie: it somehow manages to reunite both right and left-wing, with its glorification of America and of the American Dream achieved by the walking stereotype of leftist self-righteous and hypocritical egalitarianism.But regardless of its alleged political orientation, Forrest Gump is a cheap collage of implausible situations, a far-fetched melodramatic story about a man who got lucky and didn't even understand it.Honestly, instead of heartwarming and touching, I found Forrest Gump utterly revolting.",2,2,10,30 November 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Pseudo-smart pretentiousness at its worst
","In one word: baffling.Little Miss Sunshine manages to present almost every stereotype of the 'hip' indie-intellectual film-making scene.The major flaw is that such approach could work on two directions: either the dark-humored drama or the full-fledged, over the top farce.Unfortunately LMS fails to pick a path, and instead keeps on going back and forth from a serious, almost pompous, mood to a campy tone.The Dysfunctional Family trope is brought to the limit and beyond already in the opening phase of the movie. Too bad there isn't enough depth to any of the family members to connect with the audience.The whole premise of the movie is so unrealistic you really wonder for a while if the whole thing is supposed to be taken seriously or if you're actually gonna see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson popping up in the following scene. A pudgy little girl wants to be at a Pageant in California, so the whole dysfunctional family is gonna drive hundreds of miles (in a Hippie Van, of all vehicles...) just because the kid wants so... I learn now it's just a matter of WANTING to take part to a pageant then... no casting, no preliminary selections... Just show up (late) and you're in! Also, every decision the family makes on the road leads to more silly shenanigans, as if they're actively trying to make the trip (and the movie) longer.Let's not forget, as a side-note, that every subplot ends up being meaningless, or so bland it could have been left out with no major damage to the main plot.Oh, I'll gracefully gloss over the actual pageant show and the 'moves' the little girl has been taught, behind closed doors, by her drug-'n'-porn addicted grandfather...What happened to American's infamous prudery? How comes Chris Hansen and his 'why don't you get a seat over there?' jokes didn't flood the net and/or the theaters? If it's beauty pageants it's OK enjoying little girls strutting and acting like kinky adult women? Go figure... America must definitely be a funny place...And before someone chimes in 'ohhh but it was soooooo ironic, it was meant to denounce and ridicule it! You didn't get it?', I say no, sorry, the irony got lost in the mix, and died when the girl was dancing like a stripper, while her family was enjoying it.In the end the message is pretty clear and clichè... 'We are dysfunctional but we love each other. We aren't rich and successful but we're REAL!' This has been done before, and better.Also the wacky family road trip has been done better and more funnily before.Little Miss Sunshine brings nothing new to the table, probably not even the shock value, because in the end there's little to be shocked about. The dominant reaction to it is bemusement, not disgust.The movie is not funny, not insightful, not enjoyable in any way.I suspect it's another of those 'cool movies' you just have to pretend you liked and 'got' so you can act all smart and 'with it'.Quite frankly I don't care if I'm not cool or smart enough.. Little Miss Sunshine is an over-hyped piece of intellectualoid drivel; tame drivel to be brutally honest.",1,21,41,1 April 2010
American History X," How to ruin a good movie
","Why can't we have good things?Easy: because every Hollywood movie MUST be, or become, preachy and cheesy at one point or another...AHX had potential, and lots of it. Edward Norton once again delivers a great performance, and the whole cast is above average too.The story, as it unfolds, is interesting and intriguing. Even the somewhat stereotyped 'nazis' work quite well in the general flow of the movie. All in all the story holds up quite well until Derek comes home from jail.There it is: our turning point: the movie quickly becomes painfully predictable: thanks to a rape in the showers, to a clichéd 'friendly African-American inmate unjustly convicted' and to his old professor's (African-American himself too...) Derek suddenly sees the light and turns his back to his old friends and ideals.Of course Derek's redemption has a huge influence on his younger brother Danny, but sadly his fate is written already...Essentially American History X is a movie of two halves: the first part is enjoyable and outstanding, despite some predictable twists. The second part is preachy and even more predictable, so the redemption-through-death ending doesn't come as a surprise, but more like as a consequence.To be honest, the whole movie is filled with clichés and stereotypes: Derek's dad is the typical narrow-minded WASP, the White Power guys are complete morons with zero depth (which might be realistic, but come on... show some imagination). The positive characters are African-American, and of course we can't go without the token Jewish character and the liberal one getting unfairly abused.Even disregarding that aspect, Derek seems to joins and leaves the White Power crusade too abruptly and with little-to-none inner labour.THAT, much more than the cheesy and predictable twists, is the most disappointing aspect of a movie which could and should have been more complex.But, as said, the movie industry is manichean: things are either good or bad, black or white. Layers of grey aren't welcome.",7,6,10,30 November 2009
Green Street Hooligans," Hoolligans: the soap opera
","The movie get so many things wrong or depicts them in such a hackneyed way it's hard to take it seriously or to fathom where all the raving reviews came from.Apparently one of the most violent firms in English football have no qualms about letting in a preppy American student with zero credentials and negative knowledge about football...But that's fine, because those hooligans aren't terrible people when not dealing with football... One of them is an airline pilot, another one has the odd position of History AND P.E. teacher at a primary school (unrelated subjects, but go figure... those pesky London schools) and he's even allowed to have random strangers play with/give lectures to his kids...Alas, all good things come to an end when the jealous henchman decides it's time to betray his pals and strikes a deal (for what?) with the leader of their/his fiercest and most deranged rivals... Things take a turn for the worse, the traitor has another change of heart and comes back for the save.Frodo can now go back to the U.S., a tougher man, but also more mature and fair, because that's the lesson he learned while bonding with a bunch of friendly psychopaths in London.Last, but surely not least, the hooligans scene depicted in the movie would have vaguely been credible in the mid 80s, with the bleak neighbourhoods, the stereotypical 'working class England' setting and, mainly, the complete absence of stadium security that has been enforced since English Football has become a multi-millionaire business that can't be disrupted by a bunch of maladjusted thugs.P.S. The scene where one of the GSE mocks the rival fans on the pitch dressed as a steward (or being one?!) sums it up pretty well... In contemporary football you couldn't pull it off, not even on the crappiest amateur field, let alone at a Premier League game. You'd not even get close to the stands and you'd be filmed by security cameras from 10 different angles. And no more stadium for you... But apparently the movie takes place in an alternate dimension where no such things exist.",3,1,2,5 March 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Style and pretense over substance... typical intellectualoid movie
","The premise was intriguing and it offered plenty of viable developments. Unfortunately we get treated to a somewhat predictable 'the beginning is the end, the end is the beginning' circular flashback story arch, already seen in Memento (now that was a great movie) and Irreversible, just to name a few.Things start to go south, fast, as soon as the whole erasing process, something that is supposed to be very advanced procedure, is treated and handled with the same secrecy, care and professionalism college students put into cleaning porn-infected computers... A half-assed side-activity than can be performed everywhere, while doing something more fun in the meantime. Seriously, such a life-altering procedure is performed at the patient's place by two creepy guys? And the security of the records is so sloppy a receptionist can go ahead and mail them to the patient who are supposed to forget about the whole thing?That's simply preposterous, a poorly thought-out 'deus ex machina' that has no place in an alleged cinematic masterpiece.Not to mention the outcome of the whole love story... Despite finding out they had already met, loved and erased each other, Joel and Clementine STILL decide to give themselves another chance.I don't know about you, but I wouldn't really get into a relationship with a girl who thinks I'm a wimpy and boring loser who'll made her loathe herself after a while. Nor I would like to date a girl who I find obnoxious, sad and a bit slutty too.Does the movie try to convey (shove down our throats rather..) a message of hope? Or is it just hopeless stubbornness? A faux 'happy ending' just because it would have been rude sending the audience home without some sort of closure?Joel and Clementine basically wasted two years of their life... we got away with losing just two hours... Unfortunately we can remember the movie. So it's debatable who drew the shortest straw here ;)'Eternal Sunshine' is the typical intellectualoid movie, with a good, but underdeveloped, idea behind it but also with too much quirkiness to actually work. Visually it's pleasant and well done, capturing the disorientation induced by the dreamy sequences, acting is OK...Cinematically it's 'spotless', but as for the story arch it's definitely 'plotless'.",6,3,6,15 April 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Simply appalling
","I just can't get how such a train-wreck of a movie could get produced, let alone win an Oscar.Roberto Benigni used to be a decent comedian, often over-the-top and politically incorrect to the bone. But he was okay and had some enjoyable comedies under his belt.Then, somehow somewhat, he was given the role of Cinamatic Genius and was led to believe he could write and produce whatever piece of outrageous cinema he wanted, because he was so damn good, funny and witty.Sadly, Life is Beautiful is a comedy about the Holocaust.Sure, not about The Holocaust, but about a father and son getting swallowed by the Nazis death machine. But the 'familiar' dimension of the tragedy shouldn't be a poor excuse for getting away with poorly written slapstick comedy about lotteries, birthday parties, riddles and romantic liaisons.The 'concentration camp' looks more like a Fat Kids Summer Camp, considering the relative freedom of movement, and the convenient presence of the female camp nearby, allowing the corny 'Buongiorno Principessa' episode.The Nazis look like brain-dead tools who talk a scary language and don't understand Benigni making fun of them (while that alone would have granted death on the spot, but hey... it's a COMEDY!!!). Italian fascists instead are the stereotypical self-important buffoons who were even too inept to be considered scary.The message of the movie, whatever it is, gets lost in a sea of cheap comedy in a frighteningly misplaced location.Is it supposed to be sweet, touchy, emotional and even funny? To me it was just painful, disrespectful and unfunny (even ignoring the absurdity of the situation).Last but not least, Benigni spoofing Chaplin is the craptacular icing on an equally shitty cake of a movie.The fact Benigni got an Oscar, worldwide recognition and domestic superstardom is a clear sign of how sheepish the movie industry is... Some topics just scream 'Oscar-bait', and sure Holocaust is one of them.Sadly, Benigni had to take a different route to get to the same goal.",4,1,7,30 November 2009
The Wrestler," Gracefully sad
","Quite honestly, I don't get all the criticism...The Wrestler isn't supposed to be your typical 'from riches to rags to riches again' Hollywood feel-good movie you rent for a cozy night at home.The Ram is NOT Rocky, or at least not the cheesy Rocky from the second movie onwards.Randy Robinson is indeed a washed-up wrestling superstar who has seen his star rise and fade away, without being able to prepare himself for the 'retirement'. So he's broke and broken, works in a grocery and still accepts independent booking, for those who still remember him.His life is a sad and constant trip down memory lane, with little hope. Not even the newfound bond with a stripper and the booking for a nostalgia rematch won't turn the tide.'Nothing happens' because for a man like Randy nothing could happen in real life. Despite that, he still refuses to give up, because he can't and because he doesn't want. And when he realizes he's close to the end of the rope, he embraces his fate.Rourke was the ideal actor for such a character, in some sort of 'reality meets fiction' capacity. And surely he delivered, to the point you often struggle to separate Randy from Mickey. Marisa Tomei works fine too, with a relatively easy and plain role.The Wrestler isn't a cheap comedy about a difficult but glorious comeback, it isn't even a sappy drama where everything goes wrong for the sake of tearjerking.The Wrestler is a graceful depiction of how a man can end up being a failure, but a failure with dignity.Randy Robinson is a tragic character and a titanic figure: a man who succumbs to his destiny because he has no other choice, but goes out with his head up.",8,0,0,2 December 2009
The Breakfast Club," The cliché club - an overrated high-school drama
","The Breakfast club is still inexplicably kept in high esteem by many, likely due to the ever so present nostalgia factor. Or to bad taste in movies, I suspect.There isn't much to say about a collection of every stereotype about teenagers and high-school known to man.A gallery of stock characters talks about standard angst-ridden topics that in such movies are 100x more serious and important than they are in real life. And as if the premise and the 'development' (I use the term very very loosely, as there's no remarkable character progression) weren't sloppy enough, we get the sudden pseudo-feelgood finale, which makes even less sense in context.The ending is baffling because it implies a new scenario which is impossible because the few changes the characters went through were literally cosmetic, and the whole conflict between social expectations and actual personalities wasn't resolved! And how could it be resolved, when the 'characters' are paper-thin and basically are what they are?! As the saying goes, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck!So, the Breakfast club has nothing interesting to offer besides a cookie-cutter teen dramedy with bland characters and a lame ending that sort of makes the whole story arc pointless.Watch only for nostalgia value. A concept that is lost on a non-American guy who, luckily, didn't have to deal with school-sanctioned sports, proms, clubs etc. Friends and 'enemies' were chosen by affinity, or lack thereof, not by predetermined categories.",2,14,24,1 August 2016
The Island," First half okay, second half terrible
","The Island could have been a good flick.The dystopian setting of the first part of the movie was actually quite good, and looked promising. Sadly as soon as the two clones arrive on the surface (and are surprisingly smart and comfortable in the real world they had never seen before), the movie goes downhill so fast and so badly you almost wonder if it's the same movie, or if they just put the final part of another one.From a somewhat disturbing and intriguing dystopian set to a bombastic action movie in the blink of an eye, with very little psychological development and too much mindless action.Once again, a wasted chance and a wasted half-good (yet not entirely new, to put it mildly) plot.But in truth when the director is Michael Bay, what else could we expect? He would have managed to turn 1984 into a car-chase, explosions-filled piece of shiny crap...The Island is not a terrible movie, but surely disappointing considering the premise, the development and the ending.",4,1,3,28 December 2009
