The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Electrifying
","Mockingjay pt. 1 was simply amazing. I really don't go know how to describe it. The acting was perfect. You can feel the emotions in every scene. I'm not saying all this because I'm a fangirl, I'm saying this because it's the truth. Ignore all the bad reviews, those people obviously haven't read the books. I would greatly suggest that you do read the books before seeing the movie. Or at least watch The Hunger Games and Catching Fire before you see it. Every scene was exactly how I pictured it when I read the book! If you thought Catching Fire was violent wait until you see Peeta try and kill Katniss. I'd also like to point out, through the movie Peeta has interviews with Ceased Flickerman as they go on he gradually gets worse. He becomes skinny and paranoid and Josh Hutcherson's acting was gold. Also one of Jennifer Lawrence's best performances. This movie just brings so much emotion. Its intense, riveting, and heartbreaking. It's amazing. Stop what you're doing right know and go see this movie!!!",10,34,81,24 November 2014
