Scarface," This Is Why The Plot Makes No Sense.
",OK So Tonys life is going bad when he gets arrested right? Facing Jail...Then a Miracle Happens. Sosa tells him he can avoid jail but just driving around some Frenchmen who Aleady planted the bomb under some guys car and Is the one who pushes the button... You would think that a guy like Tony Montanna who boasts about taking in 20 million a month could have just had one of his minions drive the car with the french dude around 1st Ave in Manhattan. All His Proplems Would Be Solved. But then after the meeting with Sosa we see a depressed drunk Tony in a Restaurant acting as if his entire empire is ruined. You would think that he'd be having a party about his good fortune. But No...he messes up the Frenchmens hit.(and his skull) then he stops off to kill his best friend and Then tells Sosa to screw off. Makes no sense...Things were going well for the guy..,Null,0,3,27 March 2008
