Hereditary," Pretentious 'horror' movie
","You can just forget the fact that I have a degree in fine arts at this point, I'm a humble person who feels bad when people praise me for my many talents that they can only dream of reifying. Let's just pretend that you have a brain, *wink *wink ;) - Some youtuber named ThE StEVe, December 16, 2018,(This account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube's policy on nudity or sexual content.)Nice cinematography but a pretentious horror movie, the acting was great but yeah that's about it.Wanna know why the Nun, which is considered to be a worse film than this 'Oscar worthy' film, grossed more than this? When you watch this from start to finish and paid good money then ended that way like every other horror film made nowadays, its like making fools of the audiences who paid to see your film. On the Nun well, critics bash it yet the audience still went to see it and got exactly what they came for, their money's worth. Not saying the Nun is a good film but atleast you won't get BORED unlike this film.",6,6,9,9 September 2019
