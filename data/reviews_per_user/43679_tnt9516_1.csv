The Lobster," Simply terrible!
","This is one of the worst pieces of crap that I have ever endured! I watched the entire movie and anything after the first ten minutes was merely hoping that the next painful minute would be better than the last. And not once was it. I am no genius but I couldn't divine from the content how humanity had gotten to this point and I hope that it never does. I don't know if it is a alternate reality or different dimension. If it was supposed to be futuristic it isn't very distant as all of the vehicles in the city scenes were cars that are currently used with only slight modifications to look futuristic. The only redeeming value was a competent and respected cast, who I would have never dreamed would have participated in such a mess, which is what duped me into watching this from the get go.",1,22,34,11 January 2016
