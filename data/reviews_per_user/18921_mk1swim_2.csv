Mission: Impossible III," Well done J.J. Abrams!
","I just viewed this movie in Orlando after a fun filled day at MGM studios on a vacation. And as such, I would like to compare this MI3 to the Rockin' Roller Coaster. The ride begins going from 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds, and apparently, by the time you reach the first turn, the rider is experiencing 3 Gs. The ride is in the dark and you never know which way you are going to turn, and the only clues are the vivid neon lights every so often mimicking California scenery. I experienced vertigo. In the same way MI3 offers a new darker approach and is as fast from the beginning right until the end. There is no way to tell the good guys from the bad and the movie offers political commentary alluding to transitions made that the ends justify the means. Although the approach gives into every cliché of a thriller, how it is all put together is what makes the film refreshingly original. If one can suspend their own personal cynicism of what could conceivably happen in the real world, MI3 allows for a wild ride and is quite enjoyable. The only time to catch a breath during the film is the love story between Hunt and his Fiancé, which is a welcome element of choosing love over saving the world and trying to balance the two. While Cruse performs as... well eccentric and energetic as usual, although commanding, the supporting cast, writers, and director is to be applauded for giving the franchise a welcome element of surprise and a believable enigma of a puzzle for the viewer to solve. Well done J.J. Abrams!",7,2,4,5 May 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," On May 1st, I admit, I was the moron...
","I wrote a post a couple weeks ago titled 'On May 1st, you will all look like morons' or something to that effect. I did so because I had faith, mainly in Hugh and the supporting cast, and the director (and I refused to see the leaked version). The real tragedy of this movie, no doubt, is not only that some of the cast managed to squeak out solid performances -you could see them trying- but the audience is allowed to intuitively observe how much MORE they could have offered. Sadly, something fell apart along the way- be it the direction, editing, or screen writing.The editing and direction was so shabby, I literally felt as though I was watching an extended trailer- I might say that I've never experienced this before in the theater (maybe this is some sort of cinematic achievement on its own). Every time something was developing positivity (i.e. when Logan finds himself under the care of farmers, some development of Victor' character, or the initial encounter with Gambit) it just, well, fell apart.Why this movie is getting such poor reviews is not because its inherently bad- its actually pretty entertaining as a movie. Hugh Jackman IS wolverine, and he has a powerful and charismatic presence as the tormented logan (minus the awkward looking to the sky and screaming). Some surprises, action scenes (Wade and his blades), and dry humor along the way were well played. Its not that. Its not even because the fanboys are let down from a Hollywood egotistical departure from the rich comic characters (They are already developed- USE THEM!). Its because the average movie goer figures out along the way how great this movie should have been, how many missed opportunities there were, and how much more the characters could have been developed- we feel an implicit insult in the way this movie was packaged and delivered.Hopefully they do better next time around, Keep Hugh (and even Ryan Reynolds, I think if given the chance he would be great), get rid of the whole editing/direction/screen writing team (they may work well for other genres, just not this franchise), and go to Japan.",6,2,6,4 May 2009
