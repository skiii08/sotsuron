Miracle," Truly one a kind. You leave the theater with such a smile.
","Saw this movie last night at the sneak preview.  It was fantastic!  Even though the outcome was known, it didn't matter.  I was still sitting on the edge of my seat with chills going up my spine.  Not only is this a wonderful hockey movie, it is truly an amazing movie all around.  I would see it again and again.  It makes you proud of the U.S.A.",Null,0,0,1 February 2004
