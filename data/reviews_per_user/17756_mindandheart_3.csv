Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Not much change from part 1
","Well, their is not much different from part 1, the main star of Sherlock Holmes series from my point of view is the Directing and photography! the acting of all the movies stars are average but still i didn't like how fast Doctor Tomson acted like he totally forgot his wife , it was like he was a machine and as soon as the director clicked on a button he totally changed ! anyway the story and the act kept a little smile on my face all the time but still i never said WOHOOO, for me Sherlok Holmes a game of shadows was like a simple dinner, which i enjoyed a bit but was not a first class dinner with chicken or meat ! I think if they wanna keep this chain running, they must produce some real action, some speeding in the censes because it was so slow ! also i am sure that in the next part ppl will already be bored of the new techniques the director used for the camera ! so they really should think hard before making a new part !",6,1,1,25 December 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," from the best I saw Lately !
","first of all i am a big fan of TinTin so i already watched the movie while i knew the story, so of-course the story was great for me from the start ! but from the movie the Side the 3D was awesome ! of the best 3D i saw ever close to reach Avatar 3D and maybe passed it in some sense !, music was good but could be better! the flow of the action and sequence was as i Expected or even more, fast no time to take your breath the only thing i didn't like was the very BIG nose of every one, Hadok character had a big nose but not this big ! same for detectors ! if you are a big fan of TinTin then watch it you wont regret it, if u do not even know who in hell is Tin Tin then u will feel even better because you do not know the story ! anyway i think they will make a chain of movies after this one ! and for me i am going to attend them all !",9,2,7,6 November 2011
Rango," Well not bad, but I was hoping for much better
","Well, I have been waiting for a while for this movie, as soon as It reached Egypt finally , i watched it, The story is kinda nice, graphics is good and the Direction was prefect. but the Music was not this good, no sound track that have been caught by my ears and stayed their , also didn't like these Owls who are killing the story all the time. anyway over all it was a not bad movie, but i was really hoping for a much better one with using more tools from the main story, the main plot and idea is really rich and could give much more actions but its some how changed slowly for normal simple fight between clear evil and clear GOOD ! anyway i was also really hoping for more change in colors for the LIZARD :D",6,0,3,5 May 2011
