Casablanca," A true classic
","Casablanca shows the goodness of American freedom. The movie is set in a small town named Casablanca where Europeans would escape to get away from the turmoil of war during WWII. They would hopefully from there escape to America. This film has a little bit of everything. It has drama, comedy, and of course a love story to add a finishing touch to this great film. Humphrey Bogart who plays Rick Blaine is one of the star characters of this film. He did a great job portraying the cocky, yet sweet guy who is willing to help anybody. Just watching the film you would want to give him a huge hug. Ingrid Bergman plays Ilsa Laszlo. She is Rick's old flame she also did a great job. When the love story heats up between the two of them and they worked very well together. They had great on screen chemistry. It is not only the acting that makes this such a great picture, it is the script. It has the infamous phrases just as.. `Here's to looking at you, kid' and most likely you've heard this one.. `This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. It's phrases like that, that makes it such a classic. It is also a trendsetting movie. If it weren't for Casablanca there wouldn't be catchy phrases put into movies now. This film impacted America in many ways, not only for films and culture but also in music. The famous song `As time goes by' became popular from that movie and it is still popular today. It is definitely a movie to see.  This film truly describes Americana and there is no other word to describe this movie than classic and it always will be.",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
Citizen Kane," A symbolic film
","This is definitely a movie the viewer needs to pay attention to the whole time. The movie has a lot of depth and symbols throughout the whole story. This is the movie that started a lot of trends for other movies.This movie is believed to be based on the life of journalist William Hearst. The film starts out with a very dark scene, a castle on a hill, symbols throughout the whole scene, such as a sign saying `No Trespassing' which shows the character Charles Kane was a very private man. Then the scene shows Charles Kane played by Orson Wells dying in his bed with the last words of  `Rosebud'. The movie fallows his life by interviewing people who knew Kane and journalists trying to figure out the mystery of Rosebud.Orson Wells must have been so busy by directing , producing and starring in such a great film. Even though he was doing several jobs in this movie he still put out a great acting performance portraying an angry, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, lonely man. He made it very believable. Agnes Moorehead who played Kane's second wife  Mrs. Mary Kane did a great job at playing an annoying wife. The viewer watching this movie will most likely get annoyed watching her.The depth of this movie was amazing. It was very symbolic and artistic, which made you think. The special effects were also very well done, for that era.  The make-up was excellent, on the actors, Orson Wells went from a man of 25 to an older man very realistically.Citizen Kane made movies what they are today. This film was a big step in special effects and artistry and script. It's a classic movie everyone should see.The rating of this film is 9 out of 10.",9,2,4,17 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Strangelove shows the strangeness of the Cold War
","This dark comedy is about the bitter rivalry between the Soviets and Americans and the nuclear bomb. Colonel Jack Ripper goes crazy and wants to demolish the Soviet Union. Although this movie sounds almost like a drama it is a huge spoof of the Cold War.   Stanley Kubrick is a very creative director and screenplay writer. The comedy in this film had a lot of depth instead of the usual types of jokes that are in movies. He got his point across in an original way of his opinion of the Cold War and it shows in his film. He did a great job showing the stupidity of the competition of the U.S. and the Soviet Union wanting bigger and better bombs in a Freudian comedic way. Peter Sellers who played the three different characters of Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove did a great job acting.  Playing these three different characters in one film showed his diversity in acting. He was very funny in each of his roles which was impressive. The music that was chosen for the film was a great selection, especially in the beginning and ending. It illustrated the mood of the movie and gave it that extra flare for the humor of the story.   Dr. Strangelove is for a mature audience. It is a movie the viewer should pay attention to the whole time because of the depth.  This isn't a typical comedy so it is sometimes difficult to understand the humor in the jokes. Stanley Kubrick did a great job on this politically inspired film by getting his opinion across, not a in a blunt way but in a way that makes you think and laugh. It is definitely a movie to see.",Null,0,2,12 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," average movie
","Some Like It Hot? How about some like it perverted! This is surprisingly a very sexual driven movie, especially for the era. The movie is very sneaky with the dirty jokes. Some Like It Hot is about two men ( Joe and Jerry) on the run from the mob. They end up in disguise in none other than women's clothes to escape from the mob. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did great playing females! A little too well. They were a great comedic duo and made the film funny. Who didn't need to be in the film is Marilyn Monroe who played Sugar the girl that Joe and Jerry of course fall for. The Sugar character is funny, but the casting director could have most likely found someone better than Marilyn Monroe. The only reason they should have Marilyn in the film is because of the music. She did do well singing the cute yet sultry songs that were in the movie.  It's hard to believe Marilyn Monroe was such an icon in that decade and still is today. Yes, she is pretty, but her acting skills were not great in this movie. It seemed like she was forcing the lines and facial expressions out. The plot is predictable now, but most likely in the 50's it wasn't predictable since it was very risky. It is not the funniest film ever but funny enough to at least see once. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's comedic talents were the highlight of the movie, but unfortunately Marilyn's bad acting skills somewhat ruined the film. This movie is a 7/10.",7,1,13,17 April 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," best movie ever!
","It's A Wonderful Life is definitely one of the best movies ever made. It is all around a great film, with great acting, great directing by Frank Capra and a very well written plot. This is what a great movie is.The movie is about a businessman named George Bailey whose life and business isn't going so well, just as he is about to give up on things, an angel comes and shows him what life would really be like without him.They couldn't have picked a better cast for this film. James Stewart who played George Bailey gave an amazing performance. He is a well-rounded actor, not only could he do comedy but he also does dramatic very well, and that is not easy to find in actors. Donna Reed who played Mary Bailey ( George Bailey's wife) also did a great job playing her character. Stewart and Reed had very good on-screen chemistry and worked well together. All the acting throughout the whole movie was excellent. Not only did the acting make it a great film, the story also did. The story will make you laugh, cry and definitely think. It's nice to have a film out there that after you are done watching it, you will still think about it.The film started a lot of trends for other films and famous phrases. For example ` Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings`. Even though this film wasn't a huge hit in the box office, it is now a legend and always will be. It is now a tradition for many of people to watch this movie during the Christmas season. You can watch this movie over and over again and not get sick of it. It is definitely a classic everyone should see.This movie deserves 10 out of 10.",10,0,4,16 December 2003
Psycho," great suspense
","This movie will definitely keep you on your toes. It is a great suspense with creativity and an amazing plot that keeps the viewer interested the whole time. Psycho is about a woman named Marion Crane who is on the run for stealing $40,000 and while on the run she is encountered with well, a Psycho. This is a film the viewer needs to see for themselves and not ask any questions to a person who has seen it because the suspense is so great.The acting was well done in this film.  Janet Leigh who played Marion Crane had the most notable performance. She portrayed a sweet, but yet paranoid and guilty crook very well.  Anthony Perkins who played Norman Bates also did a great job portraying his character.What made this movie so amazing is the directing. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in film making. If it wasn't for him, horror films wouldn't be the way they are today. His techniques formed great suspense. The music he chose illustrated the anticipation of the film notably. Comparing this movie to the new version of Psycho which was made in 1998 is incredibly different. Even though the 1998 version was almost identical to the 1960s version, nothing compares to Alfred Hitchcock's version, proving that his techniques of using black and white film makes the film appear scarier. His original camera angles make him truly a great director that sets him apart from the other directors.This is a must see film! Though it is not the scariest movie out there the ingenuity of Psycho makes it one of the best horror films of all time. Psycho   was a definite trendsetter for current horror films.This movie is 10/10 stars.",10,0,1,20 February 2004
Rear Window," a great creative movie
","Rear Window is another genius film made by Alfred Hitchcock.  The depth and directing of this movie is amazing. There is no other movie like it and maybe never will be.Rear Window is about a wheelchair bound man named L.B. Jeff Jeffries who is stuck in his apartment due to a broken leg and ends up spying on his neighbors through his apartment window. He notices something fishy while watching his neighbor and the story becomes suspenseful.Though the movie starts out slow, which is the only negative thing to mention, it definitely becomes more exciting as the movie goes on. The whole film takes place in one area, L.B. Jeff Jeffries's apartment and the view he has of the outside and of his neighbors apartments through their windows. It was a huge risk making this film using only that area for all of the scenes. Alfred Hitchcock is most likely the only director who could pull off making a film like this.  The camera angles and the symbolism of each of the apartment floors representing something different is inventive.  Each of his skills keep the movie interesting.The acting was well-done, but it wasn't what made the movie. Jimmy Stewart who played L.B. Jeff Jefferies did well portraying his character like in most of the movies he is in. The glamorous Grace Kelly who played Lisa Fremont (Jeff Jefferies girlfriend) did a great job playing a sophisticated character.  Though the acting wasn't amazing, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly's chemistry on screen was enjoyable.Although this movie wasn't as frightening as Hitchcock's other film Psycho, it is more creative. The depth and the cinematography of this film is remarkable and once again makes Alfred Hitchcock a genius.This movie deserves 9.5 out of 10 stars.",Null,1,3,1 March 2004
The Godfather," The best film ever
","The Godfather is absolutely the best movie of all times. It is a true classic that will always be a great film for every generation. This movie will still be great in 50 years. The Godfather is about the Italian mafia and all the work they do. The Godfather (Don Vito Corleone) is the leader of the mob. Most of his sons are in the family business except for his son Michael, played by Al Pacino. He gets involved later. The acting was truly amazing in this film. Marlon Brando did great playing the Godfather and doing that famous voice that you will recognize watching the film even if you have not seen it before. Al Pacino did an incredible job portraying his character. Every actor was perfect in this film. Each actor brought something to the film and they were all needed to make this movie such a great movie. The screenplay was remarkable. The storyline never got boring. It is also very ingenious, because you can watch this film 10 times and still find something new that happened in the plot. Things will make even more sense when watching the film again. There is so much depth to this story.The music in the film was also great. It added the frosting to the cake. The music really illustrated the mood of the film, especially in all of the suspenseful scenes. The music made you think of a great close Italian family but with a bad side to them, which is what the film is about. There was not one flaw in this film. The screenplay, acting, directing were all perfect. What makes a great film is when the viewer is still thinking about the film after watching it. It has such a great ending that the viewer actually wants to see the sequel to it. This film makes it happen. The Godfather is 10/10 stars and is a must see movie if you want to see a truly great film.",Null,0,2,27 May 2004
