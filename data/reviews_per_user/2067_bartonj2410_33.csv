Deepwater Horizon," Very good disaster movie that highlights both bravery and helplessness
","It wasn't until the credits started to roll at the end of Deepwater Horizon that I realised just how severe this disaster actually was. I mean, the above poster shows just a glimpse of the devastation caused by an explosion and subsequent fire on the Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig around 40 miles southeast off the Louisiana coast.As a result, an oil spill that released an estimated 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico lasted for 87 days and went down as the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Not only that but eleven workers on the rig died trying to get to safety from such a powerful environmental occurrence.Peter Berg's Deepwater Horizon follows the crew on that infamous day; firstly as they debate with BP executives over the stability of the rig and then as they try to survive the inferno. Like his last film, Lone Survivor, Peter Berg tells the story of a real life event with a huge amount of respect for the people that were caught up in it all. Once again, Berg has teamed up with Mark Wahlberg and it's no coincidence that Wahlberg gives his best performance since he last worked with Berg. The two will work together again in Patriots Day, a film about the Boston Marathon bombing, and if they stick to the trend of their collaborative relationship, we should be in for another very good film.Wahlberg is joined by a pretty impressive ensemble cast that includes Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Dylan O'Brien and Kate Hudson. It's Malkovich who stands out as the detestable BP executive hell bent on getting the crew to drill for oil, even with the signs of an unstable rig.The film is well made and ends up being pretty spectacular when it gets going however, what Berg does best is the tension he creates as the disaster draws ever closer. You feel the presence of the oil blowout as this unstoppable monster that brings with it an extreme wrath of fire.As he did with Lone Survivor, Berg closes the film out with photos of those lost in the events that have unfolded to give the film a real sense of respect and honour. Maybe it's just me but I found it pretty disrespectful for people to be leaving the cinema as these showed on screen. Do you really need to get to your car that quick?Deepwater Horizon isn't trying to show off at all, as it probably would do if Michael Bay was at the helm. Instead, it's a film that does well to depict the desperation and bravery of those on board the Deepwater Horizon oil rig during a time of helplessness against such a force of nature.",8,12,18,30 September 2016
Creed," Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan combining with Stallone will leave you KO'd
","Creed is the seventh film of the Rocky franchise that started back in 1976. More often than not with a franchise this old, people wouldn't be too excited for a new film and judging by the fact that both Rocky V and Rocky Balboa were pretty lacklustre in comparison to the earlier films, Creed could have gone under the radar a little.Now, I really like the Rocky films but I wouldn't call myself a die hard fan of the franchise. What made me stand up and take notice of Creed, other than the word of mouth from across the pond, was the talent found to breathe new life into the franchise in director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan. What a great move that turned out to be.Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is the youngest son of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, whom he never met as Donnie was born after his death. With a childhood filled with violence behind him, Donnie quits his job to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional boxer.Donnie travels to Philadelphia to seek out his father's former rival turned friend, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), another former heavyweight champion, to train him. Keeping his identity as a Creed under wraps, Donnie tries to make it on his own name all while trying to build a relationship with Bianca (Tessa Thompson), a singer trying to make it in her respective profession.Creed has many strengths but its real one is the story at the centre of the film that harks back to what made the earlier films of the franchise so strong; underneath the tough exterior, there is a vulnerable man trying to find his place in the world. Ryan Coogler's story is an emotionally powerful one that deals with legacy, the fear of failure and loneliness rather beautifully.Coogler quite rightfully broke onto the scene when he wrote and directed Fruitvale Station and he picks up where he left off with that film in Creed, revelling in both the role of writer and director. I knew the more dramatic scenes, particularly between Donnie and Rocky, were in capable hands with Coogler however, I wasn't too sure how he would handle the boxing sequences.All I can say now having seen Creed is wow. Coogler not only delivers a pulsating training montage, important to any Rocky film, he also manages to hit the nail on the head when it comes to the actual fights. The last fight would have been good enough but there is a real gem of a scene that occurs halfway through the film. Donnie's first fight under the tutelage of Rocky is all done in one long take and it really is a stunning piece of filmmaking. Coogler owes a lot to cinematographer Maryse Alberti as it is her camera-work that makes this such an unforgettable scene, making us feel every punch as they land.Coming to the performances, I really do think Creed showcases the best performances of the franchise. In Michael B. Jordan, they have found a young and exciting actor who could go on to play this character for years to come. Jordan portrays both the cocky and vulnerable side to Donnie with an abundance of maturity and confidence.The more surprising aspect of the performances is just how good Sylvester Stallone is in the role of Rocky Balboa. Now, Stallone has never been regarded as a great actor however, you can't deny that this is the role that has more than ever showcased the acting talent he does possess. In Creed, I can't think of one scene involving Stallone that let the film down. This is his franchise and you have to give the man credit for bringing in the likes of Coogler and Jordan to take it forward. Creed is an outstanding example of how to respectfully breathe new life into a flagging franchise from Ryan Coogler, who has a big future ahead of him, as does Michael B. Jordan. It might not be the most popular statement but I genuinely think I prefer Creed to any of the previous six Rocky films.",10,1,4,10 January 2016
Spotlight," Utterly compelling drama from Tom McCarthy
","Patience is key in the world of investigative journalism, a fact highlighted in Spotlight, the brilliant biographical drama from director Tom McCarthy. The same man who brought us The Cobbler last year has certainly made major amends with this compelling drama that tells the true story of the revelation that shook the Catholic Church to its core.When Marty Baron (Live Schreiber) was hired as the new editor of The Boston Globe in 2001, he discovered the Spotlight Team, headed by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), a small group of investigative journalists who can take up to a year to publish a story, consisting of Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) and Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery).After reading a column about a local Boston priest who was sexually abusing children and the Archbishop of Boston, who chose to ignore these crimes, Baron urges the Spotlight Team to investigate the story. Initially thinking they are investigating a one-off case, the team soon uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and the ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Having spent a semester at university studying investigative journalism, I absolutely loved how Tom McCarthy told the story of this team of reporters who slowly start to uncover the horrific truth buried beneath the Catholic Church, piece by piece. McCarthy's film, co-written by Josh Singer, doesn't hold back when it comes to its sensitive subject matter; a story we may not want to hear but one that needed to be heard.The shock of the revelations are really felt through the screenplay and the character journeys we see throughout, particularly that of Rezendes. I was left shaking my head at some of the truths revealed about the local Boston priests however, I was left open-mouthed at the facts that closed the film. I just could not believe the sheer scale of what had been uncovered.Coming to the performances, Spotlight really does boast one hell of an impressive ensemble cast. Each of them work well with the screenplay from McCarthy and Singer, delivering good performances however, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are the ones that really excel in Spotlight. Ruffalo picks up yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and is probably the main challenge to Sylvester Stallone, while Rachel McAdams really does earn her maiden Academy Award nomination in the role of Sacha Pfeiffer.The score from Howard Shore impressed me as well. I really felt Shore captured the disturbing side of the investigation while also managing to emphasise the determined work ethic of the Spotlight Team. There's also an eerily brilliant use of the song Silent Night towards the end that deserves a mention.It may not possess the cinematography of The Revenant or the heart of Creed however, Spotlight is an equally powerful and important film that has to be seen. I really do hope it walks away with the Academy Award for Best Picture come the end of this month.",10,1,1,1 February 2016
The Hateful Eight," Self-indulgence to some, sheer cinematic brilliance to others
","Settling down to sit through Quentin Tarantino's eight film, The Hateful Eight, I was both excited and a little cautious. Excited because Tarantino has made some of my favourite films yet cautious because The Hateful Eight had a three hour runtime and there was a chance it could become a little self-indulgent.Tarantino has always been a bit of an acquired taste and he certainly has his critics, particularly of his last few efforts however, with The Hateful Eight, Tarantino has struck gold again. It's a tense game of Cluedo that, much like any Tarantino film, brings character and dialogue to the fore.John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter known as 'The Hangman' who, with his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is on his way to Red Rock to hand her in and watch her hang. With a heavy blizzard on their tail, they pick up two stragglers in Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), also on their way to Red Rock.The plan is to make a stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge, and wait for the blizzard to blow over. What wasn't on the cards though was Minnie's being occupied by four strangers; Bob (Demian Bichir), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), one of them not being who he says he is.Being a Tarantino film, you should know to expect long drawn out scenes of dialogue and the occasional explosion of violence. Both are very apparent from the film's opening scene and from that very moment, Tarantino holds you in a vice like grip and keeps you guessing at who's who until the final few moments of the film.It's the quality of writing again from Tarantino that helps make The Hateful Eight such an engrossing experience. His words and exchanges between the characters are so intricately written that switching off could lead to missing out on something pivotal to the film's plot. With The Hateful Eight mainly taking place in one location, it has to be spot on and thankfully it is. Much like Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, this is a dialogue driven film where each of the backstories will leave you guessing just as much as John Ruth and Marquis Warren.It's clear that Tarantino writes his films for certain actors and he is joined by a number of frequent collaborators such as Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. Every member of the cast brings their own qualities to their respective characters and it makes for such great viewing when they're all firing each other like this.I loved pretty much all of the performances but for me the stand-outs were Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. Jackson performs the words of Tarantino like no other, Leigh doesn't have much to say in comparison yet she shines when she does get a word in and uses facial expressions often to comedic effect, and then there is Walton Goggins. Goggins had a bit part in Django Unchained and has been doing the rounds on television for a while but in The Hateful Eight, he gets his moment in the limelight and he sure as hell makes the most of it. I really enjoyed the performance of Channing Tatum too in his small role that I won't go too much into right now.I had heard that this was a violent film after its release across the pond on Christmas Day and yes, when it gets violent it really is quite violent however, like both Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained, it seems more like a cartoon when the violence begins than in his previous films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. All the proceedings are accompanied by an original score from the legendary Ennio Morricone, his first complete Western score in 40 years.It may not be to everyone's taste and I don't quite know yet where it fits in my ranking of Tarantino films but The Hateful Eight is one hell of a treat in the first week of the new year. Don't let the runtime put you off as it simply flies by.",10,27,63,9 January 2016
Black Mass," Johnny Depp shines in this otherwise flat gangster drama
","My final venture to the London Film Festival this year was to see Black Mass and despite hearing not such positive things, I still had high expectations for this film. Unfortunately, Black Mass ends up being another case of a fantastic performance in a not so fantastic film. James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) is regarded as one of the most notorious gangsters in United States history and headed the Irish-American Winter Hill Gang in South Boston for a number of years. In 1975, Bulger struck a deal with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton); a native of South Boston and friend of Bulger and his brother, Senator William Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), to become an informant for the Bureau. In return, Bulger wanted the FBI to take down his rivals, the Angiulo Brothers, who were connected to the Mafia and formed direct competition over territory for the Winter Hill Gang. With the film focusing on one of the most notorious gangsters in U.S. history, Black Mass had the chance to be this generation's Goodfellas. It just doesn't feel as if they took full advantage of that opportunity and at times, Scott Cooper's film feels like a Goodfellas wannabe. Then you realise that nobody does Scorsese quite like Scorsese.Black Mass feels bloated and at two hours long, ends up dragging towards the end. Lacking the style of other gangster films such as Goodfellas or even Legend from earlier in the year, I was a little relieved when the end credits started to roll. Not that Black Mass is by any means a terrible film, because it isn't and there is still a good film to be seen here.At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Johnny Depp. As Bulger, Depp blows away the cobwebs and delivers a performance that might be one of my favourites of the year so far. Depp's filmography has been rather goofy in more recent years but in Black Mass, he more than makes amends for that. Depp, under a load of prosthetic make-up, is intimidating as the the cold-blooded Bulger.It's a shame though that the only other actor who raises their game in Black Mass is Joel Edgerton as FBI agent Connolly. Considering the cast that Cooper has at his disposal, the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons all feel underused and it plays a part in holding Black Mass back from being great.The score from Junkie XL a.k.a. Tom Holkenborg is one of note and shows complete contrast to his score for Mad Max: Fury Road earlier in the year, a sign that he has a future in composing film scores for sure. I also really liked the production design by Stefania Cella, her work really bringing 1975 Boston to life amidst Bulger's criminal activities.While Black Mass is certainly a return to form for Johnny Depp, I can't help but feel a little disappointed when I think about the film as a whole. But please, Mr Depp, more roles like this in the future would be very welcome.",6,1,1,17 October 2015
Suicide Squad," Will DC ever learn?!
","The DCEU (Detective Comics Extended Universe) hasn't really got off to the greatest of starts with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I liked the former but the latter was disappointingly poor, with critics not really taking to either well at all. Now we have Suicide Squad, a film that many felt could potentially put DC back on track with their cinematic universe.With director David Ayer pulling the strings and the likes of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Viola Davis starring, Suicide Squad was easily one of my most anticipated films of 2016.After the death of Superman, intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is convinced that she has the solution, should something of Superman's power want to threaten the world. Her plan is to assemble a team of the most dangerous criminals to take on any threat too great for regular soldiers.Task Force X or Suicide Squad, as they name themselves, is made up of; Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Slipknot (Adam Beach), each and every one of them under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who, like Waller, sees them all as expendable.When an unworldly threat arrives, the squad try their best to get the job done however, their villainous nature and the Joker (Jared Leto), looking to get Harley Quinn back, might just throw a few spanners in the works.Just like the film that proceeded it in the DCEU, Suicide Squad is a mess of the film that literally allows the audience no time to breathe, shoving the characters down their throats and forcing them to fall in love with them right away. David Ayer's narrative is so rushed, getting to the finale within around forty-five minutes, meaning there's no real time for any sort of character development. His film also has quite possibly one of the worst villains in the history of comic-book adaptations, and that's not even an exaggeration.The film is also edited really badly, chopping and changing so much that you'll start to get a headache, and not just in the action sequences. Ayer's script is really disappointing, considering the fact this was rated 15 in the UK, yet nothing here made me feel that was warranted. There's also the fact that every moment that should have got a major laugh was ruined by the fact they were all seen in the trailer. If you've seen all the trailers you've literally seen the whole film.The thing that annoyed me the most about Suicide Squad though was the soundtrack, which I was really looking forward to see how Ayer would incorporate it into his film. Now, Marvel didn't event the usage of a cool soundtrack to accompany a film but, in Guardians of the Galaxy, the musical choices made perfect sense with what was going on in the relevant scene. In Suicide Squad, random songs play at random times and it just ruined some scenes in particular.Coming to the performances, which are easily the best thing about the film, Suicide Squad has some form of redemption. Viola Davis is great as the intense Amanda Waller, as is Will Smith as Deadshot. Harley Quinn was always going to be a tough character to bring to life but I felt Margot Robbie did her enough justice, whether it's enough to warrant a solo film is questionable mind. I actually really enjoyed Jai Courtney's performance as Captain Boomerang which is quite something considering I normally can't stand the guy.Cara Delevingne, who hasn't had too much acting experience, can be used as a bit of a scapegoat as her performance isn't great however, I feel that was more down to how awfully written her character was. Joel Kinnaman doesn't really do anything wrong as Rick Flag, it's just unfortunate that he had to step into a role that we could have potentially seen Tom Hardy in if he didn't have to do reshoots on The Revenant.The use of the Joker is something that has been bugging me ever since I left the cinema. Jared Leto had huge boots to fill after the perfect performance Heath Ledger gave as the iconic villain in The Dark Knight and I think Leto did well. My main issue was that he just wasn't in it enough for my liking. The Joker has to either be the main villain or not in the film at all, not a side character who pops up for a couple of scenes throughout the film. I was intrigued by what we did see of Leto and it would be great to see him go up again Ben Affleck's Batman in a future film. You can't even consider judging him as the best representation of the Joker until we see more of him.There are some Justice League cameos in Suicide Squad, one lasting a split second and the other featuring Batman. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the appearances Batman makes did feel really jarring and out of place. I loved him in Batman v Superman but not quite so much here in Suicide Squad.While Suicide Squad does offer some form of entertainment, like other films in the DCEU, it does so with glaring issues you'd think they'd learn from. It's not the end of the world mind, remember the MCU had two not so well received films that followed Iron Man and look what they've gone on to achieve. It just means a lot rides on Wonder Woman so no pressure DC.",4,0,1,6 August 2016
Doctor Strange," People who claim each MCU film is exactly the same must be blind...
","With the arrival of Doctor Strange, the Marvel Cinematic Universe now consists of fourteen films, a franchise that has introduced us to a number of iconic characters who have occupied the pages of comic books for many years, turning Marvel Studios into a box-office behemoth in the process.The continuing expansion of the MCU is something that each film has to keep in consideration but, while introducing new characters at this stage in a franchise, it's important that these films feel fresh. Doctor Strange does very well in introducing a character I'm not too familiar with, taking time to explore his origin story and becoming one of the most different offerings within the MCU.Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is one of the world's leading neurosurgeons who, after a major car accident, is forced to give up his career due to severe injuries sustained to his hands. After hearing of a potential cure, Strange sets off on a journey of healing to meet the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton).Strange's journey takes him to Kamar-Taj, where he discovers the mystic arts. Trained how to use them and taught about the purpose he can serve, Strange takes a path that will change his life forever.As I've mentioned before, I'm not all too familiar with the character of Doctor Strange in comparison to the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man or Captain America. That worked massively in favour of the film as I was interested to see how a character like this would fit into the MCU and excited to see something new altogether within the franchise.Scott Derrickson really has done a great job in making a film that offers that something new while feeling right at home within the MCU at the same time. The exploration of the mystic arts is big enough but Derrickson juggles that with Strange's origin story to make sure this is a hero we want to root for. Derrickson's film flows at a steady pace and features some of the better humour we've seen in the MCU so far.It's no surprise that a Marvel film possesses impressive special effects however, when you see what they achieve with the effects in Doctor Strange, you can only be even more impressed with them. Watching Strange learn the secrets of the mystic arts gets pretty psychedelic at times while the action sequences, including a landscape shifting chase through New York, are quite breathtaking.Coming to the performances, Doctor Strange features a lead in Benedict Cumberbatch that proves, once again, Marvel have got the casting for one of their heroes spot on again. We know Cumberbatch can pull off the arrogance as we've seen him do it as Sherlock Holmes and he does it so well as Doctor Strange, both during his time as a surgeon and sorcerer. It's a trait that makes him a bit difficult to take to but then it's great to see the character earn the respect of the audience as the film goes on. Cumberbatch is joined by a mightily impressive supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams and Mads Mikkelsen. There's been a bit of controversy surrounding the casting of Swinton in the role of the Ancient One, a problem seen quite often in Hollywood unfortunately, but there's no denying Swinton gives one of the best performances in Doctor Strange. I really enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor's take on Karl Mordo and I'm intrigued the direction his character will take in future instalments.It's the misusage of McAdams and Mikkelsen that leaves a bit of a sour taste, McAdams rather terribly pushed aside to the role of girlfriend while Mikkelsen falls under the curse of weak and underwritten Marvel villain. It's a problem Marvel have really struggled with throughout the MCU with Loki and Ultron being the only stand-out villains. Two memorable villains across fourteen films isn't really good enough though. I mean, McAdams and Mikkelsen both do there best with the limited material they're given but it's a real shame that it has to happen.As always with Marvel, there's two extra scenes throughout the end credits that tease future projects and it's the one in the middle of the end credits that left me pumped for a particular sequel coming out next year. It also felt like a great subtle nod to Sherlock Holmes, who Cumberbatch has played before. Thanks to a very good introduction to the Sorcerer Supreme, I can't wait to see how he's going to interact with the likes of Tony Stark and Star-Lord when we get to that point in a couple of years.",8,9,18,26 October 2016
Southpaw," Very good tale of redemption with a KO performance from Jake Gyllenhaal
","As with most sports dramas, Southpaw is a film more about the man than the sport. Labelled by many as the 'modern day Raging Bull', I had high hopes for Southpaw and thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal, it duly delivered. This is a tale of one man's path to redemption through boxing.Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the Light Heavyweight champion of the world and a boxer known for his unique style and impressive fight record. When his wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), is shot dead following a scuffle with title contender Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), both Billy's career and personal life go in a downward spiral that sees him both lose his boxing licence and his daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence), to child protection services.Billy turns to trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to help him get his life back on track. Carry on down the same path and Billy could lose his daughter forever however, putting his focus into a return to boxing could see Billy regain everything he lost after the death of his wife.As mentioned before, the film focuses more on the man than the sport however, Southpaw is one of the only boxing dramas I have seen where the sport of boxing actually feels like a character in the film, not just a backdrop for the drama.Southpaw does become a bit predictable and features quite a few clichés, which can't be helped in this genre, but director Antoine Fuqua does a good job in making sure Southpaw has a bit of a cutting edge to it. This is a hard hitting drama that isn't scared to throw the hardest of punches at its audience.After leaving the cinema, I read that Eminem had been lined up for the role of Billy Hope when the film first came into production. How different a film that would have been. I could not be more thankful that the studio decided not to follow through with that and instead decided to cast Gyllenhaal in the role instead.Gyllenhaal is an actor who makes it clear that he takes his roles very seriously and you can see that from the transformation he has put his body through, becoming almost unrecognisable from the skinny Lou Bloom in Nightcrawler. His gruelling six month training regime certainly makes him look like a boxer but his decision to learn the boxing techniques means he moves like a boxer too, making the performance even more authentic.The transformation would mean absolutely nothing without the performance to match though. As expected, Gyllenhaal gives an absolute powerhouse of a performance in Southpaw that really raises the quality of the film because without him, this would be quite an average film. I struggle to think of an actor right now on a hotter streak in Hollywood than Gyllenhaal.Forest Whitaker, as usual, adds a quality to proceedings and Rachel McAdams does a fine job in her small role, which would have been better if we hadn't seen her characters outcome in the trailers. Oona Laurence gives an impressive performance as the young Leila and I didn't even mind 50 Cent or Rita Ora being cast in the film.The boxing sequences are very good as well, with the use of POV shots in particular injecting the sequences with adrenaline and making the audience feel every single punch thrown.While Southpaw isn't the masterpiece that Raging Bull is, it certainly sees Fuqua make his best film since Training Day. Led by another top performance from Gyllenhaal, maybe Southpaw will make the voters this awards season stand up and take notice of his talent, not ignore it like they did with Nightcrawler.",9,55,91,25 July 2015
The Revenant," Inarritu's tale of survival and revenge is beautifully brutal in its execution
","From the opening moments of The Revenant, I knew this film was going to be special. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film opens with a mesmerising battle sequence, both brutal and beautiful in its execution, and goes on to tell a captivating story of survival and revenge that will remain as one of the more memorable cinematic experiences I will ever have.When a party of fur trappers are driven off course by an attack from a Native American tribe, they look to Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a frontiersman who knows the territory well, to set them on a new one.After being mauled by a grizzly bear and with his life hanging in the balance, Glass is eventually left for dead by members of his own hunting party, leaving him facing a fight for survival and a chance of revenge, if he can survive the harsh conditions.The troubles that the film faced during filming have been well-documented, with crew members quitting due to the harsh conditions and locations however, the finished product would suggest to me that it was all worth it because The Revenant really is an amazing piece of filmmaking.I left the cinema absolutely breathless, mainly just because of how visually stunning the film is. There are shots that will leave you opened-mouthed and shots that will simply leave you questioning, 'How?!'. The decision to shoot the film in natural lighting is a brave one and it really adds such an authenticity to proceedings. There's a moment late on in a forest where the only light given off is from torches and it's just glorious.Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, really is in a rich vein of form in his career and his work on The Revenant really is up there as some of the best I have ever seen, his wide shots showcasing the vast and beautiful mountainous terrain and his long takes during the opening battle sequence, taking us from tussles on the floor to horseback in one flowing motion, setting the film off in such pulsating fashion. Lubezki has won the last two Academy Awards for cinematography, expect the third one to be his come the end of February.The film's length has come under a bit of scrutiny but I could have easily sat through a further half hour, I was that engrossed in Glass' search for revenge. The film is a basic tale of survival and revenge yet, through Inarritu's filmmaking choices and narrative, there feels so much more to it all. There is one intense scene that has already made the headlines for all the wrong reasons and that is the moment Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear. Obviously created through CGI yet feeling as real as anything else in the film, it really is an outstanding moment that I will just have to wait for the blu-ray to see just how they did it.Coming to the performances, The Revenant is just as strong as other departments. Leonardo DiCaprio leads the film as Hugh Glass and it's much more of a physical performance than anything else, using his eyes and facial expressions to great effect throughout. By the end, you feel as if you have gone through everything, from freezing cold conditions to eating just about anything to survive, with Glass. While I don't think this is his best performance, it's still one of such a high standard and I will be cheering him on for the much coveted Academy Award for Best Actor.DiCaprio is joined by an impressive supporting cast, headed by the always impressive Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald. Hardy again possesses a bit of mumble here though it's not hard at all to make out what he is saying but I did notice more than ever in this Hardy performance just how much he uses his eyes in his acting. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are also on hand to provide able support, Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry and Poulter as the naive Jim Bridger.I am aware that, like many of the films going for gold during awards season, The Revenant has leaked online however, I urge you to seek it out at your nearest cinema because it really is an immersive cinematic experience that simply has to be seen on the big screen.",10,10,19,17 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Hanks and Spielberg bring out the best in one another yet again
","Bridge of Spies marks the fourth collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, a relationship that has gone extremely well thus far. Both of these Hollywood icons seem to bring the best out of each other and all things were pointing towards Bridge of Spies being another winner.Telling the story of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who, during the Cold War, is told he will be the defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court, a man believed to be a Soviet spy.When the American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), is shot down and imprisoned by the Soviet Union, Donovan is then tasked with negotiating an exchange with the Soviets; Powers for Abel at a time when tensions were very high between the two nations.Spielberg is my favourite director and he will go down as one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. Whether he's dealing with a summer blockbuster or a lower budget drama, Spielberg finds a way for the film to connect with its audience, and Bridge of Spies is no different.The sentimentality that can so often be found in a Spielberg film is usually the key component in that connection and it is ever present in Bridge of Spies, a film that depicts an event in history made possible by one honest man when some thought war was the only option.There were some rewrites carried out on the script, written by Matt Charman however, when you can call upon the likes of Joel and Ethan Coen to spruce it up a bit, you know you are going to get real quality. Every word feels like it counts and there were some genuine moments where I was thinking to myself, 'Yeah, these are the words of the Coen Brothers', with dashing of light humour sprinkled throughout.Coming to the performances, there were two that, unsurprisingly, stood out for me. Of course, Tom Hanks is one of them, playing the spirited Donovan with a performance full of such wit and charm that he becomes instantly likable and a character the audience will be rooting for.The other is the performance from the lesser known Mark Rylance, an actor known more for his stage roles than his work in front of a camera. As accused spy Abel, Rylance shares a chemistry with Hanks that sees Donovan and Abel seem more like old friends than strangers who have just met. Spielberg was so impressed with Rylance that he offered him the lead part in his upcoming adaptation of The BFG, due next year.Weirdly, for a Spielberg film, the score was not composed by John Williams, who had to drop off the project due to bad health. Thomas Newman stepped up to the plate and, while he does a fine job, his score doesn't do enough to evoke the emotions the way a score from John Williams would.This isn't Spielberg showing off with a big special effects laden film, nor is it a film about spies that you may expect. Bridge of Spies is however, a riveting drama with two Hollywood icons in top form. You'd be crazy not to check it out.",8,2,5,27 November 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Strong fifth entry for one of the best action franchises out there
","Any franchise that enters its fifth film normally shows signs of fatigue, whether it be a case of same old same old or the fact that the audience just aren't interested anymore. It's rare to see a franchise go from strength to strength in its later stages but the Mission: Impossible franchise has done just that with its latest, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. Rogue Nation finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team tracking down and eradicate The Syndicate, an organisation made up of highly skilled international agents with a mission to destroy the IMF.With their methods under examination and the IMF dissolved by the American government, Hunt and his team must, as always, go it alone while trying to avoid detection from the CIA as well.The Mission: Impossible franchise is one that can take pride in its action sequences and in Rogue Nation, it has some of the most exhilarating moments you will see in a cinema this summer. They are all executed to perfection by director Christopher McQuarrie and shot breathtakingly by Robert Elswit,.When your film opens with a magnificent stunt that sees Hunt hanging from the side of plane during take off, you know you're in for something special. From there, Rogue Nation moves at a blistering pace, packing in a tense underwater infiltration and a pulsating car/motorbike chase through the streets of Casablanca for good measure.McQuarrie's screenplay is great fun as well; reminding us that, while of course there is a serious issue to be dealt with, there is fun to be had at the same time. Not every spy film has to be 100% serious.It would be hard to talk about a Mission: Impossible film and not mention the performance of Tom Cruise in the signature role of his career, Ethan Hunt. Cruise has a reputation for giving his all to give the audience a memorable experience at the cinema. For Ghost Protocol he hung from the side of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai but for Rogue Nation he exceeds even his own crazy standards by clinging to the side of a cargo plane during take off.God knows what he's got planned for the next film.Cruise is joined by other Mission: Impossible alumni such as Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, Jeremy Renner as William Brandt and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Pegg gets more to do in Rogue Nation than any of the previous films which ends up being a good thing. Rhames too gets more to do but it is Renner who finds himself sacrificed a little for this to happen. Renner takes more of a back seat in Rogue Nation compared to Ghost Protocol, swapping field work for a desk role.Then there is the newcomer in Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Much has been made of Ferguson's character being a strong female character in a male dominated genre. Yes, it's great to see but I was more intrigued by the mystery of her character and how it kept me on my toes trying to figure out where the story was going to go next.Aside from Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian in Mission: Impossible III, the series has never really had a good enough villain, holding the films back a little. The villain of Rogue Nation is Solomon Lane, played by Sean Harris. Lane is certainly sinister and makes his mission quite a personal one against Hunt but it doesn't does stop him from being, rather unfortunately, yet another weak villain in the series.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is without a doubt one of the stand-out films that the 2015 summer blockbuster season has had to offer. If they can keep the franchise this fresh after five films then all I can is; please keep on accepting those missions Mr Hunt.",8,3,6,2 August 2015
Captain America: Civil War," The Russo brothers deliver one of the great comic-book films to the MCU
","Back when Captain America: Civil War was announced during a Marvel Studios event in 2014, the anticipation I have had for this entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been rising with every single passing moment. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, stood on a stage and announced the next Captain America film would be named Serpent Society and every single person was left a little underwhelmed. Then he backtracked and revealed the film's true title, as well as bringing out Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to a deafening noise from the excited crowd.Taking elements from the popular Civil War comic and rearranging a few things to make it fit the continuity of the MCU, Marvel turned to the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who did such a good job with The Winter Soldier, to bring this story to the big screen. The Russo brothers have struck gold once again with Civil War, a film that may not only be the best entry into the MCU but one of the greatest comic-book films ever made.After events in New York, Washington DC, Sokovia and finally, a botched mission in Lagos, the Avengers, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), are brought in by the US government to sign the Sokovia Accords, a document that states the Avengers must work under government supervision rather than their own free will. Many people still see them as heroes yet there is a growing number of people who see them as nothing more than vigilantes who should be put on a leash, or stopped altogether. Captain America, who also has the trouble of finding his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) before he's taken out for good, decides against signing the document, causing a rift between not only himself and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), but splitting the Avengers right down the middle.While the Avengers, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, are all in Civil War, it is still most definitely a Captain America film, driven by a very personal story for the First Avenger. I have to applaud the writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, for the job they have done delivering a strong emotional core to Civil War. Captain America's main priority is getting Bucky, operating as the Winter Soldier for years, back at all costs and the effect it has on his friendship with Tony Stark is devastating, culminating in an emotionally fuelled finale that will leave you torn. These are characters we've spent eight years following so to see them come to blows, especially when you can agree with why both are fighting, makes you genuinely care about the fight itself and the fallout of it all. One of the highlights of The Winter Soldier was the action, particularly the hand-to-hand fights, and it's great to see the Russo brothers deliver brilliant action once again. The film is full of pulsating action whether it be close quarter combat or blistering chase sequences however, the stand-out action sequence in Civil War comes in the form of an all out brawl between two teams made up of various Avengers in a German airport. It's full of wonderful character moments and some brilliantly executed fun surprises, making it quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in any comic-book film. One of my worries for Civil War was whether there would be too many characters in one film. It could have been a recipe for disaster and ended in a convoluted mess but that is definitely not the case. The Russo brothers do the characters we are familiar with justice as well as introducing new faces that I can't wait to see again in the MCU. Both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have never been better in their respective roles of Captain America and Tony Stark. Downey Jr. in particular gives a really memorable performance as a guilt ridden Stark who feels the Avengers should be reined in. All of the other familiar faces are brought to life with good performances but the real stand-outs are the new characters that we'd all been dying to see in action. First up is Chadwick Boseman in the role of T'Challa/Black Panther, a prince and warrior of Wakanda. Boseman cuts a very regal and imposing figure as Black Panther, more than holding his own against the likes of Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Then there is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland. This is Spider-Man's debut in the MCU after Sony agreed to share the rights with Marvel Studios so they had to get it right. They didn't just get it right, they nailed it with Spider- Man. This is the Spider-Man I've wanted to see for some time now, quip after quip during the airport fight and a distinct awkwardness as Peter Parker, and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. I will wait to see how his solo film pans out but we could be seeing the best Spider- Man yet here. Take note DC, this is how you introduce new characters that will go on to shape the future of your cinematic universe.Juggling a film of this magnitude with the vast array of characters on show is no easy challenge, yet it's one that the Russo brothers thrive on. They have delivered a brilliant comic-book film in Captain America: Civil War and, with the stakes even higher and more characters to come for the next Avengers films, they are certainly the right men for the job.",10,32,66,30 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," If this is to be five films, they simply have to improve on this effort
","It's been five years since we said goodbye to Harry Potter and the wizarding world in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. With the way Hollywood is now, I'm surprised it's taken Warner Bros. five years to return to one of their most lucrative properties to see if they can bleed it dry.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a film based on a textbook written by J. K. Rowling within the Harry Potter universe. The textbook is one written by Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and is pretty much an encyclopaedia of creatures that he's documented on his travels throughout the wizarding world.When Newt arrives in 1926 New York, he does so carrying a suitcase full of magical creatures. After a mix up with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), Newt loses the case and as a result, a number of the creatures escape and run amok in New York. While trying to track down the escaped creatures, Newt must evade the clutches of Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), an Auror working for MACUSA (The Magical Congress of the United States of America), trying to protect the wizarding world from human discovery.It's definitely fun returning to the wizarding world and Rowling has written an entertaining enough story however, my problems with Fantastic Beasts lie with the fact that there is barely any introduction given to this time and setting in the wizarding world. It was something that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone did so well, laying the foundations for the rest of the series however, that was the world of Hogwarts and this an entirely new setting.We're just thrown into this story with Newt tracking down the creatures and nothing else that happens around this main story is explained very well at all. It's certainly an adventure that is fun to watch but I felt the setting needed a bit more depth, considering this is going to be a series of five films. Don't even get me started on the finale of this film, which becomes a ball of confusion thanks to an unexplained revelation and an incoherent set-piece involving a rampant black cloud (known as an Obscurus).Which leads me to the special effects on show in this film, which for the most part are very good. The majority of the creatures are well designed and brought to life through wonderful effects, even if they aren't all that fantastic. In places though the CGI looked a tad messy, particularly in the finale I've mentioned previously.Unlike the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts doesn't have the likable characters to lead the film. The performances are good enough but the characters were a little lacklustre. Newt Scamander is a pretty weak lead character for a start and Eddie Redmayne doesn't really do enough to make you like him, leaving this as a Redmayne performance somewhere between the heights of The Theory of Everything and the very low depths of Jupiter Ascending. Dan Fogler's effort as the comic relief of the film is admirable but he doesn't do much else other than make weird faces and noises. Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol play a pair of sisters who Newt meets during his time in New York but I can't help but feel Waterston is massively wasted in a very limited role, as is Colin Farrell as the mysterious Graves. Much has been made of Johnny Depp's casting announcement in this series and his appearance here leaves me fearing the worst for the rest of these films.Warner Bros. initially announced Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as the start of a new trilogy, which more recently became a pentalogy. While there is certainly enough fun to be had with this film, the films simply have to get better if they are to standalone from the Harry Potter films.",6,2,6,20 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," A horror sequel that actually delivers the horror
","There's a reason we get so many horror films released every year; they are relatively cheap to make and guaranteed to make the studio money. No matter how bad the horror could end up being, people love the thrill and rush the experience of watching a horror film at the cinema gives you.Sequels have become one of the most sinister things in film today, some seeing them as nothing but quick ways of making more money however, if done well, sequels can be one of the more interesting things in film. In the case of The Conjuring 2, it's definitely the latter.Six years after the events in Rhode Island, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren are called to Enfield, England, to investigate the paranormal events that the Hodgson family have been experiencing in their home, in particular Janet (Madison Wolfe).Having investigated the Amityville murders of 1974, Lorraine has since had visions that feature a powerful entity, forcing her to believe that the choice to carry on their line of work could lead to tragedy.What I really have to commend The Conjuring 2 for is the fact that it doesn't just feel like a carbon copy of its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the two films certainly have similarities but this didn't feel like watching the first film over again.The film does this by telling two stories; one of the Hodgson family in Enfield and another about the visions that Lorraine has been haunted by after their investigation of the Amityville murders. These two stories connect much better than the stories of the family being haunted and the Annabelle doll in the first film.I have to praise James Wan for the job he does directing The Conjuring 2, expertly building suspense through the use of sound, camera movements and editing. John R. Leonetti returns as cinematographer and there really are some fabulous shots in this film, some leading to false predictions of when and where something would jump out on the screen. The film uses jump scares but it doesn't solely rely on them to scare the audience, one particular scene with Lorraine coming face to face with the demon haunting her slowly building to almost nerve-shredding levels of suspense.The performances in The Conjuring 2 are also worth mentioning, with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga returning to good effect, Farmiga once again being the film's biggest asset. I was really impressed with Madison Wolfe as Janet, the member of the Hodgson family targeted by the demon and also Frances O'Connor who played her mother.The Conjuring 2 will no doubt have audiences worldwide jumping out of their seats and give Warner Bros. a tidy profit when it finishes its run at the box-office. James Wan is the man they should be thanking and I'd like to thank him also for producing another horror that looks for more than one way to scare its audience.",8,0,2,18 June 2016
Inside Out," Pixar hit it out of the park yet again
","For the past twenty years, Pixar have taken us on an emotional ride through the eyes of; toys, bugs, monsters, fish, superheroes, cars, a rat, a robot, an elderly man and a brave young princess. This year though, they may have their most emotional picture yet in the form of Inside Out and this time, it's all about our emotions showing emotion.When young Riley and her family move from their quiet midwest life to the hustle and bustle of San Francisco, Riley's emotions; Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) go into overdrive.Together they have to work to make sure Riley adjusts to life in a new city, house and school.As always with Pixar, there is much more to their films than first meets the eye. The story may sound very basic however, when you watch Inside Out, one of the most impressive things about it is the sheer amount of imagination that has gone into making it such a special film.The world that the animators have created inside the mind of a child is one of Pixar's best pieces of work yet and everything single one of the emotions fills it with their unique personality. There is some good voice work provided by the likes of Poehler, Smith and Black but it does feel that both Kaling and Hader are a little underused however, not enough to make their characters pointless. The script is full of brilliant comedic moments, allowing Black's Anger to steal most of the scenes, and touching scenes that have Joy, Fear, Disgust and Anger wondering what the purpose of Sadness really is.It is such themes as this and the script that makes Inside Out arguably Pixar's most accessible animation to both adults and children. If you thought the final scene in Toy Story 3 or the opening to Up tugged at the heartstrings, wait until you see Inside Out.If Inside Out is one thing, it is undeniable proof that Pixar remain the leading animation studio in Hollywood. A title they have been holding now for the past twenty years.",10,16,50,25 July 2015
Legend," Devilishly funny with not one, but two brilliant performances from Tom Hardy
","The Kray twins are two of Britain's most notorious criminals, who made their name through the organised crime empire that they ran from the East End of London in the 1960s. Depending on who you talk to or what you read, the Kray twins were either seen as thuggish gangsters or celebrities of the East End.Their violent tendencies aside, the two brothers were polar opposites. Reggie was the calmer one who had an idea of how the world of business worked whereas Ronnie was brash with his decisions, more often than not choosing to shoot first and ask questions later. The pair have been depicted in film and television before but none have been quite like the film Legend, which sees Tom Hardy play both Ronnie and Reggie Kray. While the film does tell the story of both men and their criminal empire, more focus is given to the life of Reggie and in particular, the relationship he had with his wife, Frances (Emily Browning).Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of L.A. Confidential, Legend is a violent and darkly funny insight into the criminal underworld of London's East End in the 1960s, ruled by the Kray twins.My biggest concern going into Legend was that Tom Hardy playing the role of both brothers would become a gimmick and slight distraction from the story the film is trying to tell. It took me a few scenes to get over it but after that, in a weird way, it's easy to forget you are watching one man play two characters on screen at the same time. This is all down to Hardy's brilliant double performance.He captures the essence of each character so well; the suaveness of Reggie and the aggressive side of Ronnie, once again showing how different they could be as well as how similar they also were at times. In an ideal world, it would be great to see Hardy pick up both a nomination for Best Actor (Reggie) and Best Supporting Actor (Ronnie). It would be very unlikely but very deserved.Emily Browning, starring and narrating as Frances, also gives a memorable performance, showing how vulnerable even those loved by the Krays could end up being. As much as she loved Reggie, she spent a lot of time putting on a brave face and the lifestyle he chose to live ended up eating away at her mind.Brian Helgeland's film has been accused of glamourising the Kray twins and their crimes however, in a Q&A after the film, Helgeland refused to agree that his film did this. He argued that the characters were already considered glamorous, due to the lifestyle they led, but in no way was he championing what they did.Helgeland directs in the stylish way that you would associate with many gangster films and his screenplay is both brutal and, in places, devilishly funny. His film is brought to life with the help of some wonderful production design by Tom Conroy and slick cinematography from Dick Pope.There are some great choices in music included on the film's soundtrack too, Booker T's Green Onions and I'm Into Something Good by Herman's Hermits perfectly accompanying the stylish visuals of the film.Whether or not the Krays were stylish is a matter of opinion but there is no denying that Brian Helgeland's Legend is a very well made gangster film that certainly aims high yet fails to reach the heights of Goodfellas or The Godfather films.",8,11,19,8 September 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," The latest X-Men instalment fails to live up to its name
","Five months into 2016 and we are already in our fourth comic-book movie of the year. We've had the fast-talking Deadpool, the gladiatorial battle of Batman v Superman and an epic showdown between superheroes in Captain America: Civil War but now it's the turn of the X-Men in X-Men: Apocalypse, a film that doesn't quite live up to its name.After events in Washington DC, the X-Men are disbanded and living as normal a life as they can. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) runs a school for the 'gifted' mutants and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), who is seen as a hero to mutants after her actions in Washington DC, goes in search of Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a teleporter. When the one considered to be the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), awakens from a deep sleep in 1983 Cairo and gathers his Four Horsemen; Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), he plans to destroy the Earth and rebuild it in his own image.With this threat against the world looming ever large, the X-Men must unite to save it and its population, human and mutant.The biggest problem this film had was its titular villain, Apocalypse. He's just so dull and lacks any character that could have made him an interesting opponent for the X-Men. A talent like Oscar Isaac tries his best to make it work but overall, he deserves better from the writing team.It's the writing in this film that really does hold it back as well. The story feels flat, the dialogue is unbearably corny in places and there is no real room for any real character development. It's a film that runs for far too long also, coming in at just under two and a half hours, meaning there are quite a few moments that feel like they drag. It doesn't help when someone like Jennifer Lawrence is intent on sleepwalking her way through the film.The film does have some genuinely good moments, and you won't be surprised to hear that Evan Peters' Quicksilver is involved in two of them. He gets a moment similar to that in Days of Future Past, the only difference here is that it's at a really dramatic moment which the comedic elements totally nullify. No surprise either that Michael Fassbender gets a few of the more memorable as both he and James McAvoy are once again the real stand out performers.These films have never really been about going for all out spectacle however, in this one they go all guns blazing with the finale and try to deliver a huge action set-piece. Some of it works but unfortunately, the whole thing feels all too unimpressive thanks to some some dodgy CGI and uninspired fight choreography.Introducing a slate of new mutants mightn't have helped their cause in this case because they try to juggle the finale to showcase all of the talents that these mutants possess. I've spoken about the lack of character development already and it just seems strange to me that, apart from Magneto, the villains are totally void of it. Storm, Angel and Psylocke are all poorly served by the story and feel more like mere henchmen than powerful mutants. Out of all the new recruits, I was most happy with Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler played by Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee respectively. Jean Grey and Scott Summers in particular are dealt a better hand by the story and one of them gets one of the film's best moments, almost feeling like a middle finger to how that same character was treated in The Last Stand. There's also a very familiar face that turns up towards the end and his involvement was more welcome than I was thinking it would be.I can't say X-Men: Apocalypse is terrible because it's far from being terrible. It just doesn't live up to the standards set by First Class or Days of Future Past, which is quite disappointing. The final part of the finale and the film's closing moments do have me excited for the next instalment. Who knows, with this new team it could be the best yet.",6,23,50,22 May 2016
Ex Machina," The perfect debut for director Alex Garland
","Ex Machina is a film that I was gutted to miss out on when it was in cinemas. I heard nothing but positive things about it and now I know why. It is certainly one of the best films I have seen this year.Alex Garland, known for his writing on both 28 Days Later and Sunshine, makes his directorial debut and believe me when I say that it is one of the most impressive debuts I have ever seen.Garland's film explores themes such as artificial intelligence and the human mind, in particular how it can be manipulated and the question of whether you can really tell what a person is really thinking.If I'm honest, I felt throughout that something bad was going to happen however saying that, I was utterly shocked at the way it did go. Predictability can be a weakness in films but the ending totally threw me in Ex Machina.Quite often, films about artificial intelligence run at a slow pace that may not suit some; just look at Blade Runner as an example. When a film is so dedicated to and intricate in its storytelling, I can't help but sit back and take it all in, no matter if it is a slow burner.The film is helped by some truly wonderful performances from the main three members of the cast. Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac all delve so much in to the psyche of their characters, Vikander in particular making it believable that she isn't human after all.Ex Machina is one of the most thought provoking films of the last decade.

Everest," Stunning and immersive cinematic experience that takes you to the top of Everest
","Remember when the IMAX format was used sparingly? There would only be a select few films a year released in the said format but now it seems to have become a bit of a gimmick. Many films released in IMAX screens nowadays don't take full advantage of the format and use it as a ploy to make more money.Then there are films like Everest. Everest is more of an experience as opposed to just a film, along the same lines as Gravity. While it doesn't reach the same heights as Gravity, Everest makes full use of the larger image and sharper sound that the IMAX format offers.In 1996, a climbing expedition, led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), aimed to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Often regarded as one of the most dangerous places on the planet, Everest takes no prisoners; a fact we are made well aware of before the film even gets going.When a severe snow storm hits the mountain while Hall and his party are on their way down from the summit, they face a monumental challenge to stay alive. The brutality of Mother Nature certainly takes its toll however, it also brings out the one thing that every human possesses; the natural instinct to survive.Everest is by no means a classic but it is a powerful example of how spectacle and narrative can be combined to great effect. We all know just how big Everest is but through Salvatore Totino's cinematography and some well executed shots, the sheer scale of the mountain becomes something else entirely. The mountain is brought to life in the film as one of the most beautiful and scary places on Earth.As expected nowadays, the special effects are flawless and on an IMAX screen, Everest looks stunning. The brilliant sound editing adds to a totally immersive experience for the audience.At the heart of Everest and amidst all the glorious visuals is a moving story about survival with a well written screenplay from William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy. They avoid turning Everest into your usual cheesy disaster movie which may be down to the fact that this is based on a true story and there were fatalities.Each and every one of the cast delivers a good performance and no one lets the film down in any way. I thought Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin and Emily Watson were the best of the bunch and was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal play a smaller part in proceedings than I initially thought he would. Robin Wright and Keira Knightley too have small roles but they both sell it as the wives at home waiting to hear news on their husbands.Everest is quite an intense ride that pushes the IMAX format to its absolute limits. Stunning visuals and solid performances make it a film you have to see on the biggest screen possible and definitely one of the best films to involve mountain climbing, better than Vertical Limit anyway.",8,2,5,19 September 2015
La La Land," You'll be toe-tapping from start to finish
","You know when you're watching a film that you just don't want to end, and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then? I had that feeling with La La Land, the new film from Damien Chazelle, who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years ago.With La La Land, Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't heard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in the coming months.Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet. The two meet and fall in love but it's their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart.The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully crafted a film it is; the story, performances, music, dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience. I genuinely can't find one single fault in this film.Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker, writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy. The whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals, a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying. The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los Angeles to life, awash with colour, while his swift camera-work, including some impressive long takes, in particular through the dance numbers, immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musical.Coming to the performances, La La Land features two superb lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, both giving arguably their best performance to date. Gosling has really grown on me as an actor, maturing into one of the best in the business today. He proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and he proves it yet again here. Stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in La La Land, singing and dancing her way into our hearts. The pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards season.Justin Hurwitz's score and the original songs in La La Land, along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences, including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film, heighten the film's level of originality, maintaining that energy Chapelle's films possess.I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land. I fell in love with it and I'm sure many more will do so too.",10,233,434,8 October 2016
Snowden," Good enough but it should have been much better
","Oliver Stone has made a number of biographical dramas over the years, bringing us films such as The Doors, Nixon and W., as well as dramas based on events in American history such as JFK and World Trade Centre. With Snowden, Stone tells the story of one of the biggest National Security leaks in American history.Stone's film chronicles the life of Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), from when he joined the CIA in 2004 up until 2013, when he leaked classified information regarding the illegal surveillance of American citizens to journalists working for The Guardian newspaper.Snowden struggles with the morality of techniques he's asked to deploy while working for both the CIA and NSA, while also struggling to juggle those pressures with maintaining a stable relationship with Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley).Snowden is by no means a bad film but I just couldn't help but feel that it should have been better. This is a film about one of the most important government leaks of all time but the film almost feels as if it's trying to play it all down. I think it's the pacing and the similarity between a lot of the scenes in the film that make it drag a little when it would have worked so much better as a fast-paced drama filled with urgency. The film works best when we see Snowden and the three journalists holed-up inside a Hong Kong hotel room discussing how they can get the story out before they're found by the American government, but we don't get enough of that.Coming to the performances, Snowden possesses a very good lead in Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's one of my favourite actors and it's so good to see him to continue to work with some of the biggest directors. Shailene Woodley heads the supporting cast as Snowden's love interest Lindsay and she does a fine job but my favourite supporting cast member was Zachary Quinto as Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists Snowden meets with, which is probably why I wanted there to be more scenes in that hotel room.One of the worst decisions made by Oliver Stone was to have Edward Snowden himself appear in the film right at the very end. Sure, have photos and clips of him during the end credits but when Gordon-Levitt has played the man for 99% of the film, it just took me out of the film a fair bit. It didn't really fit for me.Snowden rather feels like a bit of a missed opportunity when I think about it. It just felt all too Hollywood.",6,5,11,16 October 2016
Sicario," A simple premise delivered so effectively by Denis Villeneuve
","When settling down to watch Denis Villeneuve's Sicario, I was thinking back to his previous two films, Prisoners and Enemy. Both were extremely tense and Sicario is no different, in fact, Sicario is one of the most tense cinematic experiences you could have in 2015.Emily Blunt stars as Kate Macer, an FBI agent who does everything by the book, is recruited by government official, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), to join a task force in tracking down a drug lord responsible for bringing drugs across the border between the United States and Mexico.With the man they are chasing being directly responsible for the death of a number of her fellow agents in the kidnapping response team, Macer is more than keen to joint the hunt but when the truth begins to unravel, she finds herself in real danger.What makes Villeneuve such an enticing director is his ability to keep an audience on the edge of their seat from start to finish. Prisoners was emotionally draining while Enemy was downright weird, culminating in one of the most shocking endings I've ever seen.Sicario is neither emotionally draining or weird but Villeneuve's film perfectly builds tension around Macer's journey towards justice. It's a simple premise yet the film is so effective in its delivery that Villeneuve has warranted his place as one of the best directors of the thriller genre working today. Villeneuve manages to get the best from his cast in his films and Sicario is no different. Emily Blunt gives a career best performance as Kate Macer; brilliantly balancing both the experienced and naive sides to her character. Josh Brolin is his usual grizzled self, which is always great to watch, and Benicio del Toro gets his teeth into the mysterious Alejandro Gillick, a man who keeps Macer well and truly on her toes. As well as boasting some great performances, Sicario is also beautifully shot with some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins, somewhat a legend in his field. A story can be well told in a film but another dimension is added when the visuals are of such a high order. Deakin's camera work combined with Johann Johannsson's score makes for a real treat, in particular one tunnel sequence late in the film.Sicario may mean hit-man in Mexico but in cinema, Sicario simply means excellence.",8,4,11,26 September 2015
Steve Jobs," Michael Fassbender and Aaron Sorkin play quite beautifully together in Danny Boyle's orchestra
","A film about Steve Jobs may not be to everyone's taste but before you judge a book by its cover, I will let you know that there is no Ashton Kutcher in sight. A film about Steve Jobs directed by Danny Boyle, written by Aaron Sorkin and with a fantastic lead performance from Michael Fassbender however, and you have an irresistible film on your hands.Set backstage across three separate and iconic product launches; the Apple Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Computer in 1988 and the iMac launch in 1998, Steve Jobs is a compelling look at the man so hell bent on bringing the digital revolution.Jobs (Michael Fassbender) certainly had his flaws and while preparing for these product launches, various stumbling blocks begin to appear, whether they be technical difficulties or personal issues with friends and family choosing to surface at the worst times.His likeness to Jobs has been questioned but there is no doubt that Michael Fassbender revels in the lead role of Danny Boyle's biopic. In fact, Fassbender has never been better, perfectly capturing the essence of the man so hooked on bringing humanity into the digital age that he nearly lost his own humanity in the process.You sense a change in Jobs' personality over the three product launches and Fassbender does a great job in portraying this. I'm sure we will be seeing him get a lot of nominations come awards season. Fassbender is joined by a supporting cast who are sure as hell firing off all cylinders too. Kate Winslet is the stand-out as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' closest colleague, providing our protagonist with the human touch that stops him from becoming an android 24/7. Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen and Michael Stuhlbarg all play their part in making Steve Jobs such an enjoyable watch too.The standard of the film is undoubtedly raised by the impressive screenplay from Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin writes like no other screenwriter and his Steve Jobs screenplay is easily one of the best of the year. Combine his words with the performances and it really is a verbal onslaught that you do not want to miss. Danny Boyle's film is given a further injection of energy thanks to some sharp editing and a subtle soundtrack to accompany the manic preparation Jobs faced before the launch of the three products.Steve Jobs is a film that has unfortunately not done so well in America, with Universal pulling the film from 2000 cinemas, but it is one of the essential films you should watch this year. It's not as good as The Social Network but I reckon it faces the same problem with people not interested in seeing a film about its subject. I am glad to say though that, like The Social Network, it's a much better film than I first thought it ever could be.",8,0,4,14 November 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," The Coen brothers are far from their best in this hit and miss comedy
","No other filmmakers out there today have a more diverse filmography than the Coen brothers. For over thirty years now, the Coen brothers have been bringing us films that span across a wide array of genres. Comedy, gangster, thriller, Western and even romance have all been covered by the duo, each varying in their levels of absurdity.Their latest effort, Hail, Caesar!, is a comedy that was amongst my list of highly anticipated films of 2016. The Coen brothers are enough of a draw for me but when you look at the cast they assembled, you'd be crazy not to get excited. How disappointing it is for me to say that this is not the film I was hoping for, finding the Coen brothers far from their best.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is head of production at Capitol Pictures in 1951 Los Angeles. Also working as the studio's fixer, Mannix keeps a close eye on the goings on at the studio, keeping any scandalous behaviour of its stars out of the press as much as he can.During production of the studio's next big release, Hail, Caesar!, major movie star and lead of the film, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped and held for ransom of $100,000. Mannix must solve the mystery of who has taken Whitlock, all while juggling the troubles of other stars of the studio.I found it hard to really take to the story that the Coen brothers were trying to tell in Hail, Caesar!, something I rarely say after watching one of their films. It felt very unbalanced in pace with the runtime feeling a lot longer than it actually was and, more disappointingly, came across as a bit stilted rather than a film that flows, making it harder to watch.Hail, Caesar! ultimately feels like a load of random scenes patched together to distract us away from a story that is rather weak when you compare it to other films from the Coen brothers. That's not to say these scenes ruin the film though, a song and dance number that introduces us to Channing Tatum's Burt Gurney being one of the stand-out moments. The script, written by the duo, is definitely a shining light for this film. It always seems to be the case with the Coen brothers that they manage to produce a high quality script. There are two scenes that come to mind right away; Ralph Fiennes' Lawrence Laurentz trying to get the desired pronunciation from Alden Ehrenreich's Hobie Doyle, the star of his movie, and a scene very early on in the film where Mannix is discussing the depiction of Christ in the studio's major picture with a group of leaders from different religions. I found myself enjoying the performances given by the talented cast on display. Josh Brolin gives the Coen brothers a tough lead in Mannix while George Clooney plays the goofball ever so well, just as he did in Burn After Reading. It's Alden Ehrenreich who steals the show though with his performance as Hobie Doyle, a singing Western star forced to move to a period drama in order to broaden his appeal. Ehrenreich is marvellous in the scene he shares with Ralph Fiennes, expertly conveying the limit of his abilities and innocence of his character through facial expressions.The Coen brothers once again work with cinematographer Roger Deakins on Hail, Caesar! and the results are deeply satisfying. Deakins is a master of his craft and I cannot express how much I love just how perfect he shoots night sequences. As much as I liked other aspects of the film, the lack of investment I had in the story leads me to say that Hail, Caesar! is the first major disappointment I have had at the cinema this year.",6,0,0,5 March 2016
Arrival," This generation's Close Encounters of the Third Kind
","The mystery of the unknown is something that doesn't get explored enough within science fiction. Too often we see science fiction films, particularly involving aliens, that are only interested with how we, as a species, would fight back against them.Every now and then however, we get a film like Denis Villeneuve's Arrival that comes along and offers something totally different. The film uses its tagline 'Why are they here?' quite literally to deliver one of the most fascinating films you will see all year.Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the world's leading linguists, who gets recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications. Along with mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise attempts to get answers as to why twelve alien spacecrafts have landed at different locations around the world.I had only seen three of Denis Villeneuve's previous films before yet I have been impressed with the diversity of his films, a trend he continues with Arrival. What I really admire about Villeneuve as a filmmaker is the choice he makes to not spoon feed the audience with every single piece of information. He instead makes films to challenge the audience, leaving them to either complete the puzzle themselves or question the morality of his characters.With Arrival, Villeneuve has crafted a truly thought provoking science fiction film, telling the story in a slow yet masterful manner, leading to a beautiful pay off. The theme of communication resonates massively with the world today, the moment communication between twelve countries via satellite link breaks down summing it up quite suitably.Villeneuve's storytelling is aided by some superb cinematography from Bradford Young and a haunting score from Jóhann Jóhannsson. Young's cinematography captures the sense of wonder perfectly while Jóhannsson's score heightens the sense of mystery surrounding the alien visitors and their intentions.Coming to the performances, Arrival features a real emotional heartbeat thanks to a fantastic performance from the always dependable Amy Adams, who conveys such a wide range of emotions as Louise, growing in confidence with each session she gets with the visitors. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker offer some fine support for Adams but there is no doubting this film belongs to her.Arrival is one of the best films of the year and a really great example of science fiction filmmaking from Denis Villeneuve, who is perfectly suited to bring us the sequel to Blade Runner next year. I would happily put this film in the same league as something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, one of the all time greats of sci-fi.",10,315,563,15 October 2016
The Big Short," Great surprise package from Adam McKay
","The very idea of Adam McKay, director of Anchorman and Step Brothers, making a film about the financial crisis in the mid-2000s brought on by the uncontrolled build-up of the housing market, is one that left me scratching my head. Centred around such a serious subject, I just couldn't see what McKay would bring to the table.Well, I was totally wrong to judge McKay before seeing The Big Short because he does one hell of a job with this film. Feeling almost like a docu-drama at times, The Big Short is informative while packing a small yet effective emotional punch thanks to a few great performances. I left the cinema feeling both anger at how greed and ignorance let the collapse happen, and fear at how easily it seemed that it could happen again.After discovering that the housing market was extremely unstable in 2005, Michael Burry (Christian Bale) found a way to bet against it so that profits could be made from its inevitable collapse. The trouble was that none of the banks that Burry took his proposal to believed him and, thinking the market was safe, happily accepted his money.Burry's actions attract the attention of trader, Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), who soon realises that Burry was right and decides to make some money out of it too. Bennett's dealings lead to other interested parties, including Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a hedge fund manager, and retired banker, Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who helps two inexperienced investors make a profit from the situation.Now, I'm no expert in economics or the housing market and even after seeing The Big Short, I still can't claim to be. This film uses a lot of terminology that could lead to the audience getting lost but Adam McKay addresses this issue rather brilliantly with some cutaway sequences that take us away from proceedings to explain a word or phrase that people may not understand.It would be easy to have one of the main cast do this however, McKay was thinking a little bit more outside the box. There are three scenes, each containing a celebrity cameo; Margot Robbie in a bubble bath, Anthony Bourdain in his kitchen and finally, Richard Thaler and Selena Gomez playing a spot of Blackjack. I didn't think these would work at all but they genuinely did, though Margot Robbie in a bubble bath was the one where I was listening least.What impressed me most about The Big Short was just how entertaining it was. McKay, who co- wrote the film with Charles Randolph, brings his comedic elements to proceedings yet it's the surprisingly good drama, including a pretty hard-hitting finale that made me really appreciate just how good McKay's work is here. It's totally out of his comfort zone and he knocks it out of the park.The Big Short also boasts a cast that contains four top leading men who all bring their respective qualities to the film. Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt are all very good in the film but for me, Bale and Carell are the stand-outs. Bale really sells the eccentricity of Burry and Carell, who impressed me massively in Foxcatcher, captures the humanity of Baum well, a rare quality for a banker.The Big Short is a bit of a dark horse going into the awards season and, while I don't see it winning any of the big awards, it sure is a film that deserves your attention. Both the energy of McKay's filmmaking and the performances keep the film ticking over at the perfect pace.",8,0,0,21 January 2016
Straight Outta Compton," A biopic of the highest calibre
","When it comes to sending out a message, music is one of the most powerful means of communication. Some like to use violence or force but never underestimate the power that music can have. Straight Outta Compton charts the story of one hip-hop group who would go down in history as one of the most vocal and influential groups in the history of music. That group is N.W.A. When five friends; Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), combined their musical talents and formed N.W.A in 1986, they revolutionised the genre of hip-hop forever.With the help of manager, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), N.W.A were signed by Priority Records and released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, in 1988. The album caused controversy upon release and gave N.W.A the reputation of being the most dangerous group in the world.Their lyrics were said to be disrespectful of women while glorifying the criminal lifestyle and even speaking out about their deep hatred towards the police. This biopic depicts the trouble N.W.A had with the police as well as the big personalities that would cause a power struggle within the group.As well as being a great film, Straight Outta Compton is a very good biopic. With any biopic, the actors have to do justice to the public figures they are portraying and in Straight Outta Compton, the performances are of a very high standard. In particular, the three main performances stood out and show the passion that these actors had towards playing these iconic figures of hip-hop. Jason Mitchell is the one getting the most praise for his portrayal of Eazy-E, which is the hardest of the group to play in my opinion. There have been a few murmurs of award nominations and while I certainly think that might come at a stretch, I definitely wouldn't complain if Mitchell's performance was to get that sort of recognition.Corey Hawkins is impressive as Dr. Dre while O'Shea Jackson Jr. proves that he bares more than just a resemblance to his father, Ice Cube, by stepping into his shoes with brilliant confidence and presence. Paul Giamatti is also worth mentioning with his supporting turn as Jerry Heller, the man who there is most definitely more to than meets the eye.Straight Outta Compton was a real eye-opener for me when it came to N.W.A. I had no idea about what happened to cause the struggle within the group or how their run-ins with the police came about. A lengthy runtime of 147 minutes may put some people off however, with the film covering such an interesting topic and a fluid screenplay from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, the 147 minutes fly by pretty quickly.I wouldn't class myself as a die hard hip-hop fan but I can appreciate the music and lyrics, all of which is made easier with some brilliantly executed musical scenes showing the group either recording their music or performing it to thousands in sold-out arenas. There is some wonderful cinematography from Matthew Libatique and the editing by Billy Fox that brings such an energy to proceedings that you, at times, might actually think you are watching the performance from the same arena.You can sense the devotion that went into making Straight Outta Compton such a memorable experience and director F. Gary Gray really brings his A-game when it came to making the film. Gray has a history of making music videos for both Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, as well as the film Friday with Ice Cube back in 1995. Straight Outta Compton is Gray's most accomplished work yet and a film that he can be immensely proud of.",8,3,34,1 September 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bit of a car crash but not a total write off
","Batman v Superman is a mess of film but that doesn't make it absolutely terrible. It's important to understand that there were definitely enjoyable moments in the film, it's just that the film isn't very well made, the problems stemming from the overblown story and Zack Snyder's direction.The film was originally written by DC stalwart David S. Goyer with Academy Award winning writer Chris Terrio joining to help after Ben Affleck was cast as Batman. Goyer and Terrio together have written a film that, for the first hour and a half, goes down a more interesting route for a comic- book film, holding back on the action, reintroducing us to characters from Man of Steel and introducing us to the Batman side of the story. There are some interesting ideas raised however, the story is just too clunky and almost feels as if you're doing a jigsaw puzzle but the pieces don't fit, so you end up just jamming them into place. Then comes the last hour of the film, which ultimately feels rushed due to the way the first half was written. That's where Snyder as a director comes into play. He has an eye for the visuals sure, but just like Man of Steel, the pacing of the film is what lets him down. The pacing in Batman v Superman is so unbalanced that the two-and-a-half hour runtime is well and truly felt. The last hour absolutely flies by and this is where Snyder lays all his cards on the table, Batman and Superman finally face-off and then team up with Wonder Woman to take on Doomsday, the creation of Lex Luthor. Unfortunately, this is where the film disappointed me most. The fight that the whole film is based around is good while it lasts but that is the problem, it doesn't last for long at all. We have been waiting for three years to see them fight and then that's all we get? Then it ends with one of the most painstakingly annoying pieces of writing in the entire film. I would have given good money to see the fight last a lot longer and the moment they team up shortened somewhat. Batman and Superman are suddenly best friends and team up with Wonder Woman, who I will discuss later, in one of the most horrifically CGI finales in any superhero film. It was fun to watch the carnage unfold but it was just all over the place, as if there wasn't even a director calling the shots.The film doesn't come without positives mind, Ben Affleck's performance as both Bruce Wayne and Batman being the main one. Affleck's Dark Knight is probably the most loyal live action version we've seen and he really carries the film on his own at times. The fact they decided to write him as a man who has been donning the cape for twenty years works ever so well in his favour, giving this version of Batman a real sense of anger and determination to bring Superman down. He gets the best moment of the film as well when he takes down a warehouse of bad guys, as seen in the trailer. I think anyone who originally slated the casting of Affleck will be eating their words by the end of the film.Batman getting such a prominent chuck of the film made me feel a little sorry for Henry Cavill in the role of Superman. I liked Cavill in Man of Steel and he does well with what he gets here, it's just that it feels almost as if no one knows how to write Superman for the big screen, coming across as a bit of a side character instead. Maybe Snyder just doesn't understand the idea of Superman.Then there are the supporting players of the film, some familiar faces from Man of Steel and some new ones altogether. The best of the bunch is Lex Luthor played by Jesse Eisenberg, who channels Heath Ledger's Joker combined with his Mark Zuckerberg from The Social Network. Eisenberg was another who faced a backlash when cast and I think he brings an interesting new take on the character to this film. Gal Gadot shows up as both Diana Prince and Wonder Woman, the latter supposedly stealing the show for many people yet I don't think she did enough to warrant that. I am interested to see just what they do in her solo film next year. Amy Adams returns and feels utterly wasted as Lois Lane while Jeremy Irons makes for a good Alfred.I did have a problem with how they teased the other members of the Justice League in this film. Whether it be through dream sequences or Lex Luthor's confidential files, that magically has the character logos already established, it all just felt forced. This is where I feel they're rushing into the Justice League and not taking a lesson from Marvel, taking the time to introduce them all in solo films first. I just don't know if they're going to pull it off, particularly if Zack Snyder is directing.",4,2,5,26 March 2016
Deadpool," Entertaining enough but could and probably should have been better
","After a glorious marketing campaign, the 'Merc with a Mouth' has finally arrived in Deadpool, a film that proves the power fans can have. In the pipeline since 2004, Deadpool was green lit after test footage leaked online during the 2014 Comic-Con. The footage was so well received that the studio had no choice but to announce Deadpool, a film his fans had been well and truly waiting for.Being an R rated film in America and a 15 over here, along with the fact he breaks the fourth wall and is very meta, Deadpool offered audiences an escape from the conventional superhero adventure we are so used to seeing. How unfortunate then that it feels like a bit of wasted opportunity.After falling in love with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and being diagnosed with multiple organ cancer, mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), is offered a chance by Ajax (Ed Skrein) to take part in an experiment that will cure his cancer.The treatment sees Wade injected with a serum designed to unlock mutated cells, and after suffering through torture at the hands of Ajax and Angel Dust (Gina Carano), Wade is left disfigured. Out for revenge on Ajax, Wade becomes Deadpool, the antihero who can't help but run his mouth.Deadpool is Ryan Reynold's passion project, he is as much a fan as those who went nuts over the leaked test footage, and he really is the only person you could imagine playing the character. He is Deadpool in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark or Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Reynolds' performance as Deadpool is not one for the ages but is is one that works well within the film. I've always liked Reynolds as a comedic actor and it's that skill set that brings about the film's more entertaining moments. Deadpool wastes no time in throwing us right into the action with an opening title sequence that is both funny and deliriously entertaining. From there, we see Wade's story in flashbacks until we are fully caught up and the film begins to tread that ever-so-familiar formula found in most superhero films. If only the film carried on the way it started. It moves at such a fast pace, thanks to the joke-fuelled screenplay by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, and the frantic action directed by Tim Miller, in his directorial debut. One thing that I found quite disappointing was that quite a number of the jokes cheapen the film and I didn't really take to the meta side of the character much. Deadpool was at its best when combining the action with his sense of humour.Coming to the performances, Deadpool doesn't really have a lot to shout about. Reynolds is of course the star of the show so he gets the majority of screen time and jokes, meaning that others are simply shoved to the side or wasted. T.J. Miller was pretty funny as Wade's friend, Weasel, who gets quite a few laughs but Morena Baccarin is dealt a pretty underwhelming hand as Vanessa. The villains are rather unforgettable too, Ed Skrein and Gina Carano both delivering unspectacular performances.Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) were welcome additions to aid Deadpool in his quest for revenge but even then, they don't really do much at all.The funniest moments come when the film isn't trying too hard and there is a homage to everybody's favourite fourth wall breaking character in a post credits scene that tickled me. Deadpool is certainly enjoyable however I don't really think it's as smart or funny as it thinks it is.",6,10,33,10 February 2016
Spectre," James Bond will return... hopefully so will Daniel Craig
","Opening with an impressive tracking shot of James Bond making his way through the streets and rooftops of Mexico City during the Day of the Dead festivities, Spectre is a fourth outing as 007 for Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes' second spin in the director's chair that exudes confidence from beginning to end.After the marvellous Skyfall, Spectre had a lot to live up to and, while it doesn't quite reach the same heights as either Casino Royale or Skyfall, it is an absolute joy to see everybody's favourite spy in a film as good and entertaining as Spectre.When Bond (Daniel Craig) stumbles upon a cryptic message from his past, he is sent on a trail to uncover the mysterious organisation behind a number of terrorist attacks around the globe. With the double-0 program under serious threat, M (Ralph Fiennes) is left fighting political forces in order to keep the secret service alive. Bond, on his mission, discovers the organisation known as SPECTRE, headed by Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz), and soon realises the terrible truth behind their intentions.Daniel Craig took to the role of James Bond like a duck takes to water back in 2006 however, in Spectre, we see Craig in a whole new light while playing Bond. Spectre sees Craig more Bond-like than in any of his previous outings.While we still see the vulnerable side to Craig's Bond, in Spectre Craig is the suave and sophisticated 007 that some had doubts about him ever becoming. Craig once again delivers a fine performance as Bond, growing more and more into the role with each film. I would be happy to see him continue playing Bond for as many films as possible.Bond's relatively new MI6 colleagues get their fair share of screen time in Spectre and not one of them wastes the chance with Ralph Fiennes' M, Naomie Harris' Moneypenny and Ben Whishaw's Q giving Craig ample support.Lea Seydoux stars as Dr Madeleine Swann, a key component in Bond's quest to find SPECTRE. Seydoux does her best with what she's given, it's just unfortunate that her character feels a little underwritten. Unfortunately, Monica Bellucci fares a little worse than Seydoux and ends up feeling way too underused, coming across as the woman just 'there' for Bond to sleep with.Then there are the villains of the film. Craig's Bond films have seen some good villains already in the form of Le Chiffre from Casino Royale or Silva from Skyfall, and Christoph Waltz's Franz Oberhauser is no exception. As a senior member of SPECTRE, Waltz is wonderfully sinister and he brings all of his quality to proceedings. Dave Bautista also stars as Mr Hinx, an assassin ranked highly within SPECTRE and easily the greatest physical threat that Craig has ever faced as Bond. Bautista fills the screen with his intimidating presence and makes Bond look like your average man but rather annoyingly, we don't see enough of him.Sam Mendes, who blew us all away with Skyfall, impresses again with Spectre, carrying on the story that Craig's Bond has now developed through four films and brings some more classic Bond elements to the table, as he gradually did in Skyfall. I really like the way the story carries over into each of Craig's Bond films and the unravelling of Oberhauser's connection with Bond was one that gave me goosebumps, thanks to the terrific job by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan on the story and screenplay along with Jez Butterworth.One of the most important features of any Bond film is its action sequences. Spectre opens with a spectacular fight aboard an out of control helicopter above the streets of Mexico City. It's a thrilling start however, none of the action sequences that come after really top it. There's a car chase between Bond and Mr Hinx through the streets of Rome yet it all feels a little flat as they are just about the only ones on the road. There is no sense of peril to the sequence and it feels like you are watching a car advert at times but there is a nice touch involving Bond trying to speed up the older driver in front of him.The train fight between Mr Hinx and Bond is another highlight and a great throwback to the brutal fight between Bond and Grant in From Russia With Love. The choice to use no music in this scene is a master stroke and heightens the sense of brutality this scene possesses.Following the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins from Skyfall was going to be one hard task but it is one that Hoyte van Hoytema does an admirable job in. He, like Deakins, has an eye for how to shoot night sequences so effectively and brings the variety of locations to life gloriously on the big screen. Thomas Newman's score accompanies the film well but it doesn't really feel much different to his work on Skyfall, which was a little disappointing.Which leads me to Sam Smith's Writing's on the Wall, the theme to Spectre. I was a little sceptical about the song at first however, having now heard it play with the haunting title sequence, I find myself really liking it. It really does fit the whole feel of the film very well indeed.There are rumours that Spectre could be the final time we will see Daniel Craig as Bond. While he still has his doubters and with the list of new Bond candidates starting to circulate, I was left wishing for an encore. James Bond will return for sure, and I hope Daniel Craig does as well.",8,23,56,28 October 2015
The Nice Guys," Crowe and Gosling are brilliant together in another winner from Shane Black
","Yes, oh yes, The Nice Guys is every bit the hilarious and entertaining movie I was hoping for. Part action, part buddy comedy, The Nice Guys is the latest movie from Shane Black and believe me when I tell you, there is so much fun to be had at the cinema with this one.Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a hardened private eye who chooses violence as his method of business. On the other hand, Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a bit of a bumbling private eye, not akin to the violent methods of Healy's choosing.When the mismatched duo are paired together to investigate the death of fading porn star, Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), they begin to unravel a web of corruption and lies, pointing toward murder over suicide. They are hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl who holds the key to the whole conspiracy, before others with cruel intentions do.First things first, The Nice Guys is really driven by the great on-screen partnership of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, who share such an unbelievably good chemistry as the two private eyes who couldn't be more different.This is the best Crowe has been since State of Play in 2009 and he has no trouble at all selling the tough guy persona of Healy. The comedy was something I thought Crowe could struggle with however, having seen him do a few interviews recently and after his performance in The Nice Guys, I had no need to worry.Crowe is funny in this but Gosling is absolutely hilarious. He proved he could do comedy in Crazy, Stupid, Love but there is so much more to the comedy he performs in The Nice Guys. A lot of it is verbal but there are some moments of physical comedy that Gosling nails, particularly one sequence in the movie's finale that was rather quite brilliant.The two are aided by a brilliant script, full of enough wit and quips, written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi. Black is no stranger to writing both movies and characters of similar ilk, having written the first two Lethal Weapon movies and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which he also directed. It's not only Crowe and Gosling who benefit from the script either with Matt Bomer shining as the sinister John Boy and Angourie Rice almost stealing the show as Holly March, Holland's rather persistent daughter.I understand that The Nice Guys hasn't performed well so far at the box-office which is a real shame. I urge anyone who likes to be entertained to go and spend two hours watching this at the cinema. Trust me, those two hours will fly by and we could do with having more movies like this being made.",8,2,5,28 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Welcome back Mr Gibson
","When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.",10,521,765,25 September 2016
The Martian," Further proof that Ridley Scott is at his best when doing sci-fi
","As a genre, sci-fi quite often provides audiences with both thrilling and thought provoking films. Over the past decade there have been some great entries into the genre from filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Alfonso Cuaron however, 2015 sees a director return to form in the genre he made his name in.Ridley Scott is responsible for arguably two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made in Alien and Blade Runner, and while Prometheus may not have been a great prequel to the former in 2012, there is no denying that Scott is at his strongest when working within the genre. The Martian is Scott's latest venture into sci-fi and easily his best film in a while.When astronaut David Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from the rest of his crew as a result of a storm during a mission on Mars, he is presumed dead by both his crew and everyone on Earth. Stranded on Mars all alone, Watney must find a way to survive the harsh conditions of Mars while trying to communicate with NASA in order to get a rescue mission sent his way.What struck me most about The Martian is that, for a film that runs for nearly two and a half hours, it absolutely flies by. Thanks to Scott's direction, a zippy screenplay from Drew Goddard and a superb central performance from Matt Damon, The Martian has an energy running through it that will make sure the audience doesn't lose an interest. Personally, I could have watched another half an hour of it.The film also finds a perfect combination between comedy and drama, which led to a lot more laughs than I thought it would have. It exceeds in both, leading to an interesting take on the human fight for survival and one of 2015's most entertaining films.Coming to the performance of Damon as the stranded Watney, which has to go down as one my favourites of the year so far, and arguably his best performance to date. Damon sells both the tough and vulnerable sides to Watney, remaining totally watchable throughout, which is important as he shares virtually no screen time with any other actor for the whole film.The supporting cast isn't too bad either with Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Aksel Hennie and Chiwetel Ejiofor all playing a part in making The Martian such an engrossing watch. The cinematography from Dariusz Wolski impressively captures the scope of just how isolated you could be on a vast planet like Mars while also making sure that Damon remains your main focus. There is also some great choices in music for a soundtrack that accompanies the film in such a fun manner.The Martian doesn't reach the high intensity levels of recent sci-fi films such as Gravity or Interstellar but it doesn't have to. For an entertaining slice of sci-fi at the cinema, The Martian is the film for you. I will definitely have to make time to read the novel this is adapted from.",8,7,79,29 September 2015
