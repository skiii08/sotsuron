Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best of the bunch
","I was very skeptical at first about seeing this film. The hype was SO huge I was really expecting to be disappointed. Not even close. The Phantom Menace, in my humble opinion, is the best of all the Star Wars films. A great story, fantastic stunts, and amazing effects make this movie worth the 16 year wait. This one is a lot funnier than the others, and has THE coolest villain of them all, Darth Maul. With his ominous presence and ultra-cool fighting style, he was by far the best of the new characters (although he only had at the most 15 minutes of screen time). I could have lived without the Darth Maul 'situation' at the end of the movie (once you see it, you'll know what I mean). It was the only disappointment in a wonderful piece of filmmaking. If you haven't seen it, stop reading this and head to the multiplex. You'll thank me later.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
