Captain Phillips," My favourite actor, at his best.
","There are two standout performances in this.. Barkhad Abdi as the pirate leader and obviously Tom Hanks himself. Abdi was phenomenal given that this was his film debut, he showed why he was cast as this role in the worldwide search for it. There are so many moments throughout the film which I loved involving the two actors. I thought a nice touch my Greengrass was the way it ended with the nurse telling Captain Phillips that 'everything was going to be OK'.. because this repeated the words spoken by the pirate leader to Captain Phillips throughout his capture. It made me smile.The scene that proves to me why exactly in my head I deem Tom Hanks as the best actor, is actually that last scene. I have actually read too that the scene wasn't actually in the script, that it was improvised! For those unfamiliar with the scene or who have forgotten it, it is the scene where Captain Phillips has been brought aboard the US Navy ship at the end after being rescued, and is brought in to get checked out by the nurse on board. Personally I feel that it is astonishingly brilliant performing.. especially given that it is improvised and was just added in last minute. In those minutes of watching Hanks speak with the nurse, you see how what he has just endured throughout his capture has effected him enormously... as he struggles to comes to terms with being free and answering simple questions. It's so powerful to watch and I'm not ashamed to say my eyes welled up watching this film both times at that part!",8,0,2,16 February 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Lackluster, boring, complete let down
","Went to see this film with my girlfriend last night, here's my account on it. (I didn't read the books).Due to having not read the books.. I found myself asking questions about the film in which I shouldn't have had to be doing so..?1) why was Christian Grey so wealthy if his mum was a prostitute, drug addict who committed suicide? Nothing was explained as to how he acquired/earned his wealth! I only found out afterwards, discussing this with my girlfriend who had read the books!2) why did Mr. Grey have those marks on his chest?I felt that with Mr. Grey and Anna's relationship.. there wasn't even a remote, slight glimmer of chemistry between the two of them! I found their relationship boring and unbelievable. In terms of the eagerly awaited sex scenes that were so built up beforehand.. they were awful and I wanted them to end. How was S & M made boring? Haha.In terms of where the film was set... I would believe it if somebody were to tell me the film was set in three streets beside each other. I never once got the sense that they were travelling miles and miles across America? Whenever Mr. Grey went to Georgia and surprised Anna, there was absolutely no shock from her? I was baffled.Anna was made out to be really thick/stupid I think.. and she was obsessed with Mr. Grey from the very first time she met him.. interviewing him. I don't think it was justified as to why she was so? Would it not have made more sense to have Anna grow more and more obsessed with him throughout the film? No? Overall... brutal film, brutal acting and waste of my time! Won't be surprised if that's ruined Jamie Dornan's career. Money back?",5,1,5,16 February 2015
