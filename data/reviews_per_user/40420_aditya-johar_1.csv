Scarface," A above-average film that achieved greatness because of the 'glamour' syndrome..
","OK,everybody loves Scarface. From the teenage boys to the Gangsta Rappers to the general media..Everyone hails the movie. But really,as a film,Scarface is not as great as the hype has taken it to be.I like the movie,I like a lot of the dialogues. But the movie leaves too many questions left unanswered,too many things left out. It's as if they 'just happen'. One moment you'd be seeing Tony Montana negotiating with Sosa and the next thing you know he becomes a big dealer himself.Yes, all those rappers love this movie because it has everything they talk about..cocaine,girls,money. And it's glamorous. But really,if there was SOME depth it would have been a great movie,not just a good one.The rags-to-riches story is good,seems 'believable',but only if you answer a lot of the questions yourself,rather than hoping that the movie answers it for you.",7,1,2,25 May 2008
