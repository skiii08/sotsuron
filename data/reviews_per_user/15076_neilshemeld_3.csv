It," A better remake
","I watched this film in Sheffield on the 13th of September. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them.The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favorite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsg√•rd as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it was a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances",8,8,16,16 September 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Lovely stuff
","Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy film of what superhero films should look like. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky perro; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a strange movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world. This is how we should be rewarded for their fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire kitchen sink at a single movie and having every single washer and wing-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than Ragnarok.",8,3,11,5 November 2017
No Country for Old Men," Great film, Adverage ending
","No Country for Old Men had a descent story line, character development, acting, and cinematography, and still managed to disappoint me greatly with its rubbish anticlimactic ending.What is the purpose of suspense? I couldn't wait to see how the three main characters would interact when they inevitably came together. But the Coens yank the rug out from under the audience by wiping out the protagonist 75% of the way through the movie. Why waste so much time building Llewelyn Moss'(Brolin's) character and emphasizing his resourcefulness if you're going to kill him off so abruptly with no explanation? There's easily an entire scene missing. Fine, I get it: the Mexicans found him. I don't need a rosy ending, but at least reveal how his demise went down. I'm not even asking for a gory shootout sequence; just explain what led up to it. Yes, there is an underlying commentary on fate and humanity, but this movie is also an action/crime thriller where multiple peripheral characters are strangled or blown away by a sociopath's killer. It seems disingenuous to skim over the main character's death.",7,1,4,24 October 2017
