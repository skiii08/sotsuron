The Ring," Very Scary, Very good movie!!!!
","Excellent horror movie, I couldn't sleep well last night, I believe is going to be another successful franchise like or better than 'Alien', 'The Exorcist' or 'Scream'. The important thing in a horror movie is not the special effects and monsters that look fake, its the story and the background that surround the characters, if the director creates and mix right the ingredients he or she has a hit, I haven't seen the original I hope to see it later.  Please don't bring kids to the theater, and I recommend don't drink any beverage with caffeine that day.",10,0,0,20 October 2002
Alien," A very good movie
",Ridley Scott is a great director when I first saw this movie I follow the crew of the Nostromo and felt their pain and suffering like mine. The atmosphere is very real and the trick of hiding the monster in that big ship with dark corridors make my heart run as the movie was coming to the climax.,10,0,1,28 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A big disappointment
","The new star wars is a long bad movie, is has too many cgi shots and few or none emotions, you feel sometimes watching a documentary about space politics, even that the cgi shots are good, you don't feel any real connection with the characters or the story, terrible acting and bad direction, if George Lucas plans to do a special edition my advice, cut 30 minutes of the movie or more keep the action parts.The actor that I like on this movie was Ewan as Obi Wan, the emperor and Jango Fett, but the one that represents Anakin is a terrible actor, you don't see the romance with the senator Amidala, no chemistry and that can't be fixed with any special effect.",4,0,1,12 December 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Excellent conclusion to the trilogy
","One of the best movies, excellent special effects, great characters, interesting plot, I recommend this movie to the fans of the original Matrix, I don't understand why people is complaining this end is better that the 'normal end' in many movies today.",10,0,1,12 November 2003
Aliens," One of the best sequels in Science fiction
","Cameron's respect of the original Alien story and character of Ripley made one of the best movies combining action, suspense, and horror. You care about the characters, and the technology looks realistic even for today standards, the Aliens are very scary too.",10,0,0,21 November 2002
The Dark Knight," This Batman is not for kids is a police movie
","The movie is good, but this is not a movie for kids, for them is boring, Batman is too dark, is a good movie but I can't agree when people start writing that is the best superhero movie of all time, the best superhero movie of all time is Superman with Cristopher Reeve and the first Spider Man because this movies take into account the fantasy elements of the comics and are fun to watch, here we have a normal guy that is Batman a normal criminal that is the joker and a normal city, no more fantasy is not for kids, but is not the best superhero movie of all time everything looks dark and flat. Good acting from Bale, Caine, and the rest of the cast but is not a movie to take children.",6,1,3,22 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent movie almost as good as the originals
","Well I liked the movie a lot, the special effects were excellent and this time the plot is much better and interesting than the other two prequels, was good to see old characters back and the evolution of the space ships of the original star wars, George Lucas did a great job with this movie the character of the emperor is a villain that you would like to hate, great movie very entertaining to watch again and again.Chewbacca deserves and Oscar for best actor same as Yoda, I liked all the cgi characters specially Anakin Skywalker, no seriously is a great movie for the kid that everybody has inside.",10,3,7,21 May 2005
Amélie," Didn't make me feel empty
","I like this movie is different, and I believe everybody that has imagination can identify with the girl, other Hollywood movies that I went to see this summer make me feel empty in two ways bad scripts and overuse of special effects, this movie has substance, characters and even special effects!!!",Null,0,1,13 September 2002
True Romance," A BAD MOVIE WITH EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE
","All the teenagers that collect guns are going to like this movie but for me was pretty bad, boring and too violent, blood everywhere I didn´t enjoy at all this movie, I don´t understand whats the big deal also I didnt like any of the characters. Quarantino is not the best writter and likes blood to much, is not a movie for everybody, I should add that has too many bullets and could have been done much better with less blood and violence, but is Quarantino, this also give me an excuse to look for better movies and choose more carefully. My advice skip this movie and look for something better, is a waste of time.",1,15,52,22 April 2004
Princess Mononoke," Its no so good!!!!
","Well, I tried to enjoy this movie but I didn't like it, maybe I'm not accustomed to Japanese anime but for me all the characters were too superficial. I expected deeper emotions between the princess and the hero, and more humor. I didn't identify with any character, the movie takes itself too seriously and cares more about nature/man conflict than characters.",Null,1,2,16 September 2002
