The Avengers," Spectacular movie!
","The movie is just spectacular! From the beginning to the end, you will enjoy every piece of it. Every character played its real role, showing everybody's special powers without overdosing the expectators.The staff is outstanding! Watching Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston performing together was just amazing!The story, the special effects, the sound the role of each character were just fabulous and I would dare to say that is the best 'superhero' movie I've ever seen in my whole life! Better than each individual movie of Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and other famous superheroes.It's worth spend the time to go to the movie theater and watch this masterpiece.Enjoy!",10,6,13,27 April 2012
