Minority Report," I am so tired of Spielberg
","Knowing that this will make it to the '0 out of 189 people found the following comment useful' category I will say this: I thought of giving Spielberg one more chance after the abysmal 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' where he destroyed the undisputed talents of Haley J. Osment. Boy was it a mistake to give him that chance.It is not enough that the movie was a run-of-the-mill chase-the-good-guy movie which they've made since 1903. Nor was it that it had to last for two and a half hours with absolutely no reason. No, the worst thing was that it had the same crappy over-contrast no-subtleties look as the Saving Private Ryan or the otherwise potentially good Band of Brothers. Really, Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, which was shot on PAL Digital Video cameras looked better than this zillion dollar turd.And somehow, this story was supposed to be originally written by Philip K. Dick. They've hidden the original very well, even better than with Total Recall.I made this promise in the late 1980's, but this time I'll keep it: I will never ever watch a Steven Spielberg movie again. Never. Ever. Vote me to hell, I don't care.",2,8,16,2 October 2005
