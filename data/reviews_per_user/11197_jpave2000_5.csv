First Man," Excellent & Beautiful
","Chazelle beautifully takes viewers on an emotional and disorienting journey through the most formidable years of Armstrong's life and the risks these pioneers of space exploration took. If you're looking for an Apollo 13 or Right Stuff experience solely focused on the endevours of NASA and the American triumph in the Cold War space race, you may be disappointed by First Man. This is not a movie about Apollo 11. While Apollo 11 and the journey to the moon are the primary focus of Neil Armstrong's experience in First Man, this movie is instead exactly what Chazelle promises in the choice for the film's title; A biopic on the First Man. In First Man, we get a glimpse inside the soul and character of Neil Armstrong. Gosling truly nailed it. His portrayal of Armstrong's calm coolness in the face of extreme danger, his quiet and inwardly shy demeanor, and his contemplative stares. Gosling really shines when we see Armstrong's stunted, yet deeply personal emotions, even to the point of appearing cold to the ones closest to him. The real heart of the movie appears during Armstrong's flight missions on Gemini 8 and Apollo 11. Chazelle does a great job showing the audience how rickety the earliest flying machines were and how limited the astronaut's visual field was. The sounds and shrieks had me on the edge of my seat. The limited space in the space shuttles is claustrophobic and the appearance of the moon as the Apollo 11 space shuttle approaches its surface is as eerie as the actual nasa footage.This movie was definitely a must see. I've never seen a movie that more accurately depicts the beauty and creepiness the astronauts of the early space shuttle have described.",9,13,28,14 October 2018
Saving Private Ryan," 'The war movie to end all war movies'
","The sheer gore and brutality of war was made more real to me by this one movie. I was only in eighth grade at the time, yet I made 5 consecutive solo trips down to the local theater to see this film again and again. I was truly mesmerized by the cinematic beauty and the realistic portrayal of comradery among the main characters of the plot. This truly is one of the greatest movies of all time. To quote the WWII historian Steven Ambrose, Saving Private Ryan is 'The war movie to end all war movies.'",10,3,6,14 March 2018
Prisoners," Terrific!
","This was the first Denis Villeneuve movie I ever saw and I'm hooked! He's my new favorite director out there. Soon after I watched Incendies, Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, each one further proving how incredibly talented this director is. Prisoners is haunting, dark and addicting. Well acted and refreshingly original, I could watch this movie over and over and never get bored.",10,1,1,14 March 2018
Whiplash," Amazing! An instant classic!
","Not knowing anything about Damien Chazelle prior to seeing this when it came out allowed me to have very little expectations going into it. Boy was I impressed. After La La Land, it's clear Chazelle is one of the best new directors out there. It's hard to imagine that a movie about a competitive Jazz school could be as suspenseful as this. Teller is terrific and clearly a skilled drummer in his own right. J.K. Simmons' performance is one of the most deserved Academy Award winning performances in a decade. I still remember both my brother and I letting out a deep breathe after one particularly tense scene between Simmons and Teller. If you have not seen this Jazz masterpiece, add it to your WatchList ASAP!",10,2,4,14 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 7.5?
","I am shocked by the high rating for this movie. I consider a 7 to be 'good' and an 8 as 'very good.' This movie was neither. This movie, like the other two prequels, is a failure. The dialogue is painful and the acting is abysmal. Above all, the excessive CGI special effects are so bad, they distract from the movie rather than add to it. I give this movie a 4, aka 'a failure.'",4,1,10,23 December 2019
