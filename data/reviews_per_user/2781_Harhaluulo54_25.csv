Your Name.," Very typical and average story with a ripoff ending. Please read before downvoting.
","This time Makoto didn't even try to go with originality. Pretty art, cliché time travel romance, BGM which you will forget instantly after finishing the movie and characters whose specialty is capturing the characteristics of every Japanese school kid. Cherry on the cake is the lackluster ending which was the perfect way to finish average story with average conclusion. If we talk about the greatest love stories ever told, we look into Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles manga. It had the same time travel love story concept, and one of its 4 simultaneously ending time lines had this exact same ending in the stairs. Except there it was done right and here it is just a cliché. Pretty sure Makoto has read that manga and ripped off this ending from there. I am not very impressed. When it comes to the gender swapping, I have seen better anime series about cross-dressing.Kimi no Na Wa may please some casual anime fans or people who in generally are not connoisseur of entertainment and the art mediums related to TV, literature and games. After over 1000 anime series, 1500 manga series, 2000 movies and 150 games, I can say this is an average movie which tells the same story which has been told times and times again. This is nowhere near the most impressive capturing of the tale, it's just average, but well worth the watch anyway.",5,14,32,26 July 2017
Wind River," Worst movie from 2017, even The Emoji Movie was less brain dead
","Bad guys shoot, kill and rape because they are evil. 0 dimensional baddies whose only purpose is to make the viewer feel hate, but the act is so ridiculous you can only hate the writer for creating such sh!t. Cops acts like they are characters from South Park parodying the worst and most cliché law enforcement scene from any movie ever, expect they are being serious and it is not funny. Pretty sure half of them had never seen a gun before. I can't take this movie seriously in any way or form. It's utterly ridiculous and can only be viewed as an insult towards the viewer's intelligent.",1,16,44,22 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Worse than mindless action movies usually are
","The movie's title doesn't have the words 'Star' and 'Wars' in it. I call this honesty. Rogue One is non-canon filler taking place in the Star Wars universe. Pure milking basically. While this is not necessarily a bad idea as pure mindless action is often better than movies which try to be smart, but fail miserably - Rogue One's only redeeming quality is the CGI budget. There is nothing that stands out. Nothing positive I mean. The most memorable part for me is the hideously bad acting - which sadly was the main basis for any entertainment value this holds. Mads Mikkelsen is pretty much the only person who can act. The rest are fellows you would expect to do kids' reality TV for living. Somehow they end up here. The OST is horrible. It's basically Mad Max with 5% success ration. The movie is pure mindless action. There is no room left for character development, world or plot building - not even for pandering. Just space lasers making sounds in space because that's how science works and people hunting down a 3,5'' hdd because the future is so advanced and sci-fi. Truly one boring experience which doesn't have anything to offer. Except great amount of overused clichés, logic failures, character flaws and visually told scenes which execution you can't but laugh at.",3,1,3,2 April 2017
Passengers," Not suitable for anyone who knows sci-fi
","'A spacecraft traveling to a distant colony planet and transporting thousands of people has a malfunction in its sleep chambers. As a result, two passengers are awakened 90 years early.'The whole premise of this movie is just an excuse to create romance settings with 'the only two persons alive' trope. In short, this is a romance movie comparable to chaos flicks. One thing to remember here is the general IMDb advice 'the movie is probably watchable if it is over 5.0, unless it is romance.' In this case, 7.0 was not enough.Since the only thing in this movie is the romance, let's talk about it. Short thoughts here:-It sucks.Longer thoughts here:<ul><li>Jennifer Lawrence can't act. She is herself once again. --- I wonder is Lawrence understands how forced she sounds whenever she yells and cries. --- Her performance in the movie 'American Hustle' was identical. --- Chris 'the meme guy' Pratt can't act. He is himself once again. --- This could be the same character from Guardians of the Galaxy and no one could tell the difference. --- Neither of them are likable and a romance between these two people is only bad celebrity shipping as the characters themselves have no personality of their own. --- Nothing is more disgusting than a romance based to nothing but feels. --- These characters have no depth whatsoever. --- 'Let's kiss and be happy and get married.' --- It is nauseous, cheesy and proves that this movie is aimed for hopeless romantics with no sense of reality. --- They are basically force-feeding sugar for 2 hours. What an experience that was. --- All in all the writing is comparable to generic princess dream only 6 years old girl could have. </li></ul>tl;dr:If you are okay with 'I have feels' then there is a small chance that you won't find this movie unwatchable. If you have any kind of understanding of romance films, sci-fi and reality, you better skip this one.",2,5,10,17 February 2017
Spotlight," Amazing story that you deserve to hear out
","This movie tried to tell the horrors catholic church has allowed their priests to do to children. Rapes, sexual abuses by their priests, heavily covered and even approved by the church itself. However, it is told in extremely civilized and correct manner. It is like series of facts are listed and showed in your face. The movie goes in such extreme with this approach, that it becomes bit boring to follow even though the subject and content itself are beyond fascinating. Some would list this to the movie's pros, but I mostly view it as a so-so.I can see what they did, though. It is utter lack of propaganda and party. Total neutral approach where the movie doesn't want to do the thinking and judging for you, but leaves that job as a whole to the viewer. The opposite of what media does. I admire how they could execute all of this without any bits of provoking been seen in the piece itself, the piece we call Spotlight. The problem from my part being, and reason why I don't think any higher about this movie (which I already think is good, but not great), is simply the lack of shock. There is not much anything new this movie has to offer to a person from the 'internet generation' such as myself. Besides the neutral approach that can rarely be seen these days, the movies 'evil', and all the f*cked up s*it in the world, all are something that we all know about already. Surely, we got to see how hard it sometimes is to deliver the facts to public knowledge, and I guess we all can appreciate the effort. I know I appreciate this. In fact, I think this is the bigger, though-provoking message this movie had to offer. What we are told and what is the truth. Two different things. It is pretty much a timeless subject. Thinking about the immigrant crisis and wars we are having in the modern world now in 2016, you know, just to name the 'hottest' subjects. We can only wonder how many years it takes before all the crazy mad s*it around these subjects get revealed by some form of media and later made into a movie. It is no surprise if something as dark as child abuse by church is revealed regarding our current crisis.The truths of present are often lies in the future. Sometimes, people, such as the Spotlight team, can question even such an admired and loved organization as the church, and find the grey between all the black and white we are taught to see, and, just maybe, make the world a bit better place.",5,0,0,11 March 2016
L.A. Confidential," Slow-paced nothingness
","I just love it when nearly 2.5 hour run-time serves no purpose. This movie is so slow even handicapped subhuman-monkey hybrid could keep up with the story. It seems like that is a common factor here on IMDb. Good movies always get Metascore of 30/100 and IMDb rating of 4-7/10 or something like that. Then L.A. Confidential, a movie you don't even have to watch to see it, gets 90/100 because f i n a l l y . s o m e t h i n g . e v e n .

Moana," Trump? Clinton? PFF My vote goes for the Chicken!
","Moana does quite a few thing in the bad way, some more in the average - and few godly. The bad lies mainly in the writing with the following:1) The adults are always so stoopid. Don't do this, don't do that. Why does the princess always have to fight against these DUMBtulds. Seriously Disney, don't be so cliché. 2) The tattoo score counting was rigged! The princess clearly lost. So unfair!!The things that were so-so:1) The OST. 'Worse thing about Disney movies is the singing.' While I loved The 'Dwayne Johnson' Rock singing 'You're Welcome', some of the other songs were bad. Especially the lyrics were rather cheesy and cringe-worthy. 2) Moana. I didn't like her character nor did I enjoy seeing her character development. 'I am a princess who has been raised as one.' Yeah, same old story which was never good to begin with. The gold:1) Chicken. Should have been the real main character of this movie. Should be the president of United States. Also Pollo, Mexican and a total genius of our time. Did Disney secretly give their support to Trump by making this character? Either way, Chicken made the movie.",5,4,7,24 February 2017
Suicide Squad," It didn't annoy me
","I kind of wish I had seen this when I was still 14. I used to like the movie 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' (2003) back in the days, and 'Suicide Squad' (2016) reminded me of how much better action movies were when I still had low standards on awesome. Suicide Squad is clearly a kids movie aimed for kids. Should it be rated and reviewed as such? Not everyone who sees this is a child nor will they view it as a kids movie, so I guess it is not relevant. I would like to compare this to movies that weren't so clearly kids movies, though.Suicide Squad was a smarter move than the new 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016). It was better written and more mature than 'Man of Steel' (2013). It surpasses even Marvel movies, such as 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2016) and is better than any Captain America movie ever made. Including the new 2016 movie. Suicide Squad suffers from several problems. Which all can be referred to with the word 'bad'. Bad writing, bad directing, bad pacing, bad characters and an OST which is a total mess of meme songs everyone has heard billion times before. Every superhero movie seems to suffer similar problems more or less. The main difference being that some have flaws, superpowers and characters more annoying than others. Suicide Squad is a very mild take on everything. It doesn't have strong moralities or pseudo-deep reasoning, tragic past-stories, terrible parents nor villains who are so evil they have to go and kick puppies in their free time. It didn't try to be good, and that is definitely something superhero movies generally lack as they are never really good, but still try so hard to be. And that's why Suicide Squad is better -or at least less annoying- than most superhero movies.",5,0,0,9 October 2016
American Sniper," American Sniper? How about 'American Propaganda'?
","This is absolutely terrible cinema. Not only that, it is terrible propaganda, too. People already have bad picture of Americans and their stupidity and boy this sure helps. Religious main character who is so patriotic he needs to defend the best country in the world ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET, just to call melodramatic phone calls to his wife in the middle of shootout. Seriously, this is exactly how low you can get. I did watch Warrior (2011) and know how awful American dream movies can be, but holy damn, they did everything they could to buy all the casual and murican viewers to their side. E V E R Y T H I N G. We even have 9/11 footage and people yelling alluha akbar on the background. Shame on every person who was in the making of this, and people who like this, please, please, try not to ruin this world any more.",2,82,178,11 January 2015
Lion," 'Forced' is the word of the day
","Lion is a drama movie about this kid who goes missing, filmed in his perspective. His upcoming life after that point is filled with wonderful people who don't want anything else than to love and be something that matches the values of 'good'. Turns out that this kind of values do not create realistic characteristics. The dialogue is so bad it is comedic. They are basically reading out loud some of the cheesiest feeling related one-liners. Similar you can find from the social media profile of any emo girl who is mad because their father doesn't love them.The drama is the worst kind, melodrama. We have so much crying scenes, feeling scenes and bullshit psychoanalysis 'this is not who you are' scenes that it makes me wonder if that, indeed, is not who they are. Maybe these people are just actors in a movie which aims to make all of its casual viewers cry? Oh, wait.The audiovisual execution can be summed up with the following sentence: 'Let's insert emotional piano music here and hope someone will cry.' While piano music does miracles in some cases -such as in Hatchiko (or Hachi: A Dog's Tale as you non-weeb-speakers might call it) - in Lion's case viewer's focus is somewhere else completely. You will not pay so much attention to the selected scene and the piano track itself as you pay attention to the purpose of the song. 'Oh, so this is supposed to be sad and you expect me to cry.' It is very amateurish and only way for me to explain myself why anyone would cry is that the viewer has been on the edge recently and about anything would make them cry at this point. Not to mention the ridiculous overuse of songs of this sort. In fact, it is a bgm heavy movie with no other types of tracks.I did not have problems with the longest music scene where there was no dialog at all, though. But even its value is inferior from what it could have been due to the overuse of this sort of scenes and also due to the former pathetic tries on getting emotions out of the viewer.Even after all its problems, Lion is still worth of watching, but it is a very average movie which most likely won't offer you anything special.",5,7,18,5 March 2017
Baby Driver," Edgar Wright manages to make another memorable work, but still far from impressive
","Shaun of the Dead was something new, especially back then in 2004. Hot Fuzz made him see like a one movie miracle. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World showed that he does after all have a vision. The World's End was his clearest peak being the 5th best movie from 2013 (out of the 113 which I personally saw). And now for the first time he became the center of massive hype with Baby Driver. The movie rides a bit with character awe and badassery, something close to GAR even. It's been referred as simply 'cool/cool movie', but that is true only for the first half. After that we have romance as the main genre and the movie starts to suffer from massive quality drop. The movie seems to be quite lost at this point, making it seem like there was never a purpose for making this. Wasted potential is a good word to use here. The level of unoriginal and cliché reaches its utter max. This is something one would not expect knowing how Wright has been fairly original with his other works regardless of how well the originality paid out. The characters turn out to be pretty much a mess. One of the strongest seems to have moral reasons, one simply goes evil because someone has to, another one simply goes fully out of character, main character and the love-dovey romance are protected by heavy plot armor because this needs to be a happy movie with a happy conclusion for some reason.I will recommend this movie for its entertainment value, but if you have an eye for quality, except average and your expectations will be met.",5,0,4,12 September 2017
The Shining," How to confuse a shallow mind.
","I believe the perfect way to describe The Shining is to describe Stanley Kubrick. He is a man with vision and original ideas, but he lacks a purpose. While The Shining aims to be a horror movie, and by the way, fails in that miserably, in my eyes, it takes the worst and most typical horror movie route. That's not necessarily bad, but.There is always a mystery and the great unknown behind horror movies. This is what The Shining builds up in an impressive manner. The sole terminology and amount of mysteries and mystery elements leads the viewer to think all this build up will lead to an epic conclusion where the great reveal finally tells us what is going on, why is Jack getting insane, why does the boy see those things, who is Tony, what are these shining people and will the black man die first. Nope. Instead we are shown scenes where ghost sets Jack free from the stockroom because that's the only way for him to get out, okay? He needs to get out so he gets out. Of course that is never explained. And this leads to the biggest problem with the story. Nothing is ever explained. 'Too many answers will just ruin it.' Yeah? I see this as nothing but a terrible excuse for a lousy storytelling and lack of brains since there was hardly anything to get beyond what was told.The loose ends, unanswered questions and all the other spooky stuff that was in the movie just to make it more spooky and mysterious are, in a one word; cheap. And with few more words; a waste of potential. I guess many of us have seen a meme picture of a dog sitting on an airplane, it looks like the dog is flying it and then there is a text 'I have no idea what I am doing.' When I imagine Stanley Kubrick directing this film, I recall that picture. I see him behind the camera, the cast, the hotel, the stairs and a text 'I have no idea what I am doing' and that's what we call The Shining. Not that the story was even the biggest problem, nor that the ending scene makes no sense due this not being a movie about Jack, but the characters and the sounds too. From this point on, I will act like there are no loose ends, and the story telling and plot is flawless, and I will get into why this movie is bad solely because of it other merits.In the beginning, I mentioned this failing miserably to be a horror film. The sounds will kill the theme quicker than Kubrick creates a loose end. (This is a joke, so I did not lie 2 sentences ago). I find it incredibly hard to get in the horror mood when the 'music' can be described as wheezing. One thing they did miraculously well; they captured the feeling of tinnitus. Seriously, when you hear sounds like that, you go to the doctor and wish for the best. Then suddenly my bass is yelling, I hear the exact sound C-Class horror movies use when jump-scare scene is executed. What does this movie do with a sounds like that? They show us a black frame with a text 'Thursday' in it. I ask myself, 'Do these guys take this movie as a joke?' but I do not know the answer. I am not sure if these sounds are supposed to be spooky and scary, create atmosphere even, but one thing they do is remind you that you are sitting on your sofa and that you can always turn down the volume because it is just a ridiculously bad sound directing in a movie.Now, let's get to my favorite part. The cast. Jack Nicholson, what a bastard, I love him. But I see The Shining as his worst acting, not even acting, a role. He looks insane in every single picture that was ever taken of him. How is a man who looks insane a suitable person to be character in a movie where the character changes from your average fellow to a completely insane psycho? Well, he is not. He was a bad pick. I can only say that this is not the story it was supposed to be. There is good acting too. Shelley Duvann does an amazing job acting out a dull retard. Then a question. Who likes dull retard characters? This movie is her story, her family goes insane, she is in the middle of it all, she experience the horror. Then a second question. Why should we give a damn about what happens to a retard like her? This leads us to final and one of the biggest elements I am going to analyze. The kid. He is shining, he hears Tony, he can contact other shining, he is the reason why Jack does anything, he sees the horror, glimpses of past, future and future past, he is everything this movie is about. He drives the story towards the truth behind the hotel and towards everything this movie is. But what is he exactly? He is called a plot element. This is not a bad thing in my eyes, I think it is great. What is bad is what he wasn't. Imagine with me. He makes Jack shining, he makes Tony talk to Johnny, he resolves Jack's humanity, he is the one who experiences the horror while being the horror itself. After this the movie ends the same way, but now it has changed to a story about Jack who was inflicted by the horror of the kid and Tony. Instead we get an ending where Kubrick is basically saying, 'Since we don't know how to end this movie, let's insert bunch of stuff which makes it look deep.' Cop-out. That's how you confuse a shallow mind.",4,9,20,8 September 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The adventures of Danish Transvestite and his Jewish platypus
","I have few major problems with this movie. Them being:1) The characters. None of them are interesting. None of them stands out in any way. They are all just grey mass not worth of caring about. Even thought this movie focuses on adults, 11 years old Harry Potter and his story are infinitely more mature than this movie.2) The Harry Potter universe. It wasn't this meh and uninteresting, not ever. I am sure at least 50% of Harry Potter fans could create a better story to take place in Potterverse than FBAWTFT is. I have no other way to describe the world building than the word 'awful'. 3) The spells. Most of them look pretty lame and cheap CGI even in the first Harry Potter movies. In FBAWTFT's case it looks like they made their target audience younger because only young people could find these special effects impressive or cool. They look mainly awkward. 4) Politics. Oh god, the politics. Thought the politics and media were bad in Harry Potter? Justice system sucked? The ministers of magic being a liars and all the press backing up corrupt leaders? Court working solely on elite's favor? FBAWTFT showed that this is still the case. The leaders are baddies. This time it isn't that annoying/personal because a) you don't care and b) it is so bad.I even have to make second paragraph about the politics because they play such a big part of this movie yet are extremely unfitting to its universe. The movie takes place in the 1930's and its take on life in those days is one-dimensional and clichÃ©. The take is so black and white it almost seems like propaganda. The political side of this movie makes it half a political thriller -similar to Captain America. If you don't know, Captain America is a political thriller according to its fandom. Actually it is action movie for children. FBAWTFT is a lot like that, except it lacks action and adventure... making it just a political thriller.. which totally is not a political thriller. At this point, I have no idea what this movie is or tries to be.Also, This review comes from a person who grew up with Harry Potter and whose life Potterverse has played a huge part in.",2,6,10,16 January 2017
How to Train Your Dragon 2," I am not sure how a movie aimed for children managed to annoy me so much.
","Maybe it was the love I had towards the first part. Or maybe the disappointment this sequel brought me into after all the waiting and excitement. Pretty sure it was the ridiculously bad writing though. After the first mi lady fedora tipping scene I came to the belief that these jokes were written by different meme guy than the jokes in the first one. This meme guy was probably from 9gag. After the light sheep baby -scene, I knew that this guy was simply 2maymayd5me, but I still watched the whole thing.It was not the jokes. It was the clichÃ©s and the tropes. It was the death you saw a mile a way, the great hurr I am your mother reveal you saw a mile away. And the other things you saw a mile away. Was it a Skywalker reference? I do not want to believe. Did I mention that Hiccup's mother is alive? Of course I did. Did I mention that she is a Jesus? How is she Jesus. I have never seen a nightfury, 20 seconds later tells that every dragon has secret ability and upgrades nighfury to nightfury lvl 2. Funny? No. What about the alpha dragon being controlled by fear caused by bald evil ergo villain? How was that possible. It's kids' movie so it won't matter, clearly. Did I mention that the evil villain ergo was evil? He was one step away from kicking puppies. Suddenly alpha is alpha and controls all the dragons because *spooky voice* brainwash *spooky voice* brainwash. Except the lil ones because they just won't listen to anyone. Anyone. Oh, but I have an idea, let's use the lil ones they will surely listen to us. Anyone. Us. Anyone. Kids movie. Okay! Brainwash. Did I mention Hiccup's dad died? I did! So his mother will take care of him now. They have known for 15 minutes, this will surely fix everything. And oh lookie it did. Did I mention that Hiccup got over his father's death in 5 minutes? Well now you know!Oh, and the alpha dragons fought with horns because the other method would have required animation of some sort. Neat! And then the soldier morality... I cannot do anything but complain on how wrong this movie is so I will just stop here and live in the memory of the first one which doesn't have a sequel. :)",2,20,47,8 September 2014
Jurassic World," Self-aware comedy which I found to be better and more entertaining than expected
","Jurassic World starts off with 7 minutes of nonsense and mess which can easily turn the viewer down. 'Please kill me.' - the movie probably. Everything is just wrong with it from acting to editing, and outrageous mercedes and beats ads. Then, an evil Asian ninja comes to the screen with his lines and makes sure no one will refer to this movie without the word 'self-aware' any longer. From that moment on, non of the bad twists and lacking writing, logic or anything that usually would/could be criticized in a story of this caliber, can be taken as an insult towards viewers intelligence, nor will it be possible to get mad over this, because now it is all pure comedy gold. I will not bother analyzing the story as I see no reason to like this movie for that. The heart lies withing the pandering, ridiculously over the top scenes and, over all, pure hilarious adventure which this movie is all about. We have guys from friendzoned beta spaghetti to 'garu stu saves the day and gets the girls'. We have scene where guy shoots t-rex with a freaking bazooka. Know those scenes where an object with huge mass almost leaves someone crushed between it and a wall, but then it stops withing an inch and nothing bad happened whatsoever? We have this trope... executed with a flying dinosaur. Do I have to say more? Not laughing at these not only indicate bad sense in humor, but downright awful life's philosophy. All in all I can recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have huge bias towards the earlier franchise, but most of all, to anyone who can understand that movie doesn't have to be smart to be brilliant.",6,2,7,13 July 2015
Silence," Having troubles sleeping? Insomnia is a bitch? Try this one.
","After some good 40 minutes I had to surrender to the sweet feathery world of dreams. I think something like 4 hours passed before I woke up. Turns out there is still another 40 minutes of this movie left. 1 hour 20 minutes have never been so dreamy. After quick rewind I gave another try to the remaining 2 hours. I was at the edge of consciousness half the time. Wondering how any narrator can have such a bland, monotonous voice and at the same time getting irritated by how slowly paced and uninteresting the movie was. The movie suffers from utter nothingness. Everything that happened in it can be summed up in one sentence. 'There are Christians in Japan.' .... Somehow it took Scorsese 2 hours 40 minutes and 40 millions USD to say this simple line. To me, the viewer - it felt like half a day. To be fair, I don't think it is completely Scorsese's fault this movie sucks. And I don't even like him or his movies to begin with. Maybe better directing could make this subject more interesting, but still, only notable title from this medium about spreading Christianity is Vikings - or more like the first 2 seasons of it. Silence (2016) surely won't impress many people.",Null,8,14,23 January 2017
Logan," Logan is Marvel's Dark Knight
","Dark Knight is a mediocre action film which isn't even the best of its own franchise - And that is exactly what Logan is.Wolverine is now a slice of life guy - working hard for his family and friends. Then these baddies show up and want to kidnap his daughter. The catch being that they don't even have a change.. or clear reason on doing anything they do. It doesn't matter tho, since now we have perfect reason to start a road trip and go on an adventure! But wait a minute, our wild bunch of adventurers meet this family of black guys, epic writing stuff happens and you start to wonder who of them dies first. Oh, all of them! Dude, sick plot twist. Well, that's fine too. How predictable, tho.The dialog can be cancerous at times. 'The children didn't have any names.... except the ones we gave to them.' Like what is this even? Isn't that exactly how names work.The writing is awful and terribad, so let's not talk about it anymore. This version of Wolverine has issues. Every conversation he has basically ends up him winning it with the words 'because I am a big jerk, okay?' Charles is now retarded. Laura is the only interesting character, but the story doesn't deliver and the movie ends before it even starts.The antagonist is a mute Wolverine. It's like Batman vs. Superman except it is Wolverine and mini Wolverine vs. Mute Wolverine. Yeah, no. The fight scenes and choreography are actually decent. The movie isn't pg-13 so the execution is actually okay and offers pretty much all the entertainment value this movie holds.The music is pretty nonexistent. I forgot all of the songs as I watched. All in all the movie was worth of my time, but it was average and absolutely nothing special. Days of Future Past was much better despite being a kids movie.",5,6,14,15 April 2017
La La Land," This movie changed my life
","Since La La Land won 7 Golden Globes, here is me comparing it to 7 well-received movies from past years. Also, giving my own awards:1) It is like Boyhood (2014) in terms of average. If you don't know, Boyhood is the most average movie ever made. La La Land gets the 'Most Average Movie Since Boyhood' -Award from me.2) In terms of characters, it is lot like another romance from 2012 called Silver Linings Playbook. If the characters from that movie didn't have personalities, they could be main characters in La La Land. 3) In terms of songs, it is the opposite of Les Misérables (2012). The OST is either popular meme songs, original content which lacks completely and utterly in lyric creativity or Jazz which varies from 'this is why I don't like jazz' to 'I should listen to more jazz.'4) The second award I will give to La La Land is 'I Will Forget Everything That Happened In It In A Week' -Award. This movie is about as memorable and live-changing as James Cameron's Avatar from 2009. It lasted some hours and later on the time spent watching it is worth as much as random hour from 15 years ago when you were bored and kicked rocks while waiting school buss to arrive. It happened, but can you go into details about it? No, most likely not. Time spent averagely. 5) In terms of conclusion, the movie is like Whiplash (2014) -they both even have J.K. Simmons. The main difference being that Whiplash's ending was the pinnacle of the story where La La Land's ending was flat like earth -according to some. 6) In terms of atmosphere the movie is like Café Society (2016) from Woody Allen. Except La La Land's changes from 'this is supposedly cheerful' to 'supposedly emotional' while Cafe Society was more like 'if you see any differences in atmosphere during these 1.5 hours, you most likely have serious case of paranoid schizophrenia.' 7) Now this is acting. How did Emma Stone beat Meryl Streep? Her performance in Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) was easily the most impressive sole performance seen in 2016. She carried that whole movie alone. Emma Stone only impressed me twice while trying to convey feelings by directly starting into the camera during jazz scenes. The second time wasn't even that good because it was just repetitive. Also, I lied. This movie didn't really change anything.",5,20,35,15 January 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of Bad Memes Vol. 2
","The protectors of capesh!t, the heroes of PG-13 rated blockbusters, the knights of fartjokeverse / whatever you want to call it. The plot of this sequel was most likely written by Butters from South Park. The characters are the same as well as the 5 years old visual effect. The movie was basically created by moving Chris Bratt from Parks and Recreation to Jupiter Ascending (the 2015 movie with Mila Kunis). Minus the comedy of course. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes Marvel and DC because it's not like this is any better than Suicide Squad or any worse than Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.",Null,5,10,9 August 2017
Kong: Skull Island," The amount of helicopters is over 9000!
","Kong Skull Island is a silly movie. Pure mindless fun with some nice treats and 0 f#cks gives attitude.The story is epic.John Goodman and his buddies ride x amount of helicopters into this one island. They turn on the speakers, start to listen to rock'n roll and drop off some bombs. No questions asked. New ecosystem, one of a kind wildlife and unique animal species? Pls, Who cares, let's party the sh!t out of this island and its soil wit dem bombs. The dialog is satisfying. 'When 3 news sites have the same story, you know they are lying.' Jizz in my pants. 'Let's gather evidence and come back with the cavalry.' 'I AM CAVALRY.' Not to mention the famous last words 'Do you love yo mama.'The execution is rather fresh.The movie quite literally rocks. It has attitude and it is self- aware. Arrogant. Very arrogant. But not too much. Not once did it go too much over the top. It is exactly the right amount of witty, bastard and gritty. It couldn't be much more offensive without being wildly disliked. Some of the shots are pure art and absolutely hilarious. The cast is notorious.John Goodman is totally my man. I love that guy. Every movie he is in is always bit more enjoyable. Samuel L. Jackson wants that goddamn Kong off this goddamn Island. John Reilly still seems like a psychopath. And. The director, Jordan Vogt-Robers, famous for directing one of the funnies movies ever, The Kings of Summer (2013) has now proved he is not a one film miracle. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who have absolutely brilliant sense of humor, such as myself.",5,2,3,16 April 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Someone here asked if this is what the fans deserve.
","Without actually reading any further of this comment, I concluded (with 96% certainty, mind you) that we are talking about fans of the LoTR universe. In which case, I have to say I don't consider myself a fan, but knowing fans, and hearing that this doesn't follow the source material accurately, I have to come to the conclusion that no, this is not what the fans deserve. If, however, we are talking about people who are fans of movies and TV series, the medium in generally, then my answer is a 100% yes. There are two things in this movie which annoyed me. The character development of Thorin Oakenshield and the melodramatic writing. In all honesty, I can forgive these due the outcomes. Due the deaths. I have considered LoTR a children's book ever since Gandalf supposedly died, but came back alive after all. What a waste of a great death. The last Hobbit shows what I appreciate the most; balls. Balls to kill off characters, balls to out-write cast without any need for it, other than good writing, because let's face it, unneeded happiness is never memorable. Now is the point where I say that I never actually even watched Hobbit for the story nor plot. I watched it for the cinematography, production values and simply entertainment. The landscapes are glorious, fight between the mountains was visually stunning. Same with tons of scenes, not just with action scenes, but simply scenes where camera is just moving and showing us the scenery. We got to see something exactly what a fantasy world should look like and boy it is prettier than ever. The pacing gets my praising. It is even smoother as my awkward rhymes! 2.5 hours rarely go past this fast. There was not a moment that bored me, there was hardly anything that annoyed me, the ride was simply entertaining and that's all I ever asked from it. Since we got to see some good death too, the movie was simply a positive surprise from my part. Aftertaste; great. Worth every penny.",7,2,5,15 December 2014
Wonder Woman," Female Batman
",Batman sucks and so does Wonder Woman. Remember those Sand Snakes from Game of Thrones and their bad phyfffy memes that everyone hates? Wonder Woman is basically a spin off of that girl power sh!t trio that is not even canon. Go watch Warrior Princess Xena or any anime from the 90's with female protagonists and skip this superhero whose superpower is her gender.,6,33,99,28 May 2017
The Deer Hunter," Why would anyone care
","I watched 46 minutes of this movie, then dropped it. 24 minutes of that was random weddings about random guys who just dance, celebrate and drink alcohol. One could expect 3 hour run time to hold some purpose, but no. The first hour is literally about nothing. If you can't make stuff this simple into a shorter movie, then you have obviously failed miserably. It is artsy and boring so some people of course like it.Sometimes I also enjoy slow and boring stuff, but I find it incredibly hard to care about people celebrating imaginary weddings when I could just go to real weddings instead. I also find it hard to believe that I am complaining about some boring weddings, but well, that's The Deer Hunter.",1,4,9,24 December 2014
Lucy," Let's talk about smart.
","Lucy is a very hated movie. I can see why. I also hate a lot of stuff. I like Lucy, though. I don't think this movie is smart. No one thinks this is smart. Yet that seems to be a problem for yet so many. Here is a spoiler; It doesn't try to be smart.I think the main reason why people dislike this in the first place is that now they actually realize what idiotic means. With this movie, people can finally use their brains and say that this pseudoscience in it is incorrect and false. Doesn't actually work like this, 1/10 etc. That doesn't make this movie stupid, it makes the viewers stupid for not realizing that nearly every movie ever was stupid. This just was in your face stupid because they wanted to make a simple action packet about a girl who becomes god.I hate most movies. Most movies could be good if they didn't try so hard to be smart. Hardly anyone is capable of smart. But still everyone ever is trying to create smart, so seriously, so vicariously. Idiots trying to create smart. That's our movie industry. Then there are the people who call those movies smart, the average fans. There are basically two options with movies. Either you watch idiots trying to make smart stuff, but actually creating idiotic stuff. Or idiots making idiotic stuff on purpose. Nearly everything that falls under the latter option is a comedy. That's what makes Lucy so original. How simple it is. Mary Sue doing cool stuff. High cgi budget, some good ideas about visual execution here and there, one of the best pacing in movie history, a mediocre actress, some cool looking Korean villains. And what do we have? Movie of the year. Does every movie work with this formula? No, but this surely does. They could have ruined this by adding tons of details and back stories and relationship drama and some science theories that could actually apply, but they didn't. They didn't ruin this with unnecessary bs like so many do with their movies. On a bottom line, by not trying to be a smart movie, Lucy became one of the smartest movies I have ever seen. Not in content, not in message, but in making. This was made by smart people, and I can really appreciate that.",8,13,28,14 November 2014
The Fighter," Charlene said it, crazy duckin' family
","I have always had a mild problem with western sports series. The characters often suck so bad and the writing centers too much around one thing, making the titles not only character-centered, but seem like the whole world turns around the main character, and not the other way around.The Fighter is a prime example of a sports title that does this exact thing. From the home town common folks to people in prison, every single one exists in the name of main characters, making the movie one-dimensional. This one-dimensional nature also spreads to the characters. As the summary implies, we have loads of stupid people in it. The family, and do it for the family philosophy, both are very annoying. The family itself contains drug addicts, self-centered arseholes and, in generally, hoes whose IQ matches their shoe size. This makes the movie seem like reddit where few people who have it going fight against idiots that come in masses.Despite the terrible characters, The Fighter does good thing on delivering the idiocy and destroying it. The development almost makes this a feel-good movie as it is rewarding to see stupid people getting owned. The bad things unfortunately still out-weight the good, because there simply isn't enough time to make all the stupid people seem stupid enough. All in all it is not that bad of a movie, but definitely not good either.",4,1,1,18 July 2015
