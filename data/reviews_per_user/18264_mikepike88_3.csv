Ghost," One of the best films of 1990
","This movie is one Jerry Zucker's great successes! The screenplay is fantastic in this movie, with Swayze, Moore, Goldberg and Goldwyn making it effective.Goldwyn and Aviles play good villains, and Shiavelli plays a very scary role too (a very suitable actor).Thia movie does include quite a lot of goofs, but it has a great plot, which makes up for the goofs.The spirit effects in this movie are fantastic too, regarding that the year was 1990! This movie is a must-see romance/horror movie!",8,1,2,26 January 2007
300," A Mockery!
","A Disappointment:This movie is overloaded with gore and pornographic scenes which mock and make look stupid a great historic battle. From start to finish this movie is computer enhanced which makes it look fake and very over the top. Special effects shouldn't be abused like the are in this movie. The setting of the movie has nothing really to do with it either. Also, this movie is full of an unknown cast which brings nothing special which is expected.Don't waste your time on this!",2,4,10,15 April 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Fantastic!!!!!!
","This is my personal favourite and could well be 07's greatest production.I've never heard of Gabriele Muccino, but obviously he is a great director. Also, the script and screenplay for this movie is exceptional.This story is heart-warming because it's based on a real event, and its ending was what I was hoping for.Smith, Newton and the rest of the cast put in the greatest performances of their career.This should be an Oscar winner.",9,0,1,26 January 2007
