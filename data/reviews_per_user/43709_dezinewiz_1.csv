Marie Antoinette," Astonishing!
","I DEFINITELY think that anyone in to history should see this film! Every element and aspect was true to the period. There were some very nice stylistic choices made with some of the music to drive the film. They con-temporized it a bit, and it worked beautifully. If you know the history, you understand that she was beheaded in the end. In the film, such does not happen - literally. What does happen is quite uplifting.It had a richness and a decorum that is rarely seen in historical pieces today.The story is certainly one of sad circumstance. Every player, as far as the audience is concerned, was a good person, and had good intentions. It is simply unfortunate that the pair were too young to rule, and being brought up in a bubble, away from the rest of the world didn't help matters where the country of France was concerned.As far as the couple's innocent mindset, the country of France may have well been the likes of a county fair.Be that as it may, history is history. The story was luscious, and it kept my eyes glued to the screen!I can't wait to see another gem such as this come out of the viewpoint Sophia Coppola!",10,2,4,19 November 2006
