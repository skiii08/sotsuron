Mission: Impossible III," Loud. Stupid. Boring.
","This film has as much entertainment value as a college sophomore who had too much to drink. The superpowers of God, a.k.a Ethan Hunt, aren't consistent. He can track a shirt-button-sized device inside a building halfway across the world, but he can't get a signal on his cell phone. He finds a baseball pitching machine on a few minutes notice at night in Shanghai, or maybe he always packs one on his trips. His agents can fly a helicopter between the blades of a wind turbine, his equipment can track people inside a brick building and pick who are the bad guys and shoot them without human intervention. It was fun while the 'impossible' stuff was done with imagination and creativity, not with super gadgets or super agents. With all this, the film has as much suspense as painting a wall and watching it dry. Not worth going to the theatre, not worth waiting for the DVD, not worth even waiting for it to appear on TV.",2,1,4,10 May 2006
Minority Report," True Science Fiction
","There's one big difference between Science Fiction, with a capital 'SF'and space opera. In SF, the writer takes one 'impossible' thing andasks, 'what would happen if this were possible?'   In SF, differently from space opera, special effects aren't strictlyneeded, that's why Hollywood prefers space opera. In 'Minority Report',however, Spielberg took one 'hard' SF story and rendered it to film.The result was stunning. For about 2 hours, I completely forgot aboutanything else. It's the kind of film that one would like to invite thewriter to discuss things over. The intrincacy of the whole story isresumed at one pont where one character pushes a ball over a table andanother catches it. Anderton: 'Why did you catch it?'. Witwer: 'Becauseit was going to fall'. Anderton: 'But it didn't. Because you caughtit'. That's the whole point about SF, taking ideas and seeing whathappens when you twist them in a knot. Plot, acting, and effects,although good in this movie, are secondary. Spielberg, as he usuallydoes, did a great movie, and, in this one, he had an excellent story tobegin with. I give it a 10 out of 10. (One minor nit: at one point,Anderton is being chased by the cops in an automated factory thatbuilds one car every few seconds. He finally emerges out inside ajust-finished car. That is the only car that comes out of that factory.What happened to the other cars we saw being built?)",10,0,0,7 August 2002
American Pie," It's all about SEX. If you don't like sex, don't watch this film.
","[may contain SPOILERS] Why is it that so many people call this film 'shocking' or 'crude'? I think it is really funny, well made, an excellent film. No, you will not find any messages about 'racial and/or social injustices' here; it's not that kind of film. Its message is all about sex, teenage sex, recreational sex, period. Teenagers want sex: is that shocking? Is sex crude? If that's so, then we are all crudely made beings!I was surprised by the good quality of both the actors and the gags. I expected less, perhaps influenced by the comparisons to 'Porky's'. It is also well directed, the action runs smoothly, the gags are not overdone, and the scenes are cut at the right moments. Too often directors seem to fall in love with the jokes and keep a scene going far beyond the point where it stops being funny. Some jokes here are predictable, but funny nevertheless, e.g. the 'milky' beer. Others came completely unexpected to me, such as the point where the geek very matter-of-factly declared her innovative use for a flute. I liked the ending too: happy, manicheist, everyone gets laid and the bully sees his mom in sh*tbreak's arms.There are many characters in the film: the four protagonists, the several girls they are running after, the bully, the dad trying to be helpful, etc. Some of these characters were not developed extensively, there was no time for that, but we get a good sketch of each, like a wiring diagram that shows the interconnections without unnecessary details.Well, I know that public references to sex were considered crude in some centuries, notably in the late 19th and early 20th. But customs change and those times are gone. People who don't realize this may grow old to become very unhappy grouchy persons!",8,1,2,12 November 1999
Pitch Black," Fiction, yes; Science? Hmmm...
","This film has some of the elements of a Good Science Fiction Film. Well, at least it's fiction and it's a film. Unfortunately, it's not good and it's not science.After the first few minutes you know exactly who will live and who will die. Thrillers should reserve a few surprises for the viewer! The convict is not a saint, but he will survive and show some basic human feelings at the end. The cop is so arrogant and so sure of himself that he will surely be killed, the only element of surprise being: will it be the convict or the aliens? And, of course, most of the supporting cast will die, with just one exception of two. How often have you seen such a film?
So, this is not really a thriller, too predictable for that. Well, how is the science? From time to time, not very often, there comes a truly good science fiction film. The best I remember were 'Soylent Green', 'Gattacca', and 'The Thirteenth Floor'. But just placing the script in an alien world doesn't turn a story into science. For instance, Astronomers today know a few dozen extra-solar planets. The only feature they know of most such planets is their orbit, almost nothing else is known about them. Yet in this film a crew of planetary scientists had been in the planet, not knowing that there would be an eclipse there! And when they found out that, did they use a computer? An electronic calculator, perhaps? No, they found out using a mechanical contraption built with bicycle chains, and other pieces of junk. Just to put things into perspective, recently NASA lost a probe they sent to Mars because they made an error of about one part per million in the orbit calculation. Yes, engineers and scientists do make mistakes, but can you really believe that a group made of a murderous cyborg and a few religious fanatics could survive where a crew of trained scientists died? Perhaps this is the message that Hollywood tries to send: an ordinary bum who routinely flunked math is really more intelligent than a planetary scientist. Too bad. Don't waste your time with this film.",Null,0,0,14 June 2000
"I, Robot"," STUPID Frankenstein
","For any fan of Isaac Asimov, this film is a total fraud. Dr. Asimov went to great lengths to explain his motivation for writing his robot stories in the introduction to 'The Rest of the Robots', an anthology published in 1968. In Dr. Asimov's words, '... there seemed only one change to be rung on this plot -- Robots were created and destroyed their creator; ... I quickly grew tired of this dull hundred-times-old tale. As a person interested in science, I resented the purely Faustian interpretation of science'.The film is totally at odds with the philosophy Dr. Asimov defended, and totally different from all the robot stories he wrote. Only a few names and the 'three laws of robotics' were copied, but the central point in all his stories, that a robot could never be made to violate the three laws, was not respected. The Asimov robot stories are fun because they try to find situations were there is enough contradiction in those laws to create interesting situations.'I, Robot', the movie, is just one more remake of that old, old, old story Isaac Asimov hated so much, it's Frankenstein again. If you insist on seeing that same story again, better get Mel Brooks' version, it's funnier.Let's close with Asimov: 'Never, never, was one of my robots to turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust'.",1,30,54,6 January 2008
Cross of Iron," Not Peckinpah's best, but still a Wonderful film
","This is a film that pumps raw emotions into the viewer, like a typical Peckinpah. There is no manichaeism, no 'good guy' or 'bad guy', no one is really good or really bad, everyone is just trying to survive. But no one is free from preconceptions. Perhaps one of the best dialogues in film history is the last exchange in this one: -'I will show you how a Prussian soldier fights' -'I will show you where Iron Crosses grow'",10,1,2,6 April 1999
Resident Evil," It's a B-movie. 'B' as in 'bad'.
","I was expecting good entertainment value, or, at least, some good special effects. Too bad, there is very little suspense, the plot is as linear as it can get: they go in, meet some zombies, they come out,no surprises. Okay, it's a 'horror' movie, not a 'plot' movie, butstill it doesn't grip, one never comes to that point where there is noobvious way out. The spectator seems to be the most endangered specieshere, I believe at least some of them must have died of boredom.    The make-up and effects would be about average for a 1950's horrormovie, we have come to expect much, much better things in this computer graphics age.   Finally, we aren't even granted comic relief. If they are going toemulate old horror movies, they should at least make it a parody, likethey did with the recent 'Mummy' remakes.",2,1,3,1 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," Just say 'NO'
","Kids, stay off cheap crack, or you may end doing something like 'Mulholland Dr'. The closest analogy to this film is a party drunk, who takes an eternity to say something he thinks is so smart and funny but no one can understand.
There are a few good scenes, a funny one where a hit man tries to make a murder seem like suicide and ends shooting everyone, including the vacuum cleaner. There's a couple of lesbian love scenes, with clear and explicit nudity, for those who think Hollywood movies have become too prudish lately. However, two and a half hours is too long to wait for so little. That used to be called 'glacially slow', but, in this greenhouse effect age, one feels the glaciers will melt before this film ends.
Unfortunately, there are critics who enjoy praising films that make no sense, perhaps because they feel superior when they claim to understand it, or, worse, critics who think that making no sense is a positive contribution to entertainment. If I had known it was that kind of people who were saying such good things about 'Mulholland Dr', I wouldn't have thrown away my hard earned money on this crap.
I'm not saying it's bad to be original, all I'm saying is that there are infinite ways of being original, most of them bad. It's very easy to do things at random. The hard part is linking the threads at the end, so it all makes sense. Doing a really good non sense film is extremely hard, I think Fellini did it a few times, or Buñuel, perhaps. Here, David Lynch certainly fell far short of the mark.",2,2,5,8 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Jackie Chan does James Bond, wearing a rubber mask?
","I think M:I-1 had a much better plot. At least, it DID have a plot. If there is any plot at all in M:I-2, it's carefully disguised in a rubber mask. The formula for making this film was: get a James Bond film, remove all the girls but one, put in some Jackie Chan gymnastics, and add a few rubber masks. Anyway, those masks are great for the suspense, you never know who is who.For an action fan like me, this is a very good film, as one could expect from John Woo. Very dynamic, if you know what I mean. At several points, I thought 'Ouch! That must hurt!'. The action scenes are well distributed along the film, with the power steadily increasing to the breaking point at the end. The motorcycle chase, in particular, is among the best chase scenes I have ever seen in the movies.To enjoy this film, turn off your left brain hemisphere and activate all your adrenaline receptors. I rather liked it, but not too much. It's more like 'Mission: Frenetic'. And it should have more, prettier, girls. I give it a 6.",6,0,0,3 July 2000
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy ALWAYS returns
","No matter what you do to those pesky creatures, there will always be alost book or amulet somewhere with the recipe to bring them back. Asequel is a certain thing, and The Mummy 3 is just a question of time.And we can also be sure that the graphics effects will be, if notbetter, at least more grandiose. The computer graphics were the biggest disappointment for me. Theywere well planned, but there is still something lacking in thesoftware to make them look real. The scorpion king was the worst partof it, but all the computer generated scenes stand out as artificiallooking. Let's just hope the next couple of years bring enoughtechnical development to make the next sequel perfect.The plot, well, what kind of plot do you expect from a film called'The Mummy Returns'? It may not have been written by Shakespeare, butthe story carries well and there is the right amount of tension andcomic relief. Two very lovely ladies. The only thing that bothered mewas a certain abundance of characters. One feels they could havecombined the kid, the brother in law, and the balloon pilot into one.The dispute between the women, reaching back a few millennia, is asimportant as the dispute between the male characters. I kept trying tograsp which was the 'main' plot line without success. The museumcurator has a small part in the beginning, but hovers around appearingbriefly several times. If I had written the story, I would have thatobnoxious person meet a particularly gruesome end once Imhotep hadbeen resuscitated. Perhaps the idea in the story alternating equallybetween so many people was to bring the main focus to the specialeffects.I see a definitive improvement in this kind of film over the'classics' of the 1930's. In those days, horror films were deadserious. It was as if they were telling the spectators 'hey folks,never mind the lousy special effects, this thing is for real'.Nowadays, they say 'it's just a movie, sit back and enjoy the show'.I give it a 8/10 and can't wait for 'The Mummy Returns Again'.",8,0,0,22 May 2001
Lord of War," I feel dirty
","If there is a film that should never have been made, this is it. Nicholas Cage plays the part of a most despicable person and, although the character continuously rambles about the reasons why he does what he does, he neither explains nor justifies it. I know this film is not entirely fiction, it shows what's happening every day somewhere. But there are some things that should be best left to documentaries. If there are some gruesome facts that must be presented, at least do it in a 'Schindler's List' way, try to find a character that has a moral attitude, do not put the worst possible villain in the hero's shoes.",1,6,22,18 May 2006
The Sixth Sense," A single unexpected twist does not make a good film
","The most surprising thing in the ending of this film is that it actually ended - it seemed to drag forever, never getting anywhere. Bruce Willis, after getting tired of standard issue action films, became rather irregular in choosing scripts. After the superb 'Fifth Element', I had high hopes for the 'Sixth Sense', but, other than the ending, there is nothing original here, it's just 'Ghost II - The Mission'.Of course, once you accept the existence of supernatural phenomena there are very few surprises left; anything is possible, since the supernatural laws seem to be very flexible. In this film there is no evident clue to strictly define it as a 'supernatural phenomena' sort of film, so I kept wondering if there would be a natural explanation that put everything back in our physical universe, transforming it from the 'terror' to the 'thriller' category. No such luck. We get the same old story, so many times told. 'Some people are able to see ghosts and become scared by them at first, but ghosts are just people who died with their missions in the Earth incomplete, and they need help from living persons to finish their tasks so they can progress further to their final destiny'. Please, tell me something new, this story can become boring after a century or two.All in all, it's a linear plot, corny, absolutely humorless, full of clichÃ©s, with flat characters. Its only redeeming quality is the photography, appropriately dark, cloudy outdoors and sparsely illuminated indoors.Better see again that old Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore tape, rather than waste your time watching this crap.",3,1,2,12 November 1999
Heat," Cops and robbers at its best
","It's dense and long, you get involved in those people's lives, at both sides of the law. Although both main actors seemed to overdo their roles somewhat, everyone did a good job here: a good, tight and logical plot; credible people, each with their own strengths and weaknesses; a photography that's always in the exact focus for each scene.I have one small nit to pick in this film: Robert de Niro's character, Neil McCauley, was almost a superman. He could rob a bank, an armored truck, a safe, in a perfectly staged sequence. He could pick a girl in a few minutes at a cafeteria and take her to bed within a few hours. The only way he could be caught was by betrayal. In real life, this man would not need to be a criminal. He could make much more, without the risk of spending several years at a penitentiary.By contrast, Al Pacino's character, LAPD lieutenant Vincent Hanna, seemed sorely incompetent. He messed completely his own personal life, and only full time dedication, together with a good knowledge of criminal procedure, allowed him to prevail in the end. The other characters, too, seem to have one or more weak points. Only Neil McCauley is perfect, and that's why I don't give this film a perfect 10. No criminal is perfect in my opinion.",8,0,0,3 July 2000
Apollo 13," good technical details, but the soul is missing...
","There was an epoch that started in the Cuban missile crisis, or maybe it was the Kennedy assassination; it ended in Watergate, or maybe it was in Apollo 13. It was the age of Rock'n'Roll and Viet Nam, Monterey and Da Nang... Anyway, the 60s were interesting times. I'm an electronics engineer that works in spacecraft control systems. The film was very good from the technical standpoint, no big blunders, just some slight exaggerations, to maintain the suspense. But I was a kid when it happened and I remember those times, I think the general attitude is missing. Modern kids, who listen to Alanis Morrissette, may not understand this, but people had some strange dreams in those psychedelic years. By the early 70s everybody knew the dream had ended, we would not colonize the Moon in this century, environmental pollution was (and still is) a lethal danger, global nuclear war was imminent, you get the idea. Depending on your point of view, you were afraid that either communism or capitalism would take over the world (my uncle died with a piece of shrapnel through his heart while fighting the communists in eastern Europe, so you know what was MY fear). 'Apollo 13', the film, was well made, both from the technical and the artistic point of view, but it missed the chance to capture the spirit of the final days of an age when drama was lived in real time.",Null,0,2,11 October 1999
The Thin Red Line," Boring, too long, no plot, no characters, no point...
","A good editor could easily cut this film in half, giving it a plot in the process. This film is all about atmosphere, it tries to create a sort of empathy between the audience and the characters, but people usually expect to find a recognizable storyline. The camera is excellent, and there are several good scenes (although the sound is poor), but the overall effect is of an 'art' film in an 'action' setting - it just doesn't work as it should.",Null,9,16,4 March 1999
