Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Worst movie I have ever seen
","Everything about this movie is trash. They kill kylo ren for no reason at all, and we are stuck with Rey now. Rey is the worst character throughout each of the movies, but she is made the main character while Finn is a side character. Finn had more potential but was wasted. They also used objects to propel the story forward, causing everything to happen by luck instead of them having to work for it. Terrible movie. A disgrace to the Star wars Franchise.",1,16,19,8 June 2020
