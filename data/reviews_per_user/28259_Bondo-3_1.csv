The Blair Witch Project," ugh!
","One of the WORST movies of all-time. Reminded me of my mother, trying to operate a video camera. I'll admit, the ending is decent but the rest of the movie is just brutal! I can't imagine watching this movie on a TV screen. The constant shaking of the camera will be intensified even more on a small screen. Jeeze!",1,0,1,17 September 1999
