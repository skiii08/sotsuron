The Avengers," Mediocre at best
","If you are planning on watching this movie, or a similar one, then it's best you don't check IMDb out. A lot of reviews in here have been written by bots that gave the movie 10, without addressing any of its major issues.That's not to say I don't understand why anyone would like this movie, it has some qualities such as action, animation and a few laughable lines. But to a viewer that want to be entertained by more than just cheesiness, this movie fails.First of all, it commits a mistake that is pretty obvious to begin with, way too many major characters are tried to fit into one movie. We are left with some story lines for Hulk, Iron Man and Thor, the most major members of the Avengers, while Black Widow and that bowman are just forgotten.The villain is also pretty forgettable, it's Loki that's back, and he's a spoiled kid that never really seem that powerful or impressive, compared to the avengers. I am not going to spoil anything, but it seems like he attempts to be a really clever villain, but just ends up as a spoiled kid.The plot in general, is also pretty forgettable. It's standard, mediocre superheroes stuff, that you've seen a hundred times in superhero movies.If you're a die-hard superhero or marvel fan, or just enjoy action and cheesy lines, then this is your movie. If you want a movie with an interesting plot and characters, then look elsewhere.",4,4,9,5 December 2013
