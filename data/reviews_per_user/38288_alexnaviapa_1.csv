Hereditary," Ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous
","I've used Imdb for years and never felt the need to post a review, but this movie is so bad I just had to let you know. The beginning, middle, and end minus five minutes are a giant cliche of mood music and pseudo surprises, but it's the ending five minutes that makes you want to shoot yourself in the head. I don't know why I gave this atrocity a one. It should have been zero, sorry.",1,4,7,26 March 2019
