The New World," Boooooring
","Oh my god it was still early in the evening when we watched the movie on DVD, but I was tired after ten minutes already. There is about three minutes action at most and the rest of the time you see nice shots of landscape (if you wanna see go for a documentation instead mate!). It's played well by the actors though.You can see the events in the story coming too, means no aha effects.There are also some monologues which are not only poetic but 'Sinnschwanger' as we say in German too. So if you have sleeping problems, take it!",2,0,4,5 August 2006
