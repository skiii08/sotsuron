Mission: Impossible III," Good Actors and Bad Story
","Our HERO, and we know he's that because we've seen the first two movies, is going after the bad guy who sells mystery bad stuff (which is never identified) to other bad guys. He's suitably sadistic for a bad guy, he tortures women and threatens the good guys. That's the whole plot. Good special effects up to a point. Ethan Hunt swings to the top of the bad guy's building, disappears inside, and magically retrieves the mystery bad stuff without even showing us how he managed. This, after tricking a half-dozen highly trained guards to look the other way. Golly. I couldn't really care anything about the characters...Ethan Hunt gets married and the bad guy who tortures women captures her to get the good guy to retrieve the bad stuff. Almost left after twenty minutes of failed plot development, and unfortunately stayed to find out what the bad stuff was. Never did. Glad I only paid two dollars at the El Cheepo theatre to see this since the good actors couldn't save the bad plot.",1,9,16,2 July 2006
