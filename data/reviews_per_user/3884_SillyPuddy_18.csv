The King's Speech," Lackluster
","It was better than The Fighter which really isn't much of a feat. 2010 was a weak field for Best Film nominees that is for sure. This one was full of mumbling dialogue that we had to tweak the volume in order to try to understand what was being said. The only likable character in this long, slow affair was Geoffrey Rush who was stellar as usual. Firth seemed like half a man and not worthy of his lovely, strong wife. Still not sure why he was so resistant to therapy but I suppose that was convenient for the director to tack on another 45 minutes to this arduous film. Guy Pearce is just flat and uninspired in his limited role. ***SPOILER**** The only thing notable about the big speech at the end was he said all the words. It is not like he delivered it in some passionate way.",5,7,15,12 May 2011
Unbreakable," Engrossing
",One of the most haunting and fascinating films I've ever seen.  Dark the same way Sixth Sense was.  Both films loitered in my mind long after I viewed them.  That is where the similarities between the two films end though so it is no longer worth bringing up Sixth Sense (like so many people do)when discussing Unbreakable. This film is not jam packed with action and violence.  Its more mysterious and deliberate.  M. Night is not a one hit wonder.  So far he has 3 stellar films.  Just don't fall in the trap of comparing one to the other.  Enjoy each for what it is.,Null,0,0,6 November 2003
Fight Club," Way off the mark
","This film certainly has its share of fanfare and hype. I really was hoping I would like it even though the trailer didn't impress me. Well, it turned out being worse than I thought. Meanwhile, Fincher continues to get worse with each effort. The only reason I didn't rank this as 1 was on account of the brilliant Ed Norton. Pitt just plays himself the same way he usually does. The violence gets really old quickly and so does the film. This was way too long and pretentious. Fincher has some interesting points with all the IKEA furniture bits. Perhaps it would have been better in an hour TV show like Ray Bradburyesque. About the only amusing scene in the last half of the film was when Norton is beating the crap out of himself in his boss's office. Of course I liked this scene best when Jim Carrey did it in Liar Liar. Fincher obviously thought he was doing something important here with his pop culture references. I suppose I'm not so easily impressed because I don't rely on American mainstream movies for entertainment. Ooops..sorry to burst your bubbles but despite what some people think, Fincher is not God. After Aliens3 he struck gold with the thrilling 'Se7en' and followed that with the mediocrity of 'The Game' only to follow that with this rubbish. Then he went off the radar completely after the embarrassing 'Panic Room'. Not even Jodie Foster or Forrest Whitaker could breathe life into that sleep fest. The twist at the end of FC may have worked better if the darn film didn't drag on for another half hour. Then cue the Pixies song to show that we're cool....puke.",2,2,7,12 June 2007
Spotlight," Hollywood being Hollywood
","Yet another film with big name actors playing journalists. Same clichés in far superior films such as All The President's Men (ATPM); everything that worked in that film did not work for this one (IMHO). The only two characters that didn't annoy me were played by Tucci and Schriever (sp). I see this material and subject better suited as a documentary piece on Dateline and 20/20. If it had to be a film then I think casting lesser/unknown actors would deliver more of an impact and remove the preconceived notions and biases of the bigger names involved here. Ron Slattery is an old hat at playing the upper management type and is no different here..Michael Keaton plays another manager who gets to sit in an office (did they really need him to do this?). Rachel McAdams gets another shot at being a serious reporter (State of Play) while being stripped of the charm and freshness she brought in Wedding Crashers, Morning Glory. We are treated to Mark Ruffalo running to the office (deep, riveting stuff). Then we get to watch him in the waiting room of a law office until he takes initiative to talk to the lawyer (another reference to ATPM). To me it distracts from a really important subject and has Hollywood stamped all over it. Best Picture? Something tells me it was a foregone conclusion that when this was released it would be nominated, regardless of merit.",2,21,49,26 January 2016
Spider-Man 3," What a mess!
","The third Spiderman was worse than the second which is saying a lot. Both were far cries from the tightly wound original. What I remember-even though I've tried to forget-about Spiderman 2 is the cutesy montages that seemed more like filler than anything (Raindrops song and Hal Sparks cameo). Well similar sequences are infused in this one. A couple scenes reminded me more of a musical than a superhero movie. There were no real bad guys in this one. It was sort of by committee. Honestly, I'm not sure what the director was thinking cramming all those subplots into this creating a tedious mess. The ending drags on with one melodramatic scene after another.",4,0,1,13 February 2008
Crash," Top Notch
",I'm not often shocked or stunned by films. That is exactly what I was after watching Crash. This was one of the most powerful and mesmerizing films I have ever seen. Not a false note or wasted line of dialogue in the whole picture. One can't help but take a good look at his or herself in the mirror after a film like this. The actors are not portrayed as simply good or bad. There are shades of both and that colors the different scenes. The ensemble cast was astounding and not in the Ocean's 11 or Traffic artificial sort of way. I don't see stuff just because its packed with stars. If that were the case I would of loved Independence Day. These are all talented actors not just pretty faces. The director is completely in control of the audience and gives nothing away. You can predict-and you no doubt will-but you would be wrong. The suspense builds and is sustained until the closing credits after which you will be haunted by what transpired and how it violated your expectations. I didn't feel manipulated by the director because of some forced emotion of political agenda. I was manipulated because I couldn't help but be enthralled by all the characters and what would become of them as the events unfolded. This all transpired in a film under 2 hours long. That too me is remarkable.,10,0,6,5 February 2006
Lost in Translation," Its all that and more.
","Gotta love a film that illicits such strong emotions from its viewers.  I have such an admiration for this film.  Went to see it when it first came out and before the hype machine.  Saw it again on recently on DVD and enjoyed it just as much.  What some call boring and pointless, I call rich and rewarding.  The shots of Tokyo are stunning.  Warning: There is very little profanity, violence, or hobbits in this film.  Not sure why some people went to see this when they clearly don't have the patience or capacity to enjoy it.  It is an independent film and has the pacing of a foreign film.  This is not a typical American mainstream film with a hero, a villain, and a neat payoff at the end.  This film is just a journey that the characters take you on. Perhaps those people who found it too slow will stick to their Kill Bill, LOTR, and Independence Day type films from now on because as Eddie Vedder said, 'This is not for you.'",10,0,1,28 April 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Waste of time and brain cells
","I went into this film with such high hopes despite not liking the trailer. Ultimately, I should of trusted my instincts and stayed away from this garbage. While I was sitting there cringing during the 'drunk driving' scene, I couldn't believe I was watching the film people were raving about. With the exception of the talented, likable Carell, the characters and jokes became tedious after 20 minutes. Lots of demeaning and degrading language that was nasty but just unfunny. No way that pick up line works with the bookstore clerk who BTW rehashes her role in Catch Me If You Can of the giggly bimbo in the bank. I dare any guy to try that and see if the clerk doesn't call security or call you a freak. The film just gets worse from there as the offensive, raunchy humor accumulates. Its too bad too since the romance with Keener worked so well. The film was so much better when the idiots from Circuit City were off screen and Carell/Keener took over.",2,6,13,28 August 2005
Legends of the Fall," Its all about Brad Pitt...
","Ok I get it!  Brad Pitt is the bomb.  That is the gist of this melodramatic, pointless film.  It just takes over 2 hours to drive that point home.  A previous reviewer referred to this movie as a Pitt vanity project and he was right.  Matt Damon followed the same blueprint for Good Will Hunting. Everything revolves around his character Tristan.  I mean its like he is freakin God.  I am so glad I didn't have to suffer through this film at the theater paying money.",Null,1,4,29 January 2004
Drive," Mucho Potential
","This film had so much going for it and the first 30 minutes were stellar. The initial driving sequence was exhilarating and provided a good introduction. Being an indie film lover, I was fine with the limited dialog and use of body language to show the chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan. I loved the introduction of the Standard character and the tension he brought to the mix. Perlman, Cranston, and Brooks were all very convincing and well cast. According to my calculations, everything fell apart during the Pawn Shop scene. The fantastic coincidence was too much for me to take. I didn't realize LA was such a small town. From then on, everything devolved in to a mob film and became a tedious mess. I felt like Albert Brooks nailed it when he said to Cranston's character, 'I was so excited.' Those were my sentiments about this film before it all went south.",5,0,3,24 May 2012
Good Will Hunting," Not all that
",This is one of the most overrated films I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  I didn't care about any of the characters and the dialogue was incredibly pretentious.  It made me ill.  Some posters on here have chosen to belittle those who give this a low rating.  My reply to you is that I deal with the real world and real people everyday and think this movie is absurd.  The world revolves around Damon's character and the ludicrous scene in the bar made me want to puke.  'How do you like them apples?'  'Let's go eat caramels.'  What profound dialogue!  This guy is just too cool.  Give me a break.  If I met people like this in real life I would tell them to grow up or label them a phony.  This is the Anti-American Indie movie in all its self-importance.,1,47,104,23 October 2003
Transformers," Lame
","The only reason this nonsense didn't get a 1 was due to Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas). He was the only highlight for me. The rest of the cast was made of shallow, uninteresting people. Not that I expected more from an action flick but just saying. Jon Voight and John Turturro are two fine actors who are wasted in this film. This movie tried so hard to elicit laughs in between the action and failed miserably each time. Anthony Anderson was just not funny. The interrogation scene with the donuts was like a bad sitcom where you could see the punch line a mile away. The blonde Australian girl who outsmarted national security was just ridiculous. As for the action, it was hard to keep track of which machine was which. Just hunks of metal tearing each other apart. The cartoon had much better fighting scenes more than 20 years ago! Pathetic. Also Optimus Prime was a heck of a lot stronger in the cartoon than in the movie. He was at least Megatron's match. In the movie, he clearly had inferior strength. I can't even recommend this for children since they had to throw that ill advised bit of dialog in when the parents entering their son's room.",2,1,4,22 July 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Disappointing, Disturbing, and Frustrating
","Its hard to put in words how agitated this film made me feel. Up until the title fight, the film had so much momentum and promise. Then it cheated and succumbed to a tired, worn out movie cliché where the hero turns his/her back in the ring and the angry antagonist retaliates after the bell rings. Frankie has his head in the clouds and doesn't seem to be paying attention to what unfolds. Hello! The Blue Bear is only the dirtiest fighter on the planet. He never really tells Maggie about the danger she is in being in the ring with such a monster. You'd think he would be a bit on edge. After all his preaching to Maggie about always protecting herself, the scene just doesn't ring true. A cheap shot indeed! I thought Freeman was the best part of the movie and the glue that held it together. The writing was first rate and so was the acting. The ending was a pleasant surprise and a nice payoff. Still doesn't make up for the cheat though. After that, it became one of the hardest films I've ever had to watch. Almost unbearable.",Null,0,2,12 February 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Epitome of Overrated
","I was eager to watch this film and like it. After viewing it last night however, I was quite disappointed. This movie is the definition of lackluster. Dull, boring, and dry. That is how my liberal friends described it. They were being lenient. I would describe it as nothing more than presumptious garbage from the left. Morrow is the only one with a pulse and hardly one at that. Clooney is reduced to a impotent sidekick (not sure if thats bad or good). So many secondary characters in the film that no one should even try to care about. Its just not worth the time or attention. If I would of attempted to view it in a theater I would of fallen asleep withing the first act and not been sorry for missing the ineffective last two. What struck me as odd was that they didn't even talk much about blacklisting or the Hollywood angle. It was mostly about military personnel. What a joke. Clooney really misfired with this one. The abrupt ending was ridiculous and embarrassing (par for the course I suppose). Clooney must have thought this was in the same league as All the President's Men. Nothing could be further from the truth.",1,19,40,11 February 2006
Bull Durham," Overpraised heap of trash
","I remember watching this waiting for something interesting to happen of some likable characters to emerge.  Robbins is at least ok.  The rest of the cast is just annoying.  The dialogue is absurd.  Why this film gets so much praise is because it is fueled by lewd subject matter.  Its in poor taste and Americans usually eat that up.  It is a far, far cry from the Natural.",Null,4,10,24 October 2003
Easy A," What Could Have Been
","One of the more disappointing flicks in memory. I was so psyched to see it and delighted it was on Netflix instant watch. What began with so much potential including a decent cast (and charming, witty parents) was undermined at every turn with by its relentless attack on Christianity. At one point it even took a shot at capitalism for good measure. I am a Christian and normally don't mind a little mockery of certain aspects of it. I remember being annoyed in college by the 'slimy' bible thumpers on campus pushing their beliefs on others. I even stopped going to churches when they either engaged in cultish like behavior or the priest spoke down to the congregation. I did this because – despite what Hollywood tells you - there are good churches and decent Christian folk out there. Despite all this about a third in the story was picking up steam and found a nice little groove. Then about 2/3 in the appearance of Patricia Kudrow was like a death nail for me. What a deplorable character with her barrage of GD this and that. She added nothing to the film and really sank any hope the material had with her tirade. Too bad too since I was just starting to really like the family (Tucci and Clarkson were terrific). Plus Church was effective as well particularly when he exclaimed to Stone, 'We all know you read the book.' It was refreshing for a teacher to acknowledge when a student stands out in a positive way. Then the negativity set in and the attacks intensified to dominate the final third and suck the life out of the entire film. Dan Humphrey couldn't even save this one.",2,16,29,26 April 2011
Joy," Magic
","The first time I saw this film I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I took quite a bit from this film and take more and more upon repeated viewings. I find it interesting that many other reviewers describe this as predictable (so was Titanic or any other true story), without comedy or drama, and full of characters and situations that no one cares about. I found the opposite to be true and thought the characters were intriguing and amusing. I was quite inspired by the tale of an underdog striving to win in the midst of overwhelming odds. No, it is nothing new but to me a story like this never gets old. I find lessons in this film upon paying attention to the family, most of whom were naysayers. In business and in life there are not many people you can count on and Tony proved to be a gem. It also emphasized the importance of looking out for yourself, understanding the devil is often in the details but sometimes you have to discover this by reading and seeing for yourself and making a phone call. I also appreciated the little trinkets she kept and the nod to them at the end. It made me think of the achievements in my life, how hard they were to attain, and how much they mean to me and taught me about who I am. I was able to glean all this by watching this wonderful film.",10,6,19,31 December 2015
Dodgeball," Not Good
","I would like the hour and a half of my life back that I wasted watching this garbage. As many have pointed out, expectations should be low for this film. I at least expected it to be funny like Old School. This was no Old School. Not even close. All the jokes were cheap and crude. Sometimes that works for me but it didn't in this movie. Endless jokes about sexual orientation and stereotypes that I found rather offensive. Stiller is once again playing a doufus and is not funny. I used to be one of his biggest fans but he hasn't been in a decent movie since Keeping the Faith. Vaughn is the only bright spot in this. Some people lap this kinda comedy up. I guess I just get spoiled watching genuinely funny movies that are clever like Caddyshack, Animal House, Old School.",2,3,8,13 December 2004
