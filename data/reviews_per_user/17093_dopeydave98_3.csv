Requiem for a Dream," Over-rated and over hyped
","If you want to watch a 90 minute show reel of camera tricks then this is the movie for you. If you want to watch a movie about the highs and lows of drug taking then go and rent 'Trainspotting'.Many of the 10/10 reviews say this is 'beautifully made' and 'wonderfully shot'. That is all well and good but a movie needs substance and here there is none. I felt no sympathy for any of characters, their downfall being all of their own doing. They made their choices and suffered the consequences, all driven ultimately by greed not to gain some sort of high.Over-rated, over hyped and to be honest I was bored to tears by half way through.",2,6,12,21 August 2006
American History X," A thought provoking film with a masterful leading performance
","When the nominations were announced for the 1998 Oscars I wasn't surprised that Edward Norton had been nominated again. He had lost out in 1996 for his performance in Primal Fear, although I felt at the time the nomination was more of a recognition for a combination of his work which included The People vs Larry Flynt and Everyone Says I love You.The thing that bothered me was the film... American History X. Why had I not heard of it, let alone seen it. Unsurprisingly it had got a very limited distribution in the UK, I guess because of it's content. I waited for the video release and I was not disappointed...!?!Many people have lauded Norton's performance and rightly so. As a demonstration of his range it is masterful. A physical transformation akin to De Niro in Raging Bull, together with an emotional performance that takes in extreme violence, intellectual reasoning, regret, remorse and fear.But there is more to this film than Norton's performance. Avery Brooks' understated Dr Sweeney allows those around him to bring out the emotion of the piece. Stacey Keach's Godfather-like quiet menace is his best role in years. Much must be said too for Tony Kaye's directing, the starkness of the black & white flashbacks works superbly on several levels. It demonstrates how Derek's reasoning was as black & white as the images on screen, together with the sheer bleakness of the life he was leading; out of date film for out of date attitudes.Much has been said of the subject matter and the violence; the subject matter simply cannot be approached without reference to the violence, unfortunately that is the world we live in. David McKenna's script does not pick sides, but skillfully tells it's story without prejudice. Derek is a victim of circumstances, he's avenging the injustice of his father's death, falling under the spell of Alexander, leading the struggle on the streets against the politicians who haven't got a clue what's happening in the real world. Dereks journey from a bright schoolkid to a violent criminal seems so straightforward. Yet the real struggle is the journey back.My one moan would be that we didn't get the opportunity to see more of Derek dealing with life after prison. Norton's portrayal of 'violent' Derek is the lasting image I had of the film, simply because the performance was so good. It's fair to say had he had the chance to explore 'reformed' Derek, Norton with his range would have done a fine job and the film may well have been more widely accepted.All in all a brave film that demonstrates the actors craft perfectly. One of those word of mouth films, like Shawshank, that will be talked about for many years.",10,0,0,17 October 2002
Green Street Hooligans," A Movie of Two Halves...
","I had heard much about this movie and was very much looking forward to seeing it. The most apt a description I can give is that this is a movie of two halves. The first half starts well, we get into the action pretty quick and there's a lot of exciting stuff. The second half descends into melodrama and stumbles along to a predictable conclusion.I can forgive the speed at which fresh faced Elijah is accepted into the firm as this allows us to get straight into the story. Lexi Alexander does a good job getting across the atmosphere and passion of the game and how this spills over into the fighting. The fight scenes themselves are well produced and the reality of finding the other firm whilst avoiding the police is pitched just right. I also liked how we are shown that these 'thugs' are ordinary people during the week doing ordinary jobs.The one thing that grated me was Charlie Hannams laughable Dick Van Dyke cock-er-ney accent. We are told what being a member of a firm is all about... front, respect and belonging. Part of this is the clothes and the language. 'Shat yor maff, you wan-car...' says our Charlie... the rest of the cast who I would hazard a guess grew up in London have it spot on, poor Charlie... it's a good try, but as Don Cheadle found out in Oceans 11, if you get it just slightly wrong you sound like a right muppet...Then we get to the second half. It turns out Charlies brother is the legendary 'Major' with a reputation second to none. When being fronted up by his old foe though he simply wilts. Tommy Hatcher is a has been who has to be about 20 years older than the Major, but still manages to bottle him because he was responsible for the ruck that killed his son. And so begins the melodramatic finish.It's a pity because it all started so well and the premise of a 'yank' being involved is great. I've read the other reviews here and have noticed that most of those that have given the movie a good rating are from the US. Unsurprisingly those giving it lower ratings are from the UK (except one guy from Reading, but then in Reading they wouldn't know good football if it punched them in the face, and they think a good scrap is a conker fight...!). And that says it all really, here we have a clash of cultures. Are we watching a 'film' about the culture of the football firms... or are we watching a 'movie' about a tragic morality tale...I've given it a 6/10 because it is well made, and I am sure those unfamiliar with the football scene will enjoy it as it gives an insight into a unique culture. I applaud Lexi Alexander for having the balls (as it were) to make an interesting and likable movie... film... movie... well you know what I mean...",6,0,2,4 April 2006
