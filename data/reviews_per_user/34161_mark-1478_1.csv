First Man," Stunning in so many ways!
","Ignore those that claim it's boring and long, I have to wonder what those people's attention spans are like.
This film is a visually stunning, incredibly moving with a beautiful soundtrack, it really is hard to dislike anything.
Maybe some people were expecting another Apollo13 type film, and I love that film too but this is just a more beautiful and introspective but no less fascinating film.
Oh and to people complaining about close ups of the actors faces, so what! I found it compelling watching every nuance of their performance up close!
To sum up, watch for yourself and then judge.",9,0,1,20 October 2018
