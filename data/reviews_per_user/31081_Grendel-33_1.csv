Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George does it again
","Like everyone else I heard/read/viewed the negative reviews of Star Wars: Episode One.  Still I went expecting to be impressed and I was.  I felt like I was a kid again.  As soon as 'A Long time ago...' appeared on the screen I felt a thrill.  I thought back to the first time I remembered seeing those words in a theatre.I got what I expected, I had fun at the movies.  Sure the movie had its strengths (Liam and Ewan, podrace, Darth Maul)and its weaknesses (one Jar-Jar not too bad, an entire Race?  Ugh!).  That doesn't take away from the fact that it was a fun night out and I'll recommend it to anyone.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
