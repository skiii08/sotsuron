Source Code," 7,5? seriously?
","I'm not going to gabble... I honestly got bored, tired and felt frustrated at the end. A total loss of time... sorry. the only thing the production and the director was interested in was the exaltation of U.S. troops in Afghanistan fighting for peace(?). The Americans should finally realize that the world doesn't spin around them. They should understand finally that their forces went to Asia and killed thousands of people just to take their oil and put a 'president' they like. Come on people...7,5??? seriously??? Actually the result was disappointing, especially when it comes to a very good actor like Jake Gyllenhaal. I was expecting a more careful movie choice by him.",2,0,5,19 March 2012
