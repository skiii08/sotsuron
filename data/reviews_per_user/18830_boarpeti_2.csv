War Dogs," Great!!!
","I really liked this movie. The humor was quite right, I loved the characters, and the story was fine. The principal characters have a simple but enjoyable drama. In this year I have seen a quite good movie in this category, The Nice Guys was brilliant too. The Lord of War was clearly better but I also liked this. If you like the Nice Guys or the Lord of War this movie will be good for you. And my English is so bad, so I apologies for this. I need more 3 lines.... OH my god. I liked Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in this movie. I like how they are acting. I need two more line... SO just watch it. I hope this will be the last line...",8,6,14,19 August 2016
The Godfather," Excellent
","This movie is phenomenal. Coppola's masterpiece one of my favorite movie. Great casting, great writing, great directing. Coppola has made one of the best cult movies of all time. This movie aged well, his 34 years old but still has a strong cultural influence. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are insane. They acting is phenomenal. This movie has a really strong part. The Godfather is not just a mafia movie, it's not a move just for the mafia and crime movie fans, this movie is recommended for everyone. The movie has a great artistic approach and a great message. The movie is so memorable a lasts for a life.",10,0,0,19 August 2016
