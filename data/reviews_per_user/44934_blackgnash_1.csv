Hereditary," Horrifying, but a must see
","Ok so this movie might not function as a classic jump scare horror movie, but overall it is HORRIFYING! The whole theme of the movie is incredibly dark and the final scene leaves the audience feeling very bleak. Other people have complained that the pace is slow and plot boring, but I think it works well for the storyline. If this movie didn't build up, I don't think the final 30ish min would be as effective in terms of shock. Overall I think this is possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen, because it doesn't just deal with ghosts, but the idea that you never truly know who people are, and their intentions. I honestly hope I never see it again, I was too scared and nervous the first time!",10,23,47,15 June 2018
