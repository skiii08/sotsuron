Deja Vu," one big disappointment
","Saw a screening last night in Century City. Everything about the movie appealed to me before I saw it, Tony Scott, Jerry Bruckheimer, Denzel, Val Kilmer, Jim Caviezal and the story sounded pretty good. When I left the theater I felt pretty empty. I did not expect a time-traveling movie, but I wouldn't have argued if it was believable. From the minute we are introduced to a computer that can go four days in the past and show us footage through walls without the use of cameras, I sorta lost interest. There's suspension of belief, and then there's this. The acting was pretty average at best, but u can forget about character development. The script was flimsy, full of plot holes and feels like it was written by a teenager in my opinion. The only thing that saved it for me was the high production value: good soundtrack and good editing. I don't think that everyone agreed with me because when I left the theater I overheard other people saying they thought it was 'awesome'. So don't take my word for it, see it for yourself. But if you're spending cash on a ticket, there are better things on at the moment.",6,25,53,29 October 2006
