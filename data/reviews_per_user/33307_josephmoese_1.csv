Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Terrible
","The title says it all. I heard this was funny, but the whole thing was crammed with sex, racist jokes that were annoying to begin with. They weren't funny, and the more they happened, the more stupid they were. This gave me the impression that the filmmakers said 'lets just make a lame movie with no plot, but put a lot of sex in it to see you would see it!' It really looked like that. There were stupid jokes that were offensive to so many people. If you are a woman, this is offensive to you. It's offensive to Jewish people as well. It was truly that bad. Don't see it. I really can't stress this enough. Wow, this was a bad movie. Please don't see it.",1,3,9,13 October 2007
