Ford v Ferrari," A CAR RACE FOR THE AGES...!
","James Mangold's (Logan/3:10 to Yuma remake) latest is a fun tale of the rivalry between the Ford car company & Ferrari on who's vehicle would win the infamous 24 hour LeMans race back in the 1960's. Ford enlisted Carrol Shelby, played by Matt Damon, to solve their dilemma which in turn caused Shelby to recruit his best friend/enemy Ken Myles (returning Yuma star Christian Bale) as his driver. Both mavericks in their own fields, Shelby the car maker/seller & Myles the perfectionist racer used their combined talents (& embattled histories) to take on the illustrious task of dethroning the mighty Italian carmaker (who at that point in history made beautiful cars but was in debt). Easy job, you think? You'd be wrong since Ford's underlings & marketing gurus may have had the right ideas on how to make a car look pretty (the '64 launch of their immortal Mustang is featured) but their know how on what made a engine tick properly was lost on them which fuels the constant fire between Ford & Shelby who wanted final say so on the men to race their cars (Miles was pegged as a problematic lone wolf) while Shelby knew he had the right man for the job. Never taking the Cliffs' notes approach to the material but savvy enough to make the car jargon fun & inclusive, this film fires on every cylinder (forgive my car punniage!) staying entertaining & even riveting when we know from history who wins the race. All the actors are in fine mettle including Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, Ray McKinnon, Caitriona Balfe (from Starz's Outlander) & a special mention to Tracy Letts (playwright of Osage County) for his hilarious portrayal of Henry Ford II.",10,2,4,10 December 2019
The Lobster," QUIRKY DOESN'T EQUAL GOOD...!
","This quirky dramedy came from the mind of Yorgos Lanthimos & was nominated for Oscar for original screenplay & originality is to be found in this tale of a man who must find love again in a hotel among the various lovelorn but if a match is not found by a certain time limit, he'll be turned into the animal of the title. I know, it's a grabber. For the most part when the action is confined to the estate, the story works whereby the mechanics of masturbation or nose bleeds yields comedic gold but once our hero, played by Colin Farrell, makes a dash back to the real world, the novelty wears off since the story continues to put arbitrary rules where really there shouldn't be.",6,0,2,20 August 2018
First Man," FIRST STORY THEN FIRST MAN...!
","A dramatic misfire from the reliable Damien Chazelle depicts our first successful mission to the moon from the standpoint of the first man to step on the moon, Neil Armstrong. Having the twin stars of astronaut cinema to contend with, namely The Right Stuff & Apollo 13, First Man needed a lot to bring to the table. Sharing the same faults w/42, the Jackie Robinson biopic, we have a film w/an unknown cipher in its center. Armstrong, along w/Robinson, was an intensely private person who rarely granted interviews, so making him the lead provides an inert, soulless arena where the audience can find no footing so w/o that, the film becomes a sort of documentary w/sprinkles of character trait dropped in like a clogged IV feed tube. Claire Foy comes off best as Armstrong's beleaguered spouse but perhaps focusing on Buzz Aldrin (played by Corey Stoll) would've done the trick since even to this day Aldrin remains one of the most vocal cheerleaders for NASA & space exploration.",5,1,2,23 October 2018
A Star Is Born," NOT BAD FOR WHAT IT IS...!
","An okay remake (the fourth by count) of the perennial favorite starring Bradley Cooper (in his directing debut) & Lady Gaga. Working better as 2 lost souls coming together to make music than a love affair (ultimately I didn't buy it since she had ample examples around her growing up for her to not fall for this loser), the musical sequences win out just barely. I still hold the original from the 30's starring Fredric March/Janet Gaynor as the best version but this one has enough to satisfy audiences who will probably only know this copy. Once the mechanics of the story kick in, there's not much we, as the audience, can do but strap ourselves in for the inevitable.",6,1,2,14 October 2018
The Death of Stalin," THE BIRTH OF HYSTERIA...!
","The latest from Armando Iannucci (In the Loop/TV's Veep) is a scorching black comedy surrounding the days after Stalin's demise & the power vacuum it creates causing his group of sycophantic yes men to turn on each other to see will inherit the succession mantle. Sure it's a comedy about a dictator who killed millions but why carp when the laughs come hard & more importantly often. Starring Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin & Andrea Riseborough who deliver lines laced w/expletives & sarcasm that I suspect the great Billy Wilder may've written them if ever he'd ventured the blue route.",10,1,2,6 February 2019
Captain Marvel," DON'T CALL IT AN ORIGIN STORY...!
","The latest MCU entry gives Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel her own feature (right before being drummed into the Avengers ranks in next month's End Game to do battle) so now audiences will get to see who this woman is & what exactly she'll bring to the Thanos party. Anyway, Marvel, known as Vers, is part of a Kree elite fighting unit holding the Skrull (a shape shifting malevolent race which I first remembered from the 60's Fantastic Four cartoon) at bay as they police the galaxy but due to a mishap when her team attempts to retrieve a spy from a desolate planet, Vers is captured & tortured by the Skrull to gain knowledge of a light speed engine who's creator (played by Annette Bening) died in protecting its location back on Earth. Vers escapes her captors, reaches Earth but soon, due to the after effects of her time spent w/the Skrulls, starts to doubt her existence as evidence shows she's from this planet & not a Kree as she was led to believe. Incorporating de-aging makeup again, we get a younger Nick Fury (& Coulson as well) teaming up w/the lost 'proud warrior' to right things before the truth overwhelms all involved. Handily written & directed by Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck (Sugar/Half Nelson), this film has to do mucho heavy lifting, bridging 2 important sequels, introducing a new character & being a female empowerment manifesto which it does successfully in spurts & starts but being most audiences just want to get this Cliff Notes version of the character & her background out of the way for the main course to come, no one's going to come away so distraught that they'll swear off Marvel forever.",7,2,6,18 March 2019
The Impossible," A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF DESTRUCTION ON DISPLAY...!
","Playing like an earlier cousin of The Wave, The Impossible follows a family's survival during a tsunami wave whilst on vacation. Boasting an early turn by future Spiderman Tom Holland, we see him hold his own against Ewan McGregor & Naomi Watts as he navigates his passage from needy, feckless youth to unabashed adult. J.A. Bayona, now holding the reins of the next Jurassic World flick, has a handle on making the epic intimate & the small grandiose. A welcome respite in a cinematic world which gives us tripe like San Andreas & most of Roland Emmerich's disaster output.",9,1,2,5 July 2018
Last Flag Flying," YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN...!
","A companion piece to The Last Detail (written by Daniel Ponsican who co-scripted here) & directed by Richard Linklater details a trio of Vietnam vets escorting one of their sons home for burial who lost his life fighting in Iraq. Much like Detail, we get a sense of the lives lived since their wartime duty & how for some, things have moved forward while others are stuck in a perpetual cycle of pain & regret. A welcome vehicle for the 3 leads (Steve Carrell, Bryan Cranston & Laurence Fishburne) who perform w/the expertise & nuance you would expect. Another notch in Linklater's belt who at this point in his career seems unable to do no wrong.",10,1,3,14 August 2018
Us," I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR SECONDS...!
","Jordan Peele's much anticipated follow-up to his Oscar winning smash is a bit of a sophomore slump which is a shame given the fact a recent Rolling Stone article had him detailing how he watched other filmmakers second string outings to avoid the case but unfortunately his over-reliance on a world encompassing narrative falls short due to logistical problems & issues of character motivations which in total seem harebrained rather than organic in execution. Its 1986 & an African American family are at the boardwalk when the daughter decides to do some exploring finding herself in a house of mirrors where she encounters a doppelganger of herself which leaves her traumatized & unable to speak. Flash forward 30 years, the girl is now a grown woman w/a family unit of her own (hubby & 2 kids, a boy & girl) out on a vacation which finds them (you guessed it!) back on the same beach from years before which leads to series of events where twins of themselves appear to wreck havoc on the world at large & our family has to step up to meet this existential wrinkle to their very being. And this for me is where the film starts to fall apart where the lookalikes, who are imposing their will to survive over their originals, impart a murderous spree upon the populace but the motivations (especially after we find out who the defacto leader is) become specious & crudely drawn. When the film sticks to its chamber horror conventions (the 1 family being terrorized by their 1 set of duplicates) it works but when we see the global implications of the ending (ala The Birds) the ambiguous ending seems ill thought out & hard to swallow but seeing this movie will make its money back (it made $70 mil in its opening week & debuted at number 1) hopefully the filmmakers will use that knowledge to improve their next effort (storywise) instead of wallowing in the land of easy expectations & quick profits.",6,2,7,25 March 2019
Knives Out," BOUNCING BACK TO MORE EARTHLY CLIMES...!
","Rian Johnson's tricksy return to form after his toe dipping into space opera from last year. Borrowing liberally from Agatha Christie, Johnson's investigation into the murder of a successful mystery writer is a crowd pleaser through & through w/enough jibes at the upper class, latent racists & the working stiffs which serve them. Running a little long for this kind of story but still adroitly hitting the right notes (or feints in this case) to keep the audience guessing until the final verbal reveal where either suspicions will be founded or thwarted. Ana de Armas plays the medical assistant caught in the maelstrom of murderous activity (I admit her large part was surprising & welcome) w/the bumbling cops & private investigator played by Lakeith Stansfield & Daniel Craig respectively, trying to catch up on the clues & red herrings laid out like sinister bread crumbs. The assembled cast is superb but special mention for me must go out to genre vet M. Emmet Walsh (still working in his 80's), Frank Oz as the writer's lawyer, K. Callan (she played Ma Kent on the Adventures of Lois & Clark back in 90's) & Marlene Forte who plays de Armas' mom who I worked w/back in the 90's on a couple of independent films in Hoboken.",7,2,3,24 February 2020
The Irishman," SCORSESE & THE CROOKED WORKING MAN...!
","Martin Scorsese's return to Mafialand, now screening on Netflix, is a slow burn of a movie (3 1/2 hours slow) which finds him in familiar territory as we track the professional life of a painter (mob speak for hitman) Frank Sheeran who went to work for the mob eventually landing as Jimmy Hoffa's bodyguard. Charting the rise of this lowly truck driver to union rep, Robert DeNiro is at his taciturn best only conveying information either directly to us or via voice over. Joe Pesci is also top notch as he plays the antithesis of his prior Scorsese collabs, all sotto voce & steely fortitude as he speaks only when he needs to. The real treat here is seeing Al Pacino, surprisingly in his first outing for Scorsese, all bluster & braggadocio as he feels since he's the top man in the Teamsters he feels he's immune to any intimidations the mob may put to him. Certain internet posts have come down on Anna Paquin, who plays DeNiro's eldest daughter, who has a smidgen of dialogue & conveys her performance through furtive looks & glances as being an underwritten part but seeing she's the conscience her father lacks (at no point do we see him have any remorse or regret for any & all crimes he's committed) that when the eventual reproachment arrives, we're not surprised we've gotten here. Special mention must be given to the extensive use of CG de-aging (the film takes place over a span of decades) which surprisingly was done w/an intricate camera system devised by ILM which can show the youthful fruits of their labor almost instantaneously. Co-starring other Scorsese heavy hitters like Harvey Keitel, Gary Basaraba & Welker White (she played the mouthy babysitter in Goodfellas) w/welcome adds like Bobby Cannavale, Ray Romano, Jesse Plemons, Stephen Graham, Domenick Lombardozzi & Katherine Narducci (who played DeNiro's wife in A Bronx Tale).",10,2,6,2 January 2020
"I, Tonya"," A BIOPIC FOR OUR TIMES...!
","Finally watched the rise & fall of Tonya Harding which won an Oscar for Allison Janney for Best Supporting Actress for 2017 & nabbing a Best Actress nod for Margot Robie. Centering & culminating on the infamous Nancy Kerrigan kneecapping incident, Tonya Harding is presented as a working class woman pushed into ice skating by an overbearing mother where she succeeded but since she came from desperate straits she never garnered the same kind of attention her more polished competitors received. Even marrying a milquetoasty, abusive husband kept Tonya in a perpetual cycle of ridicule, shortcomings & unmet expectations. When a plan is hatched to torment Kerrigan via abusive mailings, her idiotic bodyguard hatches a scheme to hire a couple of brain dead thugs to intimidate her resulting in a kneecap shot heard & seen around the world. Not don't get me wrong, the film is a funny, sad & heartfelt exploration of dumb people doing dumb things but in skewering these knuckleheads, it feels a bit like shooting fish in a barrel making this cinematic attack feel a bit obvious & off putting but if you can stomach this & be a bit numb about the whole thing, you'll enjoy yourself.",7,0,0,28 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Power to the person...!
","Spike Lee's new film about a black policeman who infiltrated the KKK via phone during the 1970's is a triumph of audacious premise & topical racial politics. Denzel Washington's son plays the detective w/a command of the material & a swagger matching his dad's best performances (What a conundrum to make a trip to the multiplex & having to pick either of the Washington films to see). Also w/Adam Driver & Laura Harrier (from Spiderman: Homecoming) this is being hailed as one of Lee's best but forget the hype, just see the film to witness a moment in history we're unlikely to forget.",8,13,26,21 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," THE END OF AN ERA...!
","The last film in the Skywalker trilogy is a mixed bag of satisfied moments & missed opportunities which sums up a situation where a studio sets out to make a trilogy w/o any semblance of a plan. Not to bog down this critique w/a synopsis of the film, I can only say I feel I'm in a better place here then I was w/the prequels but that's like saying you prefer hospital food over airline food. Why Kathleen Kennedy, in her years as a producer on many of Spielberg's efforts & being married to Frank Marshall (another big time producer) some things may've worn off on her as to how to run a tight ship but as evidenced by the jazz like nature of this trilogy's construction (& even in the stand alone films Rogue One & Solo which also went through their own problematic births) one has to ask, what were you thinking? Anyhoo, J.J. Abrams (who I loved what he did w/the first Star Trek film, a franchise he admits he had no affinity for) works his usual grand idea scheme (w/sloppy follow through) which according to the social media community (which is already going gaga over Colin Trevorrow's aborted episode 9 story-line) is enough for a hanging but what did they expect? The sheer weight of financial responsibility is what Disney is looking at. Even their misguided live action remake of The Lion King made money so if the bottom line is reached then the quality of the material will be forgiven.",6,2,5,22 January 2020
Bird Box," SIMPLE & TO THE POINT...!
","The current hot topic on the internet is this horror outing starring Sandra Bullock. When the world goes tits up (in this case a mysterious force causes people who're are exposed to it, mainly if they lock eyes on it, to kill themselves off while the ones who survive are insane anyway prompting them to attack the survivors, who've taken to blindfolding themselves while outdoors, exposing them to the entity so they can share in their group vision) a band of humans (Bullock & her 2 small children) try to reach a sanctuary at the end of a raging river to avoid the madness which has overtaken the planet. Wildly imaginative & horribly prescient, this end of times scenario would make for a great double bill w/last year's A Quiet Place, another doomsday affair predicated on another hampered sense (in that film loud noises) which humans have to embrace to survive. Keeping things to its most bare bones in terms of cause & affect (we never see the creatures or find out from whence they came), this nail biter is the closet thing the States will have as a true amalgamation of a J horror film (even though I remember a film from 1984 called Impulse which had people acting out their wildest fantasies overnight). Well worth the watch & hopefully a harbinger for things to come as Netflix starts exacting quality over quantity.",8,1,2,26 February 2019
We're the Millers," BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE...!
","I admit I was little lazy getting to this title since I don't go out of my way to see many comedies on the big screen (especially the current crop of vulgar, loud efforts Hollywood loves to inflict upon us) but when they pop up on video, that's when I usually cross them off my list. Coming from the director of Dodgeball, Jason Sudekis plays a career drug dealer who loses his stash & cash putting him in thrall to his boss, Ed Helms. Helms' proposition is to pick up a load of drugs from across the border & bring it back to the States. Seeing the easiest way for this endeavor to succeed is for him to pose as a family man in a RV on vacation to tote his swag so he enlists a neighbor, a street kid & his stripper neighbor (Jennifer Aniston) to be his family & away the comic antics go. Better than I thought it would be, it was an easy view from start to finish. The charades scene is one for the books.",7,0,0,20 May 2019
Yesterday," NOT QUITE THERE, NEEDED MORE TIME IN THE IDEA OVEN...!
","The latest from director Danny Boyle (28 Days Later/Slumdog Millionaire) & writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings & a Funeral/Notting Hill) is a mind-bending treatise on the notion of sanctified memory (the music of the Beatles) existing in a world where they never existed except in the memory of a busking, struggling singer/songwriter who decides to take advantage of this scenario. An intriguing concept struggles to maintain its novelty throughout the run time since the follow through can't quite successfully hit its mark. Most audiences will be primed for seeing anything to do w/the Beatles but in this new world there is no fallout to admitting the truth to something that doesn't exist but that doesn't stop our lead from feeling guilty about his deception even though his conclusion feels one sided & hollow. Boyle does well by the material since some of his films have a bit of wonderment & whimsy laced in them & Curtis strolls his usual tropes (the bumbling best friend ala Notting, the one girl in his life he falls for cue Four Weddings) even mining his own About Time, which dealt w/memory & changes to timelines, to concoct this fantasy which does have a decent but undemanding ending even though we still feel things are off.",5,1,2,10 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," AND WE'RE DONE...OR ARE WE?...
","The wrap-up to last's year Infinity War is a satisfying wellspring of closure to many of our Marvel faves as the battle against Thanos & his minions to save the universe & perhaps restore the lost lives that were disappeared when the snap heard around the universe was instituted. Not going into the outcomes of some characters or mucking about in spoilers, this effort by the Russo brothers is gargantuan in scope & intent as multiple storylines through 22 separate films comes to a head. Whether you come from your screening satisfied or frustrated, you must give heed to the Herculean effort attempted & accomplished. This is surely a film for the ages.",10,122,231,6 May 2019
Toy Story 4," A WINNER BY ANY OTHER NUMBER...!
","The latest from the Pixar dream factory is a slow charmer featuring the further adventures of our beloved toy characters. Not getting a good feeling when this film was announced (I figured a bloated cash grab ala Finding Dory) I was slowly seduced to this new story which finds Woody's new owner entering school & having to deal w/a newly created member of the family in the form of Forky (a figure made by Bonnie in class w/a spork) who has delusions of being a piece of disposable garbage (anathema to the toys' raision de etre) & his own feelings of impending obsolescence when Bo Peep (voiced by returning actress Annie Potts), an ownerless toy now basking in the glories of freedom, focuses his anxieties in a new light. Deeply layered & textured w/the winning combo of comedy & heart that the best of Pixar produces, this film rewards in abundance.",10,0,3,24 July 2019
The Favourite," IT'S A CURRENT FAVORITE FOR ME...!
","Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar bait from last year which yielded Oscar gold for Olivia Coleman (for Best Actress) is a period piece which dusts off the stodginess off of most period pieces. Not being especially well liked by me (especially 2 of his earlier efforts The Lobster & The Killing of a Sacred Deer), Lanthimos finally finds a project which perfectly suits his esthetic. Queen Anne is out of sorts in her kingdom both externally (they're at war w/France) & at home (she's childless) & the only thing holding everything together is her loyal (& conniving) lady in waiting played by Rachel Weisz but things get more interesting when a distant cousin (played by Oscar nominee Emma Stone) comes into the picture & turns the household upside down. Mixing influences as disparate as Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (its use of fish eye lenses & natural lighting) & Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (modern sensibilities brought to a chamber drama) w/a razor sharp wit that could cut diamonds, this film opens the possibility for future takes which can winnow out the cobwebs of a genre most viewers may find quaint or picturesque. Also starring Nicholas Hoult (the current Beast in the X-Men series) & more bunnies you can shake an Easter Sunday at.",9,3,6,24 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I DOUBTED THIS, I'M GLAD I WAS WRONG...!
","Quentin Tarantino's newest is another in his revisionist cinematic history lessons which by the initial trailers I was little worried about since I didn't get what kind of thrust the released product would be but shame on me for having any doubts. Taking place in the 1969, we get a glimpse of a world where Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor & his stunt double, Brad Pitt, live in & out of their respective pockets as they try to stay employed & more importantly relevant in Tinseltown where a sea change of creativity & change was now in full swing. DiCaprio's aging Western star is now making ends meet doing bit villain turns against other actors who's stars are in the ascendant while Pitt has to collect a paycheck being DiCaprio's all around valet & handyman since his days as a stunt performer (the surgical scars on his body belie the once buoyant heyday of his glory days while a rumor of his offing his wife still hangs over him like an albatross) seems to be in his rear-view. All of this would be enough for a pleasant narrative but we also have to deal w/the real life players in these characters' orbit like Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), an up & coming actress who's pregnant w/director Roman Polanski's child & more importantly Charles Manson's flower children who cross paths w/Pitt & who will play a historic part in the annals of Hollywood murder cases for all time. That the last sequence doesn't give historians the ending they were expecting is something Tarantino has mastered for the bulk of his career & it should be applauded rather than chided since truth in this case would be rote & expected giving this denouement a welcome cold water splash of irony. Look for Damian Lewis (Billions) as an uncanny doppelganger for Steve McQueen (I thought it was CG for a sec).",10,36,54,7 August 2019
Call Me by Your Name," LOVE AT FIRST SLIGHT...!
","One of last year's best picture nominees (& eventual winner for James Ivory's adapted screenplay) is a beautiful ode to love. A professor in Italy takes in his usual summer intern which catches the eye of his 17 year old son during the summer of 1983. That the intern is an older man may make some rankle at the idea but the intelligence & maturity in the way the love affair is handled is admirable when a lesser filmmaker may have gone for something tawdry or exploitative. Timothy Chalamet gives a performance for the ages tracing the nuances & difficulties of one's first love & the final speech by his father, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, makes you catch your breath at its insight & wisdom. Thanks to all involved.",10,2,4,23 August 2018
1917," THE ONE SHOT TO END ALL OTHER ONE SHOTS...!
","This year's Best Picture Oscar nominee is a one shot (cuts hidden digitally) journey of a pair of soldiers during WWI trying to get a message to a unit about to engage in an attack which is actually a trap laying in wait. Sam Mendes (Spectre/American Beauty) has co-scripted an ambitious meditation on duty & sacrifice plunging the viewer into the horrors of trench warfare by solely focusing on these 2 comrade in arms (George Mackay, Dean Charles-Chapman) who take on this suicide mission (Chapman's brother is part of the unit they're heading to) when the odds aren't especially great. This visceral quest is felt in almost every frame as the dirt, blood & weirdly flowers engulf the screen making the experience a singular event. Yes one could argue that the sheer propensity of episodes (an enemy plane crash near one of the pair's stops, meeting up w/a French woman caring for an orphaned baby, a sniper attack which needs to be dealt with) may cause some audience members to decry 'come on!' but this may be the most intimate of epics put to screen so relish it while you can. Co-starring some Brit heavy hitters like Mark Strong, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch & Richard Madden.",9,2,3,13 February 2020
Sing Street," WHEN DREAMS MEET REALITY...!
","What a beautiful feeling it is when you follow your dreams... Sing Street follows this maxim to its fullest as a notion takes shape in the form of a band during the 80's music vid heyday in Ireland. As his world crumbles around him, his parents are breaking up, navigating a new school replete w/bullies & despotic Catholic figureheads, our hero, w/the unflinching support of his stoner brother, starts a band w/a bunch of fellow pariahs hoping just to shoot a music video to impress the older girl who has caught his eye but what he gains is self-confidence, wisdom beyond his years & also a knack for writing catchy songs. Not a bad trade-off for this heartwarming, inspiring yarn that tickled me delighted & left me w/a healthy dose of nostalgia.",10,0,0,5 July 2018
Cold War," LOVE STORY DURING THE COLD WAR...!
","A nominee for Best Foreign Language at last year's Oscars. Taking place during the turbulent Communist regime'd years in Poland during the 1960's, a pianist/talent scout & the singer he discovers embark on a romance which spans time & runs the gamut of emotions. As much a romance between people of different strata while serving as a commentary on the failings of a repressive government trying to stymie the creativity of artistes, this film, shot in gorgeous black & white (much like director Pawel Pawlikowski's previous feature Ida), is episodic yet an emotionally involving treatise on love which tugs at the heartstrings but empowers one's sense of time & place when a love affair begins w/the best of intentions only to be hampered by the marching drums of history.",10,1,1,20 January 2020
Midsommar," TERROR IN A FOREIGN LAND...!
","Ari Aster's follow-up to last year's Hereditary comes in the form of this kin to films like The Wicker Man & White Dawn. A woman, played by Florence Pugh, has suffered a massive tragedy when her sister commits suicide taking her parents w/her when linked hoses filled w/carbon monoxide run throughout the family home. Already feeling somewhat of an emotional burden to her boyfriend, this turn of events does not bode this relationship well. The boyfriend invites her to a remote village in Sweden to participate in a summer festival along w/3 other college pals working on their theses. That her beau is already feeling pangs of break-up fuels the underlying tension already in the air when the activities take a turn from the quaint to the macabre. A sense of impending inevitability soon supplants the proceedings as each member of the foreign visitors disappear under mysterious circumstances leaving breadcrumbs towards an ending even Stevie Wonder can see coming. Aster has crafted the perfect antidote to the noisy, obnoxious shock-fests which frequently populate our multiplexes by asking his audiences to go along for a ride that may not be easy but imminently satisfying.",9,3,9,24 July 2019
The Disaster Artist," THIS FILM TORE ME APART...!
","Probably the closet we have to an Ed Wood for our generation comes in the form of Tommy Wiseau magna-opus The Room. Apatow & company have decided to chronicle the making of this razzie bait from when the lead actors first met through the troubled shoot & the not all that surprising cult status the film has sustained. Equal parts obvious lampoon & a homage made w/love, James Franco directs this Oscar nominated script & plays Tommy w/delightful obtuseness while his brother Dave, plays his partner in crime. Love all the cameos from the Apatow universe but my favorite has to be Sharon Stone who shows up as Dave's one scene & out agent.",9,1,2,20 August 2018
Mudbound," AN AMERICAN CLASSIC...!
","Mudbound is the story of two returning GI's coming back from combat during WWII to an America that hasn't changed at all. Being that the soldiers are black & white, are both undergoing the onset of war trauma & their financial straits are pretty much the same cannot overcome the inherit racism which will keep them apart. Dee Rees, in her strongest outing yet as a writer/director, takes a page from the book of Terence Malick using multiple voice overs from various characters to weave a tableau of regret, hate & inevitability. No easy answers are found here but one hopes the slow but steady steps of progress makes this tale hopeful.",10,1,6,30 July 2018
Sausage Party," NO NO, I'M A VEGAN...!
","Sausage Party is an anarchic, smarmy, repellent excuse for an animated feature but it is also quite brilliant. Bringing in disparate influences such as Bakshi & Crumb, Rogen & company sexually deviant doper humor makes this akin to a magnificent car crash you can't look away from. You'll never walk through your local supermarket & feel the same again.",9,2,2,5 July 2018
Joker," DO WE GET THE LAST LAUGH...?
","Todd Phillips (Old School/The Hangover trilogy, scary to refer to them that way) foray into the comic book world comes in the form of this origin story. Following roughly along the lines of the graphic novella The Killing Joke (w/sprinkles of The Dark Knight Returns), this dark tale focuses on Arthur Fleck's (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles w/his own brand of madness, working a sorry job as a clown, caring for his home-bound mom who once worked for the Wayne estate (played by Six Feet Under's Frances Conroy who was also in DC's ill-fated Catwoman w/Halle Berry) & pining his hopes on becoming a successful comedian so much so that he'll get an opportunity to appear on his favorite late night talk show (whose host is played by Robert DeNiro) but the world he inhabits (reminiscent of the Big Apple's grungy grime of the 70's) infects his very soul where even his laughter seems to be killing him (posited as an extension of his Tourette's syndrome). When things start to spiral (a vicious attack by some youths as he tries to recover property they've stolen from him) & the eventual release comes when he stands up to 3 Wall Street types on a subway car, Fleck ditches his meds & finds new purpose to his being as he rises to meet his fate. Heavily influenced by 2 pillars of Scorsese filmdom (Taxi Driver & The King of Comedy), not to mention the stunt casting of DeNiro (star of both those masterpieces) provides a template for this narrative which feels like a strong performance shoehorned into a very familiar & predictable story-line but other than some lapses in faith in the audience attention span, the film works in spite of itself.",7,0,1,3 November 2019
It Chapter Two," IT ENDS BUT I WISH IT WAS BETTER...!
","The sequel to the 2017 megahit now focuses on the characters from the first film, 27 years later, as they, as adults, must overcome their fears to defeat Pennywise once & for all. Focusing on the easier aspects of most modern horror films (the ubiquitous jump scare), this film works in fits & starts, strong when its uses its shock tactics & spot on casting to its good graces but then wasting them away by its rinse & repeat story construction which balloons the running time to nearly three hours. Some side characters are also given short shrift, namely a bully from their past & some of the spouses in the present, which are mentioned for the sake of the novel (& utilized better in the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation) but never truly integrated into the through line cohesively. A rumored longer cut may solve these issues ultimately when viewed w/chapter 1 but it's a shame the studio which released over nearly 20 hours of Tolkien material (The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit trilogies) went the chintzy route for this masterstroke of modern horror fiction.",6,0,0,17 September 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," I'LL TAKE A SLICE PLEASE...!
","Definitely a mouthful but this title may be the most difficult thing about this simple & charming love story involving books. Not since the immaculate 84 Charing Cross Road has a film been so enamored w/the act of reading (you hear that you millennials!). During the reconstruction period in England after WWII, an up & coming writer receives a letter asking for a copy of a tome which a book club wants. We find out the club was formed when Nazis occupied the Isle of Guernsey & the inhabitants were under curfew so when a few are caught after hours the quick thinking members said they lost track of time due to their club's meeting running late. So enthralled w/the tale, the writer (played by Lily James) embarks on a mission to find out how & why this club was formed only to discover a bigger mystery in the offing. Directed w/efficient verve by Mike Newell (4 Weddings & a Funeral/Mona Lisa's Smile), this movie doesn't demand much of its viewers but why should it.",8,0,1,23 September 2018
12 Strong," DO HORSES GET MEDALS...?
","Chris Hemsworth stars in the story of the first elite unit sent to Afghanistan after the events of 9/11 to strike the first decisive blow to the Taliban. From a historical perspective, the details of what actually happened back in 2001 colors the film w/the same kind of brush that films which dealt w/the Vietnam War like The Green Berets or more recently We Were Soldiers act as if the moral & ethical realities of that conflict didn't exist putting this film into a kind of 'ship in a bottle' state of existence. Good actors appear here like Michael Shannon & Michael Pena but they're not given much to do but shoot their weapons & look like warriors doing it. A much better film I felt was Lone Survivor (or 4 Strong) which told the same kind of story w/the appropriate level of gungho-ness & loss. A nice bit of stunt casting is of Hemsworth's wife played by Elsa Pataky, his wife in real life.",5,3,6,15 October 2018
Parasite," ONE OF 2019'S BEST...!
","Bong Joon-ho's (Snowpiercer/The Host) latest is coming to local screens w/the Palm D'Or stamp of excellence & it is well deserved. This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!",10,16,24,9 December 2019
Marriage Story," A MARRIAGE AT THE SEAMS...!
","Noah Baumbach's (The Squid & the Whale/Greenberg) current Oscar bait, airing on Netflix, stars Adam Driver & Scarlet Johansson as a couple in the throes of divorce. He is a theater director in New York, she is an actress & California transplant, who had a hit film back in the day but now performs in a play her beau is mounting for the stage. Something has happened & we never get a definitive cause as to the genesis of their breakup but when civility starts to crumble (they're hoping to negotiate the divorce on their own for peace of mind & their young son) but when accusations & resentments begin to surface, lawyers are engaged (she has Laura Dern in her corner while he gets Alan Alda & Ray Liotta). What follows is a modern update of Kramer Vs. Kramer (Best Picture winner 40 years ago) in which words do strike blows (their final verbal brush-up is more potent & devastating than any cinematic gunfight witnessed in some time). Baumbach, as always is a master of character & situation, as he has always mined the humor found in the most debase of scenarios. Who knows if the director's real life break-up w/actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (she is a celebrated actress from the West Coast) inspired the proceedings here but one hopes a lot of the emotional carnage on display is pure supposition. Also starring Merritt Weaver (as ScarJo's sister), Julie Hagerty (nice to see her again, this time playing the mother who doesn't favor sides) & Wallace Shawn ('Inconceivable!') playing an actor in Driver's troupe.",10,3,7,2 January 2020
Taken 2," Bryan Mills is back...
","One of the great pleasures coming of out the Besson/Kamen studios was the first Taken.A lean & mean B action picture that moved like a speeding train through its storyline of a wayward ex CIA operative out to rescue his kidnapped daughter.In this sequel, we have the Albanian underworld out for revenge for the body count Bryan left behind.All in all a pretty solid plot for the sequel yet the writers fudge things up trying to replicate what the original was.Instead of really coming to terms with what their lives would be like since their previous adventure, we have manufactured scenes of grenades being detonated to establish locations, a girl who continually fails her driving exam becomes a stunt driver extraordinaire when the need suits it & most glaringly omitted is the original's sense of forward progression & organic tension is left on the sidelines solely to feature routine gun fights & car chases.A shame.",4,0,0,12 October 2012
Midway," EPIC STORYTELLING ON A CONVEYOR BELT...!
","From Roland Emmerich (2012/Independence Day) comes his stylized (& albeit typically destructive take) on the famous skirmish between American & Japanese forces at sea. After making the fatal error in not believing the Japanese were going to strike Pearl Harbor, the Americans are determined to make a decisive attack on their foes by taking out their aircraft carriers (using dive bombing tactics). Using a plethora of CG imagery (some an eyesore, others impressive especially the aerial combat sequences) to depict the battle sequences, the film works whenever Emmerich decides to let the images speak for themselves but whenever the poor actors open their mouths to espouse obvious historical points in 40's twinged New Yawk accents, one's eye rolling can become a liability. Starring some Brits playing yanks like Ed Skrein (who's gunnery partner is played by Keean Johnson, they both were in Alita: Battle Angel) & Luke Evans & able support by Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Mandy Moore, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas & Darren Criss.",6,1,2,26 November 2019
Green Book," LIKEABLE TRUE STORY IN THE MIDST OF RACISM...!
","A immensely likeable true story of a couple of New Yorkers, one, an Italian from the Bronx hired as a driver to a black man from Manhattan, a piano prodigy, on a Southern bound tour w/his band. Played by Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali respectively, this offbeat duo generate credible warmth & understanding as we see 2 opposites deal w/an ever changing world. Coming from Peter Farrelly, one half of the writing/directing duo behind many gross out hits, this down to Earth 'reel but true' account of this mismatched pair hits the right note of historical perspective & measured levity in a story that could've gone badly if presented incorrectly. Luckily the performances of the leads garner much good will making the obvious tough scenes of racial prejudice go down w/the right amount of distance & recognition.",8,2,4,17 December 2018
