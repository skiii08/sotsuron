Child 44," Perspective is key
","This movie is entirely a depiction of the Stalin-era from the inside and all the professional reviews I read miss this, which is the very point of the film. It is banned in Russia for a reason... The movie is criticized because the investigation is out of place. OF COURSE IT IS. The film-makers just used it as a 'cover-up' so to say. It probably would have been too much on the screen, and they probably wouldn't have gotten the financial backing if they make a movie only showing the cruelties of the dictatorship.Good cast, the role suits Tom Hardy well, he puts in a great performance, and so does the rest of the cast.This movie is an exceptional view of the 1950 Russia, and it's a unique work because not many movies cover this subject. I reckon people tend to miss the point because they never experienced any of the soviet system, and that fact makes you see things very different.I recommend for everyone to see, because it really shows what life was like back then, unimaginable. I saw other reviews on IMDb all rating 10, that tells you a lot. Great movie, covering a rare subject, and it's spot on with what it wants you to see.10/10",10,0,2,14 March 2016
