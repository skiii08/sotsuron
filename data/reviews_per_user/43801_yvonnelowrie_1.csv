Skyfall," Skyfall review
","This wasn't the best or worst Bond. I thought Adele who sang the theme did a great job but I felt producers put her in the role to appeal to a new and younger generation of Bond who are not aware of the films. A few weeks ago my friend came up to me and said 'did you see the new bond movie, that old women at the end died' I got ticked off as 'M' the old lady was a very central character in the films and the reason he was attracted to the film because of Adele and was not aware of the history of the films and Ian Flemming's characters.At first I was a bit sceptical of Sam Mendes directing the movie but the end result was outstanding. The casting was great but one person I felt didn't match their role was Naomie Harris who played Moneypenny. The effects were brilliant so were the pyrotechnics at the end when Bond's childhood home blew up.overall the movie was great!",7,1,7,25 November 2012
