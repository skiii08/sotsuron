Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Enough Already ...
","Look, there are parts of this movie that are over the top no doubt. I am a person who is pretty conservative on the whole and actually (the few) a George Bush supporter ... but you know what? This stuff is still hysterical. Now, it's not hysterical consistently throughout, but the hysterical parts are just too dang funny not to give this movie an overall good review. The only part that bothered me was trying to decipher between the scripted and the unscripted scenes. Let me tell you, if it was all NON-scripted as the producers claim, it's even funnier. Sure, some of the gags are cruel. Sure, some of the stuff sort of laughs at a 'stupid' America. But it's still funny. Does the anti-American stuff bug me some? You bet. But is it inaccurate or unfunny? Absolutely not. You've got to be able to laugh at yourself to appreciate this film, but if you can, it's funny, and it's unique. Not quite as funny as the infamous 'Throw the Jew down the well' skit in his Ali G show which is still the funniest skit Cohen has ever done, but all funny nonetheless. Step outside of yourself for a minute and laugh at all of it.",7,1,3,13 October 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Excellent Film
","I have actually seen a few bad reviews in here and I'm very surprised by them. This movie was really terrific. If you are looking for realism, I'm not sure where I could point you. 3:10 to Yuma is based on a story from about 40 years ago so of course it is going to have some points that seem 'far fetched.' They are all within the context of the movie. The acting is outstanding. I'm convinced Russell Crowe hasn't made a bad movie since 'Virtuosity.' Christian Bale is rapidly ascending the ranks with Crowe and Edward Norton as guys who simply don't put their names on to bad films (the Norton clown movie aside). Suspenseful the whole way through and great viewing. Nothing bad to say about it. One parallel I will draw though that may be a bit abstract but for those of you who have seen it I think you'll get the gist .... 3:10 to Yuma has a lot of 'A Bronx Tale' in it (or should I say vice versa since this is a remake). Either way, watch it.",9,1,4,1 March 2008
No Country for Old Men," Parts are great, but on the whole overrated
","I liked the movie a lot for at least the first hour. However, truth be told, I was braced by everyone I had spoken to about the 'awful non-ending.' So at least I was ready for a lot of disappointment at the end and that was good, because the disappointment aspect certainly didn't disappoint.Some observations on the whole: the Llewelyn character is the best in the movie and is killed off so unceremoniously that the movie loses a lot right there. In a weird way, it reminded me of 'Psycho,' how so much time is spent developing one character and that character winds up being very secondary. Next: the whole Javier Bardem academy award thing is eluding me. To me, this role wasn't even challenging. How is it hard to play a robotic serial killer who delivers every line with the exact same cadence? When I see all the hype this guy got, it makes me wish I got into acting. Nice job mind you, but not a difficult role.My biggest problem with this movie though is the long string of superfluous characters. Woody Harrelson's character is completely and utterly useless. I'm not sure why that character even existed in this. The Tommy Lee Jones character is deep at some levels, but besides making one phone call to Llewelyn's wife and walking into the one hotel room, he doesn't pursue our villain at all. In fact, he doesn't do much of anything save serve as philosopher-Du-jour (in a hick sort of way) to the audience. I just don't get it --- he in the end, seemed equally useless.Normally I like movies with odd endings, I really do (I even wrote a novel as such). I enjoyed Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, and heck, I even LIKED the way the Sopranos ended --- but this just lost me. Not confused me, but lost me. In the end it all seemed very pointless and if that's the only point the movie makes, all I can hang on to are the positives of some good suspense scenes and some stellar acting by Brolin. Watch it once, and file it under 'overrated.'",5,1,3,27 April 2008
Blood Diamond," Surprised by the Negatives in Here
","I'm very surprised by the number of negative comments about this film. Was it perfect? No. Did it have perhaps a little bit too much on the action sequences? Absolutely. Still, it was compelling and I thought DiCaprio was terrific. Those of you mocking his South African accent have clearly never been there. I thought it was spot on. What this film was was a movie with a good message that managed to entertain too; which is perhaps the best way you can ever really get a message across anyway. Education while entertaining makes something a lot more memorable. I think the critics in here are being way too harsh. I t was a very good film and extremely well acted. Poking holes in it for the sake of comparing it to docudrama films is missing the point.",8,1,2,21 June 2007
