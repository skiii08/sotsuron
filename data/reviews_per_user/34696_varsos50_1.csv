The Expendables 2," 1.30 hours wasted.
","People, please are you serious ? 7.5 for this no movie ? acting = terrible, scenario = terrible, action = childish , directing = awful even close to truth = 0% . This one was made for the pension of Norris,Arnold and Sta. Bruce , Jan and Jason had never participate in this one. I wasted 1.30 hours. do not see this one. Even if this one supposed to be a comedy it failed with phrases with no humor at all said by actors that deserve an anti-Oscar. The guns, bullets, dead people are not only outrageous but not even close for an action movie believable. There is only one very true saying in the film : we all are for the museum.",2,2,5,30 September 2012
