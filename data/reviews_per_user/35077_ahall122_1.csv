The Ring," Somebody wake me when this gets scary
","It shouldn't take this long for a horror movie to get scary. I saw The Ring at a preview and I'm sorry it doesn't live up to the hype. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has more scary moments.First off this movie steals elements from so many other horror films and uses them incompetently. The whole into comes from Scream, the creepy kids who can see ghosts from Sixth Sense and on and on.An evil demon child 'who should never have been born' makes an evil video tape that looks like a rejected Nine Inch Nails video and seven days after watching it, the viewer dies. So what does the heroine do, she shows it to everyone she cares and about, but won't let strangers see it.The one, genuinely, creepy moment comes at the end, but by the time you get to it, you want the evil demon child to get rid of all the morons you've seen in the movie so far. And the end was the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.Seeing this makes me want to see if the Japanese original is nearly half as dumb and incompetently done.",1,0,2,19 October 2002
