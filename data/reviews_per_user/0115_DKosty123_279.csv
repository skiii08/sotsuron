The King's Speech," Historic Footnote Makes A List
","Can Guy Pearce make it a triple crown this year? What movie is he working on and can he be the actor cast in 3 Hollywood Best Pictures in a row? Of course he had no chance of the Best Acting Oscar here.This film to me has great performances by Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, speech therapist & Colin Firth as George VI. Pearce is definite support here as Edward VIII who steps down. There is a lot of other solid support too and it thankful that Director Tom Hooper keeps it under 2 hours.What impresses me the most about this film is how well fleshed out the relationship between Lionel Logue and George VI is portrayed. You can feel the realism in the acting between the two. That is because 9 weeks before the film production began the producers found Lionel's Grandson had personal letters written by Lionel & Goeorge VI in his home along with a hand written diary. This allowed the script to put some of the real lines from the letters into the script.The history around the film being set from 1925 to 1939 is very well thought out and portrayed. The film while rather dark has some impressive sets in it. While the film focus is in the speech because of the title, I believe the story could be better told by revisiting the diary and letters that were found before the film was made, and rewriting the script to focus on the reality in those documents. In other words, the relationship between Logue and George VI being the centerpiece of the story instead of the speech would make it a better film.Still this is a more than adequate portrayal of the real history being brushed across the top. This is drama and there are a couple of bursts of language that make it a PG 13. This is a light rating though as the kids in the film indicate in one scene.Pearce's accidental best picture streak has a lot to do with luck here. The Academy of Motion Pictures chose this as Best Picture for a very good reason. This film is about as Conservative a portrayal of real History as you can get. The Election in the US last November indicates that this film is a very safe choice for Best Picture as this movie has almost nothing that can be considered Liberal. In January, 2014 when America starts fining it's own citizen's for not carrying Health Care insurance, there will be a real test for where political opinions are going.",8,0,0,23 April 2011
Saturday Night Fever," One Trick Pony
","This was John Travolta's first big step from being a 'sweathog' on Welcome Back Kotter. It was promo-ed with a lot of studio hype with a disco beat in the middle of 1977 disco-mania across the country. The big part of the promotion was Travolta on the fancy dance floor with the strobe lights.Unless you like disco, & that sequence. you will find the rest of the movie is forgettable. There is little to recommend it either though at least Vinnie Barbrino got to escape from Kotter's series. I don't know what it was but Marcia Strassman is still my vote for the worst looking sitcom wife. Even when she did Honey I Shrunk The Kids later, I never can picture her as an attractive woman.As long as you like John & that dance sequence this movie is for you. If you don't like either thing, I'd not waste my time as the rest of the movie is nothing worth watching. I am not even sure if this mess has a plot.",5,1,2,7 March 2008
The Benchwarmers," Title says it all- Movie Belongs on Bench
","Benchwarmers is where this film belongs, on the bench unless you've got nothing else to see. If you like some of the cast members, this is a film to watch but the script is kind of lame at several points. You have to set reality aside to look for the jokes & even some of those miss the mark. In fact, quite a few of them do. Even David Spade is not as funny in this as he is in other roles. My favorite actor in the whole thing is the house keeping robot. He is the unique idea & quite cool. Too bad the rest of the film isn't as original. They try to elevate ordinary people from the bench to superstars, but in the end the idea is old & falls short of what you'd like to see & short in the punchline department. A fairly talented cast is wasted here & can't overcome the weak script.",4,1,2,13 August 2006
Moneyball," Missed Opportunity
","This is a movie with a great tale to tell. I have too believe the book is better. I think I know why too. This movie tries to tell the story as a great Managment Story, General Manager Story to be exact. The trouble is the heart is taken out of the story because of that approach.I understand that Brad Pitt is trying to be made into a great actor. The trouble is Pitt is not a great actor. He can't carry a film because all his career he has been women's eye candy. Now that he is not as young as he once was, this movie proves it.He is surrounded by a good supporting cast, but the folks around him are wasted as this movie tries to prove that a general manager and a Yale graduate with a computer can win in baseball. Making management into a hero is something that will warm the 1 percent, but leaves the 99% out cold.When the film is using baseball clips, it is at it's strongest. For some reason, the script conversion here has dialog which does not allow the cast to really dig in. I understand Pitt is retiring from acting in 2 years. This movie proves he has never really acted. Granted, you could blame the script he is reading from but Pitt seems to be wooden in every film he has ever done.Once the movie gets past 2 hours, it gets too long. It is based on a true story but I would think the real people had better emotions and words than the cast here has or does. Hoffman is nearly wasted in his role as Manager Art Howe, a role which he is perfect for but gets very little script to work with.This movie about the Oakland A's could have been so much better. It fails to point out the human element. It makes me long for Jim Bouton's 1960's novel 'Ball Four' which is a great picture of Baseball before free agency and money. Too bad that kind of baseball book can not be written now so we can compare what Jim Catfish Hunter's first free agent victory has really done too change the game.This movie is half-baked. I hope the book is much better.",5,1,1,22 June 2012
The Avengers," Comic Book Team Makes It To Movies
","I remember the Avengers comic books from when I was a kid, a while ago. While this movie is not perfect, it does catch the spirit of the comic book quite well. The characters are drawn like they are supposed to be because there is not a lot of emotional stuff in comic books (except the love triangle of Archie, Betty & Veronica.This movie takes a talented cast and puts together the story of a threat from Odin, another world no less. It does not really get to showing what Odin looks like, but it does have a couple of big time residents from that world, one good and one evil, that the fights center around.There is some light comedy which is always needed to break up the action. A particular comedy blackout scene is Thor and Hulk beating up some bad guys. Then when the bad guys are done, Hulk and Thor are standing together and suddenly Hulk punches Thor out.There is some confusion about bringing everyone together to wage this battle. Some of the battle sequences get a little muddy which is why I can't give this movie a perfect rating. All in all, it does well enough. This Marvel film holds up better than some of the early ones in that the action is spaced with pauses at the right times to refresh the viewer. To me the original Iron Man had this problem, so much action in the latter half that the mind went numb.As for the women, well tight leather on well rounded women always goes over well in my mind. The only woman not in leather is Starks girl. Still there is something to be said for the imagination a tight leather outfit can bring to the screen. Helps the pg rating too. I was able to stay awake for this one which says something too.I will not ID the entire cast here as that has already been done. What I am amazed at is the way the movie entertains without 4 letter words, much like the comic books of old. This is very much the traditional Saturday Afternoon movie that a whole generation was brought up on before face-book, cell phones, and all the change took place.",8,3,9,21 May 2012
Million Dollar Arm," Drawn From A US point of View
","Yes, this is based on a true story but no it does not quite connect with reality. It does connect with a political view and it does have a standard Hollywood G rated love story.This movie begins with a strong relationship for US viewers - Jon Hamm making a sales pitch worthy of Don Draper on Mad Men. Then it concedes to a clean version of a real story.It admits at long last one glaring fact, even though Baseball is a sport that named it's championship a 'World Series' it is far from really known in the entire world. The second most populated country in the world knows little to nothing about it.This story has been done in Baseball before. The sport reaches out where it has never been before and finds out there is more talent out there than has ever been imagined. The actual World Series champion is only representative of the talent that has been reached and networked into the American System. Pretty much in a way US Football is the same way but the NFL is not as assuming as Baseball and the World Cup to call their sport a World Champion. No sport ever has a World Champion unless they become truly democratic and reach out to all the best talent in the world and puts the best of it on the field.Even the Olympics do not reach that noble goal. Despite the World getting smaller, that can not happen. Politics and agendas and lack of exploration always prevents that.This movie is a good depiction of greed trying to reach out and find more talent and expand a sport and it does illustrate that. It is a great reminder that the human spirit can go only where it imagines it can be. That is truly s Disney type of story. Baseball takes a back seat to that here.",6,0,0,29 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Ga,es Continue or are they Games?
","It is strange that a book got split into 2 movies. Is it financial or did the sudden success of the prior film cause this? The last movie seems mush longer than this one. Might it be that this decision to make it into 2 parts is a concession to production complications and the loss of Hoffman?I believe we have to wait until the next installment to see the answer. Another look at Jennifer Lawrence isn't such a bad thing. In this one, they seem to have made her a more conflicted person yet a person being forced to take on a mission rather than having a choice to not do it.This is a war game of more than just war, it is a game of media coverage trying to convince both sides what to do. This one does have some action, though not as much as the previous film, and a slower pace than the earlier film. This is an action series so fans of action might not like this one as much. I have a feeling the next movie might make up for it.",7,17,30,29 November 2014
Vertigo," The Master Does It Again
","Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of excellent films. This James Stewart - Kim Novack film is a gem. The cast is extremely well suited for the film. Vera Miles was the original choice of Alfred to play Novaks role but production delays because of Hitch's Gall Bladder surgery & then Miles could not do the film because she was pregnant.The script is based upon a French novel, the original working title of the film is 'From the Dead'.Stewart is a policeman who gets a fear of heights on the job, & then his fears are played by a evil one who cons him into believing someone he loves is dead. He nearly goes off a commits suicide when he finds out he has been used for a dishonest purpose when he finds the girl he fell in love with, only to lose her again.Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie on Dallas) is dandy in support as Stewarts lady in waiting. Novak, Stewart, & Bel Geddes are intense in their roles. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) & Raymond Bailey (Milburn Drysdale on the Beverly Hillbillies) also do support roles. This film has great special effects The restored version looks great with over $1 million dollars invested in it by Universals restoration team. San Francisco & the Bay Bridge look very well in the shots there. Hitchcock actually chose the locations for this film while he was shooting Strangers on Train in 1951. San Francisco never looks better on film then in this one.Bernard Herman does a great score. The original Paramont Stereo tracks were found for the restoration.The effects in the film are dazzling & recreated meticulously.If you a fan of suspense or Hitcock, this is a great film for your viewing as near perfection as it gets.",9,2,3,24 December 2006
Black Swan," Darth Vader's Wife Visits Her Own Dark Side
","Back Swan is not a movie for the kids & for those who want simple action & adventure. It is not even as scary as the trailers of it. Black Swan has the trappings of the beauty of ballet as a frame work for a dark story of complex proportions. It is not for the kids either as it is a very mature themed movie.There is no doubt this is Natalie Portman's film. The entire focus of the film is on Nina Sayers. She is replacing Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) as the star of Swan Lake in A new production by Thomas LeRoy (Vincent Cassel). Beth is the person who has been the great star but is now gone. Nina is the new choice to replace her. Beth is obviously very unhappy.Beth accuses Nina of giving Thomas special favors to win the role. While this is not the case as the audience is well aware, Beth's accusations turn out to be more of a warning to the darkness she is heading into. Nina's emotions towards Beth are played out through the first 2/3rds of the film. About 1/3 of the way into the movie Lily (Mila Kunis) shows up & gets immediate attention as Nina's rival & then a part of her fantasy as well.Veteran actress Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mom(Erica), whose main role is helping Nina & trying to keep her reined in so she does not get into trouble. For half the film, she is able to do this. As Nina passes into her own very personal madness, she breaks away from her mom. Between Lily, & Thomas LeRoy, plus Nina's warped reality, the film builds up to the only possible climax at Nina's performance of a lifetime.This is powerful drama and while Portman looks a little too thin at times, her acting is right on. The supporting players are there but only for their interaction with Nina. The film is very focused which is it's strength. The eye candy of Portman (almost 30) and Kunis (28) reminds me that it is great that these actresses in their prime get a film in which women pretty much dominate the screen.",8,4,10,4 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Arrgh Matey, Where are the looters?
","This film is well produced. It has great looks. The plot is simple and easy to follow compared with the last installment. Penelope Cruz is a good addition to replace Keira. So why isn't the movie great? It's because there is no new ground broken here. Almost everything that is done in this installment has been done before. There are very few surprises and nothing in action or humor that makes this movie a unique one in the series.There is one thing, at the end Cruz gets a Voodoo doll of Sparrow. Is this a thing she is going to stick pins in it and end this series? Unless we get a script that commands attention from the audience, maybe that would be a good thing.This movie has all the trappings of a hit film, but trappings are just the decor. Where is the treasure? That is what is missing here.",7,0,0,14 June 2011
Men in Black 3," It's Been A Long Time Since MIB2
","It has been a long time since MIB2 but the time away seems to have helped as this one is closer to the original then the forgettable, MIB2. While movies playing with time have been done a lot in recent years, this one has a script which milks a lot of humor out of messing up the time-lines.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work well together. Jones deadpan straight man routine is very well perfected and is really on display here. The production and effects are really solid and a story which while wild is pretty easy to follow.Entertaining - yes, but not a classic in any sense, still it is great to see Smith and Jones working together again. There is a chemistry that works well here. I am not sure how you could make another classic MIB but at least this sequel holds it's own versus the others and has a good sense of humor.",7,0,1,19 February 2013
Frost_Nixon," Dramatic Triumph For Viewers
","Frank Langellas Tour De Force Performance of Richard Nixon carries this film very well. While the woman playing Pat Nixon look too young, Frank really brings the resigned Nixon to life in this one. In a way, this is better than the original Frost Interviews because the script can focus more on the dramatic moments that have meaning, intead of the meaningless blather of the majority of them. Sheen's Frost while not great is quite satisfactory here.Nixon could afford to say anything in these interviews because of Fords 'Full & Complete Pardon' of Nixon years earlier. The only reason Nixon was cautious was because of that worry about his legacy. The fact is Nixon would have done what he did again, because he did not realize how wrong it is to try too destroy for his own personal gain. He was not the only one to do that in this era. In the 1972 Primary Election, George McGovern got the Democratic Nomination by creating Super Delegates, changing the party rules so that he ran second in votes in the Democratic Primaries yet got nominated. Then he lost that Election to Nixon in a land slide - and had created rules Hillary Clinton used later to get the nomination over Bernie Sanders. Both times these rules cost the Democrats the chance of winning the election so just recently they finally changed the party rules on Super Delegates. I am not sure these rule changes will help, though it does cover up and protect from arrest Clinton, Wasserman Schultz, and the party from being charged with the same crime as Nixon - conspiring to destroy the 2 party system and rig the election. Ironically, Nixon did not need to rig the system in 1972. McGovern lost the election (Hubert Humphrey got more votes than McGovern in the Democrats Primary in 1972). In both these times, the voters in the booth decided they were not going to do what the media wanted. Here in this film, Nixon states for the record he did not believe he had committed a crime even though he did otherwise. Clinton still does not believe she has committed any crime either, though a whole lot of people know she did, and her tainted nominated over Sanders has possibly caused more damage to the Democratic Party than McGovern did, as there appears no way a Jimmy Carter will rise up and bring the Democrats back into power in 2020 so far. The Democrats do need an outsider like a Carter, maybe a Scientist, to run against Trump. Will they wake up?At any rate, the history of Nixon colliding with the celebrity of Frost is very well defined in a top notch script that brings life to these debates, and Ron Howards Direction make this film a solid triumph all the way. While a lot of young folks do not even recall Watergate, the issues here will ring a bell with any voters who read the emails on WikiLeaks that the Democrats wrote last year. Even though these memos prove a blatant attempt to rig the US Election by Democrats (who are still using a Russian Conspiracy that there is no proof of changing the election) there ha still been no charges filed against any Democrat, who have admitted the memos are true. Nixon admits his guilt in this movie, and it is stunning to hear it, especially for those of us who truly remember Watergate.",8,0,0,16 December 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Excellent Off-Beat Comedy
","This is one of those laugh out loud films that are really enjoyable but never get many Oscar nods. After I wrote this, the Academy gave it no awards. It is mainly Sasha Cohen's show although the support players he plays off do an incredible job but they are clearly support. Cohen is better in support in Taladega Nights, but proves he can carry a film here.Borat is portrayed as a TV reporter in his Eastern Europe home country. This starts in his country with a tour of his home town & that he is headed for America to learn how American Comedy works for his home country. The opening sequence is funny & sets the tone for the theme of travel which is a successful theme for many successful past movies by others.Borat & his traveling companion come via a circuitous route to NYC. There is a hilarious sequence in a NY Subway & it gets funnier from there. In the hotel, Borat sees a Baywatch re-run & falls in love with Pamela Sue Anderson. This is the hook that sets the tone for all that is to come. His pursuit of meeting her takes many twists & turns & every one of them is laugh out loud hilarious. The spoiler is that he does finally meet her, & what he does then is funny too. Borat takes amazing driving lessons, & then they do a car lot routine that is the funniest one I have seen (even better than Kurt Russells USED CARS from the 1980's).What makes this film work so well in addition to the travel theme is the UN-predictable behavior of Borat. This is so well done that at times, even the other actors seem surprised by what Cohen's character does. This film has spontaneity which is fantastic. Some of the spontaneity was accomplished through unorthodox filming but that is an illustration of comedic genius.It has some strange sequences which you have to see the movie to believe. It also has a great comedic pace. It runs around 90 minutes which is what the most successful comedy films of all time usually ran. This means it doesn't bog down & if a sequence is in danger of being too long, it stops before that happens. This film is well worth the 90 minutes, classic comedy done right.",9,3,11,10 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Excellent Action & Well Written-Best of Film Mission Series
","Old television series have had a poor history of being made into films. In the last decade, clinkers have been made out of successful series such as The Beverly Hillbillies & Bewitched. Even the first 2 installments of Mission Impossible seemed closer to the films versions of other successful shows, failures both in getting back to the form which made them a success in the small box media. This film is an exception, as for once, this third installment gets it right.It opens with an interesting scene from later in the picture which looks like the film climax, only it isn't. This sleight of hand is chosen from such a perfect point in the film, that it makes it easy to follow the flashback from the beginning. The action is nearly non-stop as is Tom Cruise who seems to be in at least 90 % of the scenes in the film. So not only is the action satisfying, but if your a big Cruise fan, you get much more Cruise in this than many of his other starring films over the years.If there is anyone short changed here, it is those who want lots of females. Yes the film has attractive females, but they really only appear in about 20 to 30% of the scenes & most of their characters are more background than anything, though essential to the plot. Male actors don't really fare much better in this respect, this really is a Tom Cruise dominated film. The only way you can hate this one if if you don't like action or Cruise. That should not be many people.This filmpulls you in very well with the opening sequence & credits & holds on to you until the finish. The only time the film stops is with the ending which might be the only dull moments in the film. After concluding the last mission (there are at least 3 missions jammed into this film), there are a couple of slow moments when Cruise is explaining to his wife Julie what has just happened. I am not sure how this ending could have been punched up but after solid action for the rest of the film, you actually appreciate the rest at the end so that when the closing theme music kicks in, you walk out of the theater humming that great old TV theme song again.This one is worth seeing as you can almost feel the fuse burning as it jumps from sequence to sequence without rest.",7,1,2,8 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weakest Entry But More of Original Story Inspiration revealed
","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. This film reveal more of what inspired Lucas in the pod race sequence. It is so eerily similar to the chariot race in Ben Hur that it is not hard to imagine where the idea came from. It is interesting how one of the great films was turned into a 6 movie series of science fiction. When a man stands upon the greatness of others fiction (General Lew Wallace), Lucas has created a work which is to the 20th Century what Ben Hur was to the 19th century. History repeats itself.The major problem with this movie is though the actor is charmingly played, Anakin is just too young to be believable in this kids body. If the young actor had been in the 14 to 16 year old range, such as Lucas was when he saw Ben Hur, this movie would have been better. None the less, this film provides a lot of great special effects work & also shows another hint of the Ben Hur original - explaining Anakins Birth as a divine event. This in effect molds him as the Christ child of this series. At the same time, they also make Anakin a slave, mixing his character with that of Judah Ben Hur who was a slave too. This is a true first film of the series as this reveals that in 1959, 16 year old Lucas saw Ben Hur at the movies and used it as a basis for the entire Star Wars Series. This film is an essential piece of the story leading to the next 2 pieces. While the divine birth is only mentioned here, there is no doubt about George Lucas divine inspiration for the entire series after seeing this film.",6,0,3,23 February 2007
10 Cloverfield Lane," Talent Carries A Suspense Feature Throwback
","I have looked at the youngsters reviewing this and I have to say that they lack the knowledge to look at this film objectively for a couple of reasons. First, a lot of them are too young to know what a good suspense film is all about. Second, they are looking for a sequel which while the title might suggest it is, the film stands alone on it's own. I have never seen the original Cloverfield, so I did not have an idiotic bias going to see this one. The lesson to be learned here is do not think because a title is partly the same, that your going to a sequel. None of the cast in this film appeared in the earlier one and the only relationship it has is the JJ Abrams guy and he has done a variety of things besides these films. As for the film, a lot of the old suspense films that are classics take a fair amount of time developing the first action. The classic Hitchcock film Psycho takes about 20 minutes or more developing Janet Leigh's character before it really gets into the creepy suspense. This movie takes about 5 minutes and starts the action with Mary Elizabeth Winstead right in the opening credits. The spacing of the accident in the credits and then Michelle waking up are done almost perfectly. She wakes up locked up, shackled, with an IV in her arm and in a bomb shelter. It is this initial change that tells the viewer something different is coming in this one.Then she tries to get to her cell phone and when she gets it realizes she has no service. Then Michelle finds herself at the mercy and debt of Howard (John Goodman). In this one, Goodman shows off his dramatic skills as one of the better actors around who does not get enough lead roles. In this one he is solid and even creepy. The plot is written to keep everyone guessing as to what the reality of this is. Then Michelle gets introduced to Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who is the other person Howard let into the bunker.Howard is very convincing about the story of them needing to stay in the bunker, though not real clear about why. Emmett assures Michelle that he fought his way into the bunker because he knows there is a problem outside, but is not real clear about what the problem is either. So Michelle has to make a choice who to trust. Both Howard and Emmett make cases to her about that.In the sum, we have an old plot device here known as character development. It is something that CGI audiences waiting for the next explosion do not understand well, and is done brilliantly here. Michelle chooses to trust Emmett because she can relate to him much better than Howard who seems to jump at any shadow that he feels is a threat to him.Then there is the back story about Howard's wife and daughter who have seemingly left him. When he tells Michelle about a photo he says is his daughter, Emmett then informs Michelle she is not because he knows who she is. This makes Howard even creepier.From here a lot happens in the shelter, and the viewer, much less Michelle are really left guessing what is the real situation as there are few clues that add up to anything. From here, I will leave you guessing what comes next because this is the set up.The ending is really unexpected, for us folks who remember the old films with the happy ones. While the ending is different, it does leave open an actual possible sequel which could have lots of those CGI effects modern movie viewers often demand. One thing that does not relate to the movie but does relate to John Goodman, in 1993 he did a pretty good comedy called MatinÃ©e in which atomic attack, 1950's Sci-Fi, and coincidentally a bomb shelter are a part of the plot. Schlock producer Lawrence Woolsey's only relationship to this movie is Goodman breaks into a bomb shelter in that one. Goodman is more of a star in this movie.Still this movie in a way brings back the cold war theme in a totally reverse sort of way. The action and development create solid suspense and late in the film some of the hand held camera technique is used. If Alfred Hitchcock were still alive, I would like to have seen what he could have done with the camera work and suspense of this one. While it is not the master at work, this does come off pretty well overall.This movie ends in a new normal, very appropriate at this time.",8,0,3,19 March 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Remake Has Strong Cast
","The cast of this movie is the main reason to watch it. Christian Bale & Russell Crowe give strong performances. The reason this film does not rise into a stronger rating for me is that the special effects while dramatic are sometimes beyond belief.I understand that special effects can be used to great excess and be very effective from Bales recent The Dark Night outing though what makes them effective there is great acting. The thing is, in the Western genre, if the special effects get over-done, it stretches the imagination beyond the believability factor. That is what happens here.If you buy into the strong acting performances, you don't mind the stretch. If your looking for strong western believability in story, you do. I am in between these on rating this as the effectiveness of the acting does at times make you look beyond the story and more into the character of the men acting it.This film does make Wade, the main bad guy, appear to be a tormented man who does things for reasons other than his main motivation. Bale is very effective as the farmer, civil war vet who is supposed to take him in.The story is exactly the same as the 1957 film of the same name, but I think this one illustrates actors in development, while Van Heflin & Glenn Ford were already mature star actors when they made their version. Still, the cast in this one is solid. The extra time this version runs developing the characters is time well spent here.",6,0,0,28 December 2008
War Dogs," Real Story That Might Anger Some Viewers With Shock & Awe
","Ripped from the news, this movie is the story of 2 twenty-something guys who went into the arms peddling business in 2005 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It tells the story in the first person with Miles Teller (David Packouz) narrating it throughout. The film packs a lot of surprising things into it and is one of the better told true story tales spun on film this year.The writers who did the screen play were also writers on The Hangover and they know how to tell a story and make it into comedy. What is strange is how the truth can be funny and is most of the way through until the conclusion where things do get serious. It is spun here as a quite incredible story.The anger of some viewers might be in how inept the Military and W Bush administration are presented. W Bush does not come off looking great here by any stretch. Efraim (Jonah Hill) and David (Teller) do not appear to be very intelligent, and yet they manage to make a lot of money because of the system set up to provide weapons in the Middle East conflicts. When it is put together overall, Government waste in these wars is massive, and it appears that it was quite easy to make money on the US Government.Is there comedy? Yes, some of the situations are quite funny, and the narration is spot on in telling the story. There are no weak spots in the story, as this is story telling the way it should be done. It is easy to follow and does not get lost. There is one scene at the beginning which David is getting a gun to his head. Then the story goes back to the start and goes through everything logically. It does get back to the gun, though I think the first opening of the film is not needed but does attract the viewers attention.This is an important film which is very much worth going too. It is not a waste of time by any means.",9,0,6,20 August 2016
The Longest Yard," Remake is Funny, Len Burman Whoop, Whoop, Whoop
","This remake of the Classic Burt Reynolds film is very good. The review I read in a Gannett Publication was from a reviewer who obviously had a chip on his should because he did not like the original. He should have not reviewed this new one.Burt Reynolds original film was more a Comedy-Drama & is a Classic for the more mature viewers. Doing Football as a straight comedy is not easy to do. This remake goes to straight comedy & gets the job done. It is the best football comedy since the Marx Brothers did HORSEFEATHERS in 1933.While this films follows the script of the original, it softens the serious tone & adds much more comedic talent updating it to the present day very well. The music soundtrack for this fits in very well to mixing Rap & Classic Rock in fine form.It is sad this movies premiere week-end marks the death of Eddie Albert, fortunately this film softens the latest warden into more of a straight man role than a dramatic one. If you compare the 2 wardens & films, you will see just how talented Eddie Albert was.My favorite throwaway humor line in this version is after the Warden tells Crew (Sadler) that he is planning to be Governor of the state & run it like his prison, Crew says 'only with a lot less Sodomy?' The Warden hilariously replies 'Hopefully none!'. Len Berman commenting during the game is great addition to this film. I am afraid that the sequel is but a sequel. Unfortunately, because this was good, it has spurred on way too many football movies since it was released. Caretaker by Chris Rock is much funnier than the serious tone James Hampton took, & both versions work well in both films. This remake is a good film for the young teens, funny & solid. Love Chris Berman in this too. Enjoy the laughs & you could go all the way to some harmless fun.",6,3,7,29 May 2005
Source Code," Clever Thriller
","To break this movie down, it takes elements of Ground Hog Day and combines them with Avatar. In order to spoil it a bit, there is a secret project called Source Code where a disabled nearly dead serviceman can be put into a capsule. Then their mind can be used to keep going back to a tragic event and figure out how it happened. Then they can go back one more time and stop it and change history.While this stuff has been done before, the production, the cast Stars:Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga and a nice twisting ending make it a nice diversion from reality for 94 minutes. Ben Ripley's script does a nice job on this with Moon's Director Duncan Jones pacing the story just right.It is not a great film, but it is more entertaining than many. The source code is kind of a DNA of life that can rewrite history. Nicely done...",7,0,0,6 January 2012
Skyfall," Revisits Old Territory
","If your a die hard Bond fan, you find what you like here. The theme song by Adele is pretty much like prior Bond themes. The opening credits are very much like older Bond films. The action is much like territory covered before. In fact, it is dangerously like 'Action for Older Persons' as it is too much formula and flash, not enough script.The plot seems to involve cyber terrorism and a former agent whose gone bad and is bent on killing M. They steal a sensitive worldwide list of agents, and then burn 5 of them on You Tube with a plot to keep doing 5 more every week. What is interesting is that there is no real black mail demand to stop this process. Then the movie forgets about this process, focus on the bad guy and his personal thing about M.So it loses the save the world process here and never finds it again. Instead we get a get setting in Scotland to stage an action finale which makes very little sense. The bad guy loses focus on any real destroy the world goal and the film loses focus as well.The most refreshing thing about this movie is Naomi Harris. She is the only new Bond woman of note and she looks sensational though the film only really gives you small hints of how good she looks. This is a Bond light film in there is less sex in this than previous films. Daniel Craig is back as Bond but he really does not get a lot of acting here. It is good to see him back on screen but think he had a better role in the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.This movie celebrating 50 years of Bond has all the smoke and mirrors of a Bond film and if your into smoke and mirrors and stunts, it will make you happy. Even though it is easy to follow, there is very little to surprise you. It does set up new character actors to take over in repeating roles of Q and Money Penny for future films but it does not make up for the loss of opportunity the series had by missing 2007 as the obvious Century promotion.This film will not kill the series. The trouble is a true Bond fan is in dire need of a great script to refresh the franchise. The question is will it happen next script as it sure does not happen here. This one takes advantage of the old frame work and adds to it. The thing is when a building is 50 years old, it is in major need of rehab. This film makes it look like that has not yet happened.The net result is the same old furniture and rooms but the view to a kill is missing, lost in transition and translation someplace.",5,8,16,30 November 2012
The Hangover," Where Did The Groom Go? Woof Woof
","While I looked at other reviews of this after watching the film, it is interesting the extremes that I have seen. This is a comedy movie so while I understand folks being offended by some of the humor, still humor is supposed to be on the edge in order to be funny. Maybe the script might have been done before, but I have not seen the prior efforts so I will address this film.I kind of like the formula here. The movie starts two mornings after the bachelor party was supposed to have started in Las Vegas. It seems no one know where the groom is. While talking with the Bride too be on the phone, she is in a panic. Then, we get the Hollywood style flashback beginning 2 days earlier. This film centers around the groom to be & 3 friends including the Brides Brother who went to Vegas for a Bachelor Party. As the film develops, they are on the trail when they wake up after the first night in a hotel suite that is a total wreck with no idea what happened. On the path, they are trying to explain a Tiger in the suite bathroom, the grooms bed being thrown off the hotel roof, a cop car they stole from the Vegas police that night, a missing tooth & a missing groom.What is fun about this movie is how it slowly but surely explains what happened. The cameo by Mike Tyson is on the trail & is very funny. There are several women in the cast, but the main one is a Vegas Stripper/Escort who gets the most screen time, & one of the Bachelor's Fiancé. After that, there is little time even given too the Bride to be. There is some humor here that is politically incorrect, but is funny. Realistically, it does come off as a major hangover. The thing is, why no one can remember is (spoiler) not alcohol, but drugs. One thing never explained is the chicken in the hotel room, but there is some really sick Tiger humor, & a crazy gangster that is in the picture.This film really is fun, as long as you have a bit of a thick skin. Not as thick as you need for Borat, but skin where you can laugh at a joke as the cast performs really well in this movie.",8,1,2,18 October 2010
Iron Man 3," Comedy & Action In Form
","This movie is a great example of what comedy and action in a tandem formula can do to attract an audience. The cast helps as Robert Downey Jr. might be in his last one as Stark/Iron Man. He has solid support. This one like previous 2 films in the series are for action/entertainment which is what brings people into the theater.I am not a major comic book geek, so I make no connection of the characters with the drawn and written word. I believe this is a solid franchise in this genre. I doubt if one of these will ever be made that is the same as the comic books.That being said, if the films get a little closer to the books, they might flow a little better and not require as much comic relief. Still, to me, you put your brain in park and prepared to enjoy the action. This and the attraction of the fine cast carry the day here.Could it be better? Yes, like a lot of installments of the Bond series could be better. Still, the Iron Man films are what they are. I enjoyed this installment because I got pretty much what I expected here. This has become a pretty solid formula and they are hitting that target just about every time out.",7,5,11,13 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Very Good Start- I hate snakes too
","The opening action sequence of this film is as good as any movie you can name, & better than most. The plot involving the Ark Of The Covenant is excellent too. When this film came out, it was the first of its kind. There are two weak sequences in this movie. The first one is the early one with Jones in the class room lecturing & the female students flirting with him. This piece does little for the film & quite frankly could be cut entirely out of it. The second one is the opening of the Ark (in a way the climax of the film). This special effects jolly is interesting wizardry for the 1981 time frame, but it gives viewers nothing to ponder as far as what is actually in the ark. Compared with the Last Crusade's climax which has meaning, this one comes up with none.While this film has humor & the best action sequences of the series, it comes off more with an atmosphere of a later TV series rip-off known as 'Tales of The Gold Monkey.' On TV this only lasted a season. It is the same with this film, once you have seen it, you have seen it enough. This was the best of the series until The Last Crusade, but the Crusade took what this started & tied it together better. 157",8,0,0,11 February 2007
Casablanca," Classic
","There is no term to describe this other than classic, but not the type of classic that a film like THE WIZARD OF OZ or GONE WITH THE WIND are. That is because when this film was being made, it was just another assembly line production from it's studio (Warner). When you see it today, the cast appears so great that you would think it was something special, but this supporting cast, great as it is, worked together often. What this has in common with the WIZARD is a great script.The writers of CASABLANCA came up with a script that tops all other films in classic moments of quotes that have become a part of Americana. So many quotes from this film are used in other films & media that they have become cliché almost. Even miss-quotes like 'Play It Again, Sam' from this film have become American folk-lore. 'Round up the Usual Suspects' has become it's own film later. 'You & Me, Kid'- the list goes on & on.Other than the Great Oz, these quotes just flow from this film to 100's of other works since this film was made.What makes this film really special is the unfulfilled love between Bogart & Bergman's character that is left hanging at the end. In an era, where love always had to have a happy ending, this movie gloriously leaves us with people in love who are forced away from each other by circumstances beyond either of their control. This theme is closer to real life than most Hollywood products of any era. Almost everybody can identify with it because haven't we all had a love in our life who we yearned for very much, but due to circumstances beyond us, we never had a chance to fulfill? That is too me what makes this film stand above all others.This is a film that has action, but not much of it. This film has comedy, but only enough to make the film great. It has subtle patriotic themes that carry the film along. Most importantly, this film has the heart of every viewer who ever watches it because the film, by accident, touches themes that many films aspire to reach, but never achieve. Ironically, this all happened by the greatest of chance & rarely has any movie ever come close to what this film is. If I were a filmmaker, actor, or had a career in this industry, this would be the film I wish I had worked on. Nothing gets better than this one.",10,4,5,27 August 2006
Finding Neverland," Innovative Inspirational Exceptional Film
","Before viewing this film, I happened to see the 1924 silent Peter Pan. This made my viewing of this film an even richer experience & if you have not seen either, would strongly recommend seeing both, the silent first & then the sound. Walt Disney did a brilliant animated version of Peter Pan in the 1950's, but I feel the silent film relates & gives more meaning to seeing this film.This Neverland film is brilliant. Johnny Depp shines again in another outstanding performance. Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, & Dustin Hoffman are fantastic support. This film is touching & has a strong heart that beats through the drama. Dramatic films as well done as this are too rare today.This film shows how the human imagination can rise beyond even what an animator can put on film. It creates a perfect stage to show where human imagination can go. Just imagine an artist in front of you with a blank canvas opening up their imagination, creative process, to you as the viewer, and then filling that canvas in. I never believed this process could be done on a movie film, until now.",10,2,2,9 May 2005
A Star Is Born," An Excellent Remake With A Powerhouse Sound Track
","When I went to this, I had seen the Garland version and the Streisand Version. I pretty much knew the plot to expect, and with a few twists got what I expected. Jon Peters is only listed as a producer on this because he owned rights to certain parts of the concept from the Streisand version.
What surprised me is how the chemistry worked here. Now, I have a real life example of this chemistry that to me this film brought in.Many years ago, I went to the longest live concert I ever attended. For over 3 hours I heard Kris Kristopherson and Rita Cooledge on that stage when the 2 of them were deeply emotionally involved with one another. As I recall, Kris did the first hour, Rita did the second hour, and then for over an hour the 2 of them worked together performing an amazing concert.This film reminds me of that concert because it kind of presents the same kind of chemistry between Cooper as Jackson Main and Lady GaGa as Ally. It works well. I understand that Cooper did consider a different ending for this movie. I wish they had done it though Lady GaGa's finale is every bit as powerful as Garland, and more powerful than Streisand. Really it is not fair to compare these in this manner, but the point is this film is really Lady GaGa's tour deforce. She is fantastic in this musically based role. Her acting is fine too.There is one relief on this one versus the Streisand version, this one concentrates on Ally's (GaGa's) nose. The Jon Peters/ Streisand focus was on Barbara's posterior. This shows more taste.Bradley Cooper's first effort directing is good and does not detract from his acting role in front of the cameras. I am impressed with the cast and crew support. I hope when the DVD comes out for this one, that maybe they did film the alternate ending I have read about. The original story is powerful, but a look at the other idea for an ending is worth a look.The ending of this one is really a tribute to Garland as it is very much the same as the 1950's version.",8,4,8,7 November 2018
To Be or Not to Be," Interesting Piece of History & Well Made
","It is hard to believe now that Comedy great Jack Benny's most magical movie role would be mostly in a Nazi uniform. No one knew when it was made that it would be the last of the great legacy of Carol Lombard. Clark Gable was often described as being heart broken from the time of the tragedy on though he kept making movies.Historically, this film was not well received in 1942 and Benny's best role was in the direct path after Chaplin has paved the way here in The Great Dictator. This Ernest Lubitch production goes beyond that. This is the film which inspired a lot of the Nazi comedy films that were made way after the war.When you hear Jack Benny say the name 'Schultz' here, you can't help but think that this movie inspired the creators of Stalag 17 & Hogan's Hero's which both had a Schultz. When you see Mel Brooks 'The Producer's' and other works where he does Nazi comedy, you can't help but feel the relationship & perhaps inspiration this movie gave to Brooks when he saw it.When I see Lombard and how great she looks in this movie, I can almost feel the tragedy that Gable must have felt. What a terrible fate that she a wonderful woman was cut down before her time. In some of the scenes in this, she looks every bit as beautiful as Marilyn Monroe the other tragic blonde who came later.This is a very good movie which did not sell tickets because of it's release date. It is very worthwhile to see this & in a pair with Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator', should be used in History classes addressing World War 2 as both films are amazing work.",8,0,1,15 March 2011
Se7en," Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman Team Up On Detective Trail
","This movie is good solid character development & story telling. It is just short of being a great film. The reason that is too me is that the ending is way too predictable. The clues to the ending are revealed in the middle of the film and I was able to predict it.Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as the thinking man Detective. Any thinking man character fits Freeman though even though there is some action in this one, Freeman is the 34 year vet who has never fired his gun. That's good because he doesn't fit the classic thinking & action Detective that Humphrey Bogart did so well.Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as the young emotional out of control Detective Mills who gets Freeman teamed with him on the trail of the seven deadly sins killer. He is the young guy who marries his school sweetheart, and that is why it is so predictable. As soon as you realize that Love is one of the sins, you know his wife is in danger.The film works well as a drama but not as a mystery at the end. Earlier on it works as being unpredictable as the other victims are revealed. Kevin Spacey is very effective in the last reals as the murderer. The thing is, other than driving Detective Mills crazy at the end, his character works out to be much less than your led to believe by the story.Overall, this is a very solid film, but falls just short of being a great film. I think if a real suspense Director like Sir Alfred Hitchcock had gotten a hold of it, the ending would have been done even better. This is the best film this Director has on his resume so far.",8,0,0,9 February 2010
Star Trek," Where No One Has Gone Before, Into The Future
","Granted traditional Trekkies from the 1960's will not like this film. Then again, these same people are the same people who think that Iraq and Vietnam are the same war. They have their heads buried in the sand and ignore the potential of change and how it can benefit the future of a great franchise.This film has more action than many previous Treks. This film does not go out of Treks way to tie with the older films and TV series. Instead it is something fresh, bold, and enjoyable. In some ways it is a breath of fresh air blown into an old franchise.While the film is not perfect, it is written with both the old series fans and the new young fans in mind. Leonard Nimoy is pretty long in the tooth, but he comes off well as an elderly Spock. This movie takes this foundation and uses it to promote change.It is change that the original series was about. The old franchise hit it's low point with Robert Wises pondering Star Trak The Movie. Thank goodness this is much better than that. For those who give this a chance, they will find some irony with the story. There are not a lot of holes in this one and the writing is pretty clever for the most part.To me the biggest hole in the plot is the drilling sequence on Vulcan. It is done more for visual & special effects as it would be easy to change this scene from how it is written. Other than this sequence the rest makes sense. The plotting is good and the acting is good. The young cast makes the characters their own.If there is a problem, it is how do you follow this movie? What is the next step. This one ends with a real dedication to Gene Roddenbury. This film shows how flexible this franchise can be, in case the past films and series haven't already. This is an exciting warp drive ride.",9,2,9,9 May 2009
Fury," Compelling Dramatic War Action
","This movie seems to spend about half the time inside their tank with about a whole lot of Germans trying to get in. As a lot of this greatest generation is gone, there is few very few proud people who could address realism in the story. Brad Pitt and the cast do make it feel like the real thing. As the relation to the real World War 2 fades out, it feels like this kind of stuff has been done before. If someone really wants to get some fresh material going, some good Eastern Front Drama might attract more audience. The accounts of the Russians taking every woman from 7 to 70 when they entered Berlins tells me that front has a lot of emotion not yet depicted in movies.This is the western front towards the end there is material not covered but there are some excellent films already made about this.There are always films of action films and this is made well enough to make that fan happy. The hard part for the USSR recreating their war would be the true use of the Ford Trucks by the Russians.",5,1,7,28 August 2015
Citizen Kane," Orsen Welles Period Piece
","This is an intelligent film, but it is more of a period piece than it is a classic. My apologies to AFI but as the memories of William Randolph Herst fade, this movie will fade too. That it has lasted this long amazes me. In fact, a poll of college students today would rarely put this in the top 10 films made. The AFI is not composed of college students.This is a solid film, not total trash. It successfully tells a good story, has a fine cast, and shows a lot of Orsen Welles creativity in trying things on film that had not been tried until this film.The hypnotic effect it had on the generation it was made for, made it one of the most revered films of that era. It even got lampooned on SNL a few years ago. But over-all, in time the legend of Hearst will fade out entirely & so will this films classic rating.There are technical masterpiece touches in this film. Welles was always known in Hollywood as being difficult to work with & controversial. Because the studio he made this film with desperately needed to sell tickets to a blockbuster film, they gave Welles a creative freedom few film makers got a chance to savor.Welles took full advantage of it, & made a big hit for his generation.",7,0,2,26 June 2007
Darkest Hour," Biographical Surprise
","This is a very well done Biographical film, which throws some critics for a loop as Biographies deserve a different type of rating versus other types of films. Well done bios can be entertaining, Patton being a best picture example. But usually Bios are more about acting and script than entertainment. Once again, Patton is a great example of those with George C. Scott in his greatest role.Here might very well be Oldmans greatest role. He brings Churchill very much to life in the darkest hour of history. Especially interesting is the fact this films writer did not use a Biographical Novel to base this on. While that makes me wonder about the historic accuracy, but the film is so well done it is a pleasure to watch. The Director of 'The Theory of Everything' does a great job with this one.On the assumption it is all factually based, the film brings up important moments of history from Churchhill becoming Prime Minister in crisis to the Dunkirk rescue. There are brief references to Churchills failures in the past including India but this films focus is May, 1940. Oldman gets wonderful support from the cast with Mrs. Churchill, and his typist being very well played.The story begs some questions. Today it is hard to imagine Nevill Chamberlain wanted to negotiate a British Surrender to Hitler in 1940. Yet it does fit with a diplomat whose career as Prime Minister was of trying to avoid the inevitable. His character and the alternative person to appointing Churchill are very well drawn here. The chaos Hitler brought upon the world is a stark picture.The bonus here and surprise is Churchills ride in the London Subway prior to his dramatic speech. This scene might never have happened, but then again if it did, it would have been like this. This is unexpected but a perfect lead in to the finale. 'We will never surrender.'",8,1,4,17 February 2018
The Birth of a Nation," Through The Shadow Of Racism
","DW Grifith's Masterpiece of film is amazing because it was 1915 when it was done. 1915 is the era of shaky cameras and cut up films & scenes in many films which made little or no use of modern film making techniques as of yet. In this way, this film is brilliant for it's time but today's standards make it average now. I expected over the top racism & received it while viewing this film. You have to put that racism into this frame, you are warned about 'dark truth' by the subtitles early in this film. Indeed there are many dark sequences. As for how accurate the film is, it was not Northern Blacks who were the problem in the South after the Civel War 50 years earlier. It was the Northern & Southern Whites who were Carpet Baggers & who used Southern Blacks as puppets to continue the status quo in the South. Northern Blacks stayed in the North after the war as they were more good jobs in Northern factories. The South had few jobs after the war. The term Sharecropper was created in this era. In spite of all the blood spilled in this war, our country had still not grown up & matured to accept blacks in white society, even in the North. You have to consider though that these views put in the film are from stories passed down from Grand Parents to others by the time this film was made. Stories passed from generation to generation do get embellished to the point where reality is lost & that is what happens with the depiction of racism in this film. Making the KKK into heroes is outrageous to the modern generations of Americans, but the modern KKK re-formed after this film actually bears no resemblance to the KKK first formed in the South. The first KKK fought Carpet Bagging Whites as well as fighting blacks as another hated invader. The real indication of this is the battle scenes in the Civil War. You will note that the more historically accurate Confederate battle flags are shown. The Red 'Stars & Bars' which are now used are the Historic Revisionist / the 1950's modern KKK's way of expressing disdain to black people. Ironically these modern flags are used (acutally abused) by Civil War Re-enactment Confederates (including Ted Turner's 'Gettysburg'. This film shows the clan riding in day light. That was never done. This film is rife with problems in total but worth watching because a master film maker rose above 1915 to produce an important film. If nothing else, this film is valuable in defining what racial stereotypes were & should never be again. That is why it is important, & it will continue to be an important film is because of history. We always get reminded of these stereotypes by our modern main stream news media which today is much more racist than most of the American people they report too. Age has long worn out a lot of it's artistic beauty & accomplishment. It would be interesting to see modern Hollywood try to re-make this film but I doubt that any of the modern film makers have the guts to do that.We appear to be entering an era where we might be destined to relive racism. Electing a Black President because he is black is a big mistake. The President's own brother has written a book saying the black President is racist- against whites. That takes our country back to this movie.",7,2,6,4 May 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Fantasy Turned Into Un-Even Movie
","I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt. This film did not help me change that opinion. There are good sequences & performances here, but as a whole, this film is not something great. In fact, it put me to sleep except I'd jerk awake whenever there were shooting sequences.The film is based on a fiction work of a unit of Jews organized to get even with the Nazi's by killing them, & then locating Hitler & his henchman & killing them too. While this dream works for some folks, to me the real story of attempts on Hitler are much more interesting. In fact, there is a better story that could be made into a movie.That true story is the Eastern Front Story of the Russians wiping out Nazi's at a faster rate than even these folks do in this movie. For some reason, now that this history is available, nobody has tried a movie depiction of it yet. Of course this story could make a real epic film. A recreation of some of the tank battles that happened on the Eastern front would make good cinema because the largest tank battles in World War 2 happened on that front.This movie while it has some decent parts, does not make it as a whole. The parts make it rate a 6 on my book. If you take the best parts out, then it falls to a 3.",6,3,6,27 December 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars Episode 3.5
","After seeing this I understand the comparisons with the Empire Strikes Back, though I think the story here was not intended to make that type of comparison. This movie made it to theaters ahead of Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher's Death). Norwegian actress Ingvild Deila makes a brief cameo as a young Princess Leia and it is so short she does resemble Carrie Fisher though I think the camera shot is short deliberately.The film borrows archive footage from Episode 4 of the same pilots in Rebel Fighters near the climax which only makes a lot of sense. The story does fill in between Episode 3 and Episode 4 quite well. This is darker for a very good reason. Line in Episode 4 - 'Many people had to die to get these death star plans for us.' The first half of the film is slower paced than many of these films as it keeps quite busy filling in details of the story and developing the characters. Then the second half goes into light speed when the battle get going. There is some humor in a few throw away lines though not really a lot. The one I remember the most is when a blind Jedi is being kidnapped and they put a hood over his head and he yells - 'Don't you guys know I am Blind.' Actually, that is kind of the summary of the plot here. When Episode 4 starts, this fills in the back story.The action is great and even though a lot of people die, the movie does not slow down too much about the death rate of a lot of people on a suicide mission that must be done to save the galaxy far away.",7,0,1,31 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Thank You Stan, It's Been A Fun Ride
","AS I read other reviews of this one, I am wondering just what people were expecting. Did they think this would be more than an introduction for Endgame coming in April? Did they think everything would be spoiled by this movie? Fools do write reviews, and I looked at a bunch of them here.Now, let's see, Brie Larsons acting seems wooden like she is reading from cue cards? Wait, here is someone who is having memory issues and is trying to absorb some things to figure out who she is and what is going on. That's not wooden, it's acting the way your supposed to. As Disney released this, it might be some folks noses are growing and wooden.Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson have good chemistry. The plot does not get lost. The humor is typical of Marvel films. It's set in the last century (1900's) so it makes sense. The cat and Jackson really come up with some interesting stuff. Who knew that Stan had another Cameo in him? I wonder if he has yet another in Endgame?The film is a good ride. As far as Captain Marvel having too much power and no weaknesses, don't forget the force massing against her and the rest in Endgame. If she is weak, how would endgame end? Hmm.. I think that duh, it is pointed out that her emotions are a weakness, and in endgame we will find out more. Duh, do some of these reviewers even watch the movie.No, it's not a classic, it is an assembly line story necessary to introduce Marvel before Endgame. It's kind of like places leaglizing hemp before grass. The trip may not be the greatest, but this is a decent trip. The next one - well we will find out soon enough. This reviewer has seen lots worse films than this one. As for rating those other reviewers, i've wasted my time enough on them already.",7,14,33,25 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Wow Iron 2
","In my view, this movie is better than the first installment. There are several reasons for me so naturally I want to list them. I was surprised that all the outrageous trailers for the film turned out to be in the film. Yet they made too much sense & didn't seem quite as outrageous.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent again. He is perfectly in character as Tony Stark. There is an explanation for the outrageous behavior which makes total sense. Clue- if you had all the power on Earth & thought you were going to die, what would you do?There are some nice location shots in this, particularly Monte Carlo.All the supporting cast is back from Iron Man with some excellent additions. Lucas Film effects & Skaywalker sound are much in evidence. To me this film has a more traditional film Hollywood pace. It has perfect spacing between the action sequences & the story sequences. No sequence is too long to get boring. The last half of the first film had a battle sequence that was much too long. People fall in love with computer effects too often.There is a new arch nemesis for Iron Man. See the film & stay all the way until after the credits. There is an additional scene.",8,7,12,9 May 2010

Somehow all this works out so that by the end of the movie, Rachel & Peter wind up together & Sarah winds up alone, while Aldous goes on tour with his band & groupies. That's the story for what its worth.There is a lot of good scenery along with some strange sequences with Peters friends Brian & Liz Bretter, and Peters little trip to see Dr Rosenbaum (Steve Landesberg). There are plenty of sexual situations, & some strange stories. My take is all this stuff is OK, though not classic.Note, the more I see of Mila Kunis, the better I like it.",7,0,2,6 January 2010
42," ;An Important True Story- Great Focus Film
","If you walk into this movie just thinking it is about Jackie Robinson, your missing the boat. The great television producer Ken Burns has already done that and not very well in his Baseball series. Burns over reached in telling the Robinson story there because his made it seem like there was nobody playing baseball except Robinson which was not the purpose he intended in trying to tell the story of the sport. This movie does not over reach. The script is about the drama of what Robinson did and the reactions to it. Chadwick Boseman as Robinson is magnificent in the movie. Harrison Ford plays the stuffy Branch Rickey, interested in the almighty green perfectly. The support cast, especially the small role of Leo The Lip Durocher who was still womanizing in 1969 when the Miracle Mets blew apart the Cubs during the first Moon Landing is spot on.The heart of this movie and the message is how wrong hate is and the guts it takes to overcome hate. It is hate that costs all of us the opportunity to be better. The movie touches on this early on with the references to World War 2 battling hate though it glosses over the sad story of blacks being still segregated from whites in the service during World War 2 that was reality. It took Harry Truman to finally end segregation after the war.The movie does point out how difficult it was for Robinson to cross a line forbidden until then because of pure hate. It is an accurate portrayal. I saw it happen in real life in the 1960's. That was when I became one of the first boys to play for a woman manager in Little League Baseball.I saw the fathers on the field and in the stands spew hate at her. The hate became more intense when we went undefeated the first season, won the championship the 2nd season and just barely lost the championship game her third season. The hate never stopped and after 3 seasons she stopped fighting a battle in which their hate never let up because she was years ahead of her time. The sad thing was the fathers did not seem to learn that a woman could coach and manage a team until years later. Her courage in crossing that line is the kind of courage this story highlights about Jackie Robinson.If only there was a way for this movie to teach how destructive this hate is and reach everybody to eliminate it, this would be the most valuable film ever. I personally witnessed Coaches in the last 10 years hating a player in a port so intensely, that they destroyed that player, bullying them until they literally destroyed their dream of playing anymore. The adults who did this were petty but in no way different than the ones who stood in the way of Jackie Robinson. The world loses every time hate triumphs.Here is the true story where hate is gloriously defeated and a handbook on how difficult it is to step out against people who are petty. Those people still exist, and the lesson here needs to be taught over and over again until we get it right. Trouble is no matter how hard we battle to fight hate, the victories are too small and for some reason hate always continues to exist.",9,0,0,26 October 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Best Family Film of 2006 -Swash Buckling Fun!
","This film has it all. The first film in the series was held together by Johnny Depp. This film has fine performances from the entire cast and great scenery, special effects, & fabulous action sequences. Keira Knightly is very good as the female lead trying to marry Orlando Bloom's character who seems to be tied to Captain Jack Sparrow. In this film, these folks are given some good script to work with outside of their interaction with Sparrow. That is what makes the film better than the Curce of The Black Pearl.Yes, this film is long, but even though I was tired when I saw it, I dare you to sleep through it. The plot is too good & the action scenes too good to sleep through. The legends of the sea are used in this one, from Davy Jones Locker to the Flying Dutchman, the images are all richly there. The search for the key to this movie is very entertaining indeed. The action is great, the comedy is great, & I promise you can't sleep through it. This is like riding your favorite roller coaster.Because of the fact there is more action, more balanced acting, more locations, more of everything than the first film, Johnny Depp's performance does not stand out as much in this one as it did in the first one (which is an Oscar Depp deserved more than the person who won it, um what's their name?). Never fear though, Captain Jack Sparrow is still plenty here & does dominate enough scenes to make everyone happy. You will find this film a real pleasure to watch & it is the best family film of 2006, without a doubt.",9,1,3,11 July 2006
Argo," Surprised But Not Shocked
","This film is an old fashioned drama in many ways. There are charges it is not accurate. I doubt if anyone who makes those charges knows anything about what really happened. There are references from real people to make one suspect these back yard critics know nothing about what really happened.For example, during the closing credits Jimmy Carters voice is there saying the the guy who pulled this off did the greatest thing ever in history of cooperation between 2 countries. That lends some reality to the fact that some of this did happen.The film almost addresses the issue of the problems the Carter Administration was having in foreign policy late in the movie. When they try to stop the operation, they mention the administration wanted to change how they were doing it because they were 'rethinking strategy'. This is a reference to the failed rescue military mission Carter ordered which killed a group of US Military folks and destroyed a couple of choppers in the desert.The reminder of the problems the Carter Administration (Democrats) had is at a bad time for the Democratic Party after their recent blunder in Bengazi. While Obama killed Bin Laden, and pulled US Military troops out of Iraq while leaving thousands of US Security Personnel in their place, it does not appear the present Administration is much better than Carter was.The Carter Administration is made to look foolish here in several parts of the film. None of the film was filmed in Iran though parts of it were filmed in Istanbul, Turkey.Does this film anger Iran? It should not as the present leader of Iran is not the guy in this movie and is not any relation to the shah.John Goodman and Alan Arkin are well cast as the Hollywood types. The lack of much real action makes you think this is a true story simply because no real Hollywood folks would make any movie without taking advantage of CGI. The main weakness here is trying to get the viewer to make the CIA into something it is not- a giving and forgiving organization that is helpful when their orders are not followed. That does not ring true.It is refreshing to see well done drama with a realistic touch behind the camera. The story grabs the viewer.",8,1,3,3 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Amusement Ride Disney Expansion
","This is the first time an amusement park ride got a movie. This one has one main reason it succeeds - the casting of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. His character is fresh and ready to go in this one. Granted Orlando Bloom is a good counter balance to Depp but it is Sparrow whose the Pirate that stirs the action.When this strong entry came out, it was very popular. It incorporates a few of the ride features with the action, but for the most part it goes into it's own world. Walt Disney's imagination really is the anchor for this film.The PG rating holds the Pirates into a more family oriented format theme the real ones, but that is okay. We have enough real pirates keel holing our lives anyhow. This escape is a welcome refuge from them.This film re-invents the role of women damsels being in attractive distress but not needing to take off their clothes to get the desired effect. The big success is the classic triangle between 2 men interested in the same damsel. That works well here too.When this came out, I was surprised by the length of the film, but pleased with the results. This is the best one still in the series. Yo Ho Ho and a broken compass to ye mates.",8,0,1,24 May 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Crossroads of a Movie Franchise
","After finally watching this one, this movie seems like a cross between Star Wars special effects, Fringe Science, and the original Star Trek Franchise. The most surprising thing is the quick cameo by Lenard Nimoy as he is retired the last I heard but this might have been done before he did. As an original Trekkie, I am distraught in how the story line is getting blurred beyond recognition.The writers appear to like trying to reverse previous scripts too. In more than one sequence they reverse scenes between Spock and Kirk from how the same things were done in previous films. That is more like film flam than actual creative writing. The actor playing the young Spock is by far the most impressive in the cast. The new Kirk seems to be getting away from the original one who always had a answer to worm out of an impossible situation. This one appears to be less the equal of Spock and more the inferior in this script.The new Khan is ruthless and one dimensional fanatic, which is totally different than the original one- dumbed down indeed. Script is without a doubt the problem with the movie.It is entertaining, because of the CGI. The last half hour of the film seems to try and Salute Gene Roddenbury but because of the blurring of the plot line in time and space, Gene would spin in his grave with the writing here. They still express his message but in doing so they lose the complex message he tried to convey.Back to the drawing board might be the best way to term this. Bad Robot indeed but an active robot whose battery has yet to run out, but needs a script writing recharge.",6,0,4,12 September 2013
Happy Gilmore," Golf in a slap shot?
","This film is very funny. The character development is extremely shallow, but you can't argue with the guest stars in this movie. The cast is loaded with lots of famous folks doing cameos.This turned out to be Richard Kiels last performance. He was always a busy character actor. Of course, legend Bob Barker does an amazing sequence.Adam stars as a hockey player who decides to try golf. The premise is just enough to hang the humor on. Once he starts, he turns out to be more of an oddity than any golfer around. Once you scrap reality, it works. How this sequence with Barker worked out is so amazing.People at Price is Right were asking Barker to repeat his line at the tapings even when he was getting ready to retire.This is a movie to put your brain in neutral & enjoy the humor.",7,2,4,1 October 2007
Public Enemies," Star Studded Miss
","This remake has everything it needs except script and character development. It does bring up a couple of good valid points. The big gangs did get away from big bank robberies because they found that AT&T and the US government were so far behind in phone network security facilities that they could steal much more money using the holes that US Gov't provided. - Tax free too, even though the IRS can tax wire thieves, they are still rarely caught which means this money is tax free. Smaller item- J Edgar Hoover fired Purvis because he was a homosexual dictator who could not share power with anybody in the FBI. Later in Hoover's life he was holding back the FBI more than he was helping it. The FBI and US Gov't still have never cracked down on wire payments, years after people have learned about it. The Dillinger story presented here is no where near the quality of the 1960's epic Bonnie & Clyde. In that one the viewer got engaged with well drawn characters. In this movie the character's are more of a sketch. The film makers did their homework here but missed the real history and made the characters card board cut outs who don't seem to relate much to each other or the audience.",3,0,0,19 November 2014
Ted," Crazy But It Works
","Getting Patrick Stewart to narrate a movie that starts off like a kid's fair tale is perfect way to start this. In a way this is like a grown up version of those Shrek Ogre movies. That is the main frame of reference I can come up with, but even then this movie breaks that mold too. Some of the elements are in place to make it like live action Shrek, but it is so much more adult.Sam J Jones reprises his Flash Gordon role in this movie. While he received a Razzy for being so terrible in that one, here he threatens the Academy with a nomination for best supporting actor. Mark Walberg is Johnny who wishes his teddy bear to life and gets his wish. He gets Mila Kunis as his girlfriend and love of his life. Along with the bear, these together are the ultimate male fantasy.Ted, the bear, voiced by Seth who wrote the script, makes no effort to do a different voice from Peter Griffin. That's OK though because hey, in a way this is a different story line but has a lot of the same characters in a different situation.I envy Ted the bear. Can't figure out how a Teddy Bear would really get stoned, but hey with the dream life he has of nothing but parties and work promotions I have to envy anyone who can get a raise and promotion at work in this economy.Getting the women he gets makes it even more of a dream. Ted, your sort of the ultimate bear life as you do much better at getting women then Yogi ever did at getting picnic baskets.Yes, you need to put your brain into entertainment mode. Still this movie has Mila Kunis looking all great and not playing a real bitch which is a women's role much over done in movies today. Here she is the introspective beauty with the golden heart and the child's sense of humor.What surprised me here, pleasantly, is that in spite of all the adult themes, it doesn't show as much skin as you might expect. Wonder if they are saving that for the Uncensored DVD? With the good looking women in this, that could make this the hottest selling DVD ever.This movie successfully bridges the gap from fractured fairy tale to crazy while crossing a few lines Seth has never crossed before. Years from now there will be an entire generation of adults who will be so glad those lines got crossed.Happy 100th Birthday to Universal Studios whose logo is on this film. Thank you for putting out pure entertainment for 100 years, this film continues that tradition.",8,2,9,14 July 2012
Knives Out," Surprising New Twist on Mystery Genre
","Benoit Blanc - you would think that a lead character with a strange accent would sound more like a Frenchman who draws escargo into the plot. Nope, this might be one of the best tung-in-cheek characters ever on the trail of a murder. There's Comedy afoot here but it is not realized immediately. In fact so many viewers are misled by Rian Johnson's plot that a lot of the reviews I have read here don't even realize the classic comedy put into this which is actually funnier than the all-star Murder By Death where Obi One Kanobe is a blind butler.When I started this film, I thought well an opening scene murder is not new. Then it seemed like it was a night mare of sorts. Then I got a Columbo twist as it seems too obvious who guilty and thought this was going to be a comedy more than mystery as Benoit Blanc appears befuddled despite obvious facts and guilt right in front of him. Then the twists come into play.The party on the night of the murder-suicide is replayed like layers of an onion several times in the film. Each time as it is unwound there is a different aspect of the party revealed. It's actually darned fine writing, a surprise to be sure. Could it have worked if there was another ending? Possibly, but this ending is so funny and a little twisted that the entertainment for this genre film is way above average.Folks here tend to look at the names in that cast and think that they should have been given better dialogue? Benoit Blanc gets some of the best humor lines ever in a film like this. When you make a comedy and disguise it by making it a mystery as well, you have to remember casts do not get a lot of great lines or acting in a comedy. So while handing out an Oscar for Best Supporting role in a Mystery film, you have to ask yourself why back ground characters would get great dialogue? Not gonna happen, though the caretakers role here is the best played. Daniel Craig proves he is great at subtle comedy as Benoit Blanc.When all is said and done, this film grabbed my attention because it is different. I like it because by making the comedy so understated it twists the plot into a neat mystery within some classic lines. If your not entertained here by the holes in the donut, then your missing the point. Rian Johnson is laughing at you as a viewer if you do not get what he has done here. Considering a Benoit Blanc sequel is on the way, he is laughing all the way to the bank. I am laughing with him, because I am wondering how the sequel is gonna be anywhere near as entertaining or as funny as this one is? I am looking forward to finding that one out.It's obvious who the murderer is only this one sets a trap that a few viewers got out of. They didn't seem to get the jokes. Maybe the sequel should just use the same cast and locales and rewrite the will? No, that would really be confusing though Benoit Blanc could then bring in the knives?",8,4,6,14 April 2020
Superbad," Seth, Evan, & McLovin Come of Age
","This is an R rated movie but it is funny enough that some teenagers have gone to it at least 5 times. While I have only seen it once, I think it is better than some films of this type but am not sure if it rises quite to the high 8 plus rating it has right now.The film starts a little slow with Seth (Jonah Hill) picking up Evan (Michael Cera) at his house & checking out his mom (played by a shapely Stacey Edwards). The actor who plays Seth is actually about 25 years old, but the only time it shows to me is in a scene where he is huffing & puffing on the high school track trying to run. The rest of the time, he is believable as a high school senior. His swearing in the early sequences is a little over the top but does set the tone for later events. McLovin(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is actually 19 years old in real life & Evan is just slightly older. As for the girls, Becca (24 yr old Martha Mac Isaac) is older than the other actresses but really looks younger & hot. The youngest actress(Jules / Emma Stone) gets the black eye from Seth but she looks older than the others. Getting away from these facts, the cast fits the story & acts very well together. The 2 cops (Bill Hader & Seth Rogen) are only slightly older than the rest of the cast but they play their roles well too. Their roles make the plot possible. Seth & Evan get invited by their to be girlfriends to a party at the to be girlfriend of Seth. They even get Seth $100 dollars to buy booze. They find out McLovin is getting a fake ID so they give him the $100 to go & buy the booze at the Liquor store.The store gets robbed, McLovin gets punched by the robber, the cops come to investigate, & this sets off an incredible chain of events which eventually the guys get the booze to Seth's girlfriends party. The events get quite funny. In fact, once the film gets past it's slow opening it has a good pace reminding me of Tom Hanks 'Bachelor Party' from the 1980's in pacing.The difference is this is a coming of age story of our males & 2 females. McLovin manages to get his fantasy alone too, but his story kind of gets dropped before the ending. I could see a sequel to this here as Evan & McLovin are supposed to be roomers when they go to college after this movie takes place.Overall, I found the movie a bit of a soft-core teenager comedy with a lot of funny moments. Seth takes quite a bruising in this movie as a lot of things seem to collide with him throughout the film. It is a fantasy story as the girls the guys are dreaming about are also interested in the guys. Wow, when I was a teen I wish it had been that way for me. There is a spot in the film where the continuity of where Evan is jumps out of place as he suddenly appears at a party with no explanation where he had gone in the previous sequence or how he arrived back at the party he was running away from in the previous sequence. That sequencing is the reason I only rate it a 7.",7,1,4,7 September 2007
The Great Dictator," Technology Dated But Message is Most Powerful
","Chaplin plays the Dictator & ironically a Jewish Barber. There are eerie scenes resembling the Third Reich rounding up Jews which was happening when the movie was made.This film features a lot of tried & true talent in the cast that worked with Chaplin in the silent era. It has a captivating performance by Paulette Goddard (Chaplins second wife) As the Jewish Barbers Girlfriend. Comedy bits by Chaplin in it are top notch from the beginning. It is his only sound film where Charlie still exhibits the energy he had in his silents. The script is a marvel for which Chaplin should be congratulated. The ending is a major dramatic surprise. It is a dramatic speech in which Charlie looks wooden on screen while delivering the speech, but it is the words of the speech which are most important. The speech is a message from Charlie's heart, a plea for the modern world he saw in the late 1930's to please move towards world peace. This message is powerful enough to evoke tears, even in the modern viewer. The sad note is that even today, as then, nobody listens to this plea. The fanatic Hitler did not listen even though Adolf Hitler often seemed to use the news cameras to look like Charlie Chaplin. Chaplins dance with the globe in this film illustrates what these fanatics want, but the destruction of the globe illustrates what they will get. This film has some of the greatest symbolism in the history of film, all at the hands of the little man who made us laugh, & out of character at the end of this film, makes us cry.This film is the essential Chaplin, both historically & monumentally a great film.I never heard this speech until I saw this movie. The entire film is a gem but to put this speech in perspective, Charles Chaplin] wrote this speech during one of the darkest times in 20th century history - in 1938 and 1939- during the rise of Adolf Hitler. Putting this in perspective - the speech is a plea for humans to care . This was Charlie Chaplin's first sound movie, and he wrote and directed it. Chaplin played Anoid Henkel - and Hitler's twin - a Jewish Barber. in the film, it is the Jewish BARBER making this speech. When set in the film, just before this speech, the Barber who everyone thinks is Henkle, is told he must go make the speech Henkle (Hitler) is supposed to make in front of a huge audience, the Barber's words are 'I can't.' What follows is this speech which is one of the greatest moments in Film History.",9,0,2,27 September 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Manys Shots To The Head - Kind Of A Beaned XMEN
","While this movie makes a noble effort with a lot of explosive action and many slick effects, it forgets that the viewers are more interested in getting a story with their super hero saga. This effort falls short on story.The problem is despite a fairly talented cast, the script fails to develop the story the way it should be told. Perhaps the folks were more interested in mutants & explosive fun, but the viewer gets quickly bored with all that because of the lack of something to follow. Hugh Jackman heads up a cast that deserves better than what it gets to work with here.Maybe this happens because 2008 had a good number of successful super hero movies and for explosions & special effects, this one out does them in many ways. The important thing is the makers of the film have their heart in the right place, but fail to execute that to reach the goal of the type of film they wanted to make here.",5,0,2,27 November 2009
Dead Poets Society," Shocked I never Reviewed This One Until Now
","Director Peter Weir takes a free spirit (Robin Williams) and puts him into a role of John Keating (Instructor at a stuffy school), hints that he has a darker past on the wild side, and then has Keating defy the stuffed shirts who hired him.There is more too this movie than some viewers can comprehend. Putting a straight jacket on Williams at this age is amazing. It is a film that has a message that has been incorporated into Education by Teachers as this one has a definitive political slant. It has tragedy, and sucks the marrow out of the students while purporting to unite them in a rebellion against the stuffed shirts.Williams is brilliant in his most restrained performance of his career. While he has some funny lines, very little is ad lib. It is almost like the writer and director really put a thing to him that very little outside the script was even considered. The rest of the cast is really in minor support here- they are just for Keating to play off.Critics did not like this film at all when it was released but are warming up to it as time passes because of the simplistic message Carpe Diem catches you thinking there is more to the film than there really is. Still, this is worth watching because of Robin Williams.",7,1,2,21 August 2014
Spotlight," The Academy Screws Up By Not Naming This Best Picture in 2015
","I do not understand why a movie released in 2015, a year when Birdman won Best Picture, did not get the award for the year it was released. This movie is a great gritty crime drama that is much better than that other picture. It is nice that it was named best in 2016, but by awarding the underserving Birdman in 2015 instead of this movie, the academy chose a flaky comedy film over an excellent film in 2015.It also robbed The Revenant and Denzell Washington's Fences more deserved attention than they films got. Especially Fences, which deserved more attention than they got, and one of these should have gotten best picture in 2016. So somehow Spotlight got the award a year late from an Awards organiztion that is a few shingles short. (Maybe they need the new shingles shot?)Spotlight takes a great true story and elevates it into a great film, and it should not have taken 14 months for this movie to receive the Best Picture. I do give Spotlight kudos for not changing the story for dramatic effect. The story is dramatic enough and the writing realized this. Morgan Freeman annouced this winner at the ceremony.This is a film still worth catching.",8,0,1,31 May 2018
Aquaman," Nicely Done -Straight Forward & Effective
","James Wan, Director extrodinare of the Saw movies goes beyond cutting up here in an adaption of AquaMan which would make it's creators proud if they can see it (RIP). A lot of people worked on this film done in 12 filming locations and that shows very much in the finished product. It sticks with Aquamans original themes and characters and manages to get some humor into the film. This is the best Warner/DC effort in a while.It works well because the script is better than a lot of DC films have been recently. It is predictable, all the way to the sequel sequence during the credits, but it is going to take some extra effort to make a better film than this one. It does have the one drawback many cgi movies have, no matter how much dirt there is in a sequence, the stars always come out squeaky clean with even a hair out of place.Nicole Kidman (age 51, are you kidding?) is very good as the Queen of Atlantis. Amber Heard is the Red Haired Princess who helps the light house keepers son become the hero Aquaman we are all in need of. The thing good about this film is that there are no wrinkles or curves thrown at the viewer. The flashbacks make sense (for once), and all the script makes sense too.Major Spoiler-
We all expect the Queen to still be alive even after we are told she is not. Aquaman finally finds his mom and it is a satisfying moment in this one. After all, moms treat their hero sons the best.",8,1,3,28 December 2018
L.A. Confidential," Modern Film Noir With A Lot of Style
","This is quietly becoming a modern classic. It fits into the Film Noir category perfectly. A hard boiled action packed detective tale. This film is very well done.It has been a while since I saw this film, but I was most impressed with how the period stuff was used & how well the story was constructed. The entire cast seemed to fit their roles well & while none had the performance of their careers, they all did fine with a solidly written script.Not enough modern films made as well as this one. It will be a staple on classic film channels in the years to come & is well worth seeing. I highly recommend this one to anyone, particularly if you like film noir.",8,1,2,28 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Secret End Sequence After The Credits
","These Pirates are back again, pretty much the same crew as the last installment with the addition of some more Pirates who look to be from China. The film is often a dark background film like the last.This time, there is more plot & less county fair rides. Actually that is not bad as it helps to explain new characters & the plot is one which while it appears to not be a plot initially keeps the viewer engaged as it twists & turns its way through the movie. This installment is quite long, but it has to be. There is an opening sequence before the credits that is tied very loosely with the rest of the movie. Keira Knightley has less to do this film than the last one though she arouses interest early on.There are some dandy sets & scenery throughout the film. The costume department at Disney has outdone itself again. Even the special effects are top notch. Johnny Depp is excellent as himself & him selves in different sequences. While he is not the entire film again as he was in the first installment of this series, there is plenty of Johnny to go around.This film has plenty of action too & goes from a wedding to a funeral in a matter of a few minutes. It also leaves us an opening for an intriguing 4th film sequel which would not surprise me if it comes about as this one is sure to make another shipload of money. No one even walks the plank. The film has a secret ending, after the films credits. If you don't stay through the credits you miss something good. Overall this film is even better than the last one. Yo Ho Ho & a bottle of rum, Captain Jack Sparrow comes back from World's End & we are happy he did. Stay sharp as you view this as some critics out there don't understand what to me seems to be a straight forward plot. Pirates are smarter than critics? Aye!!!!!",8,1,3,28 May 2007
Deadpool 2," A Lot of Fun & Action
","Deadpool's second installment does have some differences from the first movie. This includes an opening like but not like a James Bond movie with some crazy credits. That is only the tip of what is in store. Marvel Comic spirits predominate a talented cast and a script which makes too much sense. Deadpool 2 has another director from the first one, and though neither film has an experienced director (4 credits versus 5), the directors of this series are not real important. What is important is does the film have great humor and does the film mover along at a brisk pace? This one does....Deadpool gets shot up, beat up, and finds love, loses love, finds luck, irony, drama, and comedy all in 2 hours of film. He also loses a few things along the way, and gets to pick up the pieces during the end credits. No need to wait until the end of the credits in this one. Now here is the major spoiler- the plot works itself out using the theme of a song. What is the name of the song?'If I Could Turn Back Time'- yes it's Cher with an amazing vocal of her song included in this package. There is some pretty good music in this one. It's always in the back ground which is good. I don't think it would ever be a good idea for Deadpool to break out singing. After all, Clint Eastwood never boasts about his warbling in 'Paint Your Wagon'. Deadpool is a funny action hero who knows better than to subject his fans to any of that.",8,7,18,28 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," Your Un- Friendly Neighborhood Entity
","The many strengths of this film are the story telling & pacing. The opening credits go back to the old fashioned listing the cast but listing them in an action scenario sequencing that make the list seem like an action film in itself. This film knows very well how to develop characters and story line. It slows down when it needs to and speeds up nicely for the action sequences. When it employs flash back sequences, they are short & effective in fitting in with the current story.Thomas Hayden Church is by far the nicest surprise in the film. His acting in a dramatic role is by far the best performance. He has come a long way since WINGS. He proves he can do dramatic roles as well as comedy.This film is well over 2 hours but with it's pacing and great special effects it seems shorter. The ending leaves the next film open for a lot of stuff as Sandman is not destroyed & Spiderman & his girlfriend (Dunst) are still not engaged to be married yet. If the films continue to have such strong story telling, this could become a long successful series. This film is much more than special effects.The weakest point of this film is why & how the dark entity sought out Peter Parker first. Nothing is explained besides us seeing the meteor hit & then the thing come after him right away when he is leaving the scene with Dunst on his scooter. It does hop on his license plate when he is leaving but the scene is so dark it is hard to see that.",8,1,2,13 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Great Well-Scripted Marvel Film - And Lots of Fun
","Another film from the Disney-Marvel-Lee team and this one is lots of fun. What is really interesting is that Thor loses his hammer quite early in this one and goes through most of the movie without it. The film is quite faithfully written from the Stan Lee Marvel franchise.Visually, the film is magnificent. The filming locales in Australia look great and somehow the Atlanta, Georgia ones are fit in too. There is once again a lot of humor and fun mixed in with the battles and special effects. Chris Hemsworth(is back) makes a solid Thor even after his hair cut. Tom Hiddleston is back as Loki. Cate Blanchett is the ultimate evil sister Hela. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie kind of appears like a drunken warrior but by the end this one, I loved what she did here. Jeff Goldblum is a riot as the Grandmaster.I really could go through the whole cast this way, but perfect casting by the team who put this one together is really here. Stan Lee does not make an unaccredited cameo here which has been common in Marvel films recently, but the great spirit of the Lee creations continue to be well defined in this movie.As usual, stay through the credits to get some bonus material. Long run it appears these Marvel films will be the ones this generation will look at as classics. The great thing is you can put your brain away and just enjoy the show, and the way the chemistry of the script and the cast come together to be very entertaining.",8,2,10,11 November 2017
Yes Man," Whoa Baby, Yes Means Yes, Duh No Means No ?
","To me, Jim Carrey has never been as funny as Drew Carey used to be on television. In this movie he is OK. The film starts a little slowly as Jim is Mr. No. Then he meets a friend of his who talks him into going to a yes lecture. There he gets worked over almost literally by Terrence Stamp. After the life change, he tries yes and at first it does not go well. Then his luck changes when he meets a short brunette with a scooter. This is where the film starts to improve. It is a simplistic plot but when you compare putting away your brain on this to enjoy a good laugh versus the Cruise Fiction & Non-Fiction Valkerie, this film looks like a work of art.The film has a good supporting cast and from what I have looked at of other reviews, a lot of folks didn't see the end of the movie. The film has a strong classic ending which makes you laugh or smile when the credits role. I will not spoil the ending, but if you do not see it, you might feel ripped off. There is a hidden deeper sense of fate in the film. Once he changes from no to yes, every time he says no, fate seems to punish him. While the humor is a little off the wall, the encounter with the shelves and the elderly lady neighbor has a great comedic touch that has nothing to do with Carey. It has everything to do with the meaning of her false teeth in the glass. While not an absolutely great film, it is better than mediocre and there were lots of films in 2008 which were.",7,1,2,3 January 2009
Milk," Pie Hit You In The Face Rights Advocates
","While the idea behind this film is a biographical story of Harvey Milk, to me it comes off as more of a story about the fight for human rights, a fight we are still in pursuit of. The acting & directing of the film are good. The story is a bit shallow though historic.What the viewer is robbed of here is a more in depth script which would allow Sean Penn to bring Harvey Milk more alive. Instead we are left looking for more than we get in this movie. The story while compelling is kind of left to carry the film alone, with the cast being left little script to work with.The use of documentary film throughout the film is nice, but oh how I wanted viewing it would like to see more life out of the cast. This is a case of a movie with the potential to hit it out of the park but leaves the runners on base instead. There is a strong message about human rights here, but when you compare it to the sci-fi picture District 9, the sci-fi movie leaves this one in the dust.The sad thing is that even after all these fights for rights we have had in the United States, it appears that because of advanced science and the Internet, we will soon be losing those rights. At least here, you get the feeling there is hope for those rights to become free rights for everyone.",6,0,4,9 October 2009
The Prestige," Very Well Made Magic Tale
","Christopher Priest's novel is given a class A film treatment here. With Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan's top notch screenplay, and Christopher's Directing talents, this film comes off very well.Michael Caines Cutter character is good and his being the narrator is even better. Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, the feuding magic men, and Scarlett Johanssons role as Olivia, the woman assistant between them are well acted roles.Magic and deception are the keys to the plot. There is a little romance but the key elements here are the feud between the men, who will stop at nothing to outwit each other.In the beginning, one lovely lady assistant dies as the result of a mistake by one of these guys when they are doing a joint act. After that, they split up because the dead woman was a wife of one of them. Then the rivalry begins.They claw each other until the death trying to find out each others secrets. This all takes place in the late 19th century, and the settings for this are magnificent. There are 3 elements to each magic act, and the final curtain is the Prestige, where the audience gets something they do not expect.In the case of this film, you have to watch the end of it to get what the movie viewer does not expect. It is very much worth watching. Very good film making here and the Nolans would go on to do Inception later on. This is a solid effort that shows how they got to the later film.",8,3,4,28 November 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," George Roy Hill Directs A Winner
","George Roy Hill is a director who directed around 20 films, a majority of them involving either Paul Newman or Robert Redford. When he got a great script to work with like this one, and The Sting, he directed great films. When the script was not quite as good, he didn't do as well to raise the effort as with Redford in The Great Waldo Pepper.This film based upon the real Hole in The Wall gang story is lavishly treated here and the story is a winner. The triangle of Redford-Newman & Katherine Ross is exploited magnificently & this film is one of the better of the westerns of the late 1960's though there are a lot of great westerns that seemed to come out in the 1960's.If your a fan of westerns, this one holds up next to classics like The Wild Bunch and some others. This film has more fluff than the former, but it still is a classic in many ways on it's own.",10,0,2,8 August 2008
Crash," Too Intense For Young Children With Little Meaning
","Sandra Bullock & Tony Danza head an ensemble diversified cast in this movie set in Christmas time LA. Paul Hagis whose writing work runs the gamut from good in Million Dollar Baby to poor in Quantum Of Solace directs his 7th film here. He wrote the screenplay as well.While this is a good intense drama which tries to look realistically at racism in a modern diversified LA, it does get too melodically preachy towards the end of the film. It presents many views of racial hate but does not really get deep enough into its characters to show the real meaning from which the hate stems.The production obviously has some expense thrown into the film and the money shows. At least this is better than some of Hagis other work but when you look at the film as a whole, it is as inconsistent as his resume. Hagis worked on Flags of Our Fathers with Eastwood which is the weaker of the two films (Letters From Iwo Jima being the better other). Million Dollar Baby for all its good stuff, has too much card board in its main characters too.It appears Hagis work varies depending upon who he is working with. Here where he is on his own, the result is decidedly a mixed bag. There is a lot of drama & meat hung out here through the story lines, but the movie just sort of ends which in a way is like the real world but since there is obviously some contrived stuff here, that ending is not satisfactory for this film. The film dilutes it's main powerful racism message in an effort to be 'politcally correct' which comes off as melancholy.",6,1,4,30 November 2008
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Coming Of Age Causes Comic Confusion
","Marvel invested a lot in this one, even coming up with Tom Holland, the youngest actor to play Spiderman as a high school student. They loaded the cast with regulars and even gave Stan Lee a credited role. While loading the cast with Keaton, Tomeii, and Downey Junior, they kind of put this edition of Spiderman into a different universe, growing pains. While the script holds together and tells a story, it is a large departure from the comic strip. It is in fact a Comedy. Your friendly neighborhood Spidey gets into action early and often. Iron Man becomes a father figure for him even though the comics never really do that. Stark Industries provides him an Internship and a Spider Suit that is much like Iron Mans. This film is aimed at teenagers. It is the ultimate fantasy in many ways. It appears Spidey has a love interest, Liz, who is taller than he and Laura Harrier who plays her is absolutely gorgeous, the kind of woman a lot of young men would dream of. Meanwhile we have Zendaya playing Michelle, a curious sort of teen girl who is obvious curious about Peter Parker, even taller than Liz, yet manages to contain herself because Peter ignores her most of the time, spending all his attention on Liz. Then to add to the confusion we have Karen, the seductive voice of Spidey's suit, a seeming siren trying to appeal to his emotions (voiced by Jennifer Connelly).While this film gets off on a major tangent with the Stark Internship and a couple of clever sequences with the Washington Monument and Staten Island Ferry, plus a little action near Coney Island, it does focus more on teen coming of age than any previous film version.Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes / Vulture is a pretty evil bad guy, with lots of help. It is he who accidentally retools the film late by forcing Spidey to prove he is more than Stark's suit and he makes Parker save everybody without it. While this one has a pretty decent soundtrack, the music is more background here than in Marvel's Guardians of The Galaxy 2 last month.Strange the way this script has so many people finding out that Pater Parker is Spiderman. this could be a very messy one to sequel. That makes sense to me as the trailers I saw at this movie were sequels to movie series I have never seen the first ones too. Maybe the new trend in movies is to re-make box office bombs until they get it right.What this movie gets right is the entertainment, special effects, and ultimate inspiration to give the viewers what they want, particularly the younger ones. Those who care about script will not like this mess of a script. This one is long on entertainment but does come of age for Parker late in the film as Liz moves away after Parker puts her father away for bad behavior. As if there is not enough people who know that Parker is Spiderman including Aunt May and one of his talkative high school friends, spoiler - Liz's Dad knows too. It is going to be curious how the sequel of this will work, or not.",7,2,6,11 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Classic Film becoming Dated
","This is a great cast as Peter Sellers is at the top of his career here. George C Scott is good in support & Slim Pickens is to me the only cowboy who can ride home one of them bombs are git split all over them Ruskies. The film itself technologically is becoming dated. The plot to this is very parallel to the serious film FAIL SAFE which also is a classic edition of the cold war themes in the 1950 & 1960's films often. The difference is this one is very much played for laughs & the comedy, black & otherwise is here in abundance. I think as the late Sellers memory fades away, this film will become less watched. That is a shame, but at least this one will always be around for a look at his best. Sellers plays two roles & is outstanding at both. Favorite quote from the film is - 'There is no fighting allowed in the war room!'",9,1,2,29 September 2006
The Bodyguard," Great Song and Creepy Irony
","I Will Always Love You will be remembered for a long time with this movie. In fact, singers imitating Whitney Houston are still winning Karoke Contests using this song 20 years later. The power of this song is perhaps more powerful than the film itself.Still I would argue this film is one of the roles which helped establish Kevin Costner's career as he is excellent in his title role. Whitney Houston gets to play herself in a lot of ways here which makes her acting very effective. There is a lot good about this film.The creepy part is hindsight. While the body guard in this has to deal with an insane killer trying to shoot Whitney, the reality is she really needed a bodyguard for an entirely different reason - to stop her substance abuse. Her line 'I am not a morning person' is one of the cliché lines of a person with that problem. That makes the film creepy in a real retrospect fashion.When you look at Houston in this film, she looks as great as she ever has. She is actually portrayed as a beautiful young rock star who her fans and a lot of others would fall in love with. I have the same feelings for her here as many would in that her character portrays success in the way that it is often achieved, at the loss of a personal life for the star. The script then exploits that perfectly by having her fall in love with her Bodyguard. That makes all too much sense and I have felt often that singers who die too soon tragically like Houston has fit the way the script is written like a glove.",6,1,3,25 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Strongest of the Series Besides Episode 4
","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.This is the best of the series & not just because of the victory over the Empire. It springs a surprise in Luke having a sister, & completes Luke confronting what is left of his father. It destroys an empire & an emperor. It introduces Ewoks & then has them join in an alliance to create the victory. It even makes C3PO a God, & you can't top that.While it does not have a miracle create the complete victory, like Ben Hur does with Christs Crucifixation & events erasing Ben Hur's mother & sisters Leprocey, it does create a man made miracle alliance which ultimately destroys the evil Empire. This really counts big in the scheme of things.There is an ultimate satisfaction in the victory, especially when everyone including Ben, & Darth seem to be a part of it. That is what makes this the ultimate celebration.",9,16,25,23 February 2007
MASH," Very Interesting Film But Not Perfect
","Donald Sutherland & Elliott Gould both built their careers out of this film. Robert Altman got major recognition for this film. This is the only film that Sally Kellerman is remembered for.The fact is the cast is stellar, & it almost won best picture except for an even better film called Patton & George C Scott won that year. Why did this one miss when it echoed the anti-war themes that were prevalent in the United States when the film was made?One reason is Patton is a flat out great film. Patton has Francis Ford Coppola. MASH while it has very good sequences, it has sequences that if they were left out of the movie no one would miss them. Both films are based on novels, but MASH is based upon a different type of novel than Patton. Patton is biographical, MASH novel base is not.Expert advice is the final reason. Omar Bradley helped add an extreme touch of realism to Patton. With MASH, you always get the feeling the script has some sections that are whole cloth. While the cloth sections are entertaining (like the erotic Last Supper Sequence), the viewer just does not get the same feeling that realism establishes.This film was a great kick off for the TV series which borrowed everything it could borrow from it from the sets to Radar. The series couldn't borrow the rest of the actors & that is the actors loss. I want to put in a plug for Roger Bowen who played Col Henry Blake in this movie. Bowen is often over looked because of the others in the cast, but he is a darned fine actor & good in comedy. He was an integral part of a hit sit-com on CBS. Can you name it?I case you give up, it is ARNIE. Originality does run out late in this film. The football sequence is the least original part of the script. It had been done before, & again better than this film does it.",7,2,3,22 July 2007
Knocked Up," It's Been A Long Time Since Little Ricky Was Born on CBS
","I decided to see this one after seeing several films lately that referenced Knocked Up & The 40 Year Old Virgin as other films this Director/Writer has made. After watching it, this is a good movie as it actually is funny & an even handed treatment of what can happen in real life.Katherine Hiegl is very attractive & quite believable as the TV reporter who gets a promotion at works, goes out to celebrate, gets drunk, then has sex with Ben Stone (Seth Rogan), and then winds up pregnant after the one night stand. While Seth Rogan kind of holds this one together, Heigl, Leslie Mann (Debbie) & Paul Rudd (Pete), Alisons sister & her husband make major contributions to the film as well.This is not only comedy, but for once it has the consequences. It doesn't mean too, but it does try to teach responsibility though the ending is really left open as far as will Ben & Alison actually wind up together or not. They do make it through the child birth together.The humor in the movie does not seemed forced. There is even a section where Alison acts a lot like her sister, Debbie, though they are drawn as different sisters.",8,0,1,10 January 2010
Horrible Bosses," Getting Back To Business
","To me the biggest surprise in this movie is Jamie Foxx. Foxx is so far out of character that I didn't realize it was him until the credits. He is funny in this role. There are a lot of good moments of comedy in this one. Since 2011 has not been a good year for comedy this might be the best one of this year.Foxx is part of a large mostly male cast that is pretty well known. Think this helps make the movie better too. Jennifer Aniston is one of the few women around. She does have one hilarious moment in the film but little else. While it is one of the most successful film she has been associated with, Jennifer has little to do here.I can understand some of the box office appeal, who doesn't sometimes have a horrible boss they want to eliminate? Reminds me of Homer Simpson when confronted with having to shoot Mr. Burns (his boss), his quip is 'Do I dare want to live out the American Worker's ultimate dream?' Here, they try to hire it done and funny complications result.",7,0,2,2 January 2012
The Doors," Burn Out City, Short Lived
","This movie centers on Jim Morrison, not the Doors group. Val Kilmer actually makes a stunning portrayal of Jim Morrison on screen. The accuracy is excellent as it shows just how a man & lots of sex & illegal drugs can burn him out in a hurry.Meg Ryan as Morrisons main (but not only) squeeze is an excellent acting job by her too. She is clearly support but I was surprised by how well she does in a small but important role.Recreating the atmosphere of the 1960's is pretty well done. The 60's are portrayed pretty well as a decade where young women believed that liberation was trying to strip naked & streak through concerts. At one point in the film, Morrison gets the Jack Black treatment by the audience as he dives into it and is carried around. Black does this late in School of Rock & might have been inspired by this film.There's lots of female adult nudity in this one, & a plenty good soundtrack featuring a lot of the Doors great hits.",7,1,2,26 January 2008
Black Mass," Best Crime Movie This year
","Johnny Depp ... James 'Whitey' Bulger is into crime in this one.This take on Bulger's story is an r rated violent mob type story but this movie elevates the organized crime story into a more modern version beyond the times of The Godfather. It could be better as it tries to reach for the mob classic. It falls slightly short of that because Bulger's true story does not reach as far as the fiction.Still this one has a good cast, and a young director who is building an impressive resume. Depp brings something to Bulger which is a more controlled felon. Is this violent world enjoyable? In a more Blue Collar Type of way. There is a lot of talk in this but there is not an offer you can not refuse.",8,2,6,30 September 2015
Nacho Libre," Espanol Jack Black
","Jack Black is his usual absurd self in this but instead of English, he goes for the Spanish appeal. He looks patently absurd in his tights, but he does show a lot of energy in the action sequences. I think this is a notch below Jack's 'School Of Rock' performance but the script actually makes more sense to me than School as in that one, I had to but away reality & pretend a completed idiot could teach school. Don't tell the teachers Union, but that is actually more realistic than this one now that I think about it.In this one, Jack is NACHO, who becomes El Nacho, wrestler who with Esqueleto go into taking on matches they always lose to make money to feed the orphans at the poor home where Jack works. Jack turns out to be a good guy in this film who when his identity is found out, almost has to leave his job.Jack does seem a little different in this film than the other although in the wrestling sequences he still gets to do the same type of dive he did from the music stage in School of Rock. This is not a great film, but at least it is funny & only lasts about 100 minutes so it doesn't overstay it's welcome with the viewers.The supporting acting in this is pretty much not there as it is Jack Blacks show for sure. His wrestling partner, actor Héctor Jiménez (Esqueleto) is really the person who stands out the most in support. None of the others get much script to work with.",6,0,0,24 October 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Greatest Film From & For The Greatest Generation
","William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives is deserved in the category of great films. It has an excellent cast headed by Frederick March & Myrna Loy. It has excellent direction & production. It uses more drama than action though it has just enough action to enhance the drama. This is a movie which you get more out of each time you watch it. How Wyler frames this story is classic.What really makes the film great is a story that pulls in a viewer because of it's subject. The story is how did the returning vets of World War 2 deal with their war experiences, & how did it effect them. It runs multiple story lines through more of an ensemble cast than was prevalent in other films of its time. It does everything right.Later on the closest the Vietnam generation has to this is the film COMING HOME - but this Wyler film is done much better. You really feel like you know the characters in this film. This film deals with how people from several walks of life were dealing with the after war experience.Among the excellent story lines is one vet dealing with the loss of his arms in the war and trying to adjust. There is an officer dealing with having to struggle as employers do not count his war experiences as a marketable job skill for peace time. There is a loan officer at a bank and how he is touched by both of these folks & other returning vets.There is the scene which seems remote now, but is still haunting, of a vet walking through the grave yard of military planes built for the war parked on a seemingly endless field, being haunted by the images of the equipment and his own war experiences flooding back into his head as he looks at it. In addition to Wyler's Chariot race in 1959's BEN HUR, this scene is to me just as powerful & memorable in this film for a whole set of other reasons.If every film were made as well as this one was, I could never leave the theater.",10,0,0,2 July 2008
The Town," A Sunny Day To Die For
","Chuck Hogan's novel 'The Prince of Thieves' (not too be confused with Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves) is converted to a screen play by Ben Affleck, Peter Craig, & Aaron Stockard. Affleck Directs & stars as Doug MacRay the Prince. Rebecca Hall carries the female co-star role well, & Jon Hamm is the FBI agent on MacRay's trail.Hogan's novel is the fictional story of 4 Irish-American Brothers who are lifelong friends in the Boston area & of Doug, their leader, falling for the manager of one of the banks they rob. The screen adaption mentions some of the men being Irish but only emphasizes one of them as having a close relationship to Doug. It has a couple of men in a flower shop who order Doug around, & who bossed his father. The father is in prison & Doug's mother dead.In the novel, Adam Frawley, the FBI agent is in love with Claire Keesey (Hall) the bank manager too. This seems to be missing in the movie as perhaps time constricted this story in the film weighs in at slightly over 2 hours. Regardless, the film is pretty well put together & does hit most of the other high points of the novel. Jon Hamm is the FBI agent.This film is well constructed & a solid drama with little humor. As it lasted in theaters for a long stretch, the film has done well. No complaints from me, it is solid entertainment.",8,0,2,26 November 2010
Suicide Squad," Fun Summer Drive In Flick
","D.C. Comics is the premise for this, but in putting this 2 hours together WB came up with a film that flows with action most of the way through. I kind of expected this movie might get an 'R' rating, but they have toned down the action and violence to make it PG. Even the language is tame compared to many films of this type.Because of the replacement of the mature stuff with the action and fluff, this turns into a movie you can take most of the kids too and confuse the heck out of them. Most kids would not like real anti- heroes but this movie sanitizes them enough that the action is the dominating factor to the film.With the exception of the premise of assembling bad people to do what good people need to do but can't, the movie breaks little new ground. That is because we do the the Hollywood Good Feeling PG ending. That is not all bad.The squad is formed by a Government Agency, and a mysterious type of witch and her brother are the evil that the team is forced to face. That sort of sums up the plot. There are a lot of interaction scenes between the Suicide Squad which dominates the jokes and punchlines categories. Will Smith gets the majority of the better punch lines, but there are plenty to go around. Margo Robbie (Harley Quinn) gets to talk, maybe too much, and gets some play off Deadshot (Smith) and most of the team. She gets to make out with boyfriend Joker (Jared Leto) and their relationship is possibly the most major sub-plot of the movie.Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) plays her role as the top government official in charge of the Suicide Squad much like Judi Dench's M in the Bond 007 films. This is not a bad thing as her role is one of the few roles played seriously. Granted this is not a fair comparison as the 007 scripts are generally a bit better than this film.Spoiler - during the awesome graphic credits, there is a clip which appears to very much hint at the next film getting spun from this one which I bet is already in the works.",7,1,3,13 August 2016
Elf," Spagetti Syrup And Gingerbread Men
","Will Farrell has done better films than this one but this is a warm feel good holiday film. When you look at it as a whole film, it holds a certain charm. That charm is established by framing the story around belief in the fantasy known as Christmas.This is the most extensive work done by Bob Newhart since the 1990's. Bob is the framework that holds this story together. Ed Asner has a very small role as Santa & is just here enough to be recognizable having little chance to do much acting.Brunette bomb shell Zooey Deschannel is charming as a blonde & proves she can sing. Hopefully she will get some better roles as her young career has proved she can handle them. In this movie, she makes the viewer buy that young innocent charm as she glows here.Faizon Love is excellent in support as the Gimbles store manager. James Caan is OK here, less annoying than in some films, but for some reason he does not seem to get really good roles anymore.There are some gross holiday bits, like downing a 2 liter Coke & a 5 minute belch which is entirely logical, and then some bits which are funny physical comedy. Farrell does not carry the whole show here and that is a good thing. While he is considered the star of his films, his films are better when the support can carry them. His easily worst film is Bewitched where he tried to carry the entire film & flopped badly.This doesn't measure up to classic holiday films but is better than some of the lame efforts of recent years.",6,2,2,22 December 2007
Taxi Driver," Fine Film With A Great Cast & Story
","Besides the great Martin Scorsese directing thi film, and Paul Schrader (Raging Bull) writing the script, the cast is pretty much a who's who of stars and supporting actors in the 1970's and beyond. Jodie Foster, all of 14, had been acting since age 7, though this was her biggest role to date. Robert DeNiro would later do Raging Bull, but his role here as Travis is excellent. Fresh from The Godfather Part 2, his experience shows in this role. With support like Albert Brooks, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Kietel you can't be talking to me about a more capable cast.The main story has to do with the taxi cab drivers in Manhatten, and New York City. With most of the filming done on the streets it gives the atmosphere a real feeling and the scenes an authentic look. The action scenes are pretty bloody and this is before CGI came along. It is all fictional and the protitution and the mob are a part of the story. It became notorious that John Hinckley Jr. who attempted to shoot President Reagan is supposed to have gotten a fixation from Jodie Foster's role in this film. While she is good here, DeNiro is definitely the star though Foster's acting in this definitely put her well on the way to stardom. Pretty adult material for her at this age, and it is handled well. As for Hinckley he got released from jail in September, 2016, and is living with his mom.
 Leonard Harris role as Charles Palantine is the supposed politcan running for President here. The Reagan connection happened long after the movie was released. This is a gritty street story with mobs and cab drivers.",8,0,0,4 January 2018
Shutter Island," Comes Close But Perhaps the Wrong Comparisons Being Made
","This film is set in 1954. During that year, Hitchcock was making Rear Window. Supposedly the crew for this film was shown Vertigo (1958) when getting ready to make this film. Perhaps this film is closer to Topaz. The critique of Topaz in that it would be considered a good film in the 1950's, but not such a great film in 2010.Still it is a good film, one of Leonardo DiCaprio's better performances since Titanic. 81 year old Max Von Snydow is along in support. It does follow a logical if not original plot line & carefully leads the viewer along through a story. Actually, when compared with other works from Martin Scorsese it is better than Gangs of New York which kind of went over board in my opinion. The story is of 2 US Marshalls going to an Insane Asslyum known as Shutter Island in 1954 to investigate the escape of a female inmate. The island setting is well done. The cliff sequence & the dark settings in the film do give it a murky environment. The story is really quite logical & it becomes quite easy to realize your being tricked at the beginning of the movie.The question is do you mind the trick? Some folks will like it, & some folks (like myself) will realize early on what the trick is. One thing definitely like Hitchcock in this is 2 of the main actors riding in a jeep that is traveling in obvious moving background rather than on a road. That is a method of travel Hitchcock used often. Scorsese must have studied Hitchcock films & employed it here on purpose.To me, even if Martin Scorsese was trying to mimic Hitchcock here, when you compare it with Martin Scorsese, it is better than most of Martins latest efforts.If you really want that type of suspense though, I suggest sticking with Hitchcock. This film does not get to the master of suspense standard, but is a good movie.",7,1,3,9 June 2010
Life of Pi," Gorgeous CGI Into Fantasy
","I think this movie might be more appreciated if I had read the book, which I have not. Still, I find appreciation here because the film uses a fantasy novel to create a fantasy on screen. Most often when you view a film based on a fantasy, you appreciate it more with knowledge of the source. Still, this movie rises above the typical conversion.It starts off with a story the viewer can follow and interests the viewer and this film does it with the journey theme.Ang Lee does manage to get that feeling over. The scenery is the strong point. There are a couple of things wrong. There is one scene where it gets extremely obvious that the light in the scene is from a spot light. Since this is not a stage play, it is an obvious error.The other thing is that the entire sequence on the life boat gets a little far fetched. To match some of the comparison's - this is better than Avatar because the love story in this one is more realistic and much less hokey. The second advantage is that this one is a lot shorter than the bloated Avatar.There is another fantasy tie in this movie with the excellent 'Finding Neverland', a Johnny Depp vehicle early in Depps career. This movie falls short to the Depp film which is just plain excellent. Granted it has better special effects, but the imagination of Neverland is just at such a high level, that the fantasy here falls short.There is some parallels to the Old Man and the Sea. This is a fish story or is it? The viewer is left to wonder if there is any reality in where Pi is story telling versus where the book fantasy is at.I enjoyed the film because it made me think at points about the predicament of the main character. What make him keep going when he has lost almost everything there is in the world. That is why this is a fantasy, as it stretches the reality into fiction rather than having severe depression which would be the normal.I enjoyed the effort and the thoughts going into this ambitious project. There is some excellent work here. It is better than Avatar.",7,0,1,21 March 2013
Doctor Strange," Stan Lee's 102 Acting Role? Wow
","There are great reviews of this one out here, and there are trolls reviews venting that all Marvel Movies are alike, over hyped and over cgi bullshit*t. Well I am kind of in between here. This one is much better than a dreadful one where two teams of super heroes actually both lose in the movie. It is a notch short of some of Marvels best efforts. That is why Stan Lee is on a bus on this one. He is trying to stay out of the way and yet laugh all the way to the bank. Successful, Lee is.The movie makes it because Dr. Strange actor pulls off his role pretty well. It does get a little deep in all the fighting and action sequences. The bald lady comes off very much like that old lady who is in charge of James Bond in the last few outings.The movie is predictable, and yet enjoyable. Could it be better, yes, and the feelings between Strange and his estranged wife are not very emotional. Of course who has room for emotions when you need to save the entire world?This is one of the places the emotion is lacking a bit. The characters do the best they can with the script, but it could have been better. The ending credits contain 2 surprises, and one thing that is not surprising. There are only about 4 songs that get credits in this one because Dr. Strange is just not very musical.Maybe that is a sour note, but it depends on what you like, You could say that in a diner, this movie is the blue plate special, better than a plain cheese sandwich, but not a prime rib sandwich. Then again in some eateries, the Blue Plate is the prime rib. It's just left over from yesterday's special.",7,2,2,16 April 2017
We Are Marshall," Inspirational
","This movie is about inspiration. It starts with a tragedy, in a true story the plane crash which killed nearly the entire Marshall University football team. Then, it deals with the reactions of everybody the tragedy touched.When this movie deals with tragedy, it doesn't just make you get out your hankies. It shows real life how difficult it is to face, how it can take time to face it, & how people must eventually deal with it. This is not an easy thing to do. The recent Disney Film, fictional, The Bridge To Teribetha, does not do this same thing correctly when dealing with one persons death.All the performances in this film are outstanding. It would be difficult to put anyones role in this above another's. Even the smaller supporting roles are done well. I was in high school when this really happened. This film has a clip of John Chancellor, former NBC News anchor, reporting on the plane crash early in the film.As an inspirational film about sports, this is one of the better ones I have seen. The only thing I would add is at the end of the film, when Marshall wins it's first home game, I would add a clip of the same John Chancellor which I think I remember seeing after that first win. If I remember right, he reported it this way: 'Today, Marshall University won a football game. While one win is not usually such a big event, after all Marshall has been through this past year, winning this one game means much more to Marshall than that.'This sums up the inspiration that is obviously put into this film, & how it really happened. To the folks who made the movie, We Are Marshall is much more than a story. This film, in the way it was made, shows a lot of caring in doing this story right on film, and it shows.David Strathairn is excellent as the Marshall College President. Some viewers might remember him as Ira Lowenstein in A League of Their Own.",8,1,1,15 October 2007
Interstellar," Quality Sci-Fi
","The effects on this one remind me of Kubrick some how. Earth is in major trouble and some folks have to go into space to save the human race. While this type of plot has been done before, this approach seems fresh and realistic. That is because real (scientists ) were hired to consult on the film. It gives a major upgrade to this movie over some other recent films where this plot was used.So the reference to the government altering school books because they faked the Apollo missions to the moon might be a bit far fetched, but there are fans of Kubick who insist he filmed the real moon sequences in the 1960's meaning they are not real. There are some realistic scenes on earth here with farms and problems threatening earth. Michael Caine is here as the planner of the space mission of 3 years to try and save the earth. This is not a perfect planet, but you pretty much figure out we have to help each other to save it but strange leaders are preventing that.It is amusing when Caine finds out late in the movie that a lot of his work was off because he might have focus on the wrong theory all his life. All to true and much too often in the real world.",9,2,5,29 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Jokers Wild & Hookers Are Cheap @ 10 Bucks A Piece
","This film is really 2 films. The first is a depiction of Marines Basic Training at Paris Island. The second is a depiction of Vietnam. The only real connection is Joker between the 2 parts. Otherwise this is really 2 separate films.Basic training creates 4 strong characters and then kills two of them at the end of it. The second half keeps Joker & sets up a couple of strong leads. When you compare this film to what other film makers were making in 1987, it is a good film. When you compare it to other Stanley Kubrick films, it is a weaker film. Even Kubicks weaker films are better than most.If your a military person looking for accuracy, this is Kubick. Kubrick is a story teller, not into reality. If you don't think so, don't forget his best films like Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, and The Shining are all fiction or Science Fiction films. Considering their brilliance, why would you expect accuracy here. What this film does is tell two good stories and entertain the audience.Kudos to the choices of rock songs for the sound track. The music choices are outstanding. As far as the story, the first half ending is rather predictable. The reason that this film does not measure up to Kubricks best is that it goes from the first half to the second with no real connection.A warning, this is not for younger children as the language in the first half really is salty. A weaker Kubrick film but this film does have some brilliant flashes.",8,0,1,23 April 2009
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Action & Sentiment Rule But Ending is But A beginning of Another Order
","Well, it finally happened, we have a Star Wars film where C3PO is at a loss for words. After 8 episodes of twaddle, C3PO has to be hacked because he is banned from translating Sith language by his own programming. Perhaps the Sith is the only thing that can shut him up. In 9 movies, C3PO has had more lines than any other character in these films.Whats nice here is seeing all the characters make appearances in the franchsie conculsion. The plot is rather predictable, Emperor Palentine has built the Final Order, a huge fleet of Dreaknots all equpped with planet killer cannons. It appears he wants to take this fleet and destroy every planet in the universe until he eliminates the rebel rebellion.The are the sub plots of his supposed Grand-Daughter, Rey, and wanting her and Genera; Leia's Son to rule the universe together by killing him? Meanwhile, they plot to get together and kill him. Only there's some detours through battles and of course Ray stops to see Luke Skywalker to finally complete her training. Amazingly, fate has provided more of General Leia than I expected. I think they must have filmed most of the sequences for this movie before Fisher's sudden death. That a big break for this movie as her role is actually still a pivot in the film, and then the General is put to rest right about the time her son and Rey face down Palentine.Finn has something to tell Rey, but he never does tell her anything. That is one of the films small moments of humor. This one is built more on sentiment and less on humor than previous films in the series. Nice to have Lando back. Even nicer is Solo *Harrison Ford' getting one last time to say goodbye to his son Kylo Ren. It's a well done emotional scene. This series have given so much to so many over the years and like several members of the cast, some of us who first saw episode 4 in the 1970's sis not make it to the last reel of this film. Rey defeats Palentine once and for all with the help of both Luke, and his son Kylo, and the universe is saved.Then there is this last sequence, an emotional moment back at the beginning where we first met Luke. Rey goes back to the beginning at the end. It is the perfect ending, but it might be a beginning as well. It completes the cycle of Rey looking for her identity. She had to go back to the beginning, establish order back into the force, and to the universe. Thus it ends",8,6,20,28 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Where's My Darned Movie?
","This movie has the honor of being my first IMAX 3D exposure to any movie. I have to admit that the effects, the 3D, and the surround sound is impressive. As for the movie, the plot has pretty much been done in 100's of films already. Aliens spoiling for taking over Earth (obviously they have not read any of our news about how we have wrecked the planet with climate change) have opened a portal into our planet to develop and plant monster after monster on our planet with plans to attack and destroy us. They want Earth and they want it bad. Sci-Fi fanatics plot to be sure.The best feature of this movie is that it is short, because it seems to turn into one attack after another after the first 15 minutes of the film. In fact, the scenes with people fleeing the attacks in Hong Kong reminded me very much of a 1950's Godzilla movie. Even the alien monsters look a lot like good old Godzilla, and in the case of the pregnant one, the bride of Godzilla.The humor is the only relief in this exercise, but there is not enough there to make it entertaining. The script is short and I feel sorry for the cast trying to bring over this turkey. Still, there are some great CGI effects so I guess everything is not lost.As for me, the most interesting moment is in the previews. It appears Warner Brothers is updating a great movie into the 3D Imax Surround Format that ought to really be something to see. They showed a new trailer for the 75 year old film which pretty much concentrated on special effects of the film, which after watching this one is 75 years ahead of it's time. Whoever at Warner had the idea of doing the old movie ought to be congratulated because I'd like to see it in IMax not just for special effects but to hear one of the great movie musical sound tracks in surround sound. That preview was for the 1939 Classic Wizard of Oz. As for Pacific Rim, it appears the San Andreas Fault is not in Kansas yet, Dorothy. If this movie was 3 hours long (ugh) there would be no place like home.",2,7,15,21 July 2013
American Sniper," Chris Kyle's Biography Is Top Notch
","Hollywood people have become more than a little fickle. This movie avoids political statements entirely. Chris Kyle's isn't about politics, it is about service to his country.The only ones who might not like the way this is told would be corporations. That is because Chris Kyle comes off in this like a blue collar worker - loyal to his company (the Navy Seals) in doing his job effectively and efficiently. That job is protecting his comrades in a war both parties voted for in Congress. The movie is only slightly patriotic because Kyle is doing his job. I do give him credit. When he meets his wife, she gets sick and barfs from too much booze. When I met a girl at a college mixer who did that, I did not even date her again, it was that ugly.Kyle was played by a member of the cast of the Hangover and played well. The combat in this one rings true, The film does a great job of addressing the mental stress 4 tours of duty in Iraq would do to somebody. It portrays Chris Kyle's family as low middle class.Mustafa (the other sides sniper) is played by an Egyptian actor named Sammy Shiek who had a role in Charlie Wilson's war. The reason I say the critics are fickle is that Hollywood must still be hurting over making The Hurt Locker a pro war fictional tale Best Picture a few years ago. Hollywood hates being too pro war so just as the Democratic Congress, that voted to authorize Iraq to start with, they are trying to run away from this movie.I have the feeling after seeing this, I need to read the book. Since I had not, the ending shocked me and represents extreme irony. Democrats are really good at running away from problems and issues, and that is what they are trying to do with this one.This movie is tense and dramatic with lots of action and everyone involved in making this one should get kudos. Could it be better? I'd have to read the book. This movie is politically middle of the road. Chris Kyle is a portrait of control in the middle of chaos. As for all of Hollywood being middle of the road and in control, that will never happen. Hollywood does not relate well to lower Middle Class people. They are all rich so they do not understand Chris Kyle's biography and the stress portrayed in this movie. To sum it up is Chris Kyle's statement to his doctor. 'I only wish I could have saved more of my friends.' A lot of them die in this movie and it appears Hollywoods, the rich fat cats do not understand his humble noble mission.",9,7,22,25 January 2015
Glory," A True Memorial For Civil War Drama
","In a lot of ways, this movie which preceded Ken Burns The Civil War is a part of what inspired it. This film kind of set a new story to the American Civil War few had seen. The consulting on this included Shelby Foote who was a fairly large part of the Burns series to follow.Historical accuracy might be impossible to prove. Foote's expert consult helps but that does assure it. The cast brings this off very well with Kudos to Mathew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. The story is a small little know piece of Civil War History. The reason it is so obscure is the lack of involvement of the biggest major heroes of the war.In a war where over 400,000 Americans died, there are a lot of those corners. It is tough to say this, but every hero in the Civil War is not told, because some of them are lost to history and beyond the reach of anyone now, it has been so many years. James Horner's music here, years before Titanic, is very recognizable and adds to the drama. The final battle sequence is very much in the mood of Titanic, even to the sequence after the battle where the bodies are being laid to rest. The drama of this story is definitely enhanced by the mood this music sets here.Time passing has made this film better. So many of the reasons the film is what it is are now gone. It is a testament to why we need to record the moments we can, while we can. Life only happens once. How people contribute is the real Glory, such as in this story here.",7,1,1,29 May 2016
Rocky II," Sequel But A Little More
","The original film is a classic. This one actually goes beyond the classic and makes Rocky a Legend. The sad thing is that the ego of Stallone & others went so far that the series became like the Energizer bunny & keep going & going to oblivion.This one, while not quite as strong as the original, does pick up the story logically & build to a fitting climax of the Balboa-Creed rematch. All the first films principals are here along with some new faces along for the ride.The strengths of this film are the logical story of what success does to both boxers who are strong men but yet both weak in ways. The development is logical to the conclusion & Rocky winning this time is the fitting ending movie goers yearned for after the first film.What is interesting and often forgotten now is the way both films tried to develop Apollo Creed to be a Muhammed Ali like type of boxer. One of the strengths of both films is having that type of character for Balboa to play off and Carl Weathers brings it off brilliantly. While Creed isn't exactly Ali, there is no doubt the real life Greatest had much to do with the success of the first 3 Rocky films in the box office, though the third one goes too far & loses too much of what the first 2 installments were all about.",7,0,1,20 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Weakest Film of The Entire Series
","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. The problem with this film is that Lucas seems to have forgotten the story telling in this one and fell in love with the special effects. Granted there are some unique sets & great ideas like the clone army & the dark count (Christopher Lee) introduced. Anakin does marry his childhood love at the end of the film (though if the ages were advanced right she would be robbing the cradle). Acting & story are the weakest here in the series. Other than the wedding, all the acting has been sucked out of this film. Did this part of Star Wars get outsourced to the special effects department?Below I describe some deleted scenes which if restored to the film would put some of the acting back. These are on the DVD of this film. The battle sequence at the final part of the film, while visually something to see is much too long. If we lopped about 5 to 10 minutes of meaningless battle sequences off of this and use the most dramatic parts only, it would flow much better.The early sequences with the assassin chase are visually appealing, but once again, if this chase had been shorter and some of the stunts less absurd, it would strengthen the film too. On the DVD version of this film, there are some cut sequences which if the action were shorter could be put back in and tell the story better.There is a sequence cut where Padmay introduces Anakin to her family including her sister which would flesh out more of the romantic story. A couple of other sequences developing the romance could be put back in too. The effect of the film without these is that they seem to fall in love one afternoon in the grass near the falls with little other development, like strangers meeting in a bar. I would like more time than that to fall in love, this romance is much too labored and not real enough. That is the main failing of this film, too many special effects sequences and too little story development. Humor is sadly lacking in this film compared to others in the series too.",5,1,2,31 May 2005
Forrest Gump," Enjoy The Entertainment, Don't Read Into This
","While this one rates as the premiere performance on film of Tom Hanks, I think one thing that prevents it from being an all time best film is the entertainment factor. Robert Zemekis direction efforts are always solid entertaining films (with the exception of a few of the remakes he has done in recent years which thankfully are getting buried without ceremony).Tom Hanks is not just Gump in this movie but he is the narrator for pretty much the whole film. If they had stuck with the book this is based on, there would have been a lot of missing drama. Would this movie be as effective if the drama was a lot less? I think it would be. The death of Jenny while making for a dramatic ending does not really add to the film other than making you reach for the hankies.For a Zemekis film, this one is slower moving than most. It pulls at the heart strings as Gump is presented as a stupid person who lucks into many historic moments by accident. Really, Gump is not stupid, just slow & partnered for much of the film with his commanding officer from the service, a double leg amputee, there is a good chemistry between these characters.There is the dream girl Jenny. Gump claims to always be thinking of her. Good touches in the film include the party with the girls & the guys where Forrest breaks up the party by complaining that the one girl trying to make out with him tastes like cigarettes. There is the simile of 'Life is like a box of chocolates' which is the most quoted line of this movie.Too many folks don't like the reading of politics into this, so don't look for this. If you just sit back & enjoy the story telling & not look for holes in the plot, then everything is fine. The same applies to the Back To The Future series Zemekis directed. The plots in many of his films are full of holes when you analyze them. So don't do it, why get a headache when you don't need too.",8,2,5,25 September 2010
Ant-Man," Antastic And It's About Time
","There are times when you watch a film that is sure to have special effects that you wonder if that is all your going to get. When you watch this one, you get plenty more than that. Plenty of thought and the ideas of 6 people joined together to write an intelligent and witty and imaginative script. Disney put a lot of resources into it and it shows.This movie has the special effects and the actors make the script go well. Director Peyton Reed does as fine a looking job with this. The film is all about pace and action and imagination. It succeeds on every level here.Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Evageline Lilly, with plenty of support from Corey Stoll and a host of others make the script go with some amazing acting. This one proves when you put together the right team, the right material, and the right resources-you get the right film and then some. The credits list so many people that you get the feeling of the action and pace of a Bond film, and so much more. The credits even have 2 bonus clips including one of the upcoming Captain America film. Marvel even stages a raid on an Avenger's facility in this one. It takes the ideas of Marvel films, and if it were a computer game, puts the ultimate expansion pack on it. Oh, yea!",8,0,0,6 May 2016
American Hustle," Understand Where The Plots Comes From
","This film is not a simple one to wade through. That is because it is partially based upon the truth but names have to be changed in order to protect the guilty, some of who are still with us; Because of the intrigue of the events of ABSCAM in the 1970's, there is a lot of care taken in the script of this. The writers have to be careful with the characters to not get too close to the real thing.This details one of the most successful stings of the US government in History. It involves a phony sheik and the building of a scam trying to prove successfully that out Senators, House members, and others are less than honest. The bribe set up involves organized crime and the building of the casinos in Atlantic City. The thing that is amazing is that guts it took to write this one/ It uses much talking to get the plot over to the viewer. It is necessary to do this as just showing what happened without going into the people pulling off this complex scam would not tell the story properly.For those who remember the actual events and the SNL sketch about it years ago, this is a hilarious romp. For those who are not initiated, it might get a bit tedious. There is a great piece of humor from this period of history in this. Something that has changed besides the telephones is the way retail merchandise is distributed. When Microwave ovens and other things first came out back in this era, small middle men would actually make a living distributing hot items from the back of their car. This movie has a sequence that recalls the old Microwave oven from a trunk routine and then tops it by having someone who gets one that way put metal in it and explodes the oven. This is not only funny but is a sight gag as noteworthy now as in any movie in history.",8,2,8,28 December 2013
The Godfather: Part II," A Second Offer Is Harder To Refuse
","Usually, a sequel is not as strong a film as the original. This one is every bit as good. I am thankful to have just viewed the Coppola 2007 restoration of this film.At well over 3 hours, it is longer than the original. What is does is deftly fill in 2 stories that we saw small parts of in the first film. We find out how the Don, Vito Cordleone got his name, what his real name is, and the history that made him who he was in the first film.The second story fills in more about his kids, particularly Michael, and how he took over in the late 1950's and his battles with one of his dads enemies. The back drop moves from Nevada to Sicily, and then to Havana. Michael faces down a series of folks including a Congressional Hearing about his life.While this has no Brando, it has an excellent cast from the first film with some additional folks added. James Caan makes a brief cameo at the end of the movie. Talia Shire & Diane Keaton head up to female cast though these films seems to have a cast of 100's because there are so many parties & events.The film keeps with the same strength as the first film, strong storytelling which brings you in and peeks your interest enough to keep you going. When you watch this, your always wondering what is going to happen next and who will get theirs.",10,3,4,21 February 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," CIA Spoof Series Continues
","This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.",8,1,1,30 September 2007
Fargo," Snowed out Crime of Insanity
","William H Macy and Frances McDormand's strong performances carry this film based upon a true incident. This is one of the movies which established Joel & Ethan Coen's reputation as film makers. While the whole crime idea by Jerry Lundgaard (Macy) is insane, the people he hires too kidnap his wife mess up everything. This goes to prove that no amount of money is worth everything.There are a couple of flaws in the understanding of the plot. I really do not understand why Jerry (Macy) needs to score all that money. A scene that doesn't make sense is when Jerry arrives home to find his wife missing, he carries the groceries all the way to the second floor when the kitchen is one the first floor.One more thing is I wonder if it is true that a character buries most of the $1 million in a open snow drift, if the money is still out there as there is no indication in the film that anyone has found it. Still the movie plays well & tell the whole story well. It is sort of a prelude to the later No Country For Old Men.",8,0,1,19 November 2010
Rush," Well Written, Well Cast, Well Directed- Must For Racing Fans
","I a way I equate this with a sort of drama between the 2 drivers that comes off as sort of a Ben Hur type of drama. I think that if I were a big time racing fan, I'd like it more but I am still at a strong 7 here. Ron Howard shows he can still direct and tell a story well behind the camera. He has a script written by the same guy who has written other films for him (like Frost-Nixon). The drama gets very strong here.As for the sex sequences, they are laughable. One thing Hollywood does well is portray hugs, love, and kisses. One thing it does poorly is the sex beyond. Luckily there is only a minimum of it in this movie.The casting of the leads is excellent as both actors are solid in their roles. The film does start a bit slow but moves along well at the end. Being shorter at the end is an asset as you leave the theater with the illusion the entire movie was speedy.Strong finish at the checkered flag sends off the viewer with a good feeling.",7,1,2,2 March 2014
Nightcrawler," Record for Broken Laws in one movie
","This is an exciting drama. Lots of good action, murder, mayhem and great realism. The younger viewers might not realize this type of plot has been done before. The difference is this version is up to date and much more realistic than the previous versions.The story relates to night stringers (reporters) trying to catch dramatic videos of crimes at night for the Los Angeles morning TV news There is plenty of language and action , so much that the romance line of the plot never even completes one kiss. There are hints it might but the complex finale never gets to it.The realism here along with come outstanding acting by the cast brings this out. The finale really leaves this one open for a sequel. The thing is will the cops arrest the leader character at the start of it or we will go to their murder trial? I will leave that cliff hanger to the people who watch this and the writers of the script for the sequel.The realism is what makes this one so tense and good. The old version of this type of plot is not nearly as real and is more fantasy. Still, television did that one in a totally different era. This one is smart and sharp and up to date.",7,0,2,11 November 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Freddie Mercury Biopic Is Musically Powered Epic
","Movies based upon reality are rarely perfect. This film comes close to being so. Granted Mercury's Darkest side of his personality might not be here entirely, but the positive side, his music and the story of Queen is overpowering and done with great energy.Could this film have been done sooner? Not really, as during the 1990's there was the defense of marriage act mentality which would have doomed this movie to not doing the main plot line-bisexuality without actually doing it with meaning. In the 1980's, the HIV theme film portion would have been impossible.The film take some liberties with the HIV making the claim that Mecury told the band about the HIV prior to the Live Aid concert in July, 1985. I am not sure that happened that soon prior to his 1991 death. It does make the story more dramatic.When I watched this film, the music hooked me immediately, but the story took it's time developing. So I was sort of thinking of A Star Is Born, another powerhouse music film for this year. Then the story took hold after the early part about the forming of Queen. This film put that story together with Freddie joining the band in 1970, briefly.The film becomes powerful when it hooks the viewer on Mercury and his complex life from his relationship to Mary Austin to his admitting their relationship is more complex because he is a bisexual. The film stays above most of Mercuries Drug Use except for alcohol and focus is more on his relationships with everyone close to him. This is told more powerully and hooked me into the film.The breaking up of Mercury's life is more powerful than a fictional soap opera. It brings tears to many viewers and for good reason. The film builds up to the classic 'July, 1985' Live Aid performance and that is recreated powerfully in this movie. While the cast is not well known, there are plenty of good performances and Mercury role is acted very well. Mary Austin is acted well too. So are the support roles.While the great music would make this a good movie regardless, the acting making it better than a good movie. Check out this film, it is very well done.",9,4,5,14 November 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Good Morning A Better Film Than Often Thought
","At the time this movie was released, most viewers went to it expecting a straight comedy film because Robin Williams was a star on the hit sit-com Mork & Minday. The viewers were surprised because this movie accomplished more than that, & because of this got mixed reviews. It wasn't fair.The story is based upon the real life experience a DJ & what he did when he went to do armed forces radio in Vietnam. The accuracy of the tale gets lost because of the Hollywood Treatment but when you look at this film, it is very successful on an entertainment level, and the film is well made.Robin Williams comedy in this is very good. The surprise at that time is how solid his acting is. He is able to mix comedy and drama here in a very profound way considering this is one of his earlier films. Hollywood really has not served the memories of the Vietnam war accurately on any level so it is not a surprise that exists here.While great directors have made great films addressing Vietnam, there is a haze that still exists over their efforts because Vietnam & the reason for being there is especially now looking back, a mystery. It did serve one major change in the United States which has changed history.Vietnam more than anything else ended the compulsory military draft in the United States so far. That draft was a form of slavery Abe Lincoln had to invoke in order to win the civil war. It was never questioned until Vietnam. This movie doesn't really show why that happened, but it does try to tell the real story of someone who actually went to Vietnam & tried to make a difference.",8,2,3,26 December 2009
Justice League," Film Does Not Aim High Enough To Be Great Entertainment
","With a whole bunch of writers working on this script, you'd expect more plot and actors getting great lines than you receive. Visually, the 2 hour film is stunning. The costumes, effects, and visuals are exciting. The filming locations in Iceland, the UK and USA are well chosen.The plot actually does continue the Batman Versus Superman story line. There are moments here which can be very pleasing, and could have been more than they are. It is really subtle where they went wrong, as this type of material is an 8 rating the way Marvel does it. So why does D.C . fall short? That is a multi-million dollar question.Ben Affleck Batman / Bruce Wayne has quite a bit of talking, but no-memorable lines. Henry Cavill Superman / Clark Kent has even less lines and his parents home almost getting repossessed by the bank illustrates perfectly what the script gives him. Amy Adams Lois Lane gets the bulk of the romantic work smooching Clark Kent, but she is given little else by this script. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman/ Diana Prince is given more script than the rest and she is very enjoyable on screen. I am in awe of how some of those really tight clothes hug her figure (no groping please). Ezra Miller's Flash/Barry Allen gets a few moments of good script, but not enough. This is not the worst 2 hours I've seen, but should have been better considering the resources. If you go, stick around for the credits, because here, like Marvel, there are some interesting teasers as to what DC is working on. I am hopeful that they check out the Marvel series and raise the bar on their scripts.",6,0,0,26 November 2017
Man of Steel," Welcome To The Planet
","I walked into the theater knowing the plot for this re-boot of the Superman franchise. I sat through 30 minutes of previews for other new movies. Then I saw science fiction action mixed with the Superman saga. Does it win with viewers? This week-end should tell the story.This version takes itself way too seriously. When I followed it through it does. This movie reboot takes Superman 1 And Superman 2 from the Christopher Reeves series and combines them into one big screen action film. It reflects today's audience in that it is so wrapped with action that it moves though all the action in a busy and intense time. It does twist around the story in some new and interesting ways. It brings in the rival (Zod) and all the characters in a speedy way. It does so smoothly, and there is enough sci-fi action it in to remind me of District 9. If there is a problem here, it is that the actors do not get a lot of script. This pace is depth is perfect for this generation of movie viewers. This movie explains Superman better than earlier versions in some ways. Russell Crowe is no Marlon Brando but then he does not need to be. The film keeps a sort of mystery around Superman's motivation. It creates a conflict within himself and his true identity which goes beyond the original story as told before.Superman fans should be happy with this effort and Sci-Fi Fans might find a few surprise kicks here as well.",5,2,6,16 June 2013
Grease," Broadway Musical Makes It Big With Disco Sounds
","John Travolta, & Olivia Newton-John dominate this film. Everyone else is just a bit player though kudos to Eve Arden who has a nice cameo here even though she was getting pretty long in the tooth when this was made. There are some others who do nice support, but it is clear from the beginning who the big man & woman on campus are in this one.There is a little bit of a side plot about losing virginity which was really a mild plot for 1979. The rest of the film & the main plot is that John & Olivia are in love. If you realize this before watching the film, your better off. There is no rocket science in this movie.This film is a transformation film though. It has elements of the big musicals of the past & the start of the transition to the 1980's style musical. Past musicals have big stages & production numbers. This movie has that. 1980's Musicals have a feel good, put your brain away feeling & light plot. This movie has that too.The disco beat dominates the sound track with Franki Vali warbling the closing theme in dominate fashion. The disco makes sense as Travolta had done Saturday Night Fever shortly before this one. The photography & staging are crisp. The film is the right length that the performance don't get bogged down. Even Travoltas voice is OK doing the songs (unless that is lip sync-hing). This is by far the biggest of the 27 films Randal Kleiser has directed even though he also did Big Top Pee Wee.This is a put your brain away for something light on a Saturday afternoon type of film.",7,0,1,7 March 2008
The Caine Mutiny," Bogart Breaks Acting Mold
","This film is entirely out of the mold on Bogies role. He would only do a few films after this but when you watch this one, you have to think he took this movie simply because it is not his typical role. Captain Queig is new to Bogart.Bogie has no women & shows no desire for any in this movie. He is in character as a dysfunctional Captain. The story is put together very well as it doesn't hurry it's pace. It develops all the characters at a slow & steady pace.There are a lot of name actors playing this this but in spite of the strong support they provide & the fact that Bogart is only 3 short years from death, he still carries the lead role very well.The story itself is total fiction & almost certainly inspired by the classic 'Mutiny on the Bounty.' It is a very strong film & very much worth a look if you have not seen this. The action sequences are not the major part of this, the acting & drama are.",8,0,2,21 August 2007
21," Winner Winner, Thinner Dinner
","This film has a youthful enthusiasm which is infectious and a young cast that pulls off the infection. It is done Hollywood Flashback style in that it starts after everything happens, goes to back to how it happens and then ends by going back to the beginning.Overall, sadly, it obviously spent a lot of money in production but tries to simplify things a bit too much. While it is entertaining, it is much too simplified to interest the serious gambler. The appeal here is in telling the story in a light mood, interesting a young audience, and entertaining it. In that sense it succeeds though not on quite the stylish ease that a movie like 'The Sting' did. Of course that one was a best picture. This one is not.AS I have not read the novel, I am not sure what liberties were taken from the true story but my feeling is that the true story here is a better tale than the movie one. That being said, as I put my brain away & look for light fare, this one fills the bill quite nicely. Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast do quite fine in going through a not too serious treatment.I have seen worse, & better films than this one.",6,3,4,23 June 2009
The Revenant," Classic Great Drama Outdoors
","This is a well thought out and produced movie. It has some great scenic vistas and the surround sound matches the scenery. Think of Jack London's Call of the Wild here, though this film is so much more.The cast does great in this film, though I honestly think because of the way the script is structured and the outdoor scenes are so well done, the actors are really not as important here. The drama and the script are, and it is all superb.The story line is followed well and the action sequences are all really well done. Particularly the bear mauling the main character is amazingly portrayed. I do wonder how faithful to the book it is as I have not read this one yet. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, his best role yet. The film is set in French Canadian Northern Territory, though the time of it might actually be during the French and Indian war. The exact time is not important as is really not made clear, as a great drama is not about when but is about the action.There is some French spoken which makes for subtitles and some sub- titles for the Native American spoken by the Native Americans as well. The main speaking in English in the film is done by the guy who would be classified as the bad guy in this. There is only one woman, a Native American, in the main cast and she is superb as well.This film is getting deserved nominations and wins in the Awards Categories, and at least there is a minority in this film. The scenic vistas and sound should win some awards too. Very enjoyable dramatic effort by everyone involved. There is some R Rated materials and some depictions of life in the wild that are pretty raw as a warning for viewers who do not like that. That material is not the central theme here. Very good film, indeed.",8,0,2,18 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Surprise This is Not A Comedy
","Now that Obama, a modern political Jackie Robinson has been re-elected, there should be more business for this movie. The Jackie Robinson ego and legend for Barack Obama has already been decided in Washington.When Clint Eastwood appeared at the RNC doing his empty chair comedy routine, I really thought it was a promotion for this new movie. I could not have been more wrong. This movie is a well done Baseball drama, with just a bit of humor sprinkled in.The plot while being a bit predictable is easy to follow and you kind of suspect the ending. Overall though, this is a very good film. Eastwood plays the old scout just perfectly. One thing is there is no solution done for the vision problem Eastwood has. We are left hanging on that item as it is forgotten at the end.Eastwood and Amy Adams do the father-daughter act very well. The storyline has Clint losing his wife when his daughter is 6 years old. This creates a dysfunctional family relationship which is realistically portrayed in the plot by the actors. The real surprise here is Justin Timberlake. While his role is clearly support, he shows some real acting skill. While he is no Eastwood yet, there looks like from judging this one that Timberlake has made the right move here as he shines in his role.Some very good support in this as John Goodman, one of the most under rated actors in movies is solid in a very good supporting cast. The movie does drag a bit in parts, but at least it does not stop, it just slows down like Eastwood has at this age.Eastwood is a Baseball Scout, Amy Adams is his daughter and an attorney. John Goodman is the General Manager of the Braves. Timberlake is a scout for the Red Sox. While the results here are not something new and unique, they are solid entertainment.",8,1,6,23 September 2012
Bridge of Spies," Dramatic Wheelhouse of The Cold War
","There are theories that the Francis Gary Powers shoot down by USSR had something to do with JFK's eventual death. This movie stays away from that and instead the focus is on how the US made a deal to get Powers back. Based on a true story this movie tries to recreate the drama behind all these events.It does so without sinking to the depths of action sequences which director Spielberg often directs. He is proving to be a capable drama director as Lincoln proved that just a short time ago. Somehow he brought the Coen's in to write this drama along with Matt Charman. The result is a quite functional drama replete with the feeling of the cold war.The history lesson here is of value and this film is done totally from the US perspective. This makes sense as the other side was not consulted on this one. The film might even be a little too careful on how it is presented. Tom Hanks is always good though in this film there is not a lot of character development other than Hanks and the Russian Spy (Mark Rylance) Rudolph Abel who is excellent. Hanks wife gets little bits of stuff but not much and even Hank's assistant Doug - Billy Magnussen gets but one or two scenes. This film is a 2 figure drama, and the main draw back is while they explain how great this accomplishment was, there is very little of why the reasons the negotiations were so successful. This is a timely reminder about a Cold War which is now often forgotten, now that there are hot wars going in several countries today.This is when diplomacy was practiced and refined so as to achieve positive results. It is solid and well done.",8,3,4,20 February 2016
Cold Mountain," Major Disappointment
","The 4 I give this is because there is some good camera work & photography in this. The problem is too much license was taken from realism with the story. The sex sequences are absurd considering the historic era the film was staged in (the Civil War). Nicole Kidman isn't even given enough script to work with but there is no surprise with this considering the writers could not even get the history right.Anyone somewhat knowing of the era would consider some of the out door sequences to be absurd. Things are done which are totally out of context or totally out of sequence.The scenery is the films strong point, the rest of it is a pretty lame effort. The film tries to make up for script weakness with scenery and length but the extra length does not really help either. Think a better script was deserved by all those involved.",4,4,9,13 October 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Talented Cast- Weak Script
","The cast is very talented in this film. Every cast member makes a lot of good things happen to carry this one on screen. It is interesting that a talented cast performing very well has made this into an over-rated film. As for script, it could be better. While it makes sense with the ending beauty pageant, a lot of loose ends from the beginning of the movie don't quite fit.There is a major continuity problem with the VW Bus which has to be pushed to be start after the first part of the movie. At one point later when the bus does start & leaves our little girl(Abigail Breslin) at the gas station, the van inexplicably starts & takes off without needing a push. Did the van starter suddenly work because she is being forgotten at the gas station? Alan Arkin steals this film as Grandpa while he is alive. He is a center of the storyline too. He deserved the Award for this film, no doubt. Fine work from the veteran actor.The cast makes the film go. The script actually borrows some material from the original 'National Lampoon's Vacation' & uses it to get laughs & an Oscar for best 'original' screenplay. In fact, a lot of the material in this script has been done before. This script has very little originality. Guess stealing a plot from a 1980's comedy & changing the action to a little girl's beauty pageant is now Oscar winning material? If you really think so, Finding Forester which plagiarizes script from other films out to interest you.The DVD has 3 alternate endings, none of which seems very exciting or an improvement over the original ending. This is one of those hot nominated films that got Oscar recognition, but years later when you watch it again, you will wonder why? It was the most over rated film of 2006.",5,1,11,20 January 2007
North by Northwest," Cropdusting 101 & Intrigue With Mistaken Identity
","This film is the most famous of all of Alfred Hitchcocks work & is the one that more people remember Cary Grant for now. When Alfred made this film, he had learned everything about playing the audience through a vast experience in films, plus his TV show. It shows in this one. It is wonderfully paced, imaginative, provocative, & suspenseful all at the same time. The imagination used to design this film, from using the UN Building for a murder scene to Mount Rushmore for scenery and suspense, to the barest flat farmland in the Mid-west, & then making a surprise happen at every location is just amazing. Hitchcock did a fun trailer for this movie that plays like a travel agent promo.The plot is Grant (Thornhill) being mistaken for an imaginary spy fits perfect & the cast is perfect. James Mason is an excellent actor and performs very well as the heavy in this film. Eva Marie Saint is a hot double agent being asked to sacrifice all for her country. She lends an air of class to the proceedings. Martin Landau is fine supporting the bad guys. Leo G Carroll is excellent in support as a top US intelligence man known as the Professor who seems to be pulling all the strings.I am not sure how this thriller could be any better & I pray no one will ever try to remake this one. Hitchcock has been copy proof as the attempts at redoing Psycho have proved. Unfortunately, I am afraid someone will try to attempt other films he did. I just pray this isn't one of them. If they do, Hitch should rise out of his grave & shoot them!",10,0,0,6 September 2006
The Shining," Disturbing As King Yet With Kubricks Flair
","In a way, Stanley Kubricks 16 films all represent a package of cinema art that will seldom be equaled by many film makers in a lifetime of work. This film does a credible job bringing master writer Stephen Kings novel into a film.Though a lot of folks find this very disturbing, I find it is not quite as disturbing to me as Clockwork Orange which is the ultimate disturbing work from Kubrick on film. Still, this one does a pretty good job of being almost as horrible.This film is one of many now where Jack Nicolson provides a fine performance. No doubt that this film is the best film on Shelly Duvals resume, as this is by far her best role and the best film she has ever done.Kubrick always seems to be trying to top himself with each film he ever made, and always seems to find a different direction to go in. Kubrick not only often makes the view think or feel what he want them to feel, but he often plays his audience like a fine musician plays their audience.",9,0,0,10 December 2008
Wanted," Another Summer Action Film
","The writer of Kingsmen is involved in this but this one is over the top on CGI effects and the plot is nowhere near the quality of the Kingsmen series. I can't believe it deserves a sequel, b ut there are plans announced. Maybe the next one will be better?Morgan Freeman is not usually associated with action movies but fits into this one. His latest stint in the much better The Dark Knight proves this film is not as strong. The Dark Knight proves that while the action in this is good, it walks while the Dark Knight sprints to the finish line.The plot- spoiler- is about a Guardian group which has operating for 1000 years assassinating people according to orders from a mysterious source higher up. This is enough to hold together the excitement. This film has lots of action scenes.Wesley is enlisted into the group early in the movie after having been told his father has been killed. It breaks him out of a dull humdrum office account manager job & into the exciting world of being beaten up & killing people.He dumps his younger chick girlfriend for older tattooed woman Angela Jolie but that's OK as the young one doesn't really seem interested in him but is plenty interested in his friends.Overall the action in this is top notch though you wonder with the car crash sequences how much the gasoline would cost to do them now as i imagine gas was cheaper when this was filmed. The cast is OK but there have now been too many summer action films the last few years. There is a major plot twist for Wesley late in the film, but I will leave that to you viewers to find out what that is. One good thing is the plot makes sense even though some of the circumstances are a stretch that sometimes seems a go a little too far.This film is OK, a good flick for drive-in theaters which would fight to see which has more action- the movies or the back seats? There are a few major mature language bursts but not that many. There are a few stimulating simulated sex scenes involving the younger chick & Wesleys best friend, but they are so brief that is nothing major.",5,0,4,3 July 2008
Salt," Salt Means Action
","It is interesting that Angelina Jolie who is about as attractive as a woman can be is totally an action hero in this one. They aim here is to make her a female James Bond. While the action is no doubt at 007 level, when you cut out the sex part of Bond you lose something. I mean, physically it is more possible for a woman to do bedroom exercises than it is the male. Instead we get Evelyn Salt whose ready to kill and watch her husband be killed, all for her own purpose or cause. The movie keeps you guessing where salt is going to wind up. It is well filmed with a reduction of blue screens because Jolie is not afraid of heights and is more than willing to dangle 12 stories up. This is great and gives the movie more of a real action look. But darn it, I'd want to see some guys score and female Bond (Salt) and that just isn't addressed at all.Salt's name is named after the Nixon/Carter etc Missile treaties with Russia which this movie does have a cold war type of theme that even brings the Middle East into it. The question is will the sequels be Salt 2, Salt 3 etc, or are there going to be any sequels?",5,1,4,17 May 2011
Duck Soup," Close To Perfect
","Interesting how so many critics over the years have thought this film has an anti-war message & that is why it failed at the box office in 1933. The film is not really anti-war, it is more anti-everything. Nothing stands in the way of great comedy in this film. It is more anti stuffed shirt than anything.This film is the nearly perfect blend of physical comedy & verbal comedy. It crackles with both, & highlights everything the Brothers felt strongly against. Groucho is the perfect Rufus T Firefly, President of the country of Freedonia. Harpo is Paul Revere at one point & Chico is a spy. There is only one Marx Brother movie that could be a bit better- Horsefeathers. This one has the classic mirror routine.",9,1,2,9 March 2007
The Battle of Algiers," Blueprint For the United States Future?
","Usually, films in foreign language with sub-titles are not something I'd watch. I am sure glad I watched this one. The film is based upon a true story.The story is of the French trying to hold on to their colony in Algeria in the late 1950's & early 1960's. The French keep trying the entire film to stomp out resistance in Algeria. It had been their colony for 130 years.Once the seed of independence is planted, no matter what the French do, their cost in troops & civilian deaths & destruction keep getting higher & higher. Considering the French have already paid a heavy price in Vietnam during this same period of history, you can understand in the end why they lost this one later. The French finally consider the cost of fighting this Algerian Independence movement too high. The scenes of torture in the film are so realistic & the scenes of violence & riots in the streets are so real, that you think the film makers were using real news reel footage in this film. It is amazingly, all staged.A lot of the parallel issues are here with our current dilemmas with Iraq, Afghanistan, & Kosovo. We are considering that these costs are too high to bear in our media. The mistake here is that the reasons are different. It is our medias hate of the current President that is fueling this hate. We are not attempting to make colonies here like the French were in Algiers. Still, this film does bring us into some interesting parallel issues. It is well worth viewing & an extremely well made film.",9,0,1,23 February 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Mystery/Drama Blended
","Rooney Mara is great in the role of the girl. Daniel Craig proves beyond a doubt he is more than the cookie cutter James Bond. David Fincher brings The Social Network direction experience to a different type of story. Granted I have not read the books, or seen the Sweden Version.This is a solid movie and since it is it runs long telling the story. There are twists, turns, dark alleys, blood, rape, explosions but yet the majority of the film is drama/mystery. The movie does what it is supposed to do, pull in the viewer and make them wonder what is happening next.That is what a well told story that is well acted and direction is supposed to do. It succeeds on all levels and presents some brutal sequences and throws a lot of seedy characters around making the viewer wonder what is going to happen next. Leaves open a sequel at the end and seems like it would be very possible as to my view, there is more about the tattoo girl to explore. That is the reason it is not a perfect movie.This one does a good job following the book, and watching it a second and third time makes it better, sign of a great movie.",9,2,7,2 January 2012
Dreamgirls," Fantastic
","This movie is the best picture of 2006. The Academy has blown it again as it wasn't even nominated in that category. Musical films don't get better than this.As for performances, Eddie Murphy is fantastic in this movie. It is his best role in many years of films & he shows excellent range & sings well to. Danny Glover is excellent too.As for the Dream Girls- Jennifer Hudson is great. Beyonce is very good also. In fact, none of the women have anything to be ashamed of. The musical performances in the film get better with each one & the finale even tops all the previous songs.The story is perhaps a parallel to the Supremes but there are enough differences to tell you they are not the same. In fact, the story line is well written & plays out very well. The film has a great pace.This is an even better Musical Film than Rent was a few years ago. After seeing this, I can't believe it is not up for best picture, & can only lead me to one question - Is the Academy racist? There is no good reason this film wasn't nominated.Once you see it, you will know I mean it, a flat out great film. Hopefully the academy will give it some acting & music awards, but they missed the boat on the award it truly deserves- best picture of 2006 - without any doubt.",10,1,2,24 February 2007
Dunkirk," Seriously Disappointing
","Considering that Christopher Nolan wrote Inception and that was a technical masterpiece and an intelligent script, this film is a major let down from that movie. I like the concept of retelling one of the most major rescues in the history of civilization, but it could have been much better than this one. There are a few problems with the film I saw, and some of them are major technical flaws.I liked the telling of he same events from different eyes. What I did not care for was the sudden jolts from daytime scenes to night scenes which did not make any sense in telling the story that happened during the first 3/4's of the film. Somehow, day should have been day and night should have been night. Take that and the going from Spitfires in the air in daylight straight to night sequences, and the continuity of the film becomes wrecked for me as a viewer. Then there is the sequence of the men getting into the beached ship to wait for the tide to come in. There is almost no logic in this one. Hiding inside a ship waiting like sitting ducks is just not logical. When the ship starts getting used for target practice and they just stay in the boat like sitting ducks is just plain stupid. The sequence is even less logical than the long sequence inside the tank in the WW2 film FURY done a few short years ago.There is little story in this as the director (Nolan) has very little dialogue in the first half of the film. While the film as a whole does make the history clear of the desperation of the situation, and the rescue, it could have been done much more spectacularly with the advent of CGI. The number of private ships actually shown coming into Dunkirk to rescue 300,000 troops is much too small. Without CGI, The Longest Day many years ago did a better job of creating an armada on screen than this film does.The air combat scenes are great, but I am kind of curious why prop planes, Spitfire pilots, needed to wear oxygen masks on their faces? Most of the time these planes did not fly as high as jet fighters where such masks would be needed. Maybe it is to help the film maker here not allow the audience to get attached to any cast member. That goal this film certainly accomplishes. There are few women in the cast though Miranda Nolan, Christopher Nolans Cousin does make another appearance in his work, her 10th film role, as a nurse.The main emotion displayed throughout the film is the patriotic cheering of people on the ground who seem to be able to see what is going on better than the film viewers. There is a lot of cheering for an army withdrawal of defeated soldiers just desperate to escape. With the exception of the opening sequence, most of the battle scenes are on the ocean. The Nazi Germans are almost invisible the entire film except for the German fighter and bomber planes in the air. There is a lot of action drama here, and at the end the rescued are riding on a train and reading Churchill's most famous speech in the newspaper. 'We shall never surrender.' Considering the genius Nolan has shown in his other films, this one does not measure up on all the levels I have pointed out and more. Even the true Historian should be let down on how this one was told. The film has many technical flaws and needed to have a consultant to get the technical stuff right, but now that World War 2 is more than 70 years in our rear-view mirror, nearly 75 years since Dunkirk, those kind of people just are not around anymore.I wish this film would have matched the advertising and hype, but if this truly the best film this summer, Hollywood is not having a good year at all. The emotions this film try to stir come up hollow.",5,10,21,26 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Diaz Beats A Lazer Wash On A Hot Day
","I waited for the DVD on this one and have only watched the 'UnRated' version. While this movie is definitely not for the kiddies, it is a funny film with spots of irony in the plot. I am sure on a nice sunny day that Diaz not only beats the Lazer Wash, but gets the car drier better too. My car never gets really dry at the Lazer.Diaz plays a movie suitably bad teacher(Ms. Halsey). While she is not as scary as the real ones who make the news, she is indeed a bad teacher. It starts showing her gold digging days, but she is not a smart gold digger. She lets her rich boyfriend know how bad she is spending his dough before the pre-nup.Meanwhile, she has just finished her first year of teaching, and when the relationship breaks, she has to return for another round at school. The second year does not start any better, but then as she settles in more it gets even worse. That is because her co-workers get to know her better than year one, and find out she really is bad, especially Ms. Punch who plays the obsessed Amy Squirrel to a tee. It doesn't hurt that Ms. Squirrel and Ms. Halsey are both after the same teacher Scott (Timberlake). After losing the rich boyfriend, Halsey decides she needs to get $10,000 to build really big breasts on her frame in order to get another rich boyfriend. Halsey is not in touch with reality here as her breasts were not the problem with the first break up. There are some moments in the film where Halsey actually helps some of her students in this version. The film has quite a few funny moments and follows a plot through. I've seen much worse Comedy efforts than this one. I will not spoil it but the ending is more to my liking than I thought it would be. In spite of Diaz washing my car, for some reason I want to make it with a squirrel. Maybe I'd better say that so you know where I am coming from.",7,2,4,26 December 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," HIV Saga
","It has been a long time since I was first made aware of HIV AIDS and the excellent musical RENT. The story here is made to feel real by compelling performances by the cast, especially late in the film. .This does go back to the early era of aids when at first there were more questions than answers. The correct fact is that the early drugs were presented often by the media as miracle cures by the media. The fact is there is still no real cure even now.This film creates a fictional hero that would have been a great person if he had actually really existed. It feels like he did because of the script writing and powerful script ending. Strong performances hammer this point home There is a footnote in the credits that any existence to a real person is a coincidence. As time passes the reminder that this is still here is more important and the hope that the could still be a cure. Even at the end though, it comes out that a full cure still is elusive.",7,0,1,19 July 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Tricky Dick Gets Into The Comics
","President Richard Nixon is back as this is set in 1973. The cast is loaded with talent. The special effects are well done. The script involves time travel. What more can an X-Men Movie be? It is hard for me to say I need to say more, so let's just say we are in agreement that no amount of time travel or CHI can put any hairs on Patrick Stewart's head. The old cue ball does hold his own with quite a talented cast. It appears the film makers had some good fun making this Marvel Comic Flick. Stan Lee still on the crew and a cameo in this, is one of the reasons it is so well done.Marvel and Stan Lee, more fun than it should be legal to film.The women look great too. The Blue woman thinks No one wants to look at her, but I could look at her lots. The form fitting costume is a major plus.Comics often create characters that are larger than life. In this one - mission accomplished. Just sit back and enjoy the show.",8,0,1,29 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Battle of The Avenger Stars
","In a first for me, a credited actor in the movie is not here on IMDb, so let me give them credit here in a small supporting role, but one that gets your attention - Stan Lee. By the time anyone reads this, he might be there, but as I write this, he is not credited.As for the film, there is so much script setting up this nearly 3 hour film, the first half has only small spots of action. In this case, I think the writers thought a lot of set up was needed because there are so many Avengers in the movie. I really feel it bogs this one down a bit. John Slattery, formerly of Mad Men, has a small role in this one, less noticeable than Stan Lee. The humor in this one in sporadic, and while there are some good laughs in the latter stages, it is strange that most of them are in the action sequences. The first half or more of the film is almost too dramatic for a Marvel film. The film actually brings in the United Nations after an action opener that makes the viewer think the whole film is going to be action. Spoiler- no it is not. Appropriately, some of the best jokes in the movie come late in the film including a great one delivered by Stan Lee. I will not spoil that here except to say Lee's role itself is a great inside joke.Even though the film is long, I did enjoy a lot of the small stuff in it. Ant Man and Spiderman are fun, and I like Tony Stark's comment about a young Spiderman's Aunt May, played by Marissa Tomei. This Aunt May is the best looking one I have ever seen.The plot uses the UN and the Avengers to divide themselves up against the bad guys and themselves. While the plot holds together, there are times all the infighting seems pointless. The blowing up of a UN building really seems pointless as there is not a real clear reason for it to be done, though it is explained it is to get the Avengers to fight each other. There is a question about a 1991 mission report that is referred to throughout most of the film, which serves in the plot as well as a couple of flashback sequences. It does a promo for an upcoming MARVEL film at the end, and George Costanza does not show up to date Aunt May in the movie. Would have been a nice touch though.",7,1,5,6 May 2016
Pearl Harbor," Realism Missing - Gee Whiz
","This film has some golly gee newer special effects but it is hampered by a young cast of unknowns with very little script to work with. While there is a lot of fancy production evident, there is almost no realism.If you really want to see the attack done correctly, watch TORA! TORA! TORA! which is the film to compare this one with directly. Once you do that, you realize how poorly this film is done. I think that this was the wrong producer, wrong director, wrong cast, wrong script & wrong everything that merged to make this film a disaster.They tried to remake TITANIC here, & people had wised up by now. This movie is a poor attempt to redo that romance story line & it does not even attempt to evoke any of the sympathy that film did with the romance.If you want to see this film done right, don't waste you time with this movie. Considering this was now 65 years ago, do not watch this one to honor it.",2,1,3,7 December 2006
Tropic Thunder," Vietnam gets treated to a revisit by UFOs
","Ben Stillers effort at making a comedy about Vietnam is OK. It is a noble effort at moving comedy to a different dimension. Bringing Unidentified flying actors (UFA's) into the Vietnam War is kind of the basis of this film.The film opens with apparent previews of other movies done by the luminaries of the cast. Then it kicks straight into the Tropic Thunder movie set in Vietnam. In typical Hollywood fashion, the set is over budget and out of control. The movie then veers in the same direction.At 107 minutes, it is in the ideal length range of a comedy film. The difference is that there are moments where action dominates the comedy. There are moments where drama is attempted, With a cast like Jack Black, Nick Nolte & Robert Downey Jr along with Stiller, the film seems more comfortable doing funny stuff than drama.Luckily Stiller realizes this and leans more towards the humor. This movie is OK but would be better if it stuck even more to humor. Jack Black only gets a few sequences.",7,3,9,29 August 2008
The Duchess," Excessive Lives Pay A Price
","I knew Keira Knightly from the Pirates films of Johnny Depp. This movie proves she is an excellent actress. Based upon a true story of British excess, this film is very well made. It is a joint production effort of BBC, Paramount, & some independent film companies.The location sets in Britain are fantastic. The costumes are so good they won awards. When you include a very good dramatic script and fine acting by the entire cast, this film is destined to be considered a great drama.The story shows very much how being in the upper class during the late 1700's into the early 1800's had a price to pay. The Duchess gets married on the advice of a controlling mother, not for love, but for status. This marriage is not a union that is made in heaven. Her husbands entire purpose for her is to get a male heir. Their huge mansion winds up with a large family before the male heir is finally delivered.The Duchess, finds love but not with her husband. She finds it with a woman who then finds love with her husband, & then finds it with a man, a politician whose aim is to be Prime Minister. In order to retain her status, she puts up with her husband having numerous affairs. Then in order to not lose her own children, she has to drop the Prime Minister after producing a daughter of his.This movie is for the drama fan, and it is full of drama. It shows the definite drawbacks to royal living as the Duchess gives up personal happiness for her entire life in order to keep her public persona. A tragedy really and very well presented one at that.",8,3,5,17 February 2010
Flashdance," What A Feeling
","This is the kind of movie where everything is a prelude to the climatic  sequence with the 'Oh, What A Feeling'. Jennifer Beals is cast as the  main star of only her second film. The rest of the cast is a group of  little known support players. Biels is the star and this remains her  best film.  The climatic sequence is the main draw to this film. The viewer forgets  almost everything else in the film once you see it. I say almost  because the most often published photo graph of Beals pulling that long  shirt over her buff 20 year young body does get a lot of attention & is  memorable to be sure. That photo was used to sell tickets.  This very much early 80's period piece is an OK movie with a great  song. It is not a classic film but if this were your blind date, you'd  enjoy the date but unless forced too, you might fore-go a second one.",5,5,10,11 March 2008
Avengers: Endgame," Excellent Might Understate This Marvel Film
","Everybody is here, Stan Lee even gets one more cameo. What is interesting is the storytelling and pacing.
While the film is over 3 hours, it really does not seem that long. The opening sequences are not like a typical film of this genre. It starts with a family outing where someone is trying to put mayo on hot dogs. That is the first thing that is amiss.
The film does follow up the previous one in the series. It does not fall into the trap of just reversing the defeat. It slowly goes along developing the process of how to do it, and then twists things into another dimension.
It works magnificently.
This film leaves the mold and yet finishes with a predictable ending, but not the way you'd expect. The real magic is making over 3 hours go by quickly, but the laboring is worth it.
To tell a story well, and develop the characters properly, this film is like a great feast, and the preparations are so complete, that I can only say 'Well Done'.
It would have been easy to lose the viewer with a plot that jumps around in time, but here you can follow time despite that.
It would have been easy to make the ending too violent. Here, it is done just right.
It would have been easy to get too emotional, or not emotional enough. Even that trap is not fallen into. Even the Fox runs well in this one. A must for Marvel fans, and a great end game for Stan Lee.",9,4,10,28 April 2019
Dirty Dancing," Proto Type For 1980's Musical
","Jerry Orbach, Patrick Swayzee, & a few others do pretty well with this movie. The soundtrack is terrific especially digging out old gems like Big Girls Don't Cry by Frankie Valli & Wipe Out by the Safaris. The story itself is a typical 80's musical harmless plot. Can baby keep her virginity while learning to dance from the hot dirty dance teacher? The best part of this film is the fact it gives the viewer an early 60's feel for the suburbs outside of New York City. It is quite notable that it does this as this feel is what gets this film to a 7 in my analysis. Not a real serious film but a film which reflects the early 60's well. It has plenty going for it & is the best of a terrible decade of Musicals known as the 1980's. This looks like a masterpiece when you compare it to 1980's Popeye. At least in this movie, I am what I am.",7,0,0,7 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," First Bond Sequel - Might Be Last One
","After the great Casino Royale script, this film is quite a let down. Part of that has to do with Mark Forester as directing only his 7th film. While he attempts to redefine the action of Bond in this more active sequel for Royale, his action sequences are often rough and choppy. There are several noticeable times in the movie where it seems everything just stops and then restarts after a jump in time (and sequence).While two of the writers wrote this and Casino Royale, it is quite obvious that the script is not as strong here as in the last film. Action dominates this one and really it pulls this down in quality compared with Craig's first outing. The last one had more Ian Fleming in the writing.There is a 35 year reminder of Goldfinger with a femme fa-tale killing of a woman coated with Oil instead of Gold, supposedly symbolic of the world oil shortage going on today. The action while hard and fast throughout the film just isn't quite up to other Bond films in the series.Daniel Craig at 5 feet 10 inches is shorter than many Bonds which means he sees more eye to ey with more women than previous Bonds. There is less sex in this film than others in the series too. This film at less than 2 hours is one of the shortest films of the entire series.The opening sequence is a car chase in which Bond brings villain in to M. Then M and Bond find out there is a secret organization which is inside of every agency including the British Secret Service. It is this organization Bond pursues the rest of the film including getting even with the guy who killed his girl in Casino Royale.There will almost certainly be another Bond film, which could sequel this opened ended effort of trying to eliminate the Quantum. Hopefully the next film will offer a better story and more realistic stunt sequences instead of the choppy ones this film has.",6,3,4,23 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," BlockBuster Before Filming Began
","This movie was so anticipated that as soon as people started reading Margaret Mitchell's book, they clamored for a movie. The story of Selznick putting this together is one of legend. Sadly, the film hampered his later career as whenever Selznick was asked for advice after this movie, he's always answer by saying 'when we were doing GWTW..' and then not listen to any ideas other than his own.Clark Gable is no doubt a great actor, & so perfect as Rhett Butler that you'd shudder putting anyone else in the role. The same can be said for everyone pretty much in the movie. It's simply amazing how 3 directors & teams worked at putting this thing together.At the time, folks thought it should have been 2 movies. I'd argue that it could have been. I'd end the first with Rhett kissing Scarlett by the bridge after their escape from Atlanta, on his way to join the Confederate Army. That way the second film would open in stark contrast to part 1, with a wrecked Tara & 12 Oaks. The second part would still be longer than the first, but each would stand on their own.I used to kid people that there is a common cast member between this film & the Wizard of Oz, that Victor Fleming borrowed the 'horse of a different color' from the Emerald City to help Rhett & Scarlett escape from Atlanta. Regardless, it is amazing that Fleming got full credit for both movies, yet had lots of help on each one.What really is true is that 1939 is one of the greatest movie years ever for Hollywood under the old studio system. I am not sure if the in pending war had anything to do with this, but Gone With The Wind was at the head of some of the greatest work in film history, in the greatest year of film history.Paulette Goddard, Charlie Chaplins second wife, who was considered the runner up to playing Scarlett, kept busy working on The Cat & The Canary & The Women with George Cukor that year. I believe she could have brought off Scarlett, but considering the other work she was doing then & in 1940 with The Ghost Breakers & The Great Dictator, it might be for the best that she missed this film. Besides, Vivian Leigh's Scarlett is one for the ages.This film is one for the ages, & I am thankful for the restoration of the film on the latest DVD versions. This film will always be important because in reality, it is the first sound/Technicolor blockbuster film of all time.",8,3,6,26 January 2007
No Country for Old Men," Dark Novel, Even Darker Screen Play & Film- Jason Lives
","There are often times when a dark novel becomes a screen play & a film and the latter do not remain faithful to the novel. This is one of those occasions.There is some great acting by Tommy Lee Jones & several of the cast members. Some of the West Texas Scenery & settings are breath taking. The trouble is this film degrades in another (warning spoiler) new version of Jason going on a needless/meaningless killing spree. This means a new version of s slasher film just won best picture last year, & Hollywood thinks this exercise is intellectual. Oscar blew this one, as it is well produced, splendidly acted trash.The Coens got a big reputation with earlier films like Fargo. This film is no where near that one. There are 3 main characters who keep looking for and missing each other throughout the film. Upon further review, it appears what is tried for in this film is irony. The ending is done for intellectual effect but it makes no sense. Tommy Lee Jones cop should have been smart enough to be at the widows house to meet this version of Jason. It does show some parallels between this version and the folks in pursuit of him.After viewing this, I'd read the novel before looking at it again. The film has an open ended finish that makes no sense (or for sequels like Jason?). If you like guns, blood, & senseless maniac violence this is a film for you.If you want smart intellect, watch Fargo. There are few fine moments in this, but this is not a Best Picture that will be remembered 30 years from now. It is a slasher film which won best picture. That is indeed amazing.",2,2,5,3 May 2008
District 9," Prawns Are Everywhere In This Realistic Sci-Fi Effort
","After seeing Sharlto Copley in the new Sci-Fi Film District 9, would highly recommend this movie to people who want to see a new well done film. I mention Sharlto Copley because his role is so central to this film that he basically carries the entire film. It is a great performance in any context.Neil Blomkamp writes & directs this film and it is quite an effort. The film very much starts off as a documentary type of film with Sharlto Copley at the center going into the story of how an alien ship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. It then goes through how humans invade the ship and move the aliens out of it and onto a colony known as District 9. The visuals are so realistic that you'd swear this is the real thing.The documentary part of the film then smoothly transfers into 2 stories- one involving Sharlto Copley's character getting exposed to alien matter and evolving into an alien, & the other involving a couple of the aliens trying to manufacture fuel so they can leave & go home. There is a cover story for the film as well about the South African effort to relocate the alien colony into District 10.The film is not done as a typical sci-fi film in that it is gritty and really feels like it is depicting real events. The film always sticks with the base cover story and leaves a wide open door for a sequel. It will be interesting to see if they do one since the main line related to this is 'I will be back in 3 years'.The film is excellent at drawing characters & stories from different points of view together & relating all of them. In fact the documentary part of this film is done so well that it actually feels like better reporting than the real media can actually do. There are also some other stories & commentary I have not brought into this review. This film has a depth rarely seen in the Sci-Fi film genre.",10,1,3,8 September 2009
Batman Begins," This is not a Redo & Fits Well as Prequel to other Batman Films
","This film does not redo the previous Batman films which have been made in the last 20 years. In a sense, this is a prequel to them as it tells the story from childhood until adulthood. It introduces Bruce Waynes parents and illustrates where the bat obsession comes from.The special effects are very well done and Michael Caine is excellent as Alfred the Butler. Other supporting players including the man at Wayne Enterprises department which houses all the technology provide excellent support. This film does not make the mistake of glorifying the criminal that is often made in telling Batman stories. I think this trap gets fallen into often because that is what the 1960's TV series does consistently.For once the criminals are not larger than life and this benefits the telling of the Batman story. While the film does run long, it does not seem as long while you watch it as it is. Rooting for BATMAN is easy and because a good story dominates with plenty of action, the film does not get sidetracked by the girlfriend & love either. There is a female to be interested in, but Batman seems more real in the Bruce Wayne role of becoming the Caped Crusader by not having a girl to tie up his every minute.Even the police get a better rap in this film. Often Batman films make them look like complete bumblers, but in this one they are actually somewhat capable, though somewhat misguided in their enforcement of justice. The more serious tone of this saga is welcome.",8,0,1,30 June 2005
Liar Liar," The Truth is not in Order
",This movie is very much and example of a Jim Carrey film where Carrey runs rough shod over the script and puts on a one man comedy show. The results of this is very funny. The thing is it is one of many films that establishes Carey as a sort of Jerry Lewis for this generation. His manic comedy is very much like Lewis was in his prime.Carrey has a lot of energy here as a Lawyer who has to tell the truth for 24 hours due to his sons wish. There is some Lewis type schmaltz in his sympathy for the kiddies. In a way Carrey came along at the right time because his manic humor can include adult themes more in the 1990's where Jerry Lewis was more limited by censors what he could do.This gives Carrey's Comedy more bite than Lewis could have in his movies. For example he can tell a woman she has big... where Lewis would just be able to mug a va va voom in his movies. Carrey is very funny when he does his stuff. That is the main reason to,6,1,2,23 February 2013
Bridesmaids," Not Quite The Movie I Expected
","I'd like to say I am totally thrilled with this movie simply because it tries to be funny. Along with that I like Kristen Wiig who is not just obviously the star and one of the main writers here, but pretty much the center of the film. In that way, the title makes perfect sense.There is a whole wedding party here but in this one, the bride takes second to the maid of honor Wiig. The story seems to center more around Wiig's character being totally unhappy and failing in everything she does for more than half the movie. While much of the film is very predictable, the humor in it sometimes comes off well, and sometimes falls flat.Still with Kristen and the other ladies to look at, it is not all bad. Wiig gets in physical comedy starting early with the first romp with a guy. From there are several attempts at sight comedy. What to me is lacking to make the movie great is some sharp verbal comedy. While I like looking at Wiig being physical, it takes more than that to make me happy.So I come away from this one with mixed feelings. I think the ladies might like this somewhat better as a chick flick but I feel even they might be a little disappointed. There is some pretty decent music here.From what I see, this is Jill Clayburgh's last movie being released. Sadly she died in 2010 and in this one she is clearly in support. She only has a few scenes and is not a real factor in the film much.The Unrated Version has some more gags in it that make it a little different a flavor than the theater including a little boy swallowing a Birth Control Pill. That actually comes off a little better than some of the theater release gags.",Null,0,0,29 September 2011
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Great Fun
","There is a lot to enjoy in this one. There is a huge cast, some really impressive sets and there is some excellent tung-in-cheek humor. The humor is subtle enough that some patrons might miss it. There is humorist art works. Ralph Finnes carries a lot of this one as the narrator and main character. He has lots of capable support.Saoirse Ronan is perfect as the woman who is Zero's girl friend yet she has very little interaction with him. There is no doubt she is active and needs action but her support shines in this movie.It is said this is a murder mystery within a Comedy. I think it is the other way around, the comedy has the mystery within it. The looks are lavish, the plot ridiculous. Even the prison sequences are short and brisk. Reality is more fantasy in this one, based on an author's works which if they resemble any reality at all would take a vivid imagination. The old hotel has a character brought to life with spirit and a solid cast. With Bill Murray and Jeff Golblum in support too.",8,0,4,29 March 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Difficult To Sequel A Classic
","This movie proves how difficult it is to sequel a classic. The plot is really simple to understand. The is yet another island with more dinosaurs which has gone totally into out of control chaos. The movies final message of 'Let's Leave Them Alone,' is interesting as the way modern man always thinks they control everything, an admission that this situation is beyond man's control is rare in cinema now days.Trouble with this film is that while it completes the themes from the original King Kong that were not touched on in the original film, it gets too long & the story is lackluster. Spielburg also becomes predictable as even the action sequences look alike when compared with the first time around.The only thing original is the shots of a dinosaur going past a swimming pool which is a neat visual effect. That's not enough, as this one sold a lot of tickets because of the first film, not because of it's own merits.",5,2,5,29 April 2007
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Apes Are Back
","The original Apes films were the movies which kept FOX studios in business. They were made on the cheap and made enough money to get the studio going until Star Wars Episode 4 blockbuster came along and saved FOX. These films were based on evolution and man's only faults destroying himself and allowing the apes to take over. This reboot of the series heads in a different direction. Instead of a war destroying man in this one, the issue is to appeal to the aging baby boomer's. A company is trying to find a cure to Alzheimers in order to help people. Then the drugs are tried doing an experiment on apes. An accidental side effect is that the drugs seem to raise the apes intelligence.This is a different idea and FOX actually has more money now so they can upgrade the special effects and change things around. This might work, as the second film is in theaters now. Will be interesting to see if the followup can be effective.This film borrows a lot of the classic dialog from the original series. I think it turns out OK, though it would be even better if they could really discover a cure for old age diseases. That might be asking more than the film makers can deliver, but it would really boost the appeal to revisiting the planet of the apes.",7,3,7,19 July 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," So Much To See, So Little Time
","When you think of Marvel World, the whole world is fighting here. When you look at the film, yes, it is all fighting. The evil side even has more than 1 bad guy. One thing you have to say about Marvel versus DC though, the bad ones in the DC world have bigger egos that the Marvel ones. This can only mean 1 thing, the heros with the bigger egos squash the bigger ego bad guys at the box office.It's true here again. The Universe is a big place and a large portion of it is brought into the war this time. All in all, it's a great show. There are contributions from several countries, and lots of action. Because of the size of the battle you come to fully expect being set up for the next one. And, yes, we are set up.The humor here more understated than other Marvel films. There is some to be sure, and this movie lacks for it. When there's a massive war, something has got to give. The film has so much going on that character development is assumed from people watching the other Marvel Films. No time for characters here, just lots of action.",7,2,7,28 April 2018
Gone Girl," Two Perfectionists Do Not Add Up Except to Horror
","A lot of people might not understand the plot and sub-plot of this movie. First, 2 flawed people who view each other as perfect get married, and then both are let down when they find out they are not perfect. Once they find that out, they each look for horrible ways to get out of what they did. They then apply that let down to each other and everyone around them.The levels of torture do get absurd and go beyond what can be imagined.The second plot is a major condemnation of the main stream media. Unfortunately that is right on target. There are murders which are always convicting people in the main stream media before a trial. This is why lots of people stay out of politics. That and you have to lie in politics and blame what you do on somebody else. Between that and doing everything corporations want you to do, politics have become a dirty business. They always have been without term limits which feed on the dirt an corruption.Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, and Neil Patrick Harris do a credible job trying to bring card board characters to life. This has to be fiction, but it has been approached in real life. There is a case that has gone through many trials where a man's wife disappeared on 09/11 and even though there was just an acquittal, there is going to be another trial. There is no body in this one that can be found and all the man's friends and neighbors and media had him convicted before the first of now many trials.I would not recommend this movie for Mr. Harris, he has already lived it and is continuing to live it. The main plot here is not as absurd as the viewer might imagine, and the media reaction is spot on.",6,1,4,25 May 2015
The Theory of Everything," Title is Deceptive
","This movie is half a film. It goes into the relationships and simple picture of Dr. Hawking's amazing life. It does not go into the inspiration behind how bright the man was. Hawkings life is in many ways a miracle. That is pictured in this script. When I got done watching it, the film reminded me of many Hollywood dramas. It drew a picture of how Dr. Hawking related to the people in his life. It left out what inspired him. That makes the film sadly lacking.The cast does a fine job of acting and makes it a decent drama but I feel that somehow, the personal relationships spelled out in this film are like the relationships done in 1950's movies. They are deep emotionally but surrounded by real life card board. I would call for a remake that actually tells the story of what inspired the theory of everything. That is not present in this film.",5,4,6,5 January 2016
Peaceful Warrior," Different Type of Socrates
","'You can take your car to the man who wears the star,' gets a new definition in this movie. Nick Nolte, usually an action movie star, becomes a full service garage mechanic who goes beyond checking under the hood to putting a dip stick into the mind.This film has a main character, Millman, who thinks he is indestructible and it is his fate to win an Olympic Gold Medal. Instead he becomes a student to a Texaco man? Sounds kind of strange only because it is.Millman's character is a conceited athlete whose personal life is even more conceited. Instead of seeking help from his team, his coach, & his parents, Socrates (Nolte) takes over. The acting is decent enough, but this movie is a bit long & tries too hard to make you think.The opening of the film, one of the most cheesy computer graphic leg shattering I have ever seen put on film. Considering the weak start, the film gets better though it promotes the urban legend of athletes being great in physical relationships.It can inspire someone to overcome obstacles- the main message I found.",6,0,2,10 March 2011
Room," Emotion Carries This Drama
","I have seen some great dramas and this one rates good on my scale. I imagine the book is much better than the film because the story picks up in this one at the end of 7 years of being stuck living in one room. While references are made in slight bits about how the ordeal for Ma and Jack started, there is very little done to explain how this could have happened for so long. Granted, that is not important to the dramatic part of this film, but it does make the film a leap that might explain why -Old Nick when he does lose Jack just takes off. I really thought he might do something more desperate like go back and harm Ma before the police free her from the room. When I looked at this, the hook is the relationship between Ma and her son Jack. Brie Larson as Ma & Jacob Tremblay (Jack) are outstanding in their roles. Their relationship is key to this drama working. Ma's entire world is being kidnapped when she was 17, raped by old Nick (Sean Bridgers), having a son and then wrapping her entire life on bringing up her son in one room with Old Nick being the jailer and provider for them both. It is an out of whack world which Jack can only see through a skylight for 7 years. Ma totally protects Jack from Old Nick like a mother in the wild protects their young. She teaches him to read, and they do get exposure to the outside world via a television set. Finally, Ma uses her son to finally escape from the room. Then this film goes into the raw emotions and reactions of shock as she and Jack get exposed to the outside world.Many times, Jack is narrating the story as it goes along. Jacob Tremblay's performance is outstanding in all aspects here. Brie Larson is very good but it is the child's view which really carries this film to make the viewer care. It is the emotion which made me interested in the film. It is not a perfect film, but it does pull the viewer in.",7,1,3,22 May 2016
I Am Legend," Certainly This Omega Man Remake Falls Flat
","Much of this movie is a one man (Will Smith) & one dog (Samantha) show. While Will Smith does a terrific job acting which is why I give this a point, and the dog is terrific too, the script has many problems. There is a long list of production goofs already noted here on IMDb in addition to the script problems.The story, while logical is an extreme leap of faith. How do you explain Smith alone being able to set up the entire lab complex & defenses when there is no time or logic in what is set up before the virus strikes the city? The defenses are set up like he knew what he needed to do ahead of time & logically, that would be impossible in real life.How does Anna & the boy, when they finally arrive late in the film, get into a destroyed New York City when all the bridges have been destroyed coming into Manhatten? Even more incredible, how does she get back out after wards? It is not shown because it can't be explained logically.I like Will Smith so watching this film is not a chore as he does a fine job. The flashback technique to his wife & kids deaths is done is 3 clips & it is very predictable what is about to happen to them with the chopper from the outset of the first one. The story might have worked better to have gone through the crash first instead of flashing back 3 times.Any health expert would tell you the biggest problem with the story. If NYC were really quarantined, no one would be allowed to leave because allowing anyone to leave would spread a deadly virus no matter what tests you did on the people leaving. This makes the entire premise of the film a major leap of faith. It's been a long time since I saw Charlton Heston in OMEGA MAN but that film did a better job script wise of handling reality. Even Omega Man has some problems. No one has done really well adapting this book to film yet. While Smith is terrific, I wish he'd have gotten a better script to work with. This film & Omega Man are based upon the 1954 novel I Am Legend. Neither film gets things completely right.Will Smith was upset when the film started shooting as there was not a script. There is no doubt that is true when viewing this film.",2,1,2,23 March 2008
School of Rock," Rock On
","When you see this one, you have to set aside any possibility of reality being in the story to enjoy the film. Once you do that, you can enjoy the events on screen. If you can't do this, you might as well stop watching the film.This is like a theater tour DE fore for Jack Black. While he has capable support, the films basic focus is on Jack's character. If you like Jack Black, this is his best recent film to watch, The film is mostly very funny with Jack Black getting involved in a lot of funny situations.The story is a modern fairy tale, nice guy a little down when the film starts gets the inspiration to survive. How he survives is what is funny yet almost scary. It does inspire, & Jack Black is the reason.",7,0,0,25 May 2007
Kick-Ass," Changing The Rules of Super Heros
","Kick-Ass is a super hero, but not a super hero. This sounds a little crazy but this is a teen age kid who buys a suit on line, procures a couple of Iron Bars & then gets his ass kicked. For most of the film, the hero is the mirror image of the films title other than the first real film action sequence.While Kick-Ass is living his dream of Peter Parker style of life, he gets involved with a girl he loves. Meanwhile he meets Big Daddy & Hit Girl who both are focused on destroying a crime boss that helped big daddy get sent to jail & killed his wife. For about a third of the film these two heroes carry the load for Kick-Ass. Then towards the end, Kick-Ass really does get involved in the action.This is Marvel Comics material carefully brought to film. While it does not flesh out as much story as Spiderman at times, it brings together some plot lines. The oldest actor in the film is Nicolas Cage & he is quite good as Big Daddy.In the end they get mob boss that big daddy wants to get because he harmed his family. This film is not quite as strong plot wise as Spidermen, but the Marvel Folks left this open for a sequel at the end of the movie.",8,1,4,15 October 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," Cast, Script & Locations Carry Film
","This film was shot in France, Morocco, Utah and Pinewood Studios,UK. It does very realistically create the atmosphere of Asia which is where Kiplings story which is the basis of the script is set. It is a well done production.There are not many films where Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer are together. This film really benefits from all of them being here. The Kipling story of the land in East Afghanistan where no outsider has been since Alexander The Great is an interesting premise.The main weakness of the film is that Allied Artists who made it were on the verge of bankruptcy. In places that lack of money in the production shows very plainly. There are a few sequences which do not meld together well either and some special effects short cuts that are obvious.Still, the 3 pillars of the film that are strong carry the day. Connery and Caine play off each other quite well and the comic element written into the screen adaptation make the movie a good one. It is one of Alied Artists last film productions and it is rumored that the bankruptcy took any salary away from Connery and Caine and neither of them got paid for their work. If that legend is true, this might be some of the best free acting ever put on the screen.",8,0,2,29 February 2012
Coyote Ugly," Good Idea Hollywoodized
","This film is based upon a true story based upon a bar in NYC. Too bad they had to Hollywoodize the main character. It comes off in total more like a female version of the male bar movie Cocktail. The main female lead character role seems like she was based upon a real person, but then her phobia seems to be manipulated in order to pull in the viewer. This manipulation insults the viewer and treads too far from the main story.The main story here should be the bar. There are times when the bar almost takes over. If it had, instead of having a contrived story based upon truth, the story would have rang more true and been a much better film. It could have been closer to televisions CHEERS where ultimately, the bar always was the focus.The things to watch for are the women who are good looking, and a solid workman like performance from John Goodman. There is half a chick flick here as young chicks might enjoy this though older woman sleep through it. The music is good including the talented LeeAnn Rhymes. This helps it avoid being awful, but there is no real classic material in this one.",2,4,8,11 August 2008
Gran Torino," Eastwood Tells Hollywood How To Make Our Movies Punks
","The movie is what movies are all about which means excellent storytelling. It is hard to believe that a story so well told has a screen writer with only a few films to his credit and a story teller who Gran Torino is his first writing credit. The writing is very much ahead of the experience of these folks and with Eastwood Acting, Producing & Directing, this film might just be his best triple crown accomplishment.At 78 years young, Eastwood does not look the same on screen as Dirty Harry did, but he is every bit the professional actor fully matured. This film flows on the screen in a way only a few films made today do.It begins with Walt Kowolosky (Eastwood) at the church at his wife's funeral. Then it goes on to show his missing relationship with his family. The focus then goes to the neighbors who are a different race and culture but grow to accept Walt for who he is and what he does. Walt is a Korean vet & retired autoworker who helped assemble his Gran Torino, his pride & joy in the film.The story is very well told as the family next door fills in the void from Walts wife & the detached sons his life has become. It is the last American living in an inner city neighborhood & how he comes to cope with being alone. Walt is plainly ill coughing up blood in the film.My spoiler is that in a way, this masterpiece of Eastwoods has very much the same type of theme as John Wayne's last film, The Shootist. Where Wayne chose to go out much the Western Hero in a blaze of glory, Eastwood chooses in this film to go out loved by his neighbors for what he did, but still very much the man with no name, only now he has a name to the neighbors while the family has missed it all. Is this the way Clint has chosen to finish his career? To me, this is going out on top.",10,2,7,17 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Taunt Iraq War Drama
","This film did win a best picture Oscar. I think it won because the best film that year was District 9 but since that is Sci-Fi, it could not be the first film of that genre to win the award. As for the over-hyped Avatar, it was too political to win.This film was perfect for a bunch of reasons. First is that it tells a good story of the danger of being an American soldier in combat. It draws three extremely well placed actors in solid roles and defines them in a well constructed story. The locations look great and the filming is very well done. The situations feel right.While some folks might feel this film is political, it really is not. Granted it is set in 2004 Iraq but the politics are kept to a minimum and do not get in the way of the story. Thus the film avoids the biggest problem with Avatar. This film sticks with it's knitting.The only weakness I see in the film has to do with how the troops spend the off hours as the punching amongst themselves seems a little extreme. The other addition is that there are too many people around the bombs being found. I think that civilians would be smarter and stay away from possible blast zones in reality. Here, everybody is a tourist.While this is the second best I saw in the year it was Best Picture (District 9 is better in my opinion), it is still a very good film. I think too many people thought this film was something beyond what it is. Yes, it tells a very good dramatic story. That really is all it does. For the Academy, that was enough.",8,1,3,1 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A Better Tale With Less Sparrow, More Humor
","This one seems to have realized one thing that makes a good film, it has a better script than some of the previous sequels. It also has the largest cast as now we have several characters doing flashbacks and current characters. The story line is more complex characterizations, but the plot is easier to follow.Now, with some Rum for sure, Jack Sparrow is indeed here in spirit. One thing different is Jack is used more as a punching bag as more often than not someone is trying to kill him. He even compliments the French until he finds out it might kill him.The humor here is sharper than other episodes. There is no Davy Jones here which is okay as his make up in previous films sometimes makes me think of Ja Ja Bings, as far as the way their character was developed in the previous installments. I think that unlike Ja Ja Davy will return. Hopefully they will have better make up.Meanwhile, the development of a next generation to replace the old guard appears to be in progress here. Let's just say that the sons and daughters of a lot of the main characters from the first 3 films are now appearing here. The film is a lot of fun. Most of the humor is of the type that adults will find funny, while young kids might miss it entirely.Sparrow does seem to get more humor lines here which is a throwback to the first film. I enjoyed the film, and while it is a notch below the first one, the return of the Black Pearl to the seas is a good endeavor with plenty of action to enjoy.",7,1,6,27 May 2017
Back to the Future Part III," Clint Eastwood is a no good yellow coward
","While this final installment of the film series does not have quite the kick of the first film, it does tie things together in a nice bow. In order to enjoy these films, your senses of time and of flight have to be a little strange anyhow.Mary SturgenBerger heads a fine cast of support in moving the series into the old west. Even Pat Buttrum shows up in a limited support role. The film is still carried by Christopher Lloyd & Michael J Fox but they are supported by a solid cast and a storyline which makes use of every talent in the film. It is a credit to Clint Eastwood that he is secure enough in his life to allow his name to be used for some tung in cheek humor here. A film sequence of Eastwoods shows up in Part 2 so it is entirely logical for him to show up here including the reuse of the sequence in the second film in this movie. The effects people go to town here working on the railroad. The opening sequence at the 1950's style drive in theater is a clever setting too. Visually this film is very well done. This film is the longest in the series and almost gets too long, but it has to be to develop a story which supposedly ends this saga once and for all.It does leave one opening, a story with Doc Browns time traveling kids. Some clever use of naming them after a science fiction author leaves open a plot line using them as a basis. I doubt that they intend to do such a film.",7,0,0,22 December 2007
Patton," Portrait of a Complex Yet Simple Leader
","The main strength of this film is George C. Scott giving the performance that defined his career. Scott is Patton throughout this film. Karl Malden is excellent in support as Omar Bradley. One of the strengths of this film is how it gets to the inside of the man Patton in total. This comes from the book 'A Soldiers Story' which was written by Omar Bradley & the retired General also served as a consultant for this film. This is in a way why this film is great, besides Scott, is that Bradley brings out the surprises of Patton, not just the man the public knew. There is something magnetic about a general who is desperate to be a hero despite being wealthy, a leader whose knowledge of the past is eerie enough to provide his beliefs in reincarnation. While Patton was not a 'womanizer' as other Generals in World War 2 (like Ike) were, he is leading a full life in the present to go with the life he has led before throughout history. This makes for a compelling, complex portrait which goes beyond how a real man is presented in film in most cases. This film is very much a canvas portrait of George Patton which not only looks like a masterpiece, but give the viewer a glimpse at the oil base that makes up the painting. It is run on television often because it is so good. If you have not seen it, you should. If you have, it still holds something enthralling enough that like a great masterpiece, seeing it again can give you something more. The battle sequences were shot in Spain & are very well produced. The character study of Patton, the man & the General is so accurate, many vets blinked when they saw the film. Hollywood rarely gets something so right.",9,3,6,18 September 2006
The Illusionist," Tricky How An Illusion Is Confused with Magic
","This movie has the unfortunate luck of being released the same time as The Prestige. It often gets confused with that film and it should not. This film in my opinion is just as good, and is different from the other film which makes this comparison a bit phony. A dark film using locations in the Czech Republic effectively as a back ground, magic is not really the subject here much. Illusion is more of the subject. A forbidden love between children of different classes finally gets started when after the kids are broken up because their families are of different classes, not unusual in 19th century Europe. About half way through the film, after they reunite adults, she is murdered.Edward Norton is brilliant as Eisenheim, the Illusionist whose act is beyond magic. Paul Giamatti is great as Inspector Uhl, the detective who has to cover up Jessica Biel Sophie's death for political reasons. Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold is the reason for the cover-up, in position to become King until his Sophie, his Dutchess to become Princess, is murdered.This film is a look at lost love, murder, obsession, and Illusion and is done as well as any story I have seen filmed. The illusion at the end is worth being around for. Or perhaps is it real? The film leaves it to the viewer to decide. No narrator here, the characters and events carry the story well enough to make a narrator unneeded.",8,1,1,28 November 2017
Hidden Figures," NASA & Women Can Be Proud of This Story & More
","This is a very good movie. Even better is there is factual basis for the story of the early NASA space program. Is it entirely factual? Not totally, but close enough. There are a few things changed by the screen writers, the true story speaks for itself- 'Hidden Figures is based off of the nonfiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, written by historian Margot Lee Shetterly. Shetterly's book is fantastically well- researched, walking readers through the social and political world in which Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson lived, and telling a detailed narrative of their lives and the work they accomplished.'The males in the story ironically are the ones where reality is stretched. Kevin Costner and Jim Parsons characters are scripted different from the real people. That is done for more effective dramatic effect. The positive messages from the film do reverberate. 'From now on there are only one color of people at NASA.' Great message which I wish would infect more people. John Glenn's - ' Get the girl to do it. I want this human computer to check the output of the electronic computer, and if she says they're good, you know, I'm good to go as part of one of my pre- flight checklists,' might just be the most amazing real story. It exposes that a computer is only as good as what the programmer has put into it. When new data first becomes known, the computer can not possibly put it out until it is in there. This is why computer projections still get proved wrong all the time.This is a great example of how team work was needed to get this country going on JFK's 'New Frontier'. While the story has happened before in history it can never be illustrated better than it is here.As for it happening prior, before World War 2, a company named EA Link developed and manufactured flight simulators to train many of the pilots who flew in the war for the Allies. A lessor known group of 7 Women who worked at Link were known as their 'Flight Simulator Ladies' who helped build these essential training devices. Their stories have been sort of lost to history. While this NASA story is accurately recorded in this film, the parallels of importance in both groups of women are important.Women were the first programmers of ENIAC, the first Computer ever built. There were 8 women, now all deceased who did this too. That was made into another movie.Hollywood is catching up making films about women's contributions in history. It is a good thing women took action before waiting to become famous by leading the way in these and other important events in history.",8,0,4,27 November 2017
1917," Based Upon An Embellished WW1 Vet Story
","Right at the beginning of the credits, the story is kind of explained because there is a WW1 vet mentioned as the source of the tale. The Director Sam Mendes wrote this movie with a woman who has the hottest looking pictures on IMDB for a writer. While she has written other movies and TV, this is Sam's first movie writing. The film is technically great but this explains a bit about why the story is a bit like Paul Bunyon, a General relying on 2 people to take important orders to the front lines army charging into a trap.This story is the reverse of Saving Private Ryan, instead of trying to make rescue a family member, this story sends both brothers into harms way.Story wise it is written for maximum dramatic effect. It accomplishes that. The direction by the director of Skyfall (one of the better Bond films in recent years) is quite capable. The story rarely bogs down and the film moves along pretty well. The actors could have done better if the story had been based upon a real story. Instead we get a toned down version of a vets embellished story which does not all the actors to really develop their roles.Considering the 2 guys in a hurry with the General's urgent orders, their detour into the bowels of the abandoned German trench and rat triggering the trip wire explosion makes little sense. The life saving is the reason for it, dramatic, but should not have been needed. Embellishing one character to make it more dramatic is the accomplishment.As much as the story is off, the film looks good and packs a dramatic power. That and the visual looks get me to rate it okay. So far this expensive film is a loser at the box office. Unless there are some scenes cut from the film to fill in the glaring gaps in character development, it's unlikely this film will break even until it hits DVD, maybe. There were 5 of us in the theater for an evening show.",7,0,0,20 February 2020
Lincoln," This One is for the Ages
","It is altogether fitting that this film is playing to packed theaters this very special Thanksgiving Day. A film dealing with Lincoln, a leader killed in the 19th Century in a loss to the United States that took away a leader who had saved the country. That is because this November 22nd marks 49 years since the United States lost another leader in the 20th Century who was the last leader who had a great vision for what this country could have been- John F Kennedy. The difference is that in the 20th Century we lost the leader too soon to ever realize their vision. Lincoln's loss was after he achieved it.This movies main theme deals with Lincoln achieving his vision, a Union with free men, not slaves. A country of peace for the United States did achieve a time of peace after the Civil War. Ironically that peace would not last into the 20th Century. The end of slavery is what did. It did take until the 20th Century during John F Kennedy's short Presidency that Martin Luther King would vocalize Lincoln's true vision when he made the 'I Have A Dream' speech.Politics aside, this film is a land mark for Steven Spielberg. He achieves something daring for the first time in his career, a mature themed historic drama. He pulls this off magnificently. He has a lot of help. The portrayal of Lincoln is top notch. The cast performs at a very high level. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of his life. From what I have seen and read about Lincoln, his performance is spot on with that. Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, and 87 years young Hal Holbrook are just amazing in support. Amazingly the script makes you feel like you know Lincoln and understand the politics. The thing that makes this special for Spielberg is how he uses visual story telling with camera angles that remind me of Alfred Hitchcock in the later stages of the film. The scenes at the Hospital Lincoln visits, and especially the departure of Lincoln for the last time from the White House for Fords Theater illustrate the maturing of Spielberg as a Director. These visuals have rarely been seen in films and for this Director these sequences are 2 of the best he has ever filmed. It gives me hope that young filmmakers today will study these scenes and start doing more visual story telling like this film. These scenes raise the bar for Spielberg and he should use them to teach his students how he achieved them.There are great script dialog like the conversations between the Lincolns bring their characters to life. the imagery of Tad on his dads lap. The shattering image of Tad in a theater hearing his father is dead. Fine film making to be sure as it conveys a human realism into the story.The script is crafted in a way to remind us how dirty politics are and show us how corrupt a system and a country even Lincoln had to deal with. In a way the 13th Amendment is the main subject of the film, but that amendments star is Abe Lincoln. That is why this movie is correctly titled. It portrays too how smart Lincoln was as a negotiator. He faced more than any leader in US History yet.",9,2,11,22 November 2012
Kelly's Heroes," Really Weird But a Good Long Weird
","Even though the battle sequences in this movie are well done, you have to remember this is a real tung-in-cheek WW 2 film. Donald Sutherland & Don Rickles balance off with Clint Eastwood to create a unique type of war film. Carol O'Conner plays a General for laughs in this too. Telly Savalas is along too.There were some major disagreements with how this film was shot & what wound up on the cutting room floor compared to what appears in the film. The disagreement was so vast that Eastwood decided after this film to start his own production company. It would be interesting if the cuts could be found & the film redone with them to see what Eastwood actually wanted in this film that was cut. The story has to do with Kelly's Heroes finding out about a bank behind German Lines filled with Gold. They decide to go into the war business for themselves & start their own invasion behind German lines with the gold as their objective.With characters like Oddball & Crapgame, the humor is there. For this type of film, it runs longer then you'd expect because of the elaborate Battle sequences. Those scenes are an indication that this film was shot to be something even more than it is. Just the same, it is quite entertaining.",7,0,1,3 March 2007
Children of Men," Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
","In order to more appreciate this movie, it is worth it to pick up the DVD which has extras that explain the movie & then watch it on a home theater sound system. With this in mind, once you understand what the film makers were trying to do here, you appreciate their effort. There is a documentary condemning Globalization & Capitalism on this DVD titled The Possibility of Hope.What this film successfully does is it takes our world and freezes it in 2010, but moves forward to 2027 and shows the chaos that is coming with Globalization. The Acronym used here in the US for Globalization is Free Trade. The old saying is that nothing in life is free. This film (and the authors book) attempt to explain that cost and how they see it effecting the earth. Alfonso Cuaron directing is very capable.Michael Caine proves his acting skills yet again playing an overage hippie in this one. A far stretch from Alfred on the Batman movies, but very well done. The theater sound is nice to have as the movie uses several Rolling Stones compositions to set the mood in this film. They are new recordings by different artists but the songs they use are chosen very well and fit in brilliantly.Clive Owen as the main character, trying to protect the only pregnant woman on earth is brilliant and Julianne Moore is good too. The cast excels in their roles despite all the technical stuff thrown in. This is the last days of the human race done in high style & concept.The film is well done & to me a unique & all too rare verdict on the cost of the globalization of the planet. It is done without preaching & paints a world in chaos in a subdued tone. Brilliantly done is the hyperbole, but this film lives up to that premise.The sound track while subtle correctly sets the tone of this movie which depicts a dreary future for man. If there is a drawback, you need to see the extras on the DVD in order to completed understand what the film makers are doing.",8,2,12,14 June 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Acting & Production Top Notch- Story Not
","This film may have been the best picture of last year according to the awards people, but last year was not a great film year. There have been better years & better best pictures. Clint Eastwood has become a master of timing releasing his pictures just in time to be considered for Oscars. Qudos to the acting & production qualities of this film. The ending would cause me to have 3 hankies except for the fact that the script does not generate enough emotion for me to care about the characters enough. Something is missing in that Hillary Duff's character does not reach me enough in this script to make me care about what happens to her.The best comparison to make to this film is the classic film ROCKY. In that film, your pulled in because you can relate to the underdog a lot and in his humanity. You really care about Rocky. While Duff's performance is top notch, the script does not rise to the level of ROCKY in that it really does not achieve the same emotional attachment to her. Will the soon to be released Rocky sequel rise above this film? It could & still not get best picture as the original already has won it. Million Dollar Baby has already been forgotten since 2004 by a lot of viewers in the same way that many will never know Cleveland won the 2000 Super Bowl(?)(For the history buff- the St. Louis Rams were originally the Cleveland Rams when they won their first Championship in 1945.) The films ending comes off as flat and predictable because of the script. This film is above average in camera work, direction, & acting, but the weakness of the script to me is the main thing that stops it from being a great film. You could tell Duff's character was going to have a tragic end almost at the beginning of the film, which is why the viewer can't get emotionally involved.",1,1,6,10 August 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Fine Film - Surprising Fact Mixed with only a bit of fiction
","You can see the great pains this film took to tell a story about the most important moment in media journalism in this country, and then the unfortunate consequences of that moment. Edward R. Murrow achieved greatness by using the truth to bring down Joe McCarthy. Murrow used Joe against himself. He did it with honestly & integrity, which sadly were missing from media journalism almost since this happened. The film shows the hard work behind getting the truth & the pains involved in telling the truth. It shows that truth does not get rewarded in this type of work. It proves how hard truth is to get. The acting is perfect, the telling of the tale is perfect though a bit static, definitely not for the action picture crowd. The ending surprised me in how well it tells to truth. This will spoil it for you but at the end of all this, William Paley, head of CBS, calls Murrow into his office with the ultimate good news-bad news agenda. The good news is Ed that you show is now going to be an hour instead of 30 minutes. The bad news is, your show is moving from prime time to Sunday afternoons, effectively killing your show. This shows how much power & influence government & corporations already had on the media in 1954. Murrow later quit CBS in disgust before he died. It proves that the media has not been accurate since then. To prove this, a quote from Dan Rather in the 1960's on seeing the home movie of John Kennedy being killed - 'Kennedy jerked forward when he was shot in the head.' Rather was the only pool media reporter allowed to see that film, and when he filed one of his journals just before he retired from the CBS EVENING NEWS- he aired it again, word for word. For a film which can make you think, Good Luck, because the media will never ever get back to 1954, to telling the truth the way Murrow had the guts to do.",8,1,1,14 May 2006
Mulholland Drive," Over Analyze This
","Without Alfred Hitchcock around, thrillers like this one are few and far between. This movie will not age well, because since 2001 rotary telephones and regular phones are gone, replaced by cell phones. This move predates home computers it seems. Therefore, even though the film is past 2000, it must be set in a time prior to 2000.To me, the entire film is a dream. There are way too many things which can not be reality. We have Betty (Naomi Watts) moving into her Aunts apartment and finding Rita/Camilla (Laura Harring) naked in her shower without the water running. Betty then gets word that Rita (name based on a Gilda poster (film starring Rita Hayworth) does not belong there. This is the biggest hole in this plot, as any normal person would call the police at this point. Instead, Betty decides to tell her this but decides she wants to learn more about Rita who is nearly naked and hurting. Things that get lost in the shuffle include the car accident that Rita got hurt in and her serious wounds which mysteriously vanish without any real medical care. From here the suspense builds as scene after scene are not predictable and sometimes do not make any sense. In the last half of the film, Betty starts reliving the same scenes she lived in the first half but with slight changes.The mystery theater which appears in the second half of the film and the casting call by the cowboy create a strange sort of suspense. As the rotations happened during the last half of the film, you have to be able to remember the first half sequences and note the subtle changes in the latter sequences. That is the only way this movie makes any sense.This is the kind of movie that makes you think, but is it the perfect film? Hardly, though it does make you think how dreams can alter reality which is the purpose of all the twists and turns. This is a film that you note things and then in the end note how things change as the dream changes. The cast carries this off well and in the case of David Lynch, this is by far his best film.",7,0,0,24 April 2016
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Novel Approach To Serious Subject
","Boyne's novel shows the fact that Boyne, born in 1971, is writing about a subject he can not understand because he did not live it. This film reflects the novel in that in comes off as a children's movie and not just because of the acting of Asa. This is a children's view of the Holocast totally in the way it is presented.At slightly over 90 minutes, I am glad that I have looked at the DVD of this film. The DVD features several scenes cut from the final film. At least 2 of those scenes should be put back into the film to make the film better. This is a case where the film editor went a little too far & there is no reason to shorten the movie this much. Adding a couple of these scenes would improve the film, particularly one sequence which has Asa & his sister looking out the back window of their new home at the internment camp in the distance. It is a conversation that needs to be back in this film.What reflects the book is that the adults are presented with the view made popular as a defense at the Nuremburg Trials, that they were naive or just following orders. The fact is that any German who read Mein Kampt knew the final solution. What this film is excellent at is bringing this story to a kids level.The trouble is it loses the adult level in the process. As an adult, you feel manipulated & I could see the ending coming a mile away. While it is emotional but unless your a child, there is no surprise here. It leaves the adult level of the film rather empty.The location shooting in Eastern Europe and the camera work are excellent, but without an adult level, I could only find half a film here. Trouble is it is shot too complex to be a children's film, & at way too low a level to be a serious adult film. It is a shame as this film could be so much more.",5,2,4,16 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Jedi Master Yoda We Do Hear From
","There are two things that are worth seeing this for long term Star Wars fans (since 1975-76), over 40 years. Top two on my list -* Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia's last scene together. While it is brief, it does have the emotion I expected. It is even more powerful because of Carrie Fishers real life death. * The renewal scene of Luke Skywalker and Master Yoda. Frank Oz does give voice to Yoda again and once again, though brief, the long term fan should really appreciate this reunion too.The film has the special effects and John Williams music that we expected, rousing to the ears. Seeing it in 3D as I did is okay, though I think it plays well even without that. There is some of the trade mark humor in the film, more of it is later in the movie. Laura Dern makes an interesting commander. There is a bonus romance that is underplayed, but okay. Other reunions of Skywalker with C3PO and R2D2 are welcome scenes too. The new characters are fit into the film like a glove and there many of the other past ones along for the ride.The reasons I am not at 8 on this are minor but there is no sequence to explain how Rey arrives on the Millennium Falcon late in the film. I am guessing there was a scene but it got cut due to the 2 hour and 25 minute run time. The new philsophy lines in the film are rather shallow. The stuff that comes from the previous films are this film strengths.I am glad Fisher's entire role was filmed before her death. I believe it is all here, a fitting tribute to Carrie. I was afraid early in the film they were going to have her leave early. Chewbacca is back in this one too, always a pleasure to see Star Wars Flying Carpet in the mix. This might not be the best film in the series, but it is better than Episode 2, and Jar Jar Bings is not here. Thank goodness, and there are a few things that can lead to episode 9 which is the last of Lucas original plans. It would be nice if Lucas would write that conclusion, though as Yoda would put it, 'Seeing of things ahead, they might not be.'",7,3,18,19 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel Has Fun With/ For The Audience
","While you get more engaged with this film if you have read the comic books so you would know the characters more, this movie more than holds it's own with humor, and has some well done action and special effects too boot. It looks like this is the Marvel Hit for the Summer of 2014, and that's a good thing. There is some very nice tail telling here.The cast definitely helps as besides the special effects the cast brings off a good script. There is too much happening to describe here and that is because the movie is pretty long. It kind of has to be in order to get in everything. It's not boring by any means. Guardians is an exciting thrill ride without going to the amusement park. When he movie ends, make sure you stay through the credits as there is a funny bit after them that caps the good humor in the film with a wink of the eye. If you like Marvel Comics and read them a lot, your going to love this film.",8,3,8,4 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Great Surprise
","When I saw the promo trailer for this movie, I thought - just another movie about the breaking of the German Code machine enigma. That story has been covered before. Instead this is a well developed dramatic script which might not be totally true but might just be better told than almost any other version. The entire cast deserves a lot of credit for bringing this in and the writers for making things seem so realistic.Every time I see Keira Knightly in another role, the more I fall in love with her talent. She is top notch here.I think now that this film has been made, we have the best told tale about the German Code Breaking. I really enjoyed this one.",8,0,4,25 April 2015
Caddyshack," Classic Golf Comedy by Great Cast - A Hole in One
","Get that critter off the course & make room for a great comedy. This film has it all- from Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, & Rodney Dangerfield all providing great performances to Ted Knight in his best movie role as a straight man to Rodney. While this film has developed some political correctness problems now due to some R rated materials which are not as acceptable today as they were in 1980, the film & it's players rise above that to a great comedy level. I only wish Ted Knight& Rodney Dangerfield could have teamed up some more in their careers. While Chase & Murray are great in this film, it is these Ted & Rodney playing off each other that puts this film over the top on entertainment value. There is plenty of verbal & visual comedy in this film which makes it great too. It plays off several themes & comes off as a great time. The reason I say Ted & Rodney are the glue is that if you watch the sequel, CADDYSHACK 2 with Jackie Mason & Robert Stack trying to do Ted & Rodney's roles & compare it with this original, you will find while the second one failed where this one succeeded. The soundtrack is good but the music is more for rock fans. The main weakness in this original is the love story between the young folks which is a throwback to this type of story distraction in MARX BROTHERS films. Luckily, this film never stops for too long on this subplot. Just remember the folks in this cast & some great classic comedy are what you watching this film for. Jon Peters (Babs Streisands ex husband & hair dresser) produced this one.",8,2,3,22 August 2006
Jurassic World," Highest Octane Entry of the Series - Rebooted
","This entry does so some liberal set borrowing from earlier films. The upgraded CGI is pretty sharp and the action is faster and more vast. This entry is better than the third entry because the director got away from cloning Spielburg which is why the last one was so terrible. A must see? Maybe not but the length is right and it gives the viewer their money worth.No one from the original cast is in this one but that does not matter as even though the plot has a feel of the earlier films and references to those films, this film stands on it's own. It has some really wild action as it begins to look like the entire world is out of control.The story feels like previous films and the 3 D is sharp. The kids in this one are actually a little older and not as cute. The original message is still here- you can not trust corporations to do things right for this world and they tend to screw up things when they get too ambitious. The Reps and Dems could take a lesson from this moral, as the free traders there have gotten like InGen, too big for their britches. Jimmy Fallon makes a cameo appearance in this one. After a raptor nearly snacks on Jimmy, he is gone quickly.",7,0,4,16 June 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," King of The Remakes
","Ever since the original Edward Scissorhands success of Tim Burton, Burton seems more content to try and remake prior films than to go after something new & original. His results doing this are mixed depending upon which remake you look at.This one is one of his better efforts at remaking Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. His cast includes Johnny Depp (Chocolat experienced) and a good supporting group. The original Gene Wilder film is not a classic and this new version does not raise that level.While I can't recommend this as a classic film, it is as watchable as the original, kind of like comparing Gene Wilder & Depp is comparing a Hershey Bar with a Nestle one. Both these films are a different flavor of the same thing, both with good taste, but neither a really premium brand of chocolate too die for.",7,0,1,19 February 2008
Mission: Impossible II," Worst Entry in Series
","The biggest problem here is believable. Instead of having the brains that usually get the IMF Mission done, this one has dumb and impossible stunts. The closing sequences are so terribly done that the movie is laughable. Ethan Hunt becomes a James Bond in this one using luck to get the job done.The masks used in this are clever but often stupid. Why would anyone believe that someone who is the wrong body size in a mask would be another person? The mask does not change the size of the body the face is one.The acting in this one of so cliché that it becomes annoying. The plot is predictable, and the stunts are so unlikely, that I am reminded of Los Costello riding roller coaster wheels in front of screens in the later part of Abbott & Costello go to Hollywood, also an MGM film.The only reason I give this anything at all is that I hate to think I wasted 2 hours on pay cable watching a zero film. It is lucky the later films have gotten better, as this one is the bottom of the barrel literally. They should burn the script on this but keep the film for schools as an example of how not to make a Mission Impossible. There are some nice locations, but they do not make up for a script who IQ is way below other IMF films.",2,1,2,3 June 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," This Review Has Been Adjusted
","I was writing another review of this and the internet blinked. I think it was the Bureau reprogramming my review. I am trying again here before this one joins Area 51 like the last one.This is a romance between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt that is considered taboo by the Bureau, the power of fate which determines everybody's life. It is old fashioned in that Blunt is presented as the helpless woman who can't pursue Damon but he has to come after her to get what they want.Of course the Bureau is behind her not being able to pursue him. The first guy of the bureau who is predominate plays Roger Sterling on Mad Men. Then they kick it upstairs to Terrence Stamp. The supporting cast is pretty solid in this one. Jon Stewart plays himself in this one.The music adds suspense, and the pace of the film is good. Those things It is a above average suspense thriller. If you buy into a romance film, you will enjoy it.",Null,0,1,30 July 2011
The Hangover Part II," New Town, Same Cast, Same Everything
","This film is entertaining. Trouble with it is after seeing the first movie, you could skip this one and miss very little. The plot runs very much the same as the first one, too much so.All the elements including the cast of the first movie are here. We have another lost night and another wedding being scheduled. Only this time, we leave Elvis in Vegas and this one is in Thailand.While there are some different twists in this R Rated second of a possible series, the story is exactly the same as the first movie. I liked it a lot the first time as it was different than movies prior. This time, it is more of the same.That means it is OK. If you have seen the first Hangover, you could skip this one.",7,0,1,14 June 2011
Logan," Marvel Gets Mature & Serious
","The marvel series often has humor and comic quality. This one goes beyond that into serious drama. Hugh Jackmanis brillant as Logan/X24. He gets plenty of good support. Dafne Keen as Laura, hi daughter(?) is great as well.There are plenty of good performances, but the strength of these Marvel Characters film is the script. This one is no exception. It mixes the Comic Book Action and Character development perfectly. The story is kind of like the 'boys of Brazil' but in this case, the kids are all super powered and genetically produced by Science including Laura. Logan needs to save them from having their powers controlled by abusers.It gets pretty bloody, but the resulting action and the story are well told and the long film is very entertaining. 
This film proves Marvel can appeal to an 'R' Rated Mature Audience. It again proves how to make a good movie. Hopefully, other film makers will look at this one and learn this lesson.",8,2,4,28 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Missed Opportunity Here- on second thought
","I enjoyed this one but it could have been even better. I saw it on IMAX 3D which is impressive. Try being faithful to a true Marvel comic book fan was impossible. Hers is how I would redo it- Make 2 movies because the cast here gets very few chances to act because they are way too busy.Movie one - flesh out the Ultron creation story which is way too short in this jammed version - and then write a script to take more advantage of Spader and humor. This is the least well written script I have ever heard for Spader. so into Ultron's preparation with more details. Movie two Kill Ultron with more style and humor. It is obvious Marvel spent w lot of money on this, and will make money-but if they re did it better they could rival The Koch Brothers.",6,4,11,10 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Hollywood Gets It Right
","This film is long at over 2 1/2 hours but that is because it does so much right that it takes that long to do the job. Everyone in the cast is terrific. The action is almost non-stop for this film too.Michael Caine is even better in this film than he was in Batman Begins. Morgan Freeman who has been busy this year (also in Wanted this summer) is fantastic. The film has times where the action is so intense that you almost get lost but it picks you up and doesn't let you get lost. Kudos to Christian Bale as he is even better here than in Batman Begins.Heath Ledger as the Joker is the big story. This is not a Joker like before, as this one is totally out there (and don't ask me where there is). His criminal activity is defined as unusually bizarre. He says it himself when he says in the movie that he just goes where he wants without any reason for what he is doing. The Joker actually starts the film robbing a bank. By the end of the movie, he has made that bank robbery seem and actually be pointless. The robbery is just a place to start the movie.The film starts dark & ends darker with very little light in the middle. It kills off people often and even one of the main roles is killed. It gives viewers a delightful UN-predictability not just too the Joker but to where the film is going.That is pretty much what makes this film go. I doubt than any film will top it this year. It even leaves Wanted in the dust grasping to catch up.",10,9,19,1 August 2008
Into the Wild," Watch Out What You Ask For
","Sean Penn makes his 9th Directing effort in this film. It is difficult to take a true story & put it on film without going too far into fictional events to make the film more appealing to a wider audience. Penn has the guts here to make this film more a work of Art, & this is to be appreciated.The main story is really pretty depressing. A son who is totally detached from his family, graduates college & then disappears going as far away from them as he can get. Told in an unusual manner by his sisters narration, this film starts in the present & then goes back & forth tracing his life route from graduation across the country in search of his goal of exploring Alaska.There is no glory in his quest. He is a 23 year old who feels he is not only detached from his parents but believes he is immortal & can learn to do anything. What the true story lacks here is what he lacked in life. That is besides going to Alaska, he does not seem to have a goal beyond there.Alex really does come off in this film as a tragic character who does not really think about others, being way too into his himself. This story does a very good job of going through why in pursuit of his goal of Alaska, he ignores all the opportunities & people who befriend him trying to make him fit into a normal life. He abhors normal life until ironically, at the end of his life he writes that there is no meaning to life unless it is shared.The theme of this like Jack London's Call Of The Wild, is survival. The various locations used to film it are amazingly photographed. Stunning is the word I'd use for some of these locations. All the characters in the film are well drawn & unless you get bored easily, you should find something interesting in the way this film is made.",8,1,2,19 February 2010
The Graduate," Great Soundtrack, Fine Film, Coming of Age in 1960's Defined
","This film has one of the better sound tracks of any film in Hollywood history. Simon & Garfunkel's music sets the perfect moods throughout the picture. Mike Nichol's Direction is excellent & a lot of the photography & camera angles are excellent but Nichols never gave credit where credit is do much on this film.A major professional film maker who consulted on this film was Harold Lloyd, the early King of Silent Romantic Comedies & it shows through out the film. A lot of the best comedic moments in the film are pure Harold Lloyd, including the sequence when Dustin Hoffman takes Katherine Ross (aka Elaine Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's Daughter) into the hotel where he has been taking (literally) her mom (Anne Bancroft) for months. The ending, if you really want to see it done more comically is borrowed completely from Lloyds 1924 film GIRL SHY. To me, while this is a coming of age comedy, the comedy in this is slow paced & lighter than GIRL SHY & in 1967 they got away with more adult themes & scenes than Lloyd could have dared to try in 1924. The plot itself is quite adult & I am sure some of the good work in the script came from Buck Henry who helped convert the book.A lot of the supporting players in this either went on the bigger roles or major television work later which doesn't hurt the main players. Without this film, Dustin Hoffman might have spent a lot of his career unemployed. This is a very good film in many many ways though not for the kiddies even though this material from the 1960's is tamer than films made after it.",7,0,1,29 April 2006
Taken," Don't Lie To Your Daddy Unless He Can Bail You Out
","Pierre Morel's Taken is only the second film he has directed, but it is very solid work. It is obvious that he takes pains in using his experience in operating the cameras to make sure the visuals are very well done. This movie is short, but to me the length is an advantage.Surprisingly, there is a fair amount of time in the beginning of the film taken (no pun intended) to develop the story and the characters. We find out quickly & efficiently that daddy is divorced and his daughter is turning 17. Daddy is trying to bond more with his daughter but mommy seems to be throwing up road blocks & isn't very good at communicating with daddy. Daddy is then shown doing his job which is person protection of a female rock singer. This shows a little of what daddy does for a living and introduces some plotting to the picture. Then daughter springs a big lie on Daddy about going to Paris in the summer & lies to mom too about where she is going to be because the daughter has been lied too by her girl friend too. Now the blonde girlfriend (Amanda) doesn't get developed too well except her main interest for the summer seems to be going to Paris and getting laid all summer. When the daughter gets to Paris she becomes apprehensive of what Amanda has gotten her into, especially when she finds out they have a Paris Apartment to themselves for the summer. Amanda does get laid, but not the way she intended too.Both girls are taken by Algerian terrorists who drug them to make them sex slaves. Luckily the daughter calls daddy who tries to reason with the terrorist but is told 'Good Luck' by Marko. From this point on, the film is almost non-stop action but action which moves the story along.The best thing besides being direct about this film is the action sequences are done well. The story pulls the viewer in and we feel great satisfaction when all the bad guys keep getting taken out, one after another. Very good film, not sure when DVD comes out if it might have some extra scenes. It might but the form being shown in the theater now is pure satisfaction.",8,0,2,28 February 2009
Avatar," The Second Wave of 3D is back with a Splash, & A War
","Leave it to James Cameron to release the first real blockbuster of the current wave of 3-D films coming to your movie theaters. The $400 million dollar quoted budget for this film definitely shows. The special effects get a 10 because of that money. This film in a way is Titanic two, as it appeals to the same audience as his former blockbuster. This, Camerons next film appeals to the same audience in exactly the same way using exactly the same formula.That formula is - an extremely big budget, technical stuff to draw in the men, & a love story to draw in the women. Now add the 3d & animation to bring in the kids too, and this audience is even more complete than Titanic was. With this in mind, if you want to see 3D done right, go to this movie & note the previews of at least 2 other 3D films coming up. This is not your Grandapas 1950's 3D process, this is state of the art.The film manages to appeal to a wide swath of audience too. There is plenty of romance for the ladies, plenty of action for that audience, some amazing imaginative creature, plant & animal creations for the naturalist, & just enough plot twist to keep you watching.The plot is what pulls this film down from a 10. I can see what they tried to do here with the plot in appealing to folks that are in the going 'Green' movement. It has a major appeal that direction. Especially telling is the description of the planet trees & nature interconnecting into a massive network described like a computer network to try & draw in the Techno Geeks as well. There is a Natural Force Network for those who like that appeal.You have the Technological Society, (Jake is from Earth as he served in Venezuela) & the 'dying world' description. Then you have the Pandora world which is presented as an entirely natural world with a rare supply of a valuable resource that the other world needs (a stretch here but greed is a good plot toy). Man types versus Pandorian tribes & animals is the set up here. Including the THX special effects, there are lots of cross references to Star Wars in this film.To me, it is way to pessimistic to refer to Earth as a 'dying world'. Venezuela is specifically referenced, which makes it ironic as we are trying to save the Earth on Earth day & the DVD is first released on Earth Day week-end. According to this movie, we'd better double our Earth day efforts. That analogy is way too simplistic because as long as man doesn't nuke his own world entirely, this planet is not dying. What is great about our planet is that like the theory of evolution, our planet evolves & survives. Man is capable of destroying himself due to modern weapons. Man is in no way capable of destroying this planet. In fact, the next 50 years could be the most exciting yet in our planets history. Human History is full of Climate Change & the climate has & will always change. Pandora is painted with a broad brush as a natural Utopia which would be perfect though wild & rough if not for the alien invaders. The Pandorans don't even seem to need to farm, though they do hunt. This simplistic black versus white plot is OK for the first major commercial 3D release with this new process, but as people realize how simplistic these two sides are presented, the plot falls apart. In the real universe, two sides are never that simple.The battle sequence in this movie pulls in viewers in the second half at is combines elements of The Empire Strikes Back & Return of The Jedi into one movie. That's getting your money's worth. There is enough here to get lots of viewers, particularly ones who want to be dazzled by 3D effects, & pessimistic folks who believe that man is really destroying our planet. For those who want a more complicated real world type of plot, this one will fall short. A fine Fantasy this is.",8,1,6,22 December 2009
La La Land," Throw Back To The 1950's? 40's?
","Wow, this won Best Picture, whoops The Accountant's messed up the envelopes, and they did it without help. Not best picture, and it was filmed at Warner Brothers studios in California. The movie does have very good music (special thanks to John Legend). Jazz is great stuff and the music of strong emotions. That is what this movie plays to, the music. Emma Stone (who was in the Best Picture Birdman last year) is Mia, a struggling actress unlike Stone, whose trying to make it so hard, she writes a 1 Woman play, and pays a theater so she can perform it one night. Meanwhile, Ryan Gosling is Sebastian, struggling jazz pianist who meets Mia and teaches her to love jazz. In the meantime, they love for a year, as the movie starts in spring, then the rest of the seasons, until Winter when Mia puts on her play, and then gets called to an audition because of the play, and gets a big star making role in Paris. Sebastian wants to open a jazz piano bar. He needs money and is still looking for money to open the bar when Mia leaves. Then the film moves ahead to 5 years later when Mia is a star and comes back to California where her husband takes her to Sebastian's Jazz Bar. Then we get the road not taken routine (Mia has a daughter with her husband when she gets back), a dream sequence, and then Mia and her husband leave Sebastian at his piano in the bar.The movie is in Panorama, the sets are expensive, and the acting is good, the dancing so-so, and the music great. I see people rating this a 10, yet with the exception of cell phones being used in the film, it pretty much could have been filmed 50 to 70 years ago.Yes, it is well done, but like Alfred Hitchcock's TOPAZ, while the material is good, it is dated material. I like TOPAZ better, but it could have been made in the 1950's instead of the 1960's. This film even has an antique convertible car from the 1960's in the beginning of the film that confused me about what time period this film was in, briefly.To me, unless you really like the music, which I do, this film is an old fashioned romance that could put you into La La Land. It is easier to follow than Birdman, but then the romance dream in my life always takes place on a flying carpet. It is one heck of a dream to find the perfect mate, and it only happens in the movies. Real life is as big a let down, as the best picture dream being shattered by a letter that was supposed to be put in the shredder, not on the stage. Sweet Dreams, La La Land puts me to sleep.",6,0,1,26 November 2017
The Hurricane," Freedom Spirit re-kindled
","In the boxing genre, this film does not get to classic proportions like The Raging Bull, but the story is more inspirational. It has a class message about freedom. Director Norman Jewison does a fine job of framing that on the screen.Denzell Washington is a great choice to play Carter. Washington is a very talented actor who brings a sense of realism to every role he does. He worked very hard on this film, over a year in boxing coaching alone along with shedding 40 pounds to play the role. It is interesting that the film uses his performance as Malcom X in 1992 as a cameo in this film. Washington actually has two roles here briefly.The story does stray at sections from the reality as it happened. Rubin Carter was not quite as saintly as this film makes him out to be. While the film stays away from the things Carter actually did do, it places a square emphasis on what he didn't do, but spent many years in prison for. The drama in the late court room sequence with an aged Rod Steiger doing a good job as judge, is very well staged.The DVD set of Washington films recently released with this and Malcom X is definitely worth spending so time with. There are 4 films in the set with extras for each film. The extras for this feature some significant information about this film and a fair interview with the real Hurricane Carter.",7,0,2,14 March 2009
Groundhog Day," It's Ground Hog Day -Again Campers- & We Got Ya Babe
","Harold Ramis is a genius in how he developed this comedy in and outside the box frame work which works it's way back to a happy ending. While the plot itself has to do with being stuck in time, place, & space, the development of the characters & the comic situations are classic.This film is one I usually watch every year about Groud Hog Day, & every time I watch it, I notice a subtle piece of humor I didn't notice before. This is the mark of a great film & this is one. The only way you can't like this film is if you don't like Bill Murray. If you don't, & can put that aside, you will still see the genius of the script. I think this one is without a doubt the best performance of Bill Murray's career & the film he will be remembered for. Bill becomes Phil Conner in this film. As the film develops, Phil is not only stuck in this day, but he keeps exploring himself in more & more ways, & gets a chance to get to know the entire world of Pauxatawny, PA intimately. In a way, the predictable happy ending makes sense, as it takes Phil along long time to figure out how to achieve his dream which takes on the human form of Rita.There are some minor problems in the fact that some of the characters almost seem to realize towards the end that Phil has been hanging around town too long. Ramis genius is the themes he packs in. He does the easy ones like suicide & scoring the quickie. Then he does the more subtle ones like 'no consequences' & playing in the snow. The touch with the bum who time has come no matter what Phil does for him each day shows an interesting depth provocation for a comedy film.The real classic Americana is the choice of Sonny & Cher's 'I Got You Babe' to wake up to every morning. In a way, Harold Ramis got all of us with this film. 'Wake up campers & put on your booties because it's cold outside.' Every day is the same, or is it? Decking the Life Insurance salesman is something I've always wanted to do. 'Tomorrow will be today again, & I can't do anything about it.'",9,1,3,9 September 2006
National Treasure," Normally I like Cage in Movies but this movie is bad
","I was terribly disappointed in this film. I watched this movie and then view CATWOMAN and in comparison, this film is much worse. It is quite easy to point out why.The plot in this film has so many holes in it that you could confuse the script with a piece of Swiss Cheese. The history is not accurate, the action makes no sense, the founding fathers of the US are not even presented accurately. I could go on for a 1000 words just on the holes in this but suffice it to say the holes in the plot on this film are so big that the writers should be put on a strict diet.The computerized action sequences in this are elaborate, but look too fake. I especially do not like the nearly 300 year old wood planks in a damp building basement that can still support weight and are not infested with roaches, termites, or carpenter ants. How could the pest control industry possibly buy that? Cage has a capable performance, and that is the only thing that gets this film to 2 on my ratings. Take away Cage, and this film is a zero, a big zero. In fact, this film makes Cage's HONEYMOON IN VEGAS look like a masterpiece.The support in this film gets a zero too. I can hardly remember their names. They should take that strong 200 to 300 year rope that the old elevator is on and hang this movie out to dry. I hope Cage will get some better material his next time out. If he can't get better stuff than this, he should go to TV & do a sitcom. He is wasting his talent in tripe such as this film.",2,5,9,7 July 2005
Limitless," Smart Pill Conquers Reality
","The best thing about this film is the pacing. It does not stick around too long & keeps the action moving. The cast does a good job. Robert De Niro is good in a supporting role. Bradley Cooper carries most of the load including narration. Abbie Cornish is the main love interest. The rest of the roles get smaller in support of these. Neil Burger's direction is fast & crisp.Where last years Inception dealt with layers of dreams, this one centers on one dream - a pill which makes you smarter so you can use your entire brain. While writing a novel which Coopers character does is a noble thing to do with that ability, I am not so sure that being able to use my entire brain that I would do it for a couple of items.Scoring day trading on the stock market is a good use for being smart? It would do wonders for the US Government budget when the IRS collects Taxes from this man (along with the Gambling revenue he owes taxes on). Still, it seems to me the intellect could be put to better uses.The film presents an interesting theory that being smart can get Eddie Morra into bed with women. Perhaps that would be true if the pill can help you read that person's mind. Being smarter can make you into a better fighter? In theory it could help, but without muscles & reflexes it takes more than thinking to make it through a fight.Still, you have to put reality into the ticket taker at the theater door when you see this one. It employs the same type of flashback format that I saw in Mission Impossible 2 in that it starts near the end, goes back to the beginning, and then winds past the flashback.It is a single dream, but at least it is effective. I didn't want to think too much on a Friday night after a tough week anyhow.",7,0,1,25 March 2011
Rocky," Solid Film for the Underdog
","This is the original film that launched a series. While the series has hit rocky bottom (pun intended), this film & the second film are the best ones in the series. I prefer this first one as it is the most original.Lucky for Sly Stallone that he found a fine cast to support him. Carl Weathers is excellent as Apollo Creed. Talia Shire is great as his girlfriend (and in real life becomes his wife). Burgess Meredith, a real veteran character actor, brings off being Rockys manager very well.The script is uplifting and the viewer gets a high out of this at the ending. In 1976 & even today well all need this uplifting from the underdog overcoming the odds to become something no one thought he could be. This one catches that emotion the best of any film in the series.",8,0,0,16 May 2007
Some Like It Hot," AFI's Choice As Best All Time Comedy
","This film deserves all the kudos it has received from AFI. It is one extremely entertaining film. It has a very talented cast & Billy Wilder is brilliant in making another screwball comedy which is what his career is composed of.Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis team up as a couple band members who accidentally witness the St Valentines Day Massacre in Chicago, & then go in drag as women band members to Florida trying to escape the mob folks trying to kill them because they did see the murder. That is the set up.On the way to Florida on a train, Curtis woman character falls in love with a woman singer in the band played by Marilyn Monroe. This film is one of her better efforts & no doubt the best turn at comedy she tried. Curtis then sets up Marilyn on a date with his alter ego, Curtis doing an impressive imitation of Cary Grant. Meanwhile, Lemmon has a problem as Joe E Brown, an exotic millionaire, has fallen for her (him). The films closing is a riot involving this plot line. That set up for this film seems quite simple, but when you watch it you realize how difficult it was to set up & how talented the cast is. I think it can still be enjoyed by viewers, even now. This film is not the first to involve men dressing as women for comic effects. Charlie Chaplin did it in a short before 1920. It is the best film to use it to comic effect though honorable mention should be made to Tootsie & Mrs. Doubtfire in this category.This one is better because the script works so well than nothing about it seems absurd or abnormal. There are moments in Tootsie & Mrs. Doubtfire which get a little too absurd.",9,1,2,14 July 2007
Inside Man," Nothing Is As It Appears
","Spike Lee has taken an extremely talented cast and turned the film and the story inside out leaving the viewer guessing all along the way. This is Lee's attempt at taking a suspense movie & making it into a nearly meaningless exercise. In fact a lot of what he does works as the film is definitely unpredictable.What I noticed upon viewing this film is the fact that as the film tells the story, it shows interviews with hostages that break into the s by the main suspect. story but are obviously timed for after the robbery is over. There are about 30 minutes of deleted scenes which don't really help put it together any better either on the DVD.Denzell Washington is good in his role as the detective who is a negotiator, and is trying to settle the whole situation without deaths. What is interesting is that he realizes the person he is negotiating with is blowing smoke at him. He does not realize until it is much too late how he is gamed.While Spike Lee has done better work, this one holds up as really good suspense that has a mystery wrapped inside a some things which don't make any sense. It's a robbery within a hostage situation but it is not anything that appears as it should.",7,1,2,20 March 2009
Hoosiers," UnderRated By Many, But A Spirited Classic
","With the recent death of Dennis Hopper whose support in this one as Shooter is a classic support role, this film was very much over looked by everybody when it was released. After all, this is only about high school basketball and it is very much a period piece. It is set in the 1950's, in the Mid-West, but with a very big city cast. It was over looked despite the fact that this is the classic under dog from the small town getting to the state championship at the high school level. This is the theme that the NCAA's are built on in college basketball every year. Yet the film did not get positive press on it's initial release.Then the film hit television, & like the Wizard of Oz, this film has a plot that plays well on television. It has Gene Hackman proving he is more than Popeye Doyle as he plays a high school basketball coach who rarely exists in reality. He plays that role with a relish that carries this film. With Shooter (Hopper) in support as a mentor, but a mentor with a drinking problem, a small school beats the odds. That is a heart which works in many classic motion pictures, & it works well here.This is a big time cast working with a director who really, this is the best & only big time film he has directed. Like the underdog, his directing here is just classic. What makes this film work is the dream. This film represents that dream, the underdog coming through. Hackmans speech, the cast around him, & a great story line, come together here by accident. While this is not Dennis Hoppers most memorable role, Shooter too represents this spirit.",8,0,1,29 May 2010
Les Misérables," Tom Hooper's Les Miserables
","I am very impressed that Director Tom Hooper who Directed 'The Kings Speech' attempted this project. While I have never seen the live Broadway production, this is the most impressive musical I have seen in a long time. Since there are very few directors with any experience with musicals, that makes Hooper's ambition even more impressive.It is strange the movie going public is so hung up on the stars that people complain - this one can sing, that one can't. Those kind of narrow minded individuals would miss this movie. I see from some reviews they already have.The main goals of a musical are - does it tell the story? In the case of this movie- yes, it tells the story very well.Are the songs and sequences staged to move the film through the story? Even though this is a long movie, yes that is how this movie proceeds.Are the sets and backdrops a help to the story? Is the screen adaption well written? Are the real basics of who, what where when and how explained to the audience? From what I saw in a packed theater, yes, without a doubt.I did not look up the cast for this movie before I went. Quite frankly, I went because I had heard so much a about how good the movie is. I honestly think from what I saw on the screen, you could have had almost any cast in front of the camera with Hopper Directing this script and the resulting film would still be outstanding.That is what I say a great film is all about, great story, great sets, great direction, and based on great material. Victor Hugo was one of the great writers and this screen adaption proves it.I do not see where any 1 person in this cast really carries the movie, but the story sure does. Because of that, when I saw the names on the screen at the end of the film, I was surprised. When they were on screen they were all in character. That is what a great film is all about.",9,4,7,6 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Back For More 3D Saving And Next One Already on The Way
","Like the first round, it appears it is always smart to keep the original formula together and keep going. James Gunn writes and directs this one, the same as the first one. A lot of the original cast is back too. It is done with jut a much fun and spirit as the first one.The formula is to mix up the characters into action using as much comedy as possible and then getting things rolling with a great soundtrack. This film does that tons more. The soundtrack is so well chosen a mix that by itself it is a great sounding film. The songs seem to fit every part of the film so well.The list of classic songs - 1. Mr. Blue Sky – Electric Light Orchestra 2. Fox on the Run – Sweet 3. Lake Shore Drive – Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah 4. The Chain – Fleetwood Mac 5. Bring it On Home to Me – Sam Cooke 6. Southern Nights – Glen Campbell 7. My Sweet Lord – George Harrison 8. Brandy You're a Fine Girl – Looking Glass 9. Come a Little Bit Closer – Jay and the Americans 10. Wham Bang Shang-A-Lang – Silver 11. Surrender – Cheap Trick 12. Father and Son – Yusuf / Cat Stevens 13. Flashlight – Parliament 14. Guardians Inferno – The Sneepers feat. David HasselhoffThere is a whole lot of Brandy, which is a great old song whose lyrics are worked into the plot lots. Of course Goldie Hawns husband, Kurt Rusell gets quite a bit of work here. Sly Stallone is not as busy but keeps himself relevant. The 4 women- Zoey, Pom, Karen, and Elizabeth keep things lively with the rival sisters and more. Stan Lee makes another cameo and is having more fun than anyone should be allowed to enjoy from his own creation. The plot will always be the same. This time, Ego (Russell) is one of 3 threats to the Galaxy, and is trying to enlist his son Peter Quill /Star Lord (Chris Pratt) to team up to build their own Galaxy as EGO has built himself a planet. There is also a Queen chasing Quill and there are some others and a step father who are involved.The plot is not what is important here. It is the comedy, the action, and the music. The film scores on all 3 points. At about 2 hours and 16 minutes it is long but not too long. Make sure as always to watch the credits for some strange stuff and clues to where the next Vol. 3 is headed. This one is a fun time, for sure.",8,11,19,7 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Good Locations Do Not Always Make Great Films
","It is not often that you see a movie with Tom Hanks that does not fit right. That is the case here as while Tom Hanks is good in the central role, it would be better if BIll Murray were in the role. Hanks is OK, but he does not have the passion of this role Murray would.The location shooting in this one is amazing. and the wow factor is there early on. What is not there is the real energy to carry off the entire film. Still Ron Howard makes a Noble effort here with an international cast. If I were making the movie, I would focus more on the story and less on the facts or mythology around that story. There is so much to tell that even with the original author on board for the screen play.That is the reason this movie falls way short of what it could be. If you get the special DVD, this one sets a record for the most extras of any film. Once you watch enough extras, you realize there is a lack of depth in the story here too. This in spite of the author doing the screen play. Thing is, since this is fiction, it has to be that way.",6,1,3,21 September 2012
Titanic," Next To Last Blockbuster At Theatre Box Office
","In 1997, this film became a must see for a lot of people. There were several factors that caused this. The film featured some of the first shots of the actual Titanic on the ocean floor after it sank. It featured early glimpses of the technology that had been developed by Robert Ballard to get those pictures. It offered one of the first true tellings of how the ship really sank as finding it in the ocean had finally revealed more details about what really happened to it.This movie has the trade mark James Carmeron hokey love story. He just re-did it in the Sci-Fi movie Avatar. This is becoming the trademark of all his films as Avatar is his first movie since this one. Will Cameron ever do a movie without one?Titanic's story is better than Avatar simply because the story here is framed better. There is true History here to base the film on & this is much better than the story for Avatar which is negative without merit. We have the ship of dreams, the star of the ocean diamond, the provocative drawing. We have the ultimate ship which has become legend for yet another generation thanks to this epic remake. The love story is Camerons jewel & the necklace the ultimate symbol.Leonardo DiCaprio has the highlight role of his career here. So far, no role he has done since matches it. This film was the right time & right place for him. Right place because he got to play after the luscious Kate Winslet. She was another unknown to most audiences, but so far this is her best film too. The rest of the cast is OK, but other than the actress who plays Kate as an old lady, they don't stand out much.Special effects appealed to sell tickets too. The ship sets were so expensive, so well done & so detailed, that they actually became tourist attractions after the movie was made there. Add all these factors plus no real other film in theaters when this was released, & you understand why it sold so many tickets.It might be the last movie to sell so many tickets. Well made hit films now do well for a few weeks, but then a lot of folks wait for the DVD before they watch it. This & the new television technology which has made home theater type television possible, has changed the public theater into a less appealing venue.Do I like this film? Yes, it is a good film, but 1 viewing is all I needed to take it all in. I still dream about Kate Winslet & wish Leonardo would try & match his acting in a newer effort.",9,0,3,5 December 2006
Thor," Way To Start Thor Saga
","First write a great script - Stan the man and the 5 writers handle that. Then get an 28 year old 6' 3' hunk and put 2 very good cast people around him. This adds up to Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, & Natalie Portman . Add Tom Hiddleston 30 year young talent as Loki whose great. This one is a winner, all the way. Kenneth Branagh does a fine job directed this one too.As for the plot, well any writer fan of Thor and Stan Lee comic should find it a labor of love. Sure enough, this script comes off that way. There's good humor all the way through and dramatic moments for Hopkins Odin plus the some special moments.A throw back moment for me is the scene with the attack on the town. Kind of reminded me of Superman 2 though the Destroyer is much more effective than the 3 were in that movie. Lodi really designed one tough machine.As is normal for Marvel, they introduce Shield run by the government in this one. There are other characters introduced along the way. The great thing though is the immediate talent shown by the younger male actors with the more experienced crew. The casting director hit the jack pot here. Enjoy this one and watch at the end for some extra credits. There's more to Thor than meets the eye, even though his first film is a lot calmer than you'd expect.The effects and the 9 USA filming locations are used well in advancing the story. The cast chemistry goes along really well. It ends with the usual 'well maybe I will see her again.' Portman is only 2 years older than Thor, but she is more experienced than him. Here though it is rated PG for Pretty Great. Darn, it's hard to believe Portman is turning 40 soon. How did that happen?",8,0,0,22 May 2020
The Godfather: Part III," The Death of Michael Cordileone
","I have an advantage here of watching the official restoration in 2008 by the director. He states in his comments that he wanted to title this film the death of Michael. It is more than that in the restoration. It is the tragic death of Michael Cordileone.Acting in this is not outstanding with the exception of Copola's daughter and Michael's daughter, Mary. She steals the show from the other women in the cast even though she is not a professional actress. This isn't easy but she does it.The film is over long at well over 3 hours and it does end with Michaels death which happens briefly in the end sequence. His end is not as well staged/framed or told as Brando was in the first film. In fact it is pitifully short of the rich details. The main problem with this film is besides being late, it really does not break any new ground in telling the story. This is a shame as this classic series deserves a better conclusion.The restoration is visually very exciting. It is the story that is a strange vacuum.",7,0,1,11 May 2009
Zombieland," Rule Number 1 - Enjoy This Film
","Director Ruben Fleischer's first theater effort is quite successful as a piece of entertainment. Jesse Eisenberg is one of the male leads & the narrator for a world pretty much taken over by Zombies. While you'd expect early on that maybe the world is too far gone, the film becomes interesting & funny. Columbus (Eisenberg) is featured in the credits going over his rules on how to survive as a human in a world full of Zombies.He meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) after the credits, & they start on a trek to Columbus where Columbus wants to see if his parents & family have survived. On the way, they meet Wichita (Emma Stone)& Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who immediately steal all their survival gear & leave them to start over for themselves. Once they do, they meet the two young women again.Here the aim of the trek they are on changes as once the women decide they need to join up with the guys, Columbus finds out that there is nothing left where his family was. Meanwhile, the women's goal is an amusement park outside LA. This becomes the groups goal.The special effects in the movie are pretty realistic & the abandoned cities, highways full of wrecks, & other sets look very realistic. The cast works well together & are just deep enough to keep the viewer engaged. This is done for laughs & the cast is a good ensemble. Abigail Breslin is 13 when this movie was done, & you can still recognize Little Miss Sunshine though she has a more extensive role in this movie than the former. While Eisnberg & Harrelson dominate the film more, the two women have fairly full co-star roles.Watching it I swear there are a couple of times I see people in windows behind the actors that are not part of the film. While there is a major cameo in this film, these other folks in the background look like they just happen to be watching the shooting as they do not look like zombies. While this film is not long on plot, it is well acted, directed & solidly put together. A pleasant diversion for a rainy day.",8,1,3,15 October 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," The Essential Frank Capra
","This film more than any other is the reason we still hear Frank Capra as a famous film name. In recent years it has become a Christmas movie on NBC & the exposure at the network level has given this movie the type of fame enjoyed by The Wizard of Oz.It deserves the accolades too. Not only is this a great script with great Direction, but Jimmy Stewart is excellent & uniquely cast in the role as the hero. This film shows how good an actor he is. This film might just be the reason Stewart got the attention of Alfred Hitchcock which would lead to Rope, Rear Window, & Vertigo. It wasn't that Stewart was chopped liver before this film, but the way he carries it is a great acting job. Capra-Stewart just seemed to have the right chemistry together as they had already combined in some other roles too. It is interesting that Stewart was so good that he would work with nearly every great director of this era before he was done.Donna Reed has her best movie screen role here too. The script is just a wonder of all time. Capra seems to always get a hold of unique & powerful scripts & this one is no exception to that. Granted Mr Smith Goes To Washington & You Can't Take It With You are good scripts too, but this is the one which still invades the National stage most often today.This film rates a bravo from start to finish & may never go out of style. It is indeed a classic.",9,2,4,31 March 2010
Enemy at the Gates," Strong Drama Using Real People
","When I watched this I was impressed by the effects. The acting is solid and the characters in the script really did exist. The trouble is that even though the film plays like this is all cut and dried fact, the story can not be verified, which makes it fiction.Still, the film has good points for drama. The chaos of Stalingrad is something to behold, and like the recreation of other World War 2 battles, dramatic thrills are taken to get the viewer to like the story. There are things to like and some flaws.
For example, this film makes it look like the Russian Press was a Free Press operating on the front lines of the city. That is not very likely. Stalingrad has lots of propoganda being pushed out by both sides during the battle. So any basis on that account is most certainly fictional.Jude Law's protrayal of the Stalinist sniper is quite good acting wise. His affari with Rachel Weitz womand soldier is quite good. Trouble is this affair on the front is not very likely to have happened the way it does in the film. It's not that the Russians did not use women in the Battle of Stalingrad, they did. It is that even in this chaos the Russian Military tried to keep the men and women in seperate units. In fact, the history as written by the Germans was that as the war progressed, the Germans did not want to fact the Russian Women's units, because they were more brutal than the men's units.While there is a lot of fiction here, including the little boy spy, it is sold entertainment. If you get yourself wrapped up in the characters, you give it a 10 rating. I did not get that wrapped up and see some issues with the using of real people to dance to a fictional script. While the script by the director and one of Christopher Lees lesser Dracula films is good drama, to me this does not get up to the level of great drama. It just doesn't bring me to tears.As for Rachel, well I can only imagine if she were really in a mixed sex unit how it would work out. She is a major asset, but the distraction from the story of one of many Russian snipers, and of Major Koneig of the Nazis, is strictly entertaining. Soviet sniper Vasily Zaytsev is glorified in Russian History, and this films attempts to glorify him even more by having him kill Erwin König, Nazi expert sniper. There is no way to verify it ever happened.",7,0,0,4 March 2019
The Departed," Solid Film - Rare Best Picture
","This is not the first time the Best Picture has been won by a remake although several plot changes were made between this film & prequel Internal Affairs. What is interesting is how the performers & performances work out. While Leonardo Di'Caprio & Matt Damon are considered the stars, this film is literally stolen by veteran Jack Nicolson. Alec Balwin's role is almost non-existent in this one.Without Jack, none of the other actors performances would be as meaningful. Jack is the center of the plot. Even with the re-writing of the script, there is still a bit of a hole in why his crime boss trusts the undercover man in his operation. Never the less, because of Jack's over the top performance, you buy it. If you didn't, this movie falls apart.Another key performance in this is by newcomer Kristen Dalten. She plays a key role in the triangle between the 2 main characters well. I am not sure what she will be in next, but her role in this was really over-looked & she plays it perfectly. Whose baby she is carrying is never fully explained at the end.The original film was set on the west coast, this one moves to Boston. There are some too rare good touches by the script & a lot is left to the imagination. That part is good. The over the top reliance on 4 letter word language is good for shock value & humor, but almost detracts from the film, though it is noticeable that as the action starts to dominate, the language is not there as often.As often happens with a re-write, how the ending is handled does not make perfect sense, but the crowning touch to me - spoiler- is the symbolic use of a rat on the balcony in the final scene. This is well set up. I have to agree, this is Martin Scorchese best film in years, heads & tails above Gangs Of New York for example.The ending is one-ups-man-ship at it's finest as it is all about reaching back from the grave.",8,1,3,6 May 2007
Psycho," Surprise Movie From The Master
","Sir Alfred Hitchcock plays his audience like a fine instrument in this movie. He surprises at every turn. He layers some of the greatest suspense he ever put on film. This film will always have a place amongst the classic films.Despite it's greatness, this is the most humble of films. When Hitchcock made this film, he actually did it on the cheap. He used the summer vacation from his TV series & used his regular TV crew to film this. The cast agreed to work for little money.The genius in this movie is all Alfred Hitchcock. All he did was take an ordinary summer vacation, applied his genius to it, and produced an all time classic film. Hitch looked at this as a challenge. He wanted to prove it didn't take a bunch of money & a lot of studio smoke & mirrors to produce a great film. He succeeded beyond anyones wildest dreams.Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins will never be forgotten for their parts in this masterpiece. Nor should they be, for their performances sparkle. Janet only had to work a portion of that summer. Perkins summer performance would last the rest of his life.This is one of the first films to actually use a throne (toilet) in the film. Until Psycho, movies had never shown a toilet on screen & it is eerie how this throne comes on screen relating to the famous shower sequence. The 5 minute movie trailer with Alfred Hitchcock showing you around the Bates Motel set is a classic trailer for any film.Regardless, it is Sir Alfred who really brought all this into a great film. No one else could have done it better. This film proves it doesn't take money to make a classic, just genius. We just don't find much of that around these days.",10,0,1,25 June 2007
Jersey Boys," Clint Eastwood's second musical Slut
","I really think this movie is solid because as a Director Eastwood allows the music to carry the movie. If you want to enjoy this one more you need to watch the DVD with the captions on to understand the story better and hear the music too. The dialogue gets lost behind the soundtrack.Loved 4 seasons music since I had the double vinyl Gold Vault of hits. Even with all the songs used in this movie, there are more hits as Marianne and Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow are not here along with some others. I am impressed they stuck with the Europe Cut of Oh, What A Night and stayed away from the drummed disco remix made in the US.There are some subtle touches to look for like the quick cameo of Rowdy Yates. This is a much better musical effort for Clint a this time he does not sing though it has much less comedy than Paint Your Wagon.The movie will age well because the 4 Seasons Music ages well. Eastwood admits on the DVD he was more of a jazz fan. He brilliantly gets the original Broadway cast, lets the group cast narrate their own story and stands out of the way of the music.Knowing some great jazz musicians would like to see Clint get a script about Jazz and do a BIOS film about Slam Stewart or Louis Armstong. I bet he would find a labor of love in putting together the soundtrack,and great jazz deserves a chance to be heard in theater surround. Much like Garland's ' 'Over The Rainbow got heard in surround, there is a huge amount of jazz that could blow theater goers minds. There is a large amount of jazz on old films to be used, and with the right script I think Eastwood could pull it off after seeing this effort.",7,0,0,21 June 2015
Wedding Crashers," Owen Wilson & Vince Vaughn Funny Together
","Wilson & Vaughn are not house hold names as a comedy team. In this movie, they play off each other very well. The film is about crashing weddings and there is lots of fun to be had at every wedding. The unavoidable problems begin though when our team crashes too many weddings.After a while, they start running into people at other weddings who saw them at the earlier ones. Then, they go to a high ranking government officials wedding (excellently acted by Christopher Walken). This wedding takes the wheel off our teams relationship & wedding crashing plans. I also have to admit this family is one of the looniest families I have seen since Meet The Parents.The jokes come at a good pace & even though this film runs longer than many comedy films, it really does not drag. Sometimes good comedy can run longer than 90 minutes & this film proves it. The women cast in this film are as strong as the male cast & Wilson & Vaughn get excellent support from them too. Jane Seymour is great though her role is limited to a few scenes.Watch for a famous UN-credited cameo at the end by Will Farrell & enjoy this film. The DVD 8 1/2 minute longer version is the one I watched & it is good though not for the young kiddies with the additional material.",7,1,2,7 January 2007
Burlesque," A Friend Always Is There To Help A Friend
","Christina Aguilera gets help from Cher & a good solid supporting cast of friends to pull off a decent film. There aren't many musical films and there are 2 things this one suffers from. The first is the plot was done in 1930's musicals.Cher is the nearly bankrupt Burlesque club owner fighting to hold on to her club. She has an offer to sell her club & get out but refuses to do it. Christina is the wide eyed Iowa farm girl who runs away from a waitress job to wait tables and move on up at Cher's club. There is a romance which is played the same as romances were played in classic musicals other than the the new found male nudity shots that are becoming more commonplace in films now.The second thing that suffers here is the music, while it is good, there are no great songs. We don't have a Jennifer Hudson knockout song like Dream Girls had a few years ago. The lack of a knock out number makes this an OK movie but keeps it from being a great film.To their credit, the costumes and staging of the numbers is top notch. Cher is carefully used by the camera to try & hide her age by using short sequences of her on camera and using darkness at times to hide her figure which at age 65 or so is not what it once was.Cher does do two numbers and her voice still hits the notes well. Aguilera sounds great too. We have a good looking musical which kind of doesn't quite cook. At least Cher can start getting her Social Security though I doubt that will bail her out at the bank if she financed this one.",6,0,1,8 March 2011
Joker," What I Expected & More Done Very Well
","There have been so many Joker actors over the years that I expected this one to be a fractured world of a disfunctional life. What I did not expect is the great script and Phoenix to raise the Joker to a whole new level. When you take this story as a whole you can see and feel why the Joker is who he is. The depth this film establishes is beyond what I expected.I found some of the reason this works so well is the script writers both have some pretty good films under their belt, in particular The Hangover and that's the perfect writing style to design a Joker script. The Director here directed Hangover too which does not hurt. They really wrote a great script.It is the actors who make it work. Besides Phoenix, Robert De Niro to me was a major surprise in support. When I first saw that he was doing a Carson type talk show type rip-off, I thought boring, I've seen it done before. Then, as the film moved on, suddenly De Niro brought a special something to the role. I'd say a Best Supporting Actor is possible for the actor here.Zazie Beetz stuck out to me too, as Joker's well, I am not sure you can classify it as girlfriend but then again you can. To me she not only played her role well, she also had a really strong attraction here which I can not quantitify. Her script is kind of limited and the background of her character is not completed, but her skills are really shown off. Frances Conroy's mom's character is solid too. Brett Cullen for some reason reminds me of Alec Baldwin in looks, and he is fine here though not much script.The story creates a strong sympathy for Joker, and then shows the horrifying results in a way that has not been done before. There is also this strange thing between Joker's character and young boys that is a tension presented throughout this movie. Joker's character has tension, and an ironic comment on Government which enables him to string out of drugs while receiving supposed sponsored theraphy, then pulls the rug out from under him with budget cuts. I give the movie credit though, as it is not presented that the budget cuts actually caused Joker's problems. He is much more conflicted than that. His involvement with the Wayne family is quite unique. Does mom really know best is the question you have to ask yourself? I never thought that maybe the Joker might need to go on (spoiler) Maury for a DNA test?There is little to critic in this one other than timeline, as it's not real clear in parts where the date really is. Then again, this movie proves we don't really need to know what time it is to present a well-told story. Most everything fits, as a life fractured in a fractured city is what this is.We do know how it fits with other films of the saga. It is one of the strongest DC based films in a long while. Timeline was a theme in Hangover, but this drama goes way beyond just a hangover.",9,3,9,23 October 2019
A Hard Day's Night," Beatles Best Film
","Director Richard Lester made one of the most successful early rock films and important historic footage of the Fan four. Lester and the Beatles are among the high points of his career. This movie and Help! were film works which made the Beatles a solid hit world wide. This movie presents them at their height. The sad thing about the amount of talent this group had is that it ended so soon. Their success made them huge for about 6 years after this film. Then all that success made the group fall apart in 1971, never to get back together again. One can only imagine what music might have resulted if that success had not shortened things. Even as single acts after the break up, they all had success. The Beatles led the way to modern rock music and this movie documents it.",8,0,0,2 June 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicolson's Best, No Doubt
","There is no doubt this is Jack Nicholson's greatest performance. He has shown a lot of range in a lot of other pictures, but this one is the ultimate for Jack's fans. The film follows a very strong storyline based upon a well written novel.This is also the best performances for a lot who support Jack in this film. Will Sampson's performance in this movie is remembered more than any of his other work. Louise Fletcher is pretty much the same. Scatman Caruthers is always good & did a lot of films during this period. Not sure if this is any better than his others, but it ranks pretty close.The movie runs the viewer through a gauntlet of emotions & shows how merciless a system can be on anybody. Problem since this movie was made is that the system hasn't been fixed. If anything, the system is worse now than ever. Doesn't anybody ever learn anything valuable by watching these types of films? Top notch, top shelf, a rare 10 rating from me.",9,0,2,14 March 2007
The Wolf of Wall Street," Decaprio A Con - Boomers Beware
","It is obvious after watching this one some things fit very well. Leonardo DiCaprio can play a charismatic con man like Jordan Belfort perfectly. His narration and acting dominate this movie. His acting shell works very well. This movie (and story) are chock fill of sex, drugs, and obvious myth building by Belfort. As the real guy contributed to the script it is obvious this is the case.Now that this is established, the Charisma of the con man is brought successfully to life, and if in real life he had been married to the young lady portrayed by Margot Robbie he would have been a very lucky man. There is no doubt she can act here and on camera without clothes she is a sight to behold. That is really an advantage of the 3 hours this saga takes to unfold, lots of skin.In support- Rob Reiner in a limited role shines in his moments as Mad Max Belfort. The rest of the support is good though limited. This is really a one man film in a lot of ways as telling the 'true' story is centered here. The film has some funny moments and many 4 letter word moments and one of the harder R Rated films there is.Martin Scorsese is very careful here not to mention too noticeably that there really is a guy the story is based on. His direction shows in the frames of the film. The PC people will be offended by the humor/ making fun of homosexual characters in the film but those are consistent with when the movie is set. It is only recently that these types of references been taboo. Jordon Belfort is obviously a man who lives on the edge in that era. What is interesting about this portrayal of Wall Street Brokers as Cons is that with Baby Boomers trying too retire with nest eggs, brokers right now have more pigeons than at any time in history in the United States. That is because in this generation of boomers, they see politicians who are ripping off the system for 6 figure pensions and are dreaming of finding a real Jordan Belfort to try and catch up with their peers in government who retire at full income while the average boomer is going to retire at less than 40% salary because of poor government policy for many years now.Boomers should watch this movie to learn not too fall into this trap.",8,3,8,1 January 2014
American Gangster," Bravo Excellent Drama
","Ridley Scott directs Denzell Washington & Russell Crowe in a factually based story about the Mob set in the late 1960's through the mid 1970's. The script is excellently written & the film is very well directed by Scott. This is by far the best I have seen this year & has the potential to be the best picture.Washington is superb (best actor) playing a real life crime czar in the Bronx during the late 1960's. The opening scene has his teacher who mentored him die of ironically, natural causes due to his heart stopping. At the wake, Washington makes clear his intention to take over.Once past this, Washington proceeds to do just that. A lot of prime news reel footage from the period & a couple of recreations of actual events serve as backdrops to help tell the story of his rise to the top. Meanwhile, Rusell Crowes Special Investigative unit starts off slowly in pursuit of not just stopping Washingtons success but also of trying to rein in a lot of bad cops on the force & on the take in the NYC police department.This film has a lot of excellent support including a surprisingly strong supporting actress performance by veteran actress Ruby Dee as Washingtons mom. At about 2 hours & 45 minutes the film is a little long but it never gets bogged down or boring. In fact, it would be difficult to make the film any shorter & hold the entire story together. This is factually based drama at its best.Oscar blew it last year by not nominating this but since the main stream media is still racist & years behind an American society that is not racist, they selected No Country For Old Men, a slasher movie for best picture last year. This proves that with the Academy- Jason Lives!",10,0,5,12 November 2007
Dark Shadows," Generation Gap Shows Here For Eternity
","When Dan Curtis did this series on ABC in the 1960's, he was not yet a top television producer. It was tackling the oddity of a soap opera about vampires 5 days a week that would later give him the opportunity to do major projects like 'The Winds of War' on ABC. I say this because you have to remember the material from the original series is really not classic stuff.What has been done here is like the series on steroids. There is more action in 2 hours than there was in 6 weeks of the old show. Thankfully the music here is much better than the original series which had music much like an endless rhapsody of murky swamp. I give the sound track and A Plus.The film opens very well going back to the origins of Barabus Collins. The the Moody Blues 'Nights in White Satin' (1972)is well chosen for the credits and the start of the 1970's, As for the train credit sequence, I have no problem with it.There is a lot of subtle 1970's humor here which if your too young, you miss it entirely. I thought the entire cast is chosen well for the film. The sets and murky mood are well established.The level of the humor is low but effective. The interactions of the cast is great. The script is a problem but considering the source material which is not great, the script is OK. The popularity of the 60's series was basically built around Jonthan Frid.The movie tries to build it around Johnny Depp. To an extent that works as Depp's Barnabus gets most of the punch lines. That is about the most diversity Barnabus can get. Love the image of Depp almost looking like a famous pop singer. To sum it up, the casting, sets, and music including Alice Cooper are the strengths of this movie. The script is what it is. Watchable? Sure, I have seen much worse than this.",7,1,3,14 October 2012
Hancock," OK Will the real Super Hero Smith Please Get a Great Script
","Will Smith is a very talented actor. One of these days he will get a great script and prove it to everybody. This is film better than I Am Legend, but it is not the one with a great script. Smith plays a rude & crude super hero who has no idea why he is a hero and does not like being called A-Hole. I watched the unrated DVD version of Hancock which is 10 minutes longer than the movie theater version of it. The extra minutes help the film as the theater version is chopped up too short.It is kind of neat to me having a hero named Hancock. Hancock is a common name used for towns in several states much less being an acronym for everyman as in John Hancock which is the full name of Smith's character. To me, the lack of a master/super villain helps this film because the film isn't long enough to develop that villain. The film title reminds me of a football coach I had. We were playing a team from the town of Hancock, and doing sprints in practice prior to the game. As we started the sprints he said, first you run 20 yards and yell Han, then you run 20 yards and yell c-ck. Then after realizing what he said, he decided we should not do the yelling, especially within ear shot of the horny female cheerleaders.",7,1,2,11 April 2009
Hitch," Light Hearted Romantic Comedy
","You don't normally associate Will Smith with a light romantic comedy. This films proves he can do this. The film is well done & is about the right length for this type of film. To me this is one of Will Smiths best films because he fits the role.The support cast has loads of talent from a member of the King of Queens TV cast to Michael Rapport from The War At home. All the cast does well.Will Smith is Albert Hitchins, an expensive matchmaker who goes around hiring out his services which are making it possible for any man to be attractive to the woman of his dreams- within reason. Then he gets a client who is a dorky CPA who is in love with his boss. The realization of that dream is what most of this movie deals with.The sub-plot involves an ugly client gone wrong who tries to ruin Hitch to a scandal sheet newspaper reporter. Of course the reporter is a knock out & Hitch falls in love with her.This film has a happily ever after sub-plot, but that is what romantic comedy is all about.",8,0,1,15 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Completes The Saga Well But
","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.Now we find out how the completion of the dark side happens. We find out about Luke & Leia. The story gets back in with the special effects in this one, which makes it the strongest entry since Return of The Jedi.In a way, Luke & Leia birth could be tied to folks who believe in the Davinci code. If the real Christ had married & had kids, their origins too would have to have been hidden to protect the 'son of God' from being exposed as a real human being. Anakin, though, is a mixture of the divine & the slave so the Davinci connection is a real stretch.While this film has plenty of action, it has enough acting sequences to make it a stronger film. It completes the saga well but it spoils the surprise on episode 5 as it reveals who Lukes dad really is 2 episodes earlier. So now, if you watch these from 1 through 6, the plot development does not make any sense in that regard.The trouble is, it pretty much has to be told this way. To me, the correct order of the 6 films for plot development are 1, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3. In this way, you start at the beginning, then you put in the prime films, and then end it with how you go to the prime films. Now, I wonder if the rumors of episodes 7, 8, & 9 are still valid? Will the Lucas team get around to those considering his advancing age & other projects in his life now? Stay tuned movie fans because Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.",8,2,4,23 February 2007
Ray," Vivid Portait of Ray Charles
","Jamie Foxx is perfect for this role. Even stronger when I viewed it as how the story is told. This films portrays a vivid image of Ray Charles as he really was. It does not pander like some biographical films to just showing his greatness.Beyond Ray Charles real life drug addiction & his real life inspirations which are told so very well by use of childhood flash backs, the image of how he used his hearing to make up for the loss of his sight is amazing. Ray is presented as not a fragile human because of being blind, but as an inspiration. Though the real Ray Charles over-came a lot to be successful, some basic flaws are shown.Most interesting is the business side of Ray Charles portrayed in the film. He is presented as a shrewd & tough business man who rarely shows his emotions when he makes a business decision. This is a side of Ray Charles never seen by the public until this movie. This movie is excellent viewing & if you get the DVD with 14 extra scenes that were deleted, all but one of these scenes add more to the film. I highly recommend the film in either version.",8,1,2,2 March 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Historic Cornerstone Not Aging Well
","The real strength of this film is the animation. The reason it was so popular in 1937 when it was released was the bright colors & production quality that is obvious when you view it on a large screen. The music is top notch for it's era too. This was a full length color feature a full year plus before Robin Hood (1938). That and the popular Walt Disney who had already established himself in cartoons is why this became a land mark Disney film for many years.Being the first however, the film now faces many of the draw backs that another Disney Feature, Song of The South, now faces. It is totally based upon a Fairy Tale & the Snow White children's tale has not aged well. The story in todays contemporary is now considered sexist. There are some negative messages in here because as a hallmark of Disney's, there is an adult level here which is beyond what the kids see. It has an unintentional negative message for children in the ending as well.Still, this movie is important & not just as a historic first. This movies success is a primary reason that the 1939 Wizard of Oz was produced. Because this film sold so many tickets was a major reason for the way Oz was produced & why MGM spent so much money & time producing it 2 years later. MGM wanted to make the kind of money Disney made on this one.Snow White has declined because of the story factors, but she usually still graces Disney World with her presence.",7,1,7,8 August 2010
Inception," Separation Of Dreams & Reality Working Together
","Inception an event that is a beginning; a first part or stage of subsequent events.I put this definition up as a compliment to this excellent film. Christopher Nolan wrote & directed this film & I have no doubt it is his best effort yet. While his films like Batman Begins & The Prestige are good films, this one goes beyond to where excellent is the only word which applies.Michael Caine seems to be in Nolan films a lot, but in this one Caine has his smallest role of any Nolan film. Taken in context, that fact and a still excellent film means high compliments. This is without a doubt Leonardo DiCaprio's best role on film. It is the best script by far that he has been involved with, even better than Titanic.Cobb (DiCaprio) is the center piece character that holds this whole film together. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is strong in support & this film actually has 2 women in strong support as Mal (Marion Cotillard) is Cobb's deceased wife & almost as much a part of the story as Ariadne. 7 other male actors are heavily involved too. This is Sci-Fi Suspense at it's finest. It is a mixture of the action of James Bond, the suspense of Hitchcock, & a stronger multi layered story so well written & constructed that the film flows by pulling in the viewer so completely that your surprised how late it is by the time you leave the theater.Two viewings could help though I believe on my first one I grasped pretty well what is going on. The second viewing could give me more insight into the story, & would still be just as entertaining I am sure. The ending will leave you breathless, satisfied, & mystified all in one package. That means it is a classic ending.The film does employ a couple of other bits of classic film making I recognized. That is not bad as this film is a breath of fresh air. Granted, the main actors all do well in their role, but the great story, strong script, & a film that is not overloaded with special effects but uses its effects to advance the story line in the right proportion, I rate it just about perfect.",10,1,6,21 July 2010
Defiance," Good Acting By The Entire Cast, Good Atmosphere
","This is one of the better roles I have seen for Daniel Craig (the latest James Bond). In fact, I see great support for Craig by the entire cast. The location shooting in Lithuania gives the film a feel of realism and it is obvious some extreme care was taken in shooting this film. The atmosphere created by the Eastern Europe locations is a definite plus here.The main minus is that even though this is based upon a true story, the story has been Hollywoodized a bit. Though not as skewed as Valkerie, some liberties have been taken with the history. I find this the only minus though not an extreme minus like Valkerie because this films makes a lot more effort towards realism.The action sequences are more numerous, and better done. There is lot of interaction between the cast members and more real life type situations in Defiance, where Valkerie is a sort of stagnant film where the characters are more emotionless card board cutouts. While I don't say this is a must see, it is a breath of fresh air seeing an acting Daniel Craig compared with the last Bond film where he had no script in Quantum of Solace to work with.",7,0,2,26 December 2009
Lord of War," Doesn't Quite Make The Sale
","I like Nicholas Cage enough to have suffered through some of his worst films. While this is not the worst one, it is also not the best. The film makers here are trying to tell a true story. They just forget that to tell a true story, you need to tell the truth & make it in a documentary style. This comes close, but does not achieve that level.Cage plays a gun runner who is one of the biggest ones on the International Arms dealer stage. Trouble is between his narration & interruptions in the story, very few people get too act much. The best acting job scary as it might seem goes to the actor who plays the President (Dictator) of Liberia.There is a fair amount of realism & story telling here. There are points where Cage narration contains elements of facts. The question is considering the subject matter- where have the film makers been allowed to tell the truth & where did they have to lie. It is hard for me as a viewer to tell because the looking glass we are being taken through is a gray & shadowy world with little public knowledge that a viewer can relate too.I give them credit for trying.",5,2,5,31 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Holmes Update Could Have Been Told Better
","Rachel Adams, Jude Law, & Robert Downey Jr. are the strengths of this film. The weakness is the complicated structure given to the film by Director Guy Richie. In this case the film might have been more effective telling the story more straight forward. While Richies film looks highly stylized, he gambles on losing members of his audience with the way he sequences it.Richies idea is at times to drill into Sherlock Holmes head and reflect what Holmes plans are before he executes them, then have him execute them. He then has times where he has Holmes do something, then show how he did it afterwords. I was able to follow this.The depiction of Holmes character is indeed an accurate one, and I give Richie credit for staying away from the Basil Rathbone styled Holmes. The performances of the cast and the atmosphere created for the film look very good on the screen which helps the film immensely.Rachel Adams acts & looks great in this & it seems there are some decent sparks between her and Downey's Holmes. Think with more directing experience Richie might find he doesn't have to work as hard on style but do more with substance.",7,0,3,1 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," Real Tight Drama
","This is really a tight drama which reminds one very much of the mood & tone of the Godfather series. When I went to see this film, all I had heard was it was a story of the birth of the CIA. After seeing it, I understand that all too well. The story is done, starting from the Bay of Pigs CIA failure, & then going back to the beginning of the CIA.It is obvious that when the CIA was born, in wartime, that it had to be a secretive organization. This story runs true to that as it is about as cloak & dagger as it gets. The main character get drafted into the start of the CIA much the way many people got drafted into the war itself- his friends in the college fraternity decide he belongs & they make him an offer he can't refuse.At the same time, he has an indiscreet affair with his friends sister (Jolie), she becomes pregnant, & going with these times, he has to do the right thing & marry her. After the wedding, he starts his cloak & dagger work in London & does not see his wife or son until after the war. During this time, the story hints that she might have been seeing another man, but then never really shows for sure if there is or not.Our operative has been distanced from his wife, & stays that way the rest of the film as they are at least split entirely by the end of the film if not totally divorced. His job becomes more & more mysterious as it seems everyone he trusts in the movie eventually becomes someone he can't trust. There is always someone looking 'over his shoulder'.His son grows up & follows dads footsteps into the agency. After going through all this background that leads to the Bay of Pigs, it is strongly hinted that someone spilled the beans to Castro's agents & that is why it failed. As he investigates, it turns out that his son, is who that someone appears to be, spilling what he overheard his dad say to his girlfriend who might or might not have been an agent involved with another double agent. In Godfather type fashion, both the girl & the double agent are eliminated by dad to protect his son.This film is a long tight drama which very much paints the CIA as an intelligence agency of our government which was created during the war to help the war effort, & then became an agency which abused it's powers much the same way a dysfunctional Mafia family would to creates its own problems under the guise of defending America. Our tale does throw in a few real historic themes of what happened including the hints that when JFK took office he intended to destroy the agency.Sadly, it might be years, if ever, that the real story of Americas legal arm of the Mafia can ever or will ever be told. This film does a great job of showing how the agency truly operates without getting too specific. If you like well done, intense drama, this is your kind of film. It makes the viewer think about a monster created by a war with another monster, Adolf Hitler.At well over 2 hours, it can almost lose the viewer as it does the story using several flashbacks from the Bay of Pigs to earlier times but I didn't get lost, so it does the job better than most films of this genre.166",8,3,4,21 February 2007
Stalag 17," Hogans Hero's Lampooned This Movie
","That's right, while the sitcom has no real relation to how this film was done, they did borrow some character names & a lot of the costumes from this movie. Larry Hovis dressed like Peter Graves character in Stalag 17. Sgt. Schultz is a character in this movie & the TV show.The setting is 1944, in this tough German camp. These guys want to escape but a German stooge has been planted amongst them to prevent it by getting information about their activities. The story goes through & finally figures out who the stooge is & mete out his just punishment.The film is solid because it is borrowed from a Broadway show included some of the cast & tells a powerful drama with a little comedy mixed in to help it through. William Holden is excellent at the lead suspect. Peter Graves is excellent as the prisoners head of security. Otto Preminger is good as the German POW Camp Commander in a limited role.This film is very solid & deserves it's place in the top 250 list.",9,1,3,30 April 2007
The Terminal," Spielberg Keeps It Interesting
","How unlikely is it that a film where a man is stuck in an airline terminal as a plot becomes an interestingly entertaining story? Most folks that were stuck in Denver earlier this winter wouldn't think so. In this case though, this is not a weather related incident.This is Eastern European immigrant (Hanks) who gets caught in the terminal due to a government catch 22. It becomes illegal for him to either enter our country or return to his own. Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, & Chi McBride head a strongly talented cast that bring this off very well.The film has humor, charm, warmth, & an absurdity which are unique to American Cinema. The story is set at JFK Airport & shows what happens when a rock meets a hard place & neither side wants to give an inch. This a a fable with a lot of talent & is brought off well. Now, if only they could solve the problems with airline food, we'd have a real miracle here. Still, this is a very watchable film.167",7,0,1,21 February 2007
The Blind Side," Heart Warming Story Strangely Politicized
","Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) makes his first major film outside of the Disney Company. It is based upon the true story of Michael Oher, an Offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens. The story features a group of football coaches playing themselves during the recruiting segment. It is based upon Michael Lewis 2006 novel. It is interesting that this story uses politics to base most of its humor. The humor stereotypes the no-no topic of black men with white women & then adds a social comment about the kids at school making fun of the white Republican family with the adopted black son. It is necessary to do this because of the way the true story happened though it is treated like this is still a social taboo? That might be true in the area this movie takes place, but that taboo has been shattered in many areas of this country many years ago now. Still, I guess it enhances the story because it helps provide a more vivid image to the background Michael Oher grew up in. It makes it easier for Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) to look like someone above the fray, willing to bring a disadvantaged young black man into her family & come off looking better than others. Since it appears the real Tuohy family is Republican, this is a great way to attempt too poke fun at both parties on this issue. One thing it does do real well, it shows how Football Coaches are sometimes out of touch with their players.The movie comes off though I think the viewer might be better off taking time too read the Michael Lewis book in order to get a better perspective on what the reality of the story is. This one is obviously cleaned up from the reality in order to keep a moderate PG-13 rating. This reflects Hancocks Disney roots. This keeps it close to a warm fuzzy family film.Still, the movie preserves the message of creating hope for those with out it. Bullock's character dominates the film, hence the academy award. Everyone in the cast does well with the script they are given & Quinton Aaron deserves a lot of credit in how he plays Oher. He portrays a troubled & despaired young man very well. You can almost see his inner struggles in the performance.",7,0,3,21 October 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Great Story Telling
","To me this is one of the best told prison movies ever made. After watching the Blue Ray Version - it is more than a prison movie too. While Morgan Freeman's performance and narration are tour DE force, the support cast is outstanding. Even the ancient James Whitmore has a good role in this one.I noted on the credits that Steven King contributed to his writing being converted into a movie. There is no doubt this one benefits from that. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game here too. Frank Darabont directs and writes this movie and the viewer gets the feeling that the director pictured how the story should be told when he wrote it along with when he directed it.This movie is the ultimate trip about injustice and justice within the prison system. It draws deep characters for each role which seem to take advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate triumph over despair. Bob Gunton gets kudos from here for his role as the warden.When your looking for a movie to watch, there are few to beat this picture as this one just turned out perfect. If every film were this well done, they would all be best pictures.",10,1,1,27 December 2013
Parasite," Incredible Situation of Social Drama
","When I started watching this I thought well here is a caption film and I haven't watched one in a while. I fully expected that because of the captions I would lose track of the story. Then, as I got into this film, I realized I was being drawn into the social fabric of South Korea. I appreciated it more and more as the film moved on.We have a desperate family living in a basement. The son has a friend whose leaving for college in America. His friend asks him to tutor his girlfriend while he is away at school because he trusts him. The girlfriend has a wealthy upper middle class family. So on his classmate recommendation he gets the job.Then the son finds he can get his entire family jobs with his new employer as well. So pretty soon the desperate family is all working and getting involved with the employers family. The social consequences of this become more and more complex as the desperate family is not telling their employers they are all related to each other. The wealthy family has many issues of it's own as well.Character development here is excellent and key to this as their relationship becomes more and more complex. Everything is going well until one week-end when the middle class family is taking their youngest son camping for a week-end. Then we find out some dark hidden secrets of their house as their employees decide to have a party at the employers house. Then the employees find out about a dark hidden secret in their employers house and everything starts falling apart for both families.I don't want to get too technical here because even though I warn for spoilers, I would rather the complexity of these social interactions are better if you see them for yourself, than my getting too detailed describing them. This is great writing and direction of a very complex social order story. It teaches the viewer about South Korean Culture and South Korea in a way that is unexpected, but very welcome. While the results of everything coming apart might not make some viewers happy, the way it happens when things come apart make total sense. There is some mild adult material here, but it is done milder than many R rated films.All the cast fit their roles and get plenty of chance to act. They really make the viewer feel what is going on and where complex relationships have to wind up. The title is a give away in that the desperate family does become parasites to the wealthy family. The way it happens is what makes this movie special. Kudos to all the folks who have given this movie awards. It deserves all of them. The film takes the viewer into a different world, and does so in a unique manner.",9,1,1,6 May 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Unique - Drum Roll - You Have to be there
","This is a comedy satire winning best picture that has to be an acquired taste. Michael Keaton and Zach are a unique pairing and the story is original. Oscar loves this one.I say you have to be there because this one is perfect if your really into it. History tells us Oscar ant the public are out of step a bit at times. For example, the Classic Marx Brothers film DUCK SOUP got the brothers fired by Paramount Studios because it bombed at the box office. Meanwhile their prior film HORSEFEATHER's was a huge hit selling tickets, and a better film, but the subject of making fun of college's does not sell as well in Hollywood as anti-war political satire.Birdman does hit satire on a lot of current themes and explores new ways to use CGI in a satire. Still, it needs development which means Oscar might not have chosen well honoring this one as best picture.Then again, Paramount did not choose well when they fired the Marx Brothers prior to their making a Night At The Opera.You either love this movie or I suggest you go too the lobby until this all blows over.",2,3,6,13 July 2015
Halloween," Ultimate Halloween Scare Film
","I can't believe someone just had the nerve to try & remake this John Carpenter classic. This film is outstanding as a Halloween scare film all the way through.Jamie Lee Curtis really gained her fame in her role for this film, initially. She is the baby sitter who keeps just missing getting killed. Donald Pleasance is excellent as the Doctor who is going overboard & is making his career out of pursuit of this killer. A lot of the support is good in this too.The main image from this film that is ingrained in your head upon viewing is the classic jack-o-lantern lit on the front porch of the house. It's symbolism just stays with you the entire film. This is a modern classic which should be left to stand on it's own merits. Even a second viewing & you catch subtle things Carpenter put into the film which you might have missed the first time.",8,7,11,4 September 2007
Wonder Woman," More of What A Comic Book Fan Would Expect
","This is a Wonder Woman with a much harder edge than Lynda Carter's TV version. There are some things which are different, much different than what a fan of the TV series would expect.The CGI and effects are of course obviously much advanced over the TV version. Actually as a pg-13, the sexuality in this one is much less than the old TV show. I always drooled for Lynda Carter. The way Gal Godot is presented in this one, while she is attractive, she is presented more as strong than as sexy. She is a strong and determined independent Super Hero with Super Powers.As far as being charming as well as sexy, that is downplayed in this one. There are a few really conservative jokes about fidelity and sex manuals, but other than those, this is a totally family friendly action film. The CGI graphics are good, and the action sequences are good though some of the action is a bit intense. Danny Huston and David Thewlis are the main baddies and Chris Pine is a more personable Steve Trevor whose role is actually upgraded to a Spy in this plot line. Trevor actually has a lot of feelings expressed at times in his role for Wonder Woman. He is much different than the Trevor on the TV series.The plotting is a little muddled and crazy, but comic book fans of Wonder Woman should be happy with the results. It could have been done better though. Still, this should sell a lot of tickets. It is good.",8,5,11,18 June 2017
Back to the Future Part II," A Skewed Look at the Future
","Thomas F Wilson becomes a more central character in this movie. That is because Biff is in a lot of the action. The film starts with Doc Brown transporting Marty & his girlfriend Jennifer to the future. Once there, Jennifer is drugged & out of the way for most of the time.Doc wants Marty to rescue Marty's son from certain disaster. This film, shot at the same time as part 3, is actually more of a bridge from 1 to 3. It introduces a lot of the themes that would complete the saga. Biff is in the movie as old Biff & young Biff & young adult playboy Biff.While Wilson does a good job playing Biff, he is portrayed as stupid in every time zone. No matter what Biff does, things don't turn out well for him. Overall, the use of flashbacks is clever and it can hold an audience, but because of all the plot devices introduced, the film is kind of like a rest stop between the 2 action films, parts 1 & 3.",7,0,1,14 January 2008
Black Panther," Believe The Box Office, It Is Great
","This movies production is a merger of South Korea, Georgia (USA) and Australia. I have never read the comic books but this movie is very well done. The locations, the cast, and the production between Marvel, Disney, and Lucas Films is once again film magic.The Scenery is astounding, the special effect are right on, and most importantly the script is excellent giving the actors room to act and they do it so well. One of the Script Writers, is also the director(Ryan Coogler) of the film Creed. There are a couple members of the cast from that film too. The costumes are amazing, and the sound track is spot on. The theme of unity at the end is a good message. The film length at slightly over 2 hours is about right. As far as the entertainment, well Stan Lee is definitely holding on here for safe keeping. Andy Serkis from the Apes movie series is Ulysses Klaue, and though his role is cut short, he plays him to the hilt. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan head up a talented cast. The ladies including Lupita Nyong (Star Wars-The Force Awakens) do not by any stretch take a back seat to the male cast.There's so much action, it is very nearly the end of the film before there is any romance. By the time the films kisses come, well, the credits roll shortly after. There's lots of crudos to go around on this movie. Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) is Everett K Ross, a former pilot and CIA agent whose nowhere near being in charge in this film. Letitia Wright as Shuri stands out.As usual, wait and watch the credits for some surprises, and to applaud an excellent cast and crew put together to make this one.",8,12,33,19 February 2018
Iron Man," Computer Animation & Stan Lee- A Modern Marriage Made in Heaven
","Stan Lee & his comic character creations are a marriage made in movie heaven. The success of the Spider Man series has proved this. This is the latest creation from Stan Lees characters of Marvel Comics. It is an entertaining film.Genius Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghnistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony's data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon.There are some sparks between Paltrow & Downey Junior which can be developed. This is not as strong an entry as the Spiderman series yet because it falls a little short on story. This is because these script writers just wrote their first script with Lee's material. Maybe with more development and the next sequel which is sure to be coming, it will get stronger. There are a lot of good things here though.It appears that casting of Starks & Pepper are right to carry this series on. I am wondering when & if they are going to try to bring Thor, the God of Thunder, another of Lees characters to the screen. That shall be a major challenge. With a stronger story line & more development between Stark & Pepper, this can become as strong as the Spiderman series. Stan Lees material being brought to the big screen is becoming a blessing to modern film viewers.",6,0,2,26 December 2008
The Greatest Showman," Superb Movie./ Show on All Levels
","The story here of PT Barnum is done in a daring musical here, and in the real spirit of the great showman, it works. The point of the greatest showmans life is the show. This movie brings this spirit into the telling of the story perfectly. Jenny Bicks story adaptation to the screen is a greatly paced masterpiece. The lyrics for the music here are from the same folks who did La La Land, but this music soundtrack leaves that movie in the dust. This is the best musical I have seen in a long time. The mixture of dialogue to musical is perfect. Hugh Jackman is fabulous in the Barnum role. I never saw the live Broadway show Barnum years back, so I am not sure if the film owes anything to that. I fell in love with Zendaya, playing the Anne Wheeler aerial role. She actually rises to the top of the Co-Starring roles, even though her role was not intended to be a main role. Michelle Williams /Charity Barnum role starts off well, but fades later in the film. She is good, but suffers a bit from lack of script in the last 20 minutes of the film.Zac Efrons/ Phillip Carlyle is excellent acting, and his scenes with Zendaya are electricity in a bottle. The film does get a couple of excellent messages about the society Barnum existed in. The first of these is about the New York City rich elite snobs. These folks really did exist, and in some cases still do. It took the television era to actually get through these walls put up by these puffed up egotistic people. The second is about how Barnum in his shows took down these walls and accepted everyone because he did not start as one of these snobs. His sole purpose was to be the Greatest Showman.Sometimes Barnum almost certainly, as this story suggests, lost sight of everyone and everything around him trying to promote himself. That is one of the best things this story/movie captures. This is truly, the spirit of Barnum.",9,0,1,1 February 2018
Ben-Hur," Long Ago & Not So Far Away, An Empire Started Here
","Quite long ago, on a planet that we are on, a 16 year old saw this movie & then with a vivid imagination, developed in his mind a science fiction saga which borrowed many elements from this film. When the scene of the stars in the sky form over Bethlehem & that special star forms, that image makes one wonder in awe about our universe. Wyler's awe inspiring sequence has definitely been extended. The magic star here marks where Christ is born, & it is that magic which would ironically become a death star in the teenagers mind. The universe that the star is located in, even more magical.That teenager was George Lucas. This film has an evil Empire (Rome). It has an all powerful force (Christ) which unites Arab & Jew to overcome & defeat Rome. In fact, the Empire actually helps create its own defeat like Anakin Skywalker does by crossing into the dark side. Masala betrays his childhood & past by embracing the evil Roman Empire. Most folks don't realize, the novel this is based upon is a great work of Fiction, from the 19th Century. Many people have realized the small parallel (pod races) between this movies chariot race & George Lucas saga. What most don't realize is the overall theme parallel between them as well. When a 16 year old Lucas saw this film, he built upon it's fictional plot to build an entire Science Fiction Empire. Even the slave theme,the betting sequence & the virgin birth are all borrowed in Episode 1.Stephen Boyd in his greatest screen role as Masala is in the races here. The crime is that Boyd never got more roles like this as his talent here is great as basically a co-star. 4 horse chariots, & magnificent looking horses. Instead of Darth Vadar, we have the Emperior of Rome, his designate is Pontius Pilate whose role in Biblical History is more notable than Jabba the Hut's in Star Wars saga is.This is the role Charlton Heston will be most remembered for. Granted, he played Moses & Taylor in the original Planet of the Apes film, but this film is his, all the way. The film story is centrally located on Judah Ben Hur. It has some diversions such as his relationship with Mesala,his encounters with Jesus Christ, his family, the Roman master from the slave ship, & the Arab Prince whose white horses he races in the great chariot race. All the supporting folks are excellent in their roles.Heston compliments the British supporting cast acting particularly in making the film stronger. The original novel by (Gen) Lew Wallace was actually written in the 1800's. It's theme is something which doesn't even work in the modern world, the alliance of an Arab with a Jew. This screenplay credit for this version is deceptive in that Gore Vidal and another writer rewrote the script as shooting was going on. Their work is amazing considering they were often one day ahead of shooting their rewrites. In the novel, & earlier 1925 version and the Broadway shows which preceded it, Judah Ben Hur is converted by his encounters with Christ to being a Christian. This was changed in the 1959 version to appeal to a wider audience.Things to look for- the opening depiction of the birth of Christ by Wyler, the depiction of Christ teaching crowds of people, the stunning portrayal of the crucifixion without all the violence Mel Gibson found necessary later in the PASSION Of The Christ where he was trying to present graphic details rather than the existential ones which are done effectively here. The Carpenter shop & tie ins of Christ with Judah Ben Hur. The Roman galley ship battle sequences are well done too.There is a silent version of this which is interesting made in 1925. The stories are roughly the same with a few differences including the ending. Full sized Roman Galleys were built for the 1925 film and one was accidentally torched & burned during filming with the actual fire being used in the final film. Both films were MGM's most expensive projects when they were made. Both included filming in Italy, though the 1925 version got so messed up in Italy that it had to be finished in the United States.Heston spent a month prior to filming learning & practicing how to race the actual chariots. The white horses are named after stars whose names are later used in Science fiction works.",10,2,5,17 October 2006
Casino Royale," Fleming Material Makes Better Film For 007
","A trip back to Ian Flemming actually benefits & renews the Bond film series. While our new Bond resembles a British Steve McQueen in looks, this film has a more serious tone than the last few outings. His looks are not as important as the fact that this movie calls for him to act & he does.The reduction in gadgets & increase in story using Flemings material benefits this film greatly. The actors in support do well. There are even sections of this film without action which is really rare in the Bond series. Some great scenery in the locales used in the film, & the opening sequence in black & white is quite effective.The humor is not as abundant, but the settings are more realistic than most Bond films & this one has a quality of drama to it. The poker sequences are well done & for a rare time in a Bond film he actually loses a few hands. The setting for parts of this film is the same place where Anakin Skywalker wed in Satr Wars 2 for you Lucas fans.There is a neat sequence where a house in Venice is sunk, literally. Not sure how they pulled this off but it looks much more real than the effects in Die Another Day did.Good film, & an opening for a sequel at the end of the film which has never been done in a Bond movie before. Well worth the time spent compared with previous films.Now, as this is the only year with 007 for the next 1000 years, will a sequel be ready to come out this year that will continue to re-new & refresh the series as this one has started too? Happy Bond Year, 007 to you all!!",9,2,5,23 November 2006
Bull Durham," Like Kevin Costner But this film is over-rated
","Kevin Costner is a fine actor, and is believable in a role as a ball player. Problem with this film is a poor script. A fine cast is wasted by the script. The script makes the situation seem not real, and the humor is poorly done.The late Max Patkin, clown prince of baseball is excellent & I saw him live at a minor league game, he was a class act & the script does not ruin his cameo role in this film. Too bad the whole film was not about Max, as a story about his life would make an interesting film. Bull Durham's problem is the script for the rest of the story this film tells is so mediocre. It is not written well enough to hang jokes on.This film could have been so much better that I think even Costner realized it & went on to do FIELD OF DREAMS in order to try & make the public forget about this effort. Baseball has been done in comedy form in a lot of films, & I would suggest the film MAJOR LEAGUE as being much better than this effort.",3,10,25,29 May 2005
Saving Mr. Banks," History Misses An Opportunity With Interest
","While this is the story of Mary Poppins, this movie pulls back the drapes on a real life drama behind it all in a 1960's Disney Studio that is at the top of the world then. It shows that even though the studio is at the top, some things were difficult to do.It is a story not known to exist - the recordings the author of Mary Poppins insisted be made while she was negotiating what was going to happen to her own creation on movie film.Tom Hanks takes on a difficult role in the same style he did when he has taken on other real life stories in his career like Apollo 13. The difference here is he is constrained by the over whelming memory of Walt Disney which prevents him from making a totally accurate account. This story does explain how the movie turned out. Dick Van Dyke is near the height of his career when the movie is released but there has always been a side of this movie which is surreal. That is explained here nicely. The movie is touchingly dedicated to one of Walt Disney's daughters who died in 2013. Very appropriate for this one. Disney and his children are members of the greatest generation of World War 2. His daughter represents a baby boomer that like Annette Funicello has now left us. This is a picture of a generation being left behind. It begs the question - would Mary Poppins be successful in the next generation?",8,0,1,29 December 2014
Speed," Action & Action But Aging
","This is a film where the viewer is pulled into the action & eventually gets pulled in by the acting. Dennis Hopper is very good as the mad retired cop bomber who just seems to want a bigger pension & will do anything to get it. When he is foiled the first time he tries, he develops a vendetta against his foils. That vendetta between him & Jack (Keanu Reeves) is a big part of what makes this movie go.The other part is Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) & Jack developing a relationship when thrown together by circumstances controlled by Howard Payne (Hopper). Bullock became a name from this film. The film moves as 116 minutes go fast. It's only weakness is the uneven moving from sequence to sequence. There are 3 main sequences, the opening, the main body of the film, & the conclusion. While each sequence is well done, the chops between each one are distinct, & abrupt. The better one is between the opening & the main part as the awards ceremony for Jack & Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) gives this chop more coherence.If there were a way to do this kind of action in live theater, this film is structured like a 3 act play. If you want 2 hours to fly by, literally, this film is good as it tells a story in a very traditional way but with lots of action.",7,0,0,15 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Action & More Action
","Live Free or Die Hard This is the first time I have ever seen any Die Hard film even though it is the 3rd film in the series. That does not matter as like other franchises, the plot in this one is self-contained having nothing to do with any of the others as far as I can tell. Everything makes sense, maybe too much sense.The plot is about a Washington insider getting a bunch of computer geeks to write him a bunch of programs which are an attack on the US Computer infrastructure. He then takes the programs & starts an attack on the country. It plays like a save the country plot for most of the film- until it is revealed late in the film what his real purpose is - spoiler - money.The film starts with a computer geek who wrote the program being killed. Our villain is systematically killing them off so he can cover his tracks using a team he has put together. Our hero (Willis) is then assigned to pick up one of the geeks still alive. His first scene is one where he is trying to protect his daughter's virtue (?) from a boyfriend at college. Sounds a little hokey, but it works.From there, this film takes off like the original film SPEED with plenty of action. It does a great job developing the villain's top Hench woman played ably by Maggie Q (who also did some fine work in Mission Impossible 3). After Willis & the Geek take care of her, they go after the top guy who has kidnapped Willis daughter.This film has plenty of action & some light comedy along the way. It is this summer's action thrill ride, runs over 2 hours & never gives you a second to rest until the end.",9,2,5,18 July 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Hanging Around The Closet
","When I go to a Marvel Comics film I expect to see action and this one has that. Usually there is some humor, and this one has that too. It does show some of the spirit of Stan Lee as he is on the crew that worked on this one.Overall a solid movie entry to the Thor series. It does has a talented cast - first movie I have seen Natalie Portman in since she turned 30. So far the maturity of the big 30 is holding up well on her.There is some very good things for Thor to build on here. While it is not perfect, it is solid. For anyone who left the theater early, better come back and check some very important scenes that happen during the credits.Anthony Hopkins once again adds another solid performance as Odin to his resume of films.The film does contain itself to about 2 hours which is great as some of these films get so wrapped up in action that they get boring when they go beyond that time and get boring.The settings are impressive, maybe even more so in 3D but I did not watch that version. Thors hammer rings up another score.",7,0,2,16 November 2013
Midway," CGI Comes of Age And Successful History
","After seeing the previous movies about Midway, I was not sure an update was needed. This movie says - yes, this one was needed. There are several reasons for it. The movies biggest strength is visual and it's next is no trying to over-reach.Previous versions of this story were melodramatic and hollywoodized beyond reality. This one isn't, and the best thing is no one cast member has such an ego that they attempt to dominate the movie. That is a refreshing change from previous depictions of this story.Intelligence information is used properly, and the lead up from 1937 to the Midway battle are really well done. The re-enactment of Pearl Harbor is well done. The miracle that the US Carriers were not in Pearl that day is not dwelled upon, just shown. That is the strength of the entire film. It is done as it happened. It amazes me that the 2 locations are Hawaii and Montreal, Canada.
It seems like there are more locales, but this is good film making, the story is rock solid, well written, and actually dominates the film instead of the acting. This does not happen often enough in movies.Loved the history of the characters at the end of the film, and did not realize that 2019 is the year the last of Doolittles raiders on the first bombing run on Tokyo died. It was important that this little side story got into the film. It was important as a morale boost to our efforts in the Pacific in the war. RIP",8,5,7,3 December 2019
The Producers," Another Nazi Spoof but with a Flair
","Nazi spoofs became big in the 1960's. Even before this movie, Hogan's Heros had already hit the TV screens & the Nazi's between the eyes. The difference is this is a bit more than a simple send up of the Nazi's.Zero Mostell is a broken down has been producer in desperate need of money. Gene Wilder is a book keeper who just happens to suggest a way to make money by cooking the books & deliberately producing a failure of a play. Mostell, desperate enough to grab at straws, grabs this one & tries to really produce a stinker.The only thing that goes wrong is that by trying to screw everything up, they accidentally make the play funny & in the process a hit. This is white collar crime in the 1960's, simple & funny unlike today when white collar crime has made this type of crime look like something from the age of innocence.The material in this is good enough the Brooks managed to recycle it all, but as far as this film & its newer incarnation, this one is the better one.",8,1,2,2 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," More Than You'd Expect To Set Up Episode 8
","I have been reading some reviews of this movie by a lot of folks who will get egg on their face when the next one comes out. There are a lot of plot parallels in this film including another son killing his father (which is a spoiler if you know who I am referring too). I have to laugh at people who are trying to critique George Lucas original ideas in this episodes plot. Harrison Ford does have the starring role to carry this movie.Meanwhile, back in the galaxy far away, there are some new factors in this one. For instance a cloned storm trooper who turns against the bad guys is new. The action sequences, like the original films, are James Bond type as the good guys shoot a lot better than the bad guys.As far as intelligence, no this movie is no more intelligent than Avatar as a critic in the LA Times points out. There are some twists here that make people who want to see the series at the same level as episodes 4,5,&6 angry. It is a lot better than episodes 1 & 2 which included a dreadful remake of Ben Hur with a young boy (too Young to be cast as Anakin) having an adult relationship with a much older teenager. Episode 2 was one of the slowest paced films of the entire series, though it had to fill in the story for Revenge of the Sith.For those not aware, Episode 6 was originally titled 'Revenge Of The Jedi' but then got changed to 'Return' before it was released. That is why Episode 3 was titled 'Revenge', to get the word into the series.The writers here are not George Lucas, but at least they had very few dead spots in the film. There were a couple of sequences which were not totally logical but that is the price we pay for modern movies which often do not make the scene totally logical. Still the viewer does not lose the plot here.There are some interesting questions for the next episode that come to mind. Will Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher get bigger roles? Will Harrison Ford be back? Who are Rey's parents (this episode leaves that open) even though she has Jedi powers. After the destruction of the dark side again in this episode, how will they return and will all the folks on each side remain on that side considering we have a defector in episode 7 for the first time. Nobody ever totally defected before in the other episodes though some like Lando played both sides. There is still a lot of life in what we have here, it really depends on the next script and how well the movie is handed. The humor between the droids is a little flat in this episode, but that can be fixed easily if some comedian has time to stop drinking coffee and consult the script writers on how to write lines.",8,6,26,27 December 2015
RED," Veteran Cast Produces Fun Comic Book Action
","While there are some sequencing issues, this movie is a lot of fun to watch with an excellent cast. Bruce Willis & Mary Louise Parker are the main leads. With support like Morgan Freeman, Karl Urban, & 93 year young Ernest Borgnine & a large cast, this film has a boat load of talent.DC Comics seems to be great material for entertaining films. Willis seems a natural in this role as Frank Moses - a retired black operations agent who is having a phone affair with a woman in Kanas City. All of a sudden, a group of gunmen enter his house to kill him and the action starts. The humor starts to fly as well & the more & more people who get involved, the more fun the film becomes.The audience gets plenty of laughs with the action here, definitely worth a look. Retired Extremely Dangerous",8,3,8,16 October 2010
Rear Window," Hitchcock At His Best
","Technically, this is the reverse of 1948's ROPE. ROPE's murder happens behind a closed curtain. This films observes everything through open windows & curtains. There was so little wasted footage in this because Hitch knew what he wanted to shoot before he shot it, that there was less than 10 minutes edited from the film as shot. The efficiency is almost as good as ROPE but the sequences are shorter. Jimmy Stewart plays a man with a broken leg in an apartment complex (so large a set that the crew came to think of the set as home during the shooting of this film) with nothing better to do than gawk out at all the neighbors while he is recovering. Grace Kelly in one of her last & best complex roles before becoming Princess Grace is Stewarts girlfriend (also presented as a bit of a tomboy as well as being a sensuous beauty) who winds up along with Stewart's maid getting involved in the mystery that a neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) presents because of how he is observed by Stewart.This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, presenting situations in which the viewer gets emotionally involved & wants to help the folks on screen with their dilemma. From the short story is added other folks in the story from Miss Lonely Hearts, to others as Stewart, much more comfortable in this film than he was in ROPE, is on the mend from a broken leg peering in on the multiple apartments & people in this little world. It is a fine film because even though the action is all limited to one huge set (apartment & window to a multi-apartment complex) for the most part, it explores & surprises the viewer with what can happen in such a static situation. I am thankful the studio came out with a restored version as this is a film that is well worth restoring to it's original form. Thelma Ritter is exceptional in her role as Stewarts maid.The tension when the salesman (Burr) confronts Stewart in his apartment is brilliant & the technical use of now outdated flashbulb photography still plays well as setting the tension in this sequence.",10,0,1,19 September 2006
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," This is Very Well Done
","I have not read these books. I was with someone who had and they told me that compared to the first film in the series, this one is much better. There is a whole lot of reasons they sighted but the biggest one is that the first film was not very good at portraying the symbolism of the book. This one more than makes up for that. This film is a long adventure into this saga. Without reading the books, I liken it to an adventure film that is twisted with plots and subplots with suspense at every turn. The cast all seems perfect for their roles. Young Jennifer Lawrence seems perfect for her role as Katniss. The love stories between her and other cast members seems to be very real. This film reveals this young actress as one who should have a very bright future in films.Donald Sutherland is an excellent choice in an impressive cast as the President. The cast is so good I list them below. I can tell without reading the books that they are good material because the entire cast gets an excellent script to work from and bring off their moments to shine in great form.Now I need to read these books because part 3 will be coming and I believe if it is the same quality as this one that reading the books will allow me to get more out of it. It might spoil the plot for me, but the way Jennifer Lawrence fills the screen in this one, it will be a pure pleasure. This film is definitely that. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent in the support cast as well. It would be difficult to make this film any better than it already is.Jennifer Lawrence ...

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Episode 4 Came First
","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. This is the film, & it established Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill), OBEONE KANOBI (Alec Guiness), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) & Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) as part of a group rebels fighting the evil Empire, the Emperor & Darth Vader. In parallel with Ben Hur is the one quote which carries the next 3 episodes. 'Strike me down, Darth, & I will become more powerful than you can ever imagine.' This Obeone Kanobi quote makes & Darth's slaying him, makes his character like Christ in Ben Hur as Kanobi dies & then his spirit lives on in the force against the Empire. A New Hope was just that for the American movie goer as this film represented a new hope that films are made which entertain & stimulate the imagination. George Lucas accomplished this & set the stage for much more with this movie. While the film had to be done on a tighter budget than the rest of the series, this made the acting & script more important in this film than in the others. This film made us want more. The climatic Death Star Raid sequence is arguably one of the best battle sequences ever in a science fiction film. It grips the audience with the fate of the rebellion in the balance. When I first saw this film, the great counter balance was with C3PO & R2D2 as robots behaving like Abbott & Costello for comic relief from all the serious acting going on around them. This balance is important in making this film entertaining too, though is often over-looked by film critics. This film created a hero for a whole generation of film fans, even 2 generations now.Few films have captured the imagination enough to spawn 2 sequels & 3 prequels which have all done well. Then there is something about evil empires & young hero's fighting impossible odds & winning which brings out the film fan in all of us.",9,1,2,28 September 2006
50_50," Cancer Sucks And This Movie Gets That Right
","Levitt as the son with Cancer gets credit from me for playing a difficult role very well. Seth Rogan is a good co-star who has some shining moments. The women here all do well, from the one dimensional ones (one night stands) to the main ones. Kendrick is one of 2 red heads that shines in this one. I thought when watching this that one of the one-night fun women that they meet in a night club sounds exactly like Mila Kunis. Maybe this is an uncredited cameo or maybe another actress has her voice?The story does present a balance that any disease like Cancer is not fair. It is a little wild in that the disease can be used to hit on women. To the films credit, it balances that by the guys who are older victims of the disease and showing how miserable it is when the disease wins. Real life takes turns that often do not agree with anyone, and there are times that the media trys to put everyone in the same category using group think about issues.This one gets outside the box on the issue of Cancer and avoids the sterotypes that are often associated with the illness. It does have some R rated language, but then it is appropriate. Worth a look for the way the subject is handled and a talented cast doing it well with a good script.",8,0,0,30 April 2018
Deadpool," Double Punch This One Marvel
","This is just flat out an excellent film. It satisfies the Marvel characters really well, and it put out humor even faster than the action, which is a good thing. The film jams lots of punch into it's nearly 2 hour running time. The 2 Marvel writer who wrote this script seem to really be hitting their stride. It seems like this one has the pace of a run away train, but it stays completely on track and does not derail.This one take full advantage of the action and spaces it well with the humorous banter. It aids some neat graphics as well. The CGI action is impressive here, very realistic. The script take advantage of the humor between the characters very well. Deadpool is immortal, and that makes it possible to do almost anything with them. They never even seem to run out of jokes. With the double meanings of many of the jokes making them even better, this movie really does most everything right.This is how to design and execute an entertaining film. Highly recommend this one.",9,3,12,18 February 2016
300," Gritty battle Film
","Kudos to Gerald Butler & Lena Heady who bring off their roles as King & Queen of Sparta really well. They get some capable support but they are the two lynch pins that hold this film together well. This is based upon the same story as The 300 Spartans in 1962 & is very well done. The computer efforts here look much better than the remake of King Kong's effect did just a short time ago. I enjoyed this film, as it is unpretentious about being an action film. The film is exactly as advertised.The action takes place in the 5th Century BC, when 300 Spartans held off thousands of Persians for 3 days in order to give the rest of Greece time to mount up their defenses. After this battle, the Atneian Navy used a similar strategy of luring the larger Persian Navy into a smaller water area and soundly thrashing the Persian fleet. The sex in this film is mild & artfully crafted, not something you need to worry about taking a teenager too. The violence, if brutal & if you have a teen who does not like violence such as be-headings, this might not be a film for them. This film knows where it is at & does a fine job of bringing it off. One of the better film remakes in quite a while. Would highly recommend the tale of King Leonidas fighting to extinction to slow the invading hoards from Persia from conquest of Ancient Try & Greece. The Persion Leaders all seem to have a lot of body pierced hardware on. Almost looks like some of the modern day body piercing. Not sure how well this look fits historically, but it is not that important in how the film is staged & how the story is told. For someone into gritty battle films, this is a must see.",9,1,6,26 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Way overdue Idea Makes It Big Time
","Many years ago as the James Bond series got more and more imaginative, it began to look more like a comic book. Here some writers took a comic book and very successfully turned it into a screenplay and movie. Heck yes, this should have been done long ago. Heck yes the special effects are enough to make ones head explode. Heck yes, they put a great cast in place to bring it off. Heck yes, it is a kick ass comedy of a spy genre movie.There is too much good stuff to detail here, but the cast is a mix of great older actors and younger ones. It has maybe more stunts than any spy film made prior. It has more jokes than any spy film made prior. More of everything and a heck of a good time. Put your brain into over drive and try to keep up with a movie whose pace starts in over drive and then goes into warp drive. Can it be sequel-ed and made better? Now that would be a challenge.",8,8,18,1 March 2015
The Hangover Part III," Mr Chow No Fun
","You could call this the Mr. Chow show. That is because everything from the plot too the punchlines all rely on Mr. Chow. This makes it punch less. John Goodman is almost totally wasted and then gets wasted halfway through by Mr. Chow who seems to be threatened by the chance John might get a real punchline.The blue ray DVD has a lot of extras including a joke about re-casting Zach. Unfortunately Zach has his worst outing of the series.The film goes straight down faster than you can fall off Ceasar's Palace. I haven't see Chow like this since Purina. They forgot that America runs on Dunkin.Where is Mike Tyson? We need him chewing on Chow here. Beheading a Giraffe would be clever except Zach does it for no real reason other than to cause Jeffrey Tambor to drop dead. After these 2 die, the movie goes with them to the grave.At least the pregnant hooker does not get any Hallow Weiners, just the audience gets a hallow film. Think this series of films has run it's course.",2,3,7,16 October 2013
Easy A," Taking The Scarlett Letter To The Next Level
","This Emma Stone starring film takes mature themes to the present in a lot of ways. There is no doubt this is Emma's film as it is glued to her character as the center of the story. Amanda Bynes and a host of others provide good support roles.The story centers on how the rumor mill and the weaving of lies still gets people to draw wrong conclusions. Kind of reminds me of what the main stream media has become today except they take lies and spin it into 'Truly Re-Written' History. The difference is this story is funny where what the media does has become sadly distorted and out of touch with reality.Thomas Hayden Church (antone remember the sitcom Wings?) is the English Teacher who is teaching the class 'The Scarlett Letter' in class. Emma Stones character literally becomes a modern day Hester even to the point of putting the letter A on her clothes. If you take this story seriously, which is not the intent, it teaches how cruel human beings still are.Emma lies to her girlfriend about her first physical male encounter with an imaginary friend named George. The girlfriend is a busy body who takes the story and spins it into reality. Soon we have a modern day Hester who is completely innocent but her reputation is trashed.From here there are a lot of amusing things that get done by people to take advantage of the rumors, sometimes with hilarious results. There is not a serious tone to this film though it is scary to think that modern day teens have not advanced beyond the Puritans of the 1600's. Then again, one look at the Middle East still fighting wars from the Bible proves how real this is.",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
Apollo 13," Failure is not an option
","'Failure is not an option,' is the most memorable line in this movie. It is funny how Tom Hanks so perfectly fits another diverse role the way he fits this one. The entire cast seems to be perfectly fit in like with a shoehorn.The way the story is presented is important here. After several successful missions to the moon, things had become so successful that even the astronauts & their wives did not realize the real risk involved in going to the moon. The 1 small step of Neil Armstrong was really a giant leap.When this drama happened, television brought it home to a public that was deeply surprised by what was going on. After all, success breeds success. This story perfectly illustrates why success can never be taken for granted.It illustrates the teamwork in space & on the ground that made this rescue possible. It is a story of failure of a mission that evolves into the success of a second mission- survival. That is the importance of this story.If you have not seen this, it is worth viewing. While it is not essential, it is definitely dramatic. Great work by everyone including Ron Howard.",8,1,2,12 March 2007
The Great Escape," Blockbuster Cast & Stellar Performances
","This is a long film based upon Paul Brickhill's true story novel of a real escape of Allied Prisoners from a WW 2 pow camp. Parts of this were later borrowed loosely for Hogan's Heros. The story is followed pretty faithfully except composites were used of the real people involved.A cast of Steve McQueen, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, & many others makes this film into what it's title suggests, great escapist fare. The filming was actually done in Germany giving the viewer an authentic look & feel to viewing the film.The film tells the story of the escape well & how the prisoners overcame the Germans, poor conditions, & managed to do the impossible in a historical way. Even though it runs over 3 hours, if you have never seen it, it is worth while viewing. If you like the film, the book is even better.",9,2,4,8 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Excellent Connection Between 4 & 6
","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. This film was considered a weak link of these three when it was first released. As the years have gone by, it has grown in popularity. It is as solid as either 4 or 6. It has great acting, a good script, excellent action sequences, & introduces Yoda. Granted if you watch the series in number order, Yoda pops up earlier, but this is the real introduction to him here, & it fits so well.Luke Skywalker completes a lot of Jedi training with Yoda, & one thing that was explained in episode 1 better is why Yoda fears training Luke so much. It was explained in episode 4 too with Obie Ones dialog about Vadar. Strange how this plot line runs together yet spreads apart.This film reveals that Luke is the son of Darth Vadar, a man which he views an evil monster. It is a relationship which is almost similar to the relationship between Mesala & Ben Hur in that in both cases- Hur & Luke, their relationships to the other character are shaken at their own souls foundation. The more one looks at this film, the better it looks.",8,1,2,23 February 2007
Aladdin," Over Analyze This
","This is a kids movie. This is a Disney Movie. This is a movie where Robin Williams body slams Allah and the audience and easily steals the movie.Because of this, the over all quality of this film is Williams ad libbing lines. That makes this movie a big success.If your looking for intellectual, try Dead Poets. If you want acting - Good Morning Vietnam (a very under rated film). This one is fantasy- period, nothing more and nothing less. The girl animated in this is very much Disney 'Oops, I did it again' type.If you want to know why the Middle East is really so screwed up - try something without Robin Williams - John Goldfarb, Please Come Home where we launched Shirley Maclaine into an oil sheik in the 1960's comes to mind.",7,2,4,21 August 2014
Saboteur," Love That Bob Has Nothing on this film
","Bob Cummings is excellent in this, as this technically brilliant Hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today. Priscilla Lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other blonde's that worked with Hitchcock later. She just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today.There are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director. The acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today. Every person in the cast performs well. There are several great backdrops in the black & white film.This was the first film at Universal for Hitchcock. Long run between the feature films he did at Universal, plus the television series, Hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there. This fact gets lost in film history.Norman Lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film. The story moves along really well including Hitchcock's only filmed western sequence. This film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it.",8,1,2,14 November 2009
Gangs of New York," Martin Scorsese OK Film
","Martin Scorsese has done some great films, but this one comes off as just OK. It is not from a lack of trying as the visuals in this film are quite rich & evocative. The action sequences are pretty well done too. Martin Scorsese's biggest problem in this film is the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio performance in this film shows he is still trying to mature as an actor. He walks through this film without putting much effort into it in spite of all the folks around him. Hopefully, after doing this film & CATCH ME IF YOU CAN with Spielberg, the learning will help him as his acting is flat in that movie as well.Cameron Diaz is in this film pretty much as eye candy but is really not given enough of a role that she will be remembered for this one.Daniel Day-Lewis alias 'The Butcher' in this film really gets the best role & steals the film from everyone else. With all the action & scenery in the movie, there really isn't a lot to steal, but (if you pardon the pun), 'The Butcher' to me gets the meat of the acting in this script.At 167 minutes this film runs pretty long, mostly because of the long action sequences, & it could be made shorter as some of the sequences drag all too long, but even if it were shorter, it would not really improve the film.This is a good film, but not a film that will be remembered other than as one of Directors Martin Scorsese film more than anything else. Well made but average for a director who has done better than this one.",6,0,0,23 October 2006
Spectre," Classic Bond
","The 007 series is aging gracefully with this entry. The plot is simple and easy to follow compared with some other action films recently. It actually appeals to the long in the tooth Bond fans who get teasers about more information about Bond's past. Some Bond fans are now 50 years into it.We get back into the save the world plot as well. Spectre is trying to take over all the intelligence services of all the countries in the world. If they succeed they will run everything. Unlike some Bond films it only gets down to the last minute, before a revamped Q stops it.There are multiple locations used in the film. The revamp of arch enemy Blowfeltd complete with long haired white cat is something that reaches back to the past Bonds. There is the eerie drilling of Bond's Brain is enough to scare the heck out of anyone who has ever had brain surgery.The PG rated film dials back the adult content though the new Money Penny even gets into the act here and not with Bond. Craig's Bond is very suitable to the times. The updated plot works well, and there are plenty of scenes where the reminders of Bonds past are more prevalent than candy in Xmas stockings.If you look real close there are a few things left not explained but they are minor. This film is much better than newer critics who are not experienced with how Bond films are supposed to work have reviewed it.",8,1,3,28 November 2015
Moon," A meaningful Premise
","This movie is an interesting character study between Gertie the Robot & Sam the Human(s).The premise is an Lunar Corporation is mining the far side of the moon for Gas which is now being used to supply 70 percent of the Earth's power. At first you believe Sam has only been on the moon for 3 years as part of his assignment. Then something does not ring quite right.While you could compare this with Hal in another Sci-Fi film, the difference here is that in this one, Gertie has cut off communications with Earth directly and has the power to regenerate Sam in clones wherever they need one.Sam wrecks some equipment & dies in the crash prompting Gertie's replacement. Then the new Sam violates Gertie's orders and goes out and saves the old Sam. While the Sams do not get along, they eventually find a way to organize an end run around Gertie so a rescue party is sent for.The symbolism here which viewers might over look is how a large organization with too much power can change reality and with it do things that never should have been done. Once the 2 Sams get into this, they find out that has happened here.In the end, Gertie becomes an ally to help Sam. The film is just over 90 minutes but this is the right length for this film.",8,1,5,17 May 2011
Hacksaw Ridge," A True Story Not Varnished
","Mel Gibson's 7th directing effort in film is a very serious solid dramatic effort. The film is everything the true story and title implies. The battle for Okinawa was one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific (most the campaign was pretty bloody) as the Japanese considered Okinawa as a home Island and fought furiously to defend it. Hackshaw Ridge was shown as a ridge with a massive complex of tunnels the defending troops would stay in until American Troops were trying to take the ridge. Then they would come out and suicide attack the Marines. Desmond Doss (played by former Spiderman Andrew Garfield) true story deserves to be shared. Amazingly, 2 script writers wrote this true story script to film without the benefits of basing it on any novel. The facts of the story are amazing in themselves. Doss's father, a World War 1 vet does not want his son to go to war. His son enlists after Pearl Harbor but only as a Medic. Still, Dad is not happy. When his son is on trial in court for not willing to train with a rifle, Dad shows up in uniform in court. It is an important true story within the story. Vince Vaughn is very effective as Sgt Howell in training camp and on Okinawa. This is a very serious film with few light moments (naked man in boot camp). It is told pretty much straight forward from Doss childhood after the opening battle credits. The facts stated at the end of the film are amazing. The biggest won, Doss Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the unit from Hackshaw Ridge. It is hard to tell if it is totally like it really happened but it is well told. The drama is solid, and worthwhile.",8,1,2,23 July 2017
The Runaways," Historic Biopic
","Up until the Runaways hit the scene, women's rock and roll were limited to some random women in rock bands. The Runaways were the first group to change all that by having an all-women group. This is the second film to address this band. Both films should be watched and then remember that history is always revised in Media. When I watched the extras on the DVD I found out this story focus was on -Kristen Stewart Kristen Stewart ... Joan Jett Dakota Fanning .. Cherie Currie Joan Jett and Cherie Currie were consultants on this film and so the story is limited by their point of view. Other than that limit I have no complaints about what the film tries to do. Women in Rock and Roll prior to the band I can recall were a member of The Honeycomb who sang the song 'Have I The Right' in the early 1960's and a woman drummer with The First Edition ( song -Just In Time). Kenny Rogers was the lead singer of The First Edition. Since neither of these counts as really hard rock, they were just token women who tried to break the barrier",6,1,2,1 May 2013
The Social Network," Zuckerberg - The Hero, The Legend
","This film is a very emotionless look at how Mark Zuckerberg used ideas and circumstances around him to create Facebook and become a Billionaire. The film opens with Erica Albright on Zuckerbergs only depicted date in the movie getting frustrated with his nonsensical ranting and dumping him calling him the appropriate name. The rest of the movie (spoiler) tells us how he lives up to that name. This simple plot is then encased into a lot of other subplots.This movie presents the high IQ main character as a genius who seems to outsmart not only other nerds & geeks, but even the business types he deals with throughout the film. In effect it is making Zuckerberg into a modern legend and a real tough as nails type who is not effected by anyone around him, feasting like a fighting fish on everyone else. How much of the story is actually true is a subject of conjecture as the disclaimer at the end of the movie states that scenes were done to change the story for 'dramatic effect'.The film closes with a lone Zuckerberg sitting at a laptop sending a friend request to the long lost Erica on Facebook. That is the closest thing to real emotion that is in the movie. There is anger from the other folks who seem to get taken advantage of.There is a scene that depicts Bill Gates speaking to an audience at Harvard. Gates is a man who has used money, computers, and the media to make himself into a legend. This scene is right on for this movie as this testament of Zuckerberg pretty much makes him a legend. Both he and Gates have made themselves into legends using the same technology. This film covers Zuckerberg as the next generation Gates.Is this a good movie? Yes as it does break a lot of molds and does not appear to make up too much. The direction and production and sound track are very good. The cast does a fine job acting, but suffer from a lack of script as far as being able to show a lot of range in their roles. That's because this spin of a legend lacks reality and the lack of depth of the characters proves that.I won't knock the film for that. It is a fine film, but in real life is Zuckerberg really this much of a dead fish? If he really is, this movie shows that having brains and taking of advantage of others will win for you in life as long as your self-absorbed.",8,0,1,29 March 2011
The Wedding Singer," Sadler-Barrymore Works
","This film really centers on Adam Sadler's character. In saying that, this is a bit young a Sadler than now, but in this movie, Sadler proves early one that he can do comedy, drama, & pathos. Drew Barrymore, while not having anywhere near as much script, doesn't show all the range but is pleasant enough as the femme fatal in the end.It is interesting the wedding cancellation of the 'other woman' who leaves him at the altar so to speak. I think the overall film would be stronger if her character were developed more fully. There could have been some funnier sequences if she were developed enough that her character & Barrymores have more of a contest for Adams character. Along with that, you can't really see why he was going to marry her to start with. There is no energy between her character & Adam's.Adam Sadler is brilliant as the wedding singer. I am not sure anyone else could have played this role as well. The humor is light & the chemistry between him & Drew Barrymores character is electric. This to me is his best performing film that I have seen.",8,1,1,1 October 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Hard Fought Acting Wins Out
","I don't know why people look at this movie as political. This movie is less political than lots of animated movies I have seen in recent years. There is a truth base in the script & even though this stretches the truth quotient of this story, it does not stretch truth anywhere near what the written Biographies of Bill Gates stretch the truth about how bright he is.This is Will Smith & his son delivering great dramatic performances. Is the drama enhanced? Yes, & the ending is predictable too. Are the circumstances over hyped to make the story more dramatic. Of course they are. That is what drama is about, & what drama is supposed to be.This is a fine film. I like Will Smith as an actor. I have a tremendous respect for his ability to deliver consistently great acting, regardless of script. This film has one of the better scripts Smith has gotten & he delivers. His son delivers, & the rest of the cast does well in support. There is some dandy camera work, & some gritty reality thrown in as well.Is it going to be a classic film? No, just a good film but it is by no means a waste of time. I'd watch Will Smith do Shakespere because he is that good an actor that he could pull it off. He pulls this one off just fine too.",8,0,0,13 November 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," They Named Indiana After The Dog?
","When I first saw this movie, my impression as I walked out of the theater is that this film has the perfect ending. After eating your popcorn & drinking your soda, watching our heroes win & ride off into the sunset is the perfect ending. It is exactly the feeling you want to create leaving a movie.Then I realized, the whole film gives you a perfect feeling like that. The late River Phoenix & the opening sequence set a perfect mood for what is to come. When you think of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), who better to play his father, Henry Jones, than Sean Connery. The plot is well thought out for this one, going back to the first movie in the series & using a biblical theme. For some reason, this element missing seemed to detract from the second installment of the series. The cup of Christ seems a perfect follow for the Ark of the Covenant. There is plenty of light comedy in the film. Every thing from father & son sharing the same lover (wonder if Celista Flockhart would like to try that in real life?) to Adolf Hitler autographing Dr. Henry Jones book in a bizarre sequence of events that starts on a blimp, no less.The father / son plot line works well in creating comedy & emotional ties in their sharing the adventure as well. The movie has a terrific pace, & the viewer enjoys the action so well that there is little time to question anything that is totally absurd. To me, this movie is more entertaining than Raiders of The Lost Ark, & is the best one yet.",8,1,4,11 February 2007
Back to the Future," A Wild Ride with A Gigawatt Kick
","This film has a pace & magnificence which transcends major holes in the plot/ script. Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd are at the top of their careers in this film. They have capable support although the sequels proved that even though Crispin Glover has a good sized supporting role in this film, he really does not add anything by his presence as he is not even missed in the sequels. He did sue producers for the using stock footage of him in the sequels & won the suit, but he'd have been better off to have appeared in the films because he is now much in danger of being referred to as Crispin who? I love the Huey Lewis songs in this first installment. It is nearly impossible to write a time travel film & get it right but you love the main characters & the music so much that you don't care but some obvious ones include Marty McFly paying for coffee in a 1950's Cafe with 1980's money. The license plate coming off the car when they transport Einstein is a great effect but also makes no sense. The changes in the photo of the McFly kids make no sense as why would only the oldest son be effected by problems in the space-time continuum? Humor is a main ingredient of this movie. From classics like how to open a Coke bottle in the 1950's to 'who the hell is John F Kenedy?' to Pepsi Free, there is humor throughout the film. I like the Fox - Llloyd quotes:'You built a time machine out of a Deloran?' 'The way I see it, if your going to travel through time you gotta do it with some style!'The people who carry this film are Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd who is really over the top. Put your brain away, & get on into the DMC time machine. Enjoy it!",8,2,3,10 January 2006
The Birds," Master Hitchcock Very Much On target
","Sir Alfred did a great job on this film. Tippi Hedren only did one other film with him (Marne) but this one is more effective because its makes you uncomfortable with seemingly normal circumstances. Hedren's best work in any film that I have seen is here. Grace Kelly is reported to have turned down this role as being not right for a Princess.The film kind of leaves the viewer open to interpretation as to why the birds behave as they do. Is it related to the way the love birds are treated by Hedren? Is it something else? Is it nature suddenly rebelling against humans? The special effects scenes are so realistic as to UN-nerve someone viewing the film for the first time. The amount of work going into this film by the film makers really shows on the screen. Hitch wanted to end this movie with the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge loaded with birds. The studio said no, too expensive & difficult to do.It is a bit longer than some Hitchcock films, but worth the extra length. The sequences quietly building suspense to the next birds attack are masterfully done. The acting gives the viewer some interest as a lot of the actors became known later for television series appear in this. This film is scary viewing.Hitchcock wanted to top Pscyho and in terms of special effects, he comes close to that. The story line is not quite as powerful.",8,1,3,6 March 2007
Sully," Brace For Realism and Drama
","Considering this is based on Sully's book, with the very capable Clint Eastwood Directing, I expected this movie the to make an impact. Mission Accomplished, and then some.The film is designed like an onion. It opens with a nightmare by Sully crashing his plane, then it winds back into the aftermath of the crash, then it winds back to the crash, and then winds up to the aftermath, then back to the crash, and then finally to the hearing after the crash. It does so flawlessly like peeling back that onion and exposing more and more about the story.Sully's relationship with his co-pilot is the most exposed part of this. Sully's relationship with his wife and family, is told smartly though it is more just between him and his wife. It mentions the daughters but that is all. The most difficult thing it does well is the recreation of the crash. Sully puts in just enough about the passengers to make it feel real but not more than is needed. It dramatizes the relations between Sully and the NTSB investigation a bit more for dramatic effect, but is just the right touch. The hero's on the river who got to the plane quickly so that everyone is saved is done just right.Tom Hanks is very effective, which is almost always true, as Sully. The film does actually get over the feeling of how Sully was treated as a hero by everyone after the crash, not an easy thing to do, brings the hero feeling into reality.This film makes a point about computer information which is very relevant here. Any computer information is only a good as what is programmed into it. When a computer is used to simulate anything, it must have real data put into it to get real data out. That piece of drama dominates the closing of this one.This film makes a point about computer information which is very relevant here. Any computer information is only a good as what is programmed into it. When a computer is used to simulate anything, it must have real data put into it to get real data out. That piece of drama dominates the closing of this one. I can not emphasize this enough. In an era where a lot of political issues are being supported by conclusions reached strictly by data in computers that has no real factual basis, there are the problems with that being pointed out in this movie.Is it worth seeing? This movie makes my day, punks, but I leave it up to you to decide if I have fired enough data into this to make your day, too.",8,0,1,24 September 2016
Jurassic Park," Welcome To Jurrassic Park
","After viewing this film several times, it is very clear to me that Michael Cricton's book is a base for this, but the film for entertainment value goes far beyond the book. It literally borrows from the original King Kong to try & make itself into an epic. While it falls a little short of that goal, it is an admirable effort.Spielberg even makes fun of borrowing from King Kong with the gate at the beginning of the Jurassic Park tour. In fact, tung in cheek humor is rampant throughout the adventure film. The casting of Wayne Knight as the evil guy who brings the park tumbling down perfectly illustrates this. Knight is great in this role, a fine supporting actor of this era.The opening sequence of the film gives you an idea that this is going to be a low budget film, even the impression of a slice & dice melodrama. Then, it goes in the other direction entirely. The scenery is lavish, & the scale of reality is amazing. They do have to dumb down Michael Creigton's explanation (novel idea) of genetics in order to appeal the film to a mainstream audience.This film marks some of the earliest modern computer technical special effects being used to great effect. When you watch the film repeatedly, you realize how well the viewer is manipulated into a fantasy as large as King Kong.The cast is still largely a group of unknowns with the exception of Sir Richard Attenborough who is used to great effect in his role as the creator of this park destined to fail. Jeff Goldblum & the others went on to other films but only Jeff has really established much outside of the sequels.This film is the blockbuster of the 1990's for Spielberg. Sam Neil & Laura Dern still have little fame beyond this film. Wayne Knight is more famous for the sit-com Seinfeld than this movie though this film & JFK prove his talent in support of films.Influence is what makes this film unique. This film stimulated an entire younger generation to have more interest in dinosaurs than there had been for many years. It created the imagination for rides at Universal Studio & at Walt Disney's Animal Kingdom. Next to ET, this is Spielbergs largest kids film.",8,2,4,18 February 2007
Valkyrie," History Skewed Beyond Repair
","This film is being falsely advertised, but not too false. Based upon a true attempt to kill Adolf Hitler and using the names of the real people who tried, the second half of the film is total fiction & the plan is fiction as well.Even though it is framed so well by the writers, reality gets left behind after the explosion attempt. The group that Col Stausser headed in the attempt to kill Hitler really did not have an exact plan what to do if they were successful. That is what makes the second half of the film and especially the scene with the attempted arrest of Henrich Himmler total fiction as this never happened.What really is missing is the prime motivation for why the group was trying to kill Hitler. The true historic motivation for this group was nothing to do with freedom from Hitler. While they wanted to kill Hitler, their goal was to bring back the Kaiser. They were hoping that by restoring the German Monarchy, they could end the war before Germany was destroyed by the evil madman.The film depicts the group as nearly pulling off this military coup and this did not happen. Every German knew about Hitlers plans for slaughtering Jews from Mein Kamp. Jews had a bad time in Europe when the war started as Stalin was sending them to death camps in Siberia just as quickly as Hitler was.The only things the film can get credit for is looking authentic while the mix of English, American & German accents get mixed, and correctly pointing out that the day of the bombing in the Wolfs Lair, that El Duce (Benito Musselini), deposed Italian was there. It also points out correctly at the end of the movie who gets shot for the high crimes.The suspense music seems to repeat itself a lot in the film, too often. Some folks might this Cruise getting shot is good, but actually this story has been done better than this film version where because of their lack of motivation, it is difficult to understand why the movement is here at all. I sure wondered about it when the film ended.",1,30,74,2 January 2009
The Simpsons Movie," I Was Elected To Lead, Not To Read
","This movie is not too late. This movie is done exactly the way it should be, flat out funny. I say this to the audience that are fans of the Simpsons. As for the rest of the world, your missing out.Yes, the movie has a plot about environmentalism. While this subject can get too preachy, it is not that when the Simpsons present it. The plot presents a lot of ways to hang great humor on. The audience I saw it with was laughing (along with me) the entire film. A surprise - spoiler - is that Homer misses getting his donuts. That means bad news-Homer doesn't gain any cartoon weight- good news we got room for the next film.Everything about this film is done right. In fact it is actually tamer (to me) than some of the television episodes. That means they went for humor- not adult themes- & this movies succeeds on all levels. It even chides Simpson fans for not being in front of the tube. The opening is a rock concert, not the Simpsons on their couch in front of the TV. The length is about perfect, & the entertainment value is here. All the characters are there although there is so much good stuff jammed into the approximately 87 minutes that some characters don't get much screen time. The film is so funny, you don't really care who gets screen time. Another Simpsons winner, too bad more series & movies can't be as good.Homer gets Springfield into trouble, Homer & Bart save Springfield, & we get a bonus, Spider-Pig. This is my 300th review here on the IMDb & as I said when I reviewed the Television Series - A Doughnut Hole For Every Critic! Enjoy this & if they can keep it this good, lets have a sequel of something truly entertaining for a change out of Hollywood. I am looking forward to the next one already. They didn't even need Bart flashing in this one, it is great well done lampoon on the excesses of today & all the bull we get exposed too. Spider Pig is the ultimate ham actor.",10,2,8,28 July 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Almost Perfect
","This film had almost as much advance publicity from MGM as GONE WITH THE WIND. Long run, it has become more & more of a classic. This is a film with a great script & a cast that is at their peak of skills. Judy Garland is the heart & soul of this movie, & never got back to the heights of this performance throughout the rest of her career. Only 'Meet Me In St. Louis' approaches it. The support she gets from the rest of the cast, Frank Morgan who is at his best, Ray Bolger, etc. is outstanding. This film has more quotes than any other film. Yet, it is still considered a children's fantasy film & is a film which viewers either love or hate for some reason. Margaret Hamilton made her entire career out of being a witch in this film.Let's not forget the music from this film which is nothing short of amazing. One song from this film, DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD was made into a top forty song in the 1960's, many years after the film was made. While this film did little in theaters when it was released, it became an American icon on TV.AS I write this, though, I sum up my comments on how the heart of this film has touched folks by using a quote from this movie from the Wizard himself, when the Wizard awards the Tin Man with his heart. Take this quote, & view this film, & you will wonder why it is not quoted more often as it is the most over-looked quote I have ever found from any movie. 'Remember my sentimental friend, a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others.' To me, this says it all about this wonderful film.",10,3,4,27 August 2006
The Soloist," Not Typical Formula Film
","This will be the most under rated film of 2009. Jamie Foxx is brilliant playing a schizophrenic homeless person in Los Angeles who plays a 2 string violin. Robert Downey Jr is the LA Times Reporter who meets him on the streets of LA & tries throughout the film to help him.The portrayals of both roles are very well done, as their relationship evolves logically throughout the film. Where this film departs from the normal film is that it tells the true story & does not come up with a Hollywood ending where there is a solution. In fact, leaving this open ended like the reality is a strength of this film. It makes the film come off as more genuine.This is classic telling of a real story & while the film is at it, the depiction of the homeless area of Los Angeles is very realistic. This is a fine film with very good acting & care taken in making the film an accurate depiction of the real life story it is based upon. The frustration of the LA Reporter as Downey portrays him, & the reactions of Foxx homeless person are very realistic.",9,0,1,1 January 2010
The Martian," An Egg That Doesn't Quite Hatch
","The cast is talented, the scenes look good. So what happened? The writer of The Egg gets the story a bit scrambled and the film is at this point the most over-rated Sci-Fi film on IMDB.If you do not like the theater version, try out the unrated verson with 10 extra minutes on the DVD. This longer version reveals what the cast here truly wanted to do, and did. They take a crisis and make it into a comedy film. Worse yet, they then cut the film to make it look more serious than it was filmed at.Cut is an ending that comedically compares with Slim Pickens riding his bomb down in Dr. Strangelove. The trouble here is that this film is nowhere near as good as it is rated. Maybe Matt Damon and Kristen Wigg have a lot of fans out there, but serious Sci-Fi fans have a whole lot of issues with this one.Thw science is just not right. The premise is not much better. The films plays like the shooting budget got slashed after they started it. Funny, but sad considering the talents wasted.",5,1,1,28 April 2018
Law Abiding Citizen," Phantom Of The Justice System
","Gerard Butler who played the Phantom of the Opera in 2004 plays Clyde, one man who wants to clean up the problems in the US Justice system and avenge the murder of his wife and daughter. In a way, this role is not unlike the Phantom. Especially when he gets that murderer and kills him and dismembers him in the most painful way possible. His continuation of a series of people involved with the case is quite a series of killings.Jamie Foxx plays the DA involved in the case who lets Clyde's wife's killer walk free after 5 years in order to get a death sentence to the guy who did not kill them. Foxx is a man who as part of the justice system compromises justice in order to get his own personal conviction records. He is as flawed as the system he is a part of.What works here is the time clock effect because Clyde is saving the DA for last because he wants him to suffer through all the others deaths before then. The film becomes a race against time for Foxx to save himself, and while the ending is a bit different, Foxx DA does exactly what you'd expect him to do. He figures out how Clyde is doing it and then compromise his principles yet one more time and lets Clyde kill himself.In a way there is a delicious sequel here as Foxx is so compromised by this ending, should have the story continued on how he continues to compromise the justice system, or will he just let his ego continue the way he has this entire movie? Butler & Foxx perform well in this movie. Their characters are the movie and leaving Foxx corrupt DA compromised at the end makes me wonder if there could be a sequel coming as justice does not win in this one.",8,0,1,12 June 2011
Atonement," Only Decent Oscar Nominee
","This film is a remake and it is based upon a depressing story. The thing is, compared to the other best picture nominees I have seen so far, this one is the best. It has a story that makes sense. Michael Clayton & No Country For Old Men fall short on this.It has some great camera work and outstanding British location shots. The acting in the film is superior to the other nominees I have seen and it is based upon a better story than the others. Sadly, the Academy did a poor job in 2007 nominating films for best picture. This is the only one so far that deserved the nomination.This picture did win the Golden Globe for Best Picture. It is a solid film. Overall I'd rate it as a fine adaptation of the novel. Finally, it is much better than No Country For Old Men (aka. Friday the 13th Jason Strikes Again) which should not have even been nominated.Of course, maybe the Academy just wanted to play a joke on everyone by awarding a slasher film best picture. The real joke is that intellectuals & snobs think it was the best one. Guess these viewers are both pretty dumbed down now.",8,0,2,11 May 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Great Lampoon of NASCAR- Best Comedy of 2006
","This movie does something that is rarely done successfully done, pokes fun at the modern NASCAR circuit. Without detailing all the gags, this is pure fun which doesn't offend the tastes too often. Will Farrell is patently absurd as Ricky Bobby & the support he receives in this film from the entire cast is excellent. Gary Cole is very solid as Ricky's dad, & so is Jane Lynch as his mom. Amy Adams is solid too. In fact, the entire cast including John C. Reilly seems to have been fit into their roles like gloves.Sasha Cohen comes off better in this as Ricky Bobbys French nemesis than he does in even Borat. He is used perfectly & fits his role really well. The story line works really well as the evolution from speed too shake & bake too magic man & me helps keep the film focused on something besides the jokes. There is just enough plot to hang the jokes on. The script is lots of fun with references to lots of things besides NASCAR & Sex (which is all too often the only thing done as comedy today). This film proves that outrageous is much better than sex when done right as comedy. Thank goodness this is much better than the ill conceived BETWITCHED Farrell did in 2005. This film is really an excellent showcase for everyone involved. If your a NASCAR fan, you should even get some extra fun out of this one.Get ready for the checkered flag Ricky Booby, this film is a winner all the way.",8,66,103,13 August 2006
The Godfather," F Fords 2008 Restoration- An Offer I Didn't Refuse
","The Cordleone family is modeled on a Mafia family which existed. The Mario Puzo novel was highly fictionalized & made for an interesting premise. The classic line from this film 'I'm going to make them an offer they can't refuse,' has become the most cliché line ever uttered from a film.Marlon Brando was well suited for his role in this plodding drama. The 2008 restoration of the Godfather by Copola on DVD brings this film, not only back to original form but even better. The set available now has all 3 films plus extras. When I watched to original now restored, I realized just how great this movie is.This film takes it time telling it's story and it is much more classic story telling over action. The restoration makes the dark film play much better than older prints I have seen before. It is in 5 speaker sound for home theater systems. After seeing how good this original is, I am looking foreword to checking out 2 & 3.James Caan, Abe Vigoda head a stellar list of folks supporting Brando here with incredible acting by Al Pacino as the son heir apparent. There is plenty of reason to watch this restored version. It is done with an obvious flair and once you watch this, you easily forget HBO's poor relative, The Sopranos. If they face Brando, they wouldn't last 5 minutes.",10,4,9,20 November 2006
