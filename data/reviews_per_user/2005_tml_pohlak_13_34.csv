Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," May the Force be with you
","I remember perfectly well when The Phantom Menace came out. I was 6 at the time, and I was introduced to Star Wars through KFC. We went there as a family one Sunday, and I noticed on the bucket that there was a really neat-looking picture of guys fighting with what I now know to be light sabers. I asked my cousin 'What is this?' He looked at me and said 'Star Wars. The new movie.' I was introduced to Episode II through a bag of Doritos years later, and Episode III while wasting time in my grade 7 computer class. And Star Wars was completely forbidden by the parents for the little kids. Like Titanic, if you got to see it, you got bragging rights. (My cousin got supreme bragging rights when he bought the movie on VHS.) What can I say? We were young. The point of my story is simple. I was introduced to Star Wars through The Phantom Menace, and watching it was a huge thing for me, bigger than watching A New Hope.Well, before I watched it, I heard nearly universally negative reviews. 'The Prequel Trilogy is horrible,' I heard, 'The only O.K. one is Revenge of the Sith.' So I was bracing myself for a disappointment that never came.George Lucas surprised me. His writing and direction, I found, bogged down the original Star Wars for well over a half hour. He wrote and directed The Phantom Menace, but he did this phenomenally. He made beautiful shots, they were skilfully edited together, and his fertile imagination for this film really kept it going.The acting was surprisingly terrific. I wasn't expecting much from Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, but they were convincing and sympathetic! Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor play mysterious Jedis very convincingly they don't ham it up or overplay the mysterious bit. A true bond forms between them on screen.Perhaps the biggest surprise are the characters. For once, R2-D2 and C-3PO did not annoy me in the least. I've heard a lot of complaints about Jar-Jar Binks being annoying. Well, yeah, in a way, that's true. His way of speaking is just too cheesy (Grammatically incorrect!!! Horrors!!!); his voice is a little too high-pitched for the sanity of my ears. But overall, he provides some pretty decent comic relief, and reminds us that Star Wars was, after all, a space opera, meant to be fun, and not some allegorical masterpiece about war and so on. Those who interpret it that way probably know this. May the Force be with them.Why was The Phantom Menace received so poorly? I truly have no idea. The sad thing is, had it been little more than a remake of Star Wars, with Luke Skywalker being replaced by Anakin, it probably would've been received much better by fans and critics alike. Give George Lucas credit! He took familiar material we all knew and loved, and made something brand-new, refreshing, and entertaining out of it. He gave us a spectacular pod race and a breathtaking light saber duel, among other things, to enjoy in this film. I enthusiastically applaud his efforts!I love John Williams' score. I am a big fan of his work, and knowing he was on board made me anticipate this so much more. I love the theme he came up with for Darth Maul. It is nothing like Darth Vader's 'Imperial March'. Like Lucas' efforts, the score was something new, refreshing, and supremely entertaining.I saw this movie with high expectations, and ended up being completely pleased. Although this movie has its faults, I'm quite fond of it, flaws and all.",10,1,3,2 March 2009
Minority Report," Everybody runs...
","I used to think Tom Cruise couldn't act to save his life. Having seen 'Minority Report', I now know better. He delivers a down-to-earth, realistic performance in a challenging role. Set in the future, in the year 2054, Cruise plays the chief of the Precrime Department. Basically, technology has evolved, and there is now a way to stop crimes from occurring. However, he falls victim to this 'perfect' system when he himself is accused of committing a future crimeÂ… This is one of the most involving thrillers I have ever seen. The mystery behind the plot is rather cloudy at first, but once it starts to be explained, it becomes obvious who the perpetrator is. Collin Farrell (who was in 'Phone Booth') delivers a solid performance as well, as does the rest of the cast.Have I ever been disappointed by Spielberg? No, and for the record, I loved his unique portrayal of future times in Minority Report. Most films set in the future have a classic feel: the future looks nice and pretty on the outside, but underneath the surface, people are as disgruntled as ever. However, Spielberg doesn't go with any of that nonsense here. The colours are all dull, monochromatic, bleached out. The lighting is dark. It is a refreshingly bleak and hopeless outlook on the future.In addition, Spielberg has the audience jump at all the wrong moments. No, perhaps I worded that poorly. What I meant was: oftentimes, the audience thinks Cruise is in danger, when in reality, there's nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, when the audience should be on the edge of their seat, Spielberg does nothing of the sort. It'll make sense when you see it.Combine grand special effects, another amazing score by John Williams, strong performances, and Spielberg's capable direction, and you get a great movie.",10,1,3,5 May 2009
Shakespeare in Love," For never was there a story of more woe than this of Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow..
","Shakespeare in Love purports to be a comedy about Shakespeare suddenly inspired by a love interest (with Paltrow), and the words begin to flow like never before. Watching it, I found it far from funny. Everything that occurs in it is predictable and cliché, and not particularly endearing. It pokes fun at the clergy by having a clergyman protest against the theatre and its morality. Then, the screenwriters decide it will be great fun if the same clergyman reacts enthusiastically at a performance. It does not emerge as such. I'm quite surprised that Tom Stoppard, a fantastic playwright, has his name attached to this.Shakespeare in Love starts promisingly: a hilarious presentation by a debtor to those he owes money to of an early storyline of Romeo and Juliet. Soon after, however, the constant references to Shakespeare's oeuvre become stiff and un-amusing. For instance, a clergyman yells 'a plague o' both their houses!' referring to two rival theatres, which becomes a line in Romeo and Juliet. Not too bad? Well consider the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet being inspired by a similar encounter between Will and Gwyneth (alas, foiled by the Nurse, whose persistent calling for Juliet also makes it into the scene). Comic relief is soon provided in limited, spaced-out bursts (between the numerous sex scenes of course).Perhaps my negative view of Shakespeare in Love is influenced by a vendetta I have against it. The film did not deserve 1999's Best Picture award, which should have gone to either Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beautiful, or The Thin Red Line. It practically swept the Oscars with 7 wins, which often it did not deserve. Gwyneth Paltrow won the Best Actress award. Apparently, perpetually flashing fleeting smiles and flaunting one's breasts (literally— her breasts are probably shown about 13 times) are Best Actress qualifications. Judi Dench won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress— for about 10 minutes of screen time, where she does what the Queen does best (i.e. save the day), but without making the performance particularly memorable or endearing.And now for the redeeming qualities: Shakespeare in Love undoubtedly had some fine music. The music was purely opulent and made many of the scenes 'watch-able'. The film's strongest scene would have to be when someone (whose name I completely forget, but at the same time, couldn't care less) goes into the theatre where a rehearsal is taking place and a duel ensues with Shakespeare. Comically, musically, dramatically, and directorially, it is the film's most solid scene, and I briefly had hopes (which were mercilessly dashed) that the film might become good.And now for some acting criticism: Joseph Fiennes is one of the most amateur actors I have ever had to endure watching— one of the poorest choices available for Shakespeare. Paltrow was bad enough where fleeting smiles were concerned— Fiennes makes her look like a genius. Ben Affleck plays well, an Elizabethan Ben Affleck.The Verdict: A mediocre film at best, Shakespeare in Love was over-hyped, and definitely did not deserve all those Oscars it grabbed. Its Best Picture win is a direct slap in the face to two of the greatest masterpieces ever made (and The Thin Red Line, which should'vie won SOMETHING that year— it's a very good movie!). Cliché, stale, and uninteresting, I swear I thought my brains melted about 40 minutes into the movie. An agonizing experience for the most part. Geoffrey Rush is the best part of the movie.Overall Rating: 2/10",2,10,19,12 June 2009
Brokeback Mountain," How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...
","'Brokeback Mountain' won 3 Oscars, and was nominated for 7 more. The late Heath Ledger's performance was praised, as was Jake Gyllenhaal's, and critics hailed it as a masterpiece.Looking at the poster for 'Brokeback', I noticed that it was very similar to another movie poster, 'Titanic'. According to Wikipedia, it was designed after the 'Titanic' poster on purpose. And that sums up the movie perfectly: it tries too hard to be touching, to be heart-warming, and to be romantic.Why does everyone praise Heath's performance? He wasn't that great, all he really did was talk through his lips with a deep voice. All of a sudden he deserves an Oscar?This movie was really (also) poorly made and directed. It starts with an awkward and far-too-long silence, and that's just about the whole movie: Ang Lee spends way too much time (for instance) following Ennis and Jack to the bar, showing a lot of (rather lovely at first, but then gets really boring) scenery. Please remind me why Lee got an Oscar for his direction instead of Steven Spielberg for 'Munich'? About 10 minutes into the movie, I'm waiting for something to happen. 20 minutes: ooh! A bear shows up! But nothing ends up coming from it: it's shown, you have an exciting minute waiting for some sort of plot to develop from it, but it turns out that we're coming back to Ennis and Jack after all.I'll cheerfully admit that I'm biased, and that romantic movies really aren't my thing. But 'Brokeback Mountain' has such a poor plot, casting, direction, and an appalling score (that once more tries too hard to sound romantic)... How bad do I hate this movie? Words cannot describe my feelings.Do you want a well-made (keyword: WELL-made) romance movie? Watch 'Titanic'. I'll take it any day over this junk.",1,17,61,5 May 2009
Insomnia," A bone-chilling masterpiece
","Al Pacino is an L.A. cop who's come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a brutal homicide. Hilary Swank is the Alaskan detective who admires his work and methods. Robin Williams is the killer they're hunting down. (All three are Oscar winners by the way, and deliver performances that are definitely worthy of an Oscar.) Throughout the film, Pacino's character's mind wreaks havoc; the Alaskan town is so far up north, they get 'white nights' (I.e. the sun doesn't set for half the year). As a result, he cannot sleep.With 'Insomnia', Christopher Nolan joins my list of directors I admire. 'Insomnia' owes much of its stunning success to the directorial choices Nolan makes. The most difficult task of the movie is this: how exactly can you show the audience Pacino's increasingly disoriented, sleepless mind-frame, without boring them? I think Nolan handles this expertly.The cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Robin Williams. His character is undoubtedly psychotic. What a temptation for Williams to steal the show with a display of angry shouting, of pure psychopathic hostility, of maniacal laughter! But no. He avoids this and goes for a far different touch. His character talks of extremely disturbing things in a very calm, matter-of-fact way, making his performance far more bone-chilling. As much as I love Williams' comic roles, I have to admit he's practically unrivalled in 'serious' acting.Another thought: although this is a film I like to consider a thriller, it is very much like a film noir as well. Personally, I love the plots of film noirs, but I can't stand the relentless usage of shadows and dark lighting. 'Insomnia' shatters these guidelines. It is a very dark film with lots and lots of light. The effect is interesting to say the least.This film is a thriller, and consequently, I'm choosing my words carefully in order to spoil as little of the film as possible. I highly recommend seeing this film— I was blown away. 'Insomnia' is also very deep, powerfully invoking themes of guilt and restlessness. I do not regret buying this film: I confidently call it a great movie.Note: Apparently, 'Insomnia' is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgård. I haven't seen it, but if it was anything close to as good as this film, whoever does see it is in for a real treat!",10,10,12,18 May 2009
Yes Man," Say it a million times. Then say it a million more. And the word you will have said two million times is...
","In 1997, Jim Carrey starred in a wonderful film called Liar Liar, about a lawyer who is forced to tell the truth for 24 hours. Now, in 2008, he was in Yes Man, about a banker who must say 'yes' to every opportunity presented to him. Sound familiar? Although Yes Man was a decent film, it is nothing compared to Liar Liar. When a lawyer desperately wants to tell the truth, but cannot, it is funny. It provides many opportunities for Jim Carrey to go insane with his facial expressions and such. But when a man says 'yes' to everything because he wants to Where's the tension? Jim Carrey's comedic talents are practically not employed in this film, which is a terrible shame.Although Yes Man is enjoyable, there is one thing that I wish the film didn't do. Jim Carrey's character, Carl, has an elderly woman as his neighbour. One day, she asks him to come set up some shelves for her. As a method of compensation, she proposes to give him a 'sexual release'. What happens next— I just wish the film hadn't gone this far. There was no need. When Carl refused and fled, the scene was funny. When he returned, the scene momentarily switched from funny to disgusting.Jim Carrey makes gargantuan efforts to carry the film, and he more or less succeeds. He is supported by a solid cast, but none (with the possible exception of Terence Stamp) do nearly as good of a job as Carrey.One more thing about Yes Man that I have mixed feelings about: Carl's boss, Norm, is portrayed as a stereotypical, Hollywood 'loser', hosting a Harry Potter dress-up party, and later, a similar one in honour of 300. He remains a gawky, two-dimensional caricature. Only in one of his final scenes, at his 300 party, does Norm actually feel like a real character, which is a fantastic, unexpected, and pleasing surprise. However, it's just barely worth the long wait for about 10 seconds of a good scene.The Verdict: The film is enjoyable and entertaining, but far from memorable. A couple of flaws seriously detract from it. For a far better film with a similar premise, I recommend Liar Liar.Overall Rating: 6/10",6,0,0,11 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Better than the first, not as amazing as the second.
","Return of the Jedi is a step down from The Empire Strikes Back, but still a huge upgrade from A New Hope. (Anyone else notice a pattern here? Lucas directed A New Hope, but not the other two? Curious)First of all, let's just get the annoying characters out of the way once and for all. R2D2's constant beeps and whirs got on my nerves. Chewbacca is still pretty annoying. C3PO? Annoying, but at least far less than The Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps the most annoying one, though, was Jabba the Hutt. I mean, his disgusting physical appearance was bad enough, but the fact that he spoke nothing but 'Huttese'? The inability to interpret his speech really got on my nerves. Lucas should've been more careful as to what characters spoke plain old English.The acting was superb! James Earl Jones has this really neat, powerful, and consistent voice. The trio of Hamill-Ford-Fisher was splendid as always. But one of the film's highlights was the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). He is more powerful and more menacing than even Darth Vader, and McDiarmid absolutely eats up the screen every moment! His creepy laughs, enjoying his sadistic form of torture, were as bone-chilling as Dath Vader's constant heavy breathing.The action scenes were epic. They were much better directed than the original (the same pattern here curious), more thrilling, easier to follow in many ways.John Williams' music is absolutely amazing. The guy is a genius. An absolute genius.Two thumbs up to Return of the Jedi, a really good movie, but remember, still inferior to The Empire Strikes Back.",9,1,2,12 March 2009
Empire of the Sun," Fascinating! A great film from Spielberg!
","A very young Christian Bale stars as Jim Graham in 'Empire of the Sun'. Based on the novel by J.G. Ballard, it is the story of an English boy struggling to survive under Japanese occupation in WWII. The cast of 'Empire of the Sun' deliver extremely strong performances. A pleasant surprise can be found in the foreign languages spoken throughout the film— although I had no idea what was being said, I got a general impression thanks to the way the lines were said.Christian Bale's character undergoes a drastic transformation due to his WWII experiences (but his dream of flying a plane remains consistent), and observing this transformation on screen is just amazing. Bale gives one of the best child actor performances in a film to date.An interesting thing throughout 'Empire of the Sun' is the portrayal of the Japanese. Their part in the war is rarely touched on in WWII movies— after all, Nazis and their persecution of Jews provides a more 'interesting story'. Although the Japanese are unmistakably 'the enemy', at times one feels great empathy for them, particularly the kamikaze pilots Jim admires. One fascinating character is a (Chinese, I think) boy about Jim's age, who, too, dreams of flying. The difference between the two is this: the Chinese boy is free; he eventually joins with the Japanese as a pilot. The boy has practically no speaking interaction with Jim, and yet, the two characters are powerfully contrasted (I will avoid my bad habit of over-elaborating here).John Williams composes yet another fascinating score. A Welsh lullaby (called 'Suo Gan', according to Ian Freer in his book 'The Complete Spielberg') features quite prominently in the music, and its use is perfectly timed. The first time it's used, it's just a hilarious opportunity to watch Christian Bale lip-sync the song (faltering every once in a while, which is practically inevitable). But its subsequent usage becomes extremely powerful, as one remembers just what kind of boy Jim was when he first sang it in the film. The music's haunting melody is something that will probably stay with the audience long after the film is done.Call me biased if you like, but I really admire Spielberg's direction. 'Empire of the Sun' is filled with heart-wrenching moments without launching into bathos. Spielberg makes some really clever directing choices. For instance, the first time we meet Basie (John Malkovich), who becomes something of a father figure to Jim, Spielberg doesn't show his face in full. It is always somewhat blocked by the shadows. Even when he goes out into the streets, he wears sunglasses, so we cannot see his eyes. This deliberate mysteriousness pays off, as it serves to spice up the audience's interest in this new character.I won't really describe the plot (which, to be honest, is amazing), because this is a film not worth spoiling. This is a little treasure. 'Empire of the Sun' just about flopped at the box office, and has become practically forgotten, but it is nonetheless one of Spielberg's best films— a great movie that I highly recommend.",10,1,4,17 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Begun, the ripoff has...
","I should've known better than to trust George Lucas. But after his surprising success in The Phantom Menace, I was looking forward to Attack of the Clones. What I got was sorely disappointing.Lucas should've known better than making this film! The references to The Empire Strikes Back are so blatantly obvious in fact, it's quite obvious Lucas tries to plunge into the depths of despair Empire did, and be that amazing. Problem is, it doesn't work, thanks to a really bad, weak story, combined with many other factors.If you ever doubt that visual effects alone cannot make a good movie, look no further than this! Attack of the Clones has some of the most astounding visual effects to date! Of course, this doesn't change the fact that this movie was poorly written and poorly directed. Why poorly directed? For instance: since the puppet-Yoda days are over, Lucas decides to show off this new advance in technology by showing too many unnecessary close-ups of Yoda's face. This is a really bad choice: the magic of this new advance is quickly smothered.Then, of course, we get to the acting. The only bright spots were Ewan McGregor and Frank Oz (Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, respectively). Hayden Christensen played Anakin as some spoiled brat, constantly complaining about everything. (The political views he expresses, by the way, alarmed me. I expected him to pull out the old swastika and start a lecture about extermination at any moment.) Most of the performances were terribly flat. How can you be in the midst of spectacular events, yet talk as if you would on a cell phone outside Starbucks? The biggest letdown was, sadly, Natalie Portman. She was fantastic in The Phantom Menace, but thanks to Lucas' terrible script, couldn't do much here. This might explain why her performance was really half-hearted. Although appealing to the eyes, she displays little of the rich acting talent she has.We get down to the annoying characters at last. First, Jar Jar Binks. Lucas diminished his role immensely here, after all the complaints in The Phantom Menace. But his role is so minor, he shouldn't have been included at all! His brief appearances grated on my nerves, as his Caribbean-stereotype behaviour and high-pitched voice tried my patience. At least there was plenty of time to get used to him in TPMhis appearances are too spaced out here. Next, one of the biggest rip-offs of all-time: R4 (when Obi-Wan goes to visit the 'non-existing' planet). Hm I wonder where they came up with that? R2-D2 and C3PO are back to their annoying ways, especially C3PO, whose misadventures were so idiotic, I wanted to bash him on the head.So, in conclusion, this film does only one thing: prove that advanced special effects will do nothing to save a movie that's already as bad as this. And that's pretty much what Lucas seems to have depended on.",1,1,4,12 March 2009
Romeo + Juliet," Congratulations to the (moronic) screenwriters!!!
","NEVER, NEVER, has Shakespeare been butchered more than in ROMEO + JULIET. Don't get me wrong: I was completely open to the idea of an updated version of Shakespeare's classic. I was even looking forward to it. And then, I watched it. Shakespeare's play is a classic for a reason-- this movie was put together as if it was a last minute project for an English class. The setting is completely updated-- Romeo now has a handgun, Friar Lawrence has a cross tattooed on his back, the Capulets and Montagues engage in a gunfight. And yet, they use dialogue from the original play! The setting LOOKS modern, but the speech sounds 16th century. Now, I would not have been bothered by this, but for one other thing. THE ACTORS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RECITE Shakespeare! When DiCaprio recites his lines, he does so halfheartedly and monotonously-- as if he was saying, 'Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm in love with this girl now. What a waste of an hour. Can I just poison myself already???'. Only one character recites the Shakesperean dialogue well-- Friar Lawrence. If that was not enough, the screenwriters take delight in butchering a classic. Several key moments were omitted, such as the slaying of Paris. Mercutio, instead of being witty, is now just plain annoying. He, too, does not know how to speak Shakespeare. In short, it is an assault on the eyes, the ears, and the brain. With films like these, no wonder some people dislike Shakespeare! A plague o' all the scriptwriters!",1,3,7,27 May 2008
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A very good morning indeed!
","The interesting thing about 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is that so little of the horrors of the Vietnam War are shown, that the film effectively portrays the horror and senselessness of war. Director Barry Levinson instead shows shots of a printing machine showing the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. The numbers constantly rise. It's very effective.Essentially, though, 'Good Morning Vietnam' is a hilarious comedy starring the master of improvisation, Robin Williams. Williams plays a non-conformist radio DJ, who essentially tries making the troops laugh. The GIs love him, but the military's top brass (especially Sgt. Major Dickerson, played by J.T. Walsh) is up in arms.Interesting enough, by the end of 'Good Morning Vietnam', we learn so much more about the characters— except Adrian Cronauer (Williams). He uses his comedy as a wall, keeping people from learning about him. When stranded in the wilderness, he starts using one-liners on the trees, for instance. This is a guy who remains a secret because he wants to— and it works, developing his character better than any back-story could.Another extremely effective touch in 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is the music. Sometimes, I'm not a fan of music with lyrics in films (most often, instrumental music works best, in my humble opinion). But in 'Good Morning, Vietnam', songs about love are being played to accompany a time of war. It's a successful move.The acting of the film is exemplary, including a touching performance by an actor you probably never heard of, Tung Thanh Tran. Memorable performances come from Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and J.T. Walsh, and Williams even got an Oscar nomination for his performance.To conclude, 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is an interesting (to say the least) mix between wartime drama and comedy, aside from being plain old hilarious.",10,1,1,31 May 2009
Apocalypse Now," The horror... The horror... of overrated movies...
","If there has ever been an overrated director, Francis Ford Coppola is the one. Apocalypse Now is nearly universally praised as one of the greatest war films of all time. I consider it to be one of the most overrated movies of all time; far from a masterpiece, it merely cashes in on the American anti-war sentiment of the time.Let's begin with the film's story itself, shall we? Well, although adapted from fantastic source material (Conrad's Heart of Darkness), Apocalypse Now has a very vague plot joining the film. As I have learned, the film was plagued with production problems, which may be why this is so. Either way, the film is comprised of a few interesting scenarios (I particularly liked the boat massacre) tied together in an extremely convoluted way. The story makes no sense, because it's practically irrelevant— too much side material takes away from a promising plot.I've said time and time again that Coppola has a very feeble grasp of suspense. During the duration of Apocalypse Now, what does the hero, Willard, do? He watches. What does the audience, therefore, do? We watch Willard watching. The increasing chaos downriver is not a magnificent suspense builder. To be honest, it's sheer boredom.And what of the characters? Willard is a character made out of cardboard. All he does is frown and think about his mission. I couldn't empathize with him at all, and frankly didn't care whether he was successful in his mission or not. His crew is a ragtag bunch of sketched-in, half realized, uninteresting characters. Robert Duvall's character has fantastic potential, but emerges as uninteresting: he appears, demonstrates Coppola's point that the military is a bunch of hypocrites, and disappears, all without contributing much to the plotAnother thing: a novelist's approach does not work in films. The drama should be performed, and not narrated. Although voice-over proves effective at times, Apocalypse Now is one great big, long voice-over that quickly becomes stale, boring and ineffective.Another thing: the film supposedly 'truly captures' the insanity of war. No. What it does is 'subtly' point out the hypocrisy of the American army. They eat meals that the guys in the field would die for. They were planning to punish Kurtz for his murder of four civilians, but praised him once the press got a hold of the story. They send Willard out to kill Kurtz because he's half insane already. There's no leadership at the bridge. The soldiers go absolutely insane over the Playboy 'playmates' instead of concentrating on the war (that was one of the film's most disturbing scenes-- not in a good way). A man indiscriminately shoots down innocent Vietnamese peasants. Robert Duvall's character attacks a village because the beach has 'the best waves' for surfing. Far from subtle, it points out exactly what Apocalypse Now is: a cash cow for Hollywood after the anti-war movement.And now for the good bits: After over two hours of insane boredom, Marlon Brando appears AT LAST. After two hours of watching Willard watching the 'insanity' of the war, I was glad for a character of interest. Most of Brando's dialogue was, apparently, ad-libbed, and you can tell. His dialogue does not reek of Coppola's mediocre (or just plain bad) screen writing. That is the film's one redeeming quality: only due to Brando (whom I, ironically, consider the most overrated actor ever) is the last 20 minutes of any interest whatsoever. There is one other redeeming quality, and that is the boat massacre. Truly the film's strongest scene, it is sadly followed by a trail of disappointments that all but drown it out.The Verdict: Far from a masterpiece, Apocalypse Now is barely coherent. Coppola apparently described the film as 'not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam'. Incorrect. It is Hollywood raking in profits after Vietnam. It's no use accusing me of simply not understanding the movie's point, or of having to watch it again. (I'll live quite comfortably if I never hear of the film again.) As a matter of fact, I've seen it three times: the first in my film class, where I despised it, and had to study it and its 'messages'; the second on my own, where I appreciated it a little more, but not by much; the third prior to writing this review, where I returned to my original position. To be blunt, I don't like Apocalypse Now at all.Overall Rating: 2/10 (Brando's segment alone guarantees the 2)",2,19,37,15 June 2009
Quantum of Solace," Moderate Mess-Up
","Daniel Craig is one of, if not the, best Bonds ever. He was positively brilliant in 'Casino Royale', and he does an equally good job here. 'Quantum of Solace' takes its name from the short story in 'For Your Eyes Only', but it really has no plot similarities whatsoever (trust me, I read the story just to see if there's any similarities- there are literally none). The movie is a direct sequel to 'Casino Royale', the only one so far in the Bond franchise. Now, the idea was great, but it was ruined by two things.First of all, the direction. Where the hell did they pull Marc Forster from? The guy's direction was awful. During many of the chase scenes, I couldn't tell the difference between Bond and the villain. The style was really awful and confusing at times. I much preferred Martin Campbell's direction.The Bond girl oh, dear! Since the Bond girl has often been depicted as the 'damsel in distress' (which, in my humble opinion, works), they decided to go all 'politically correct' in this film. Camille is one of those 'tough girls', who is on a mission to kill the man who well let's leave that bit out. Let me point out something to the people behind QOS: you don't need to make the Bond girl tough for her to be good! Look at Vesper Lynd in 'Casino Royale'! Next thing we know, Bond will go steady with the Bond girl, just for it to be politically correct! *gags*Those are really the only two faults of the movie. The Bond villain lacks the usual deformity, which I liked! I mean, the villains are the kind of people who do well in society and all, and this really helps convey the sinister 'every-dayness' of the villain.So overall, 'Quantum of Solace' has its faults, but it's enjoyable, especially once you put its two major faults aside.",9,2,9,5 May 2009
Batman Begins," There's nothing to fear but fear itself...
","It took me a second viewing to truly appreciate 'Batman Begins'. Unlike most superhero movies, it isn't stuffed with non-stop action sequences and jaw-dropping stunts. That doesn't mean there's no action, but there is considerably less than in a typical action film. The first time I saw it, I thought it was O.K. The second time, I realized just how good it was.Yes, the movie can be somewhat slow at times. But it is Batman's first adventure after all. If he were to face his greatest challenge first (as he did in 1989 movie), then each film after that would progressively feel not as good. Starting with the villains they did, the ones who aren't as well-known, was a brilliant choice.Batman is no longer Arnold Schwarzenegger without an accent— gone are the days of lifting guys off a roof with a single hand. Gone is the 'Bat Credit Card', the convenient Bat-(insert weapon of choice here). The film goes for a more realistic touch than most superhero movies do, and that's what makes it really good.The casting was positively first rate. Everyone fit their roles perfectly, especially Cillian Murphy as the villainous Scarecrow (he would play another sociopath in the 2005 thriller 'Red Eye'), Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Gordon heck, let's not continue this list: everyone was positively brilliant! Hans Zimmer's score sets the background for all this. Gone is Danny Elfman's great-to-hum, heroic-sounding theme. As much as I liked it, Elfman's music wouldn't have worked for this movie. Zimmer's is positively brilliant, though.'Batman Begins' is one of the greatest superhero movies to ever be made. I hail it as a great movie.",10,4,6,5 May 2009
1941," An air raid without bombs
","1941 is often considered to be Steven Spielberg's weakest film, and it is simple to see why. Critics had been looking for an opportunity to bash Spielberg since Jaws became a phenomenon, and they finally got their chance with 1941. It was savagely attacked and has earned the reputation of a box-office disaster (although it did gain some money). It is actually slightly better than its reputation would suggest, but not by much.Steven Spielberg opens the film with a reference to Jaws, which is a treat. The film, unfortunately, quickly degenerates into a ridiculous slapstick routine, where so much goes on, it's hard to laugh at any of it. Too many different subplots circle around each other constantly. The result is that we are left with a comedy about strangers. The extremely limited character development transforms certain characters into mere sketches, and others into shadows.1941 is one instance where the director's cut of the film is far better than the original theatrical release. For instance, the Japanese crew of a submarine plan to attack Hollywood. To do this, they kidnap a man named Hollis Wood and try forcing him to tell them Hollywood's location. In the original release, he appears at random, his scene awkwardly placed. In the director's cut, the audience is first treated to an excellent scene where some of the crew go to the mainland disguised as Christmas trees, taking photos of themselves. Hollis Wood, who is in the Christmas tree business, attempts to cut what he thinks are trees down, and is kidnapped in the process.Visually and comically, the film's best scene is the jitterbug scene, where Wally tries dancing with his girlfriend at the USO (where he isn't supposed to be, as he is a civilian), trying to win the jitterbug contest, all while avoiding getting pummelled by the furiously jealous Sitarski. The complicated camera movement in this scene are a visual miracle, and, in addition, this is the film's strongest scene. Although Sitarski is successfully avoided several times, he eventually throws a punch, which soon evolves into a full-out brawl. The (presumably) club owner begins commenting on the fight into a microphone, reminiscent of a sports broadcast. It briefly seems that the film may become hilarious: the frantic, wild pace that infects the rest of the movie is not seen here. The scene finds its own pace somehow, and it's really effective. But soon after the fighting goes out into the streets, the comedy rapidly declines.The film 'scores' comically in its most subtle, small touches: patriotic, very American music plays as a couple is told their house is strategically advantageous for an anti-aircraft gun; a general sheds tears as mother and son are separated in Dumbo; an airplane lands at a gas station (one Spielberg used in Duel), and the pilots expects the service to fill it up; a ventriloquist's dummy spots a Japanese sub from atop a Ferris Wheel before its human counterparts do; Wynowski kicking Birkhead in the shins to make sure he's not a Japanese infiltrator on stiltsAlthough the list of comedic touches is considerably long, someone has to take the blame for the overblown, frenetic, overdone scenes that assume they will turn out to be funny: for some unexplained reason, Hollis Wood is forced to poop at gunpoint, escaping the Japanese sub by pretending he's constipated; an overblown special-effects driven scene as aircraft battle over Los Angeles; a homeowner shoots his anti-aircraft gun at a Japanese sub— through his house; the Japanese attack an amusement park, mistaking it for an industrial centre, causing the Ferris wheel to roll into the water; Loomis Birkhead constantly attempts to have sex with a plane-crazy secretary, Donna Stratton, by getting up in a plane with her (finally achieving this goal in a plane that barely seats the two of them); a woman, thinking she hears an air raid siren, shrieks 'Japs!' over and over again, but it is really the hero's plot to steal a zoot suit. The crude, poor excuse for comedy permeates practically the entire film, and is not funny at all.However, John Williams deserves a lot of credit for his music, which embodies the spirit of the comedy 1941 was intended to be. True, it is not his most brilliant score (it doesn't even make the Top 15 list), but it's one of the film's highlights. In particular, the music that accompanies the jitterbug riot makes the entire scene purely amusing. The music was a valiant effort to save the film from disaster, but it wasn't enough: the disaster still happened.The Verdict: In short, Steven Spielberg's 1941 is actually funnier than its reputation suggests, but not by that much. Critics lashed out at 1941 simply because it is a Steven Spielberg film, whereas other movies with less than half of 1941's imagination were not nearly as ridiculed. In the end, however, 1941 feels like it is a beached whale struggling to get back to the water. It has its moments, but is not a strong film in general.Overall Rating: 4/10",4,1,3,11 June 2009
Back to the Future Part III," A good conclusion to a fantastic trilogy
","Back to the Future was pure fun. Part II was extremely well-made but without the spirit of fun. Now, in Part III, the spirit of fun returns. Unfortunately, this film, despite being enjoyable, is the weakest instalment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It picks up where Part II left off, and is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunately, it would've been so much better had the recreation of the Wild West days been more meticulous. Instead, every cliché from a Clint Eastwood western is recycled in here (with Marty taking up Eastwood's name, in homage). The result is a more fun film than Part II, but not nearly as strong.In the original film, Marty travels back in time, helps his parents overcome personal problems and get together. Part II had the brilliant idea of giving Marty a problem he struggles with, which people from the places he visits try to help him with. This problem is him being unable to control himself when he is called a name. Part III carries on this subplot, along with a new romantic subplot, which are the film's strongest bits and true joys.The Verdict: Not as strong a sequel as Part II was, but the original's spirit of fun returns in Part III. The result is the weakest instalment of the series, but a fun one to watch nonetheless.Overall Rating: 9/10",9,1,2,26 June 2009
Million Dollar Baby," A 'million dollar' waste of your time.
","Clint Eastwood starred in, co-produced, directed, and wrote the music for Million Dollar Baby. And the result is typical for actors who direct their movies as well. This is, to put it nicely, a terrible movie. Until the ending, the movie's message seems to be 'you can accomplish anything if you try hard'. And then comes the ending, which destroys any possibilities of a moral from this movie. Eastwood does nothing new, playing his standard, anti-hero, 'tough guy' role. Morgan Freeman appears in this embarrassing movie, but miraculously, manages not to embarrass himself. This is a film overridden with clichés, absolutely boring and lifeless. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year. Must've been a bad year.",1,5,12,12 March 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Mission: Impossible Stunts 2
","Mission: Impossible 2 is loaded with stunts. From the very first sequence, this movie is jam-packed with action and gravity-defying stunts. Too much for its own good, as a matter of fact.First of all, let's start with the simple fact that Tom Cruise cannot act that well. He's decent, but never convincing in his role. His romantic interest, played by Thandie Newton, was absolutely horribly cast! I've never heard such unnaturally stressed sentences before! The only bright spot in the entire cast is Dougray Scott as the villain. The rest of the cast is either flat-out terrible or just mediocre.Now the plot: it was O.K. Trouble is, it called for one trick far too often. Countless times during the film, someone puts on a flesh mask and with an electronic device alter their voices, and pass themselves off as someone else. Now, the first time this was done, it was flat-out great! But by the time people began impersonating dead people, it got far too predictable and asinine.John Woo's direction? He focused mainly on the stunts, which I have to admit, were pretty good. But he's no 'acclaimed action director' like it says on the back of the DVD box. He's a second unit who got lucky!Yes, I was fooled by the nice DVD box that this was a movie worth buying. I hope no one else makes the same mistake.",3,0,2,12 March 2009
A Beautiful Mind," The word I'm searching for is 'amazing'
","A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash (Crowe), a brilliant mathematician. It begins by showing his days as a student at Princeton, where he searches for a completely original idea, something that will earn him widespread recognition. This goes on for about the first 25 minutes, and it is positively brilliant. But then, something happens. The next 20 or so minutes are extremely predictable and dull, as if it came straight out of a spy novel. This is my fault, though, because I find out as little as possible about a movie before seeing it. Had I tried finding out a little more about A Beautiful Mind, I would've surely seen the reason for this. Long story short, I wasn't expecting the major plot twist that came around the hour mark of the film, and that just blew me away. That dull 20 minutes is something I appreciated only when viewing the segment again, this time with the knowledge of why it seemed so dull. *** If you know positively nothing about ABM's plot, I strongly recommend skipping the following *** The praise for A Beautiful Mind is completely justified. Russell Crowe was positively robbed of an Oscar, as his performance is completely and wholly captivating from beginning to end. It is essentially due to his fantastic acting that Ron Howard brilliantly portrays schizophrenia. Researching the film a little more, I found that the movie takes enormous liberties with the real-life events it is based on, and has been heavily criticized for it. I disagree with such criticism. There is no way for a director to capture on film the mind of a schizophrenic. Nash's delusions are altered from auditory, but these liberties serve only to make them more powerful, shocking, and disturbing on screen. This is what makes the film so darn good— it captures the absolute pandemonium of the life of a schizophrenic. I really couldn't care less if the exact delusions experienced are not shown, so long as the atmosphere of such delusions is portrayed. The horror of Nash's tumultuous life is brilliantly captured when he 'attacks' his wife, thinking he is defending her from a gunman. *** Safe to read from here on *** The Verdict: A Beautiful Mind might not be faithful to the source material it is based on, but it transfers the atmosphere of the source material perfectly on screen. Russell Crowe's brilliant acting proves to be the film's foundations, along with Ron Howard's brilliant direction. (By the way, a special mention goes out to Vivien Cardone for a straightforward, yet bone-chilling, performance.) Truly a great movie, A Beautiful Mind is quite an achievement— undoubtedly the Best Picture of 2001.Overall Rating: 10/10.",10,1,4,13 June 2009
War of the Worlds," And here... we... go!
","BE WARNED! MAJOR SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!Adapted from H.G. Wells' fantastic novel, Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' falls just short of a masterpiece; a few strategically placed errors prevent it from attaining that high level. First of all, Tom Cruise, whom I once dismissed as a rather bad actor, delivers a fantastic performance. Dakota Fanning also does a great job—on paper, her character seems like a snivelling brat. On screen, she is a fantastic character: a daughter who needs more attention than Ray has been willing to give her—he is even unaware of her allergy to peanuts. (One of the most touching scenes was when she asks Ray to sing her a lullaby. Ray doesn't know the one she'd like to hear, so he resorts to 'My Little Deuce Coupe' as a poor substitute.) But the best actor of the piece is probably Tim Robbins. His character is an interesting fusion between Wells' clergyman and artilleryman, and Robbins, a fantastic actor, delivers a top-notch performance as Harlan Ogilvy.'War of the Worlds' begins as an amazing alien invasion movie. Spielberg's most interesting move was insisting that Tom Cruise's character not be heroic; throughout the film, Ray flees from the invasion, discourages others from fighting back, and is more of a coward than anything. (A rare and superb Tom Cruise moment occurs after he surrenders his car at gunpoint: instead of chasing after the vehicle, he sobs.) He must learn to accept his responsibility as a father (a recurring Spielbergian motif) during this extraterrestrial holocaust.One of the most powerful scenes in the entire film is when Ray decides that Ogilvy must be silenced. In a marvellous sequence, he blindfolds his daughter, Rachel, and asks her to sing a lullaby he doesn't know the words to. As he enters the room Ogilvy is in, we hear them struggle. Dakota Fanning delivers superb facial reactions while continuing her song, positively horrified, yet unable to see what is going on. The murder of Ogilvy is symbolic of the loss of her and Ray's innocence. The scene asks an important question: when reduced to such circumstances, how far would we be willing to go to protect our loved ones? This amazing scene would not have worked without the strong performances of Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning.However, screenwriters David Koepp and Josh Friedman mess up. Why oh why did Robbie (Justin Chatwin) have to survive? All that character build-up for nothing! 'War of the Worlds' ends with a melodramatic, dull thud. Previously, it was touching how Ray was willing to lie to himself and to Rachel that Robbie will meet them in Boston. He holds onto this illusion with great faith; it gives him hope. But when it turns out that Robbie really is alive, the effect is spoiled. Another problem occurs in the last half hour, when Ray suddenly starts acting heroic- and all that character buildup of Ray as a coward is wasted. (There are plot holes in the story, but they can easily be ignored. After all, most movies have plot holes, and if they're not too big, we can still sit back and enjoy the film.)Moving on, though Spielberg makes yet another great directing choice: he strictly sticks to Ray's perspective. He comes tantalizingly close to showing an epic battle between humans and aliens, but we see no more of it than Ray does. In short, the holocaust of the alien invasion is seen through the eyes of a few, in a similar way to how 'Saving Private Ryan' portrayed the horrors of WWII through the eyes of just a group of men. Another great move is having practically every shot from ground level: there are only a few that are from a bird's-eye view. This cements the story as from a person's perspective: Spielberg throws the audience into the story as part of the story, not as mere onlookers.'War of the Worlds' seems to always come out when people fear something. Wells' novel came out when the English were afraid of a German sneak-invasion. Orson Welles' infamous radio broadcast came when people feared a Nazi invasion. The 1953 version was made when people feared a nuclear war. Now, Spielberg's version was strongly influenced by the 9/11 attacks, where an invasion is no longer a fear; rather, a group of individuals willing to justify murder for ideological purposes strike fear into us.Of course, one cannot review the film without acknowledging the superb visual effects! The aliens' tripods are aesthetically pleasing, yet at the same time, extremely scary. They move with a fluid, aquatic quality about them which adds to the scariness. Another interesting thing is the 'threes': the tripods have three legs, as do the aliens, who also have three limbs. The number three is thus used to subtly point out just how different this alien culture is from ours.Something about the ending of 'War of the Worlds' has always appealed to me. After all of mankind's technological weaponry has failed, the alien onslaught is destroyed by the tiniest of creatures— mere bacteria. This is just great irony— despite all our technological feats, it is ultimately a germ that saves the human race from destruction What would've happened if humans had succeeded in eliminating the common cold?It is tempting to dismiss 'War of the Worlds' as a mere summer action-blockbuster popcorn flick, but in reality, it is a film that delves into deeper waters. Its superb quality is marred, however, by a too-bright, too-hopeful ending.The Verdict: An amazing movie until the final half-hour.Overall Rating: 9/10",9,4,7,26 April 2009
American Gangster," 'Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too.'
","American Gangster is a brilliant crime film, and that's all there is to it. Not only does it deliver pure, escapist entertainment, but it is also more thoughtful and thought-provoking than the average 'organized crime' film.The first thing I will comment on is the direction. I love Ridley Scott's direction. For one thing, he has an excellent grasp on building suspense, which in American Gangster plays a major role in keeping the audience involved. His direction is first-rate, and I noticed that he used the imagery of coffee very often in the film. A shot near the end of the film, where coffee is spilt all over a bed, is particularly effective (not to mention aesthetically pleasing). However, there is one aspect of American Gangster's direction I highly disliked, and that is the over, explicit sexuality, in particular the numerous naked bodies of women. I'm not a fan of these kinds of images in film (particularly when used in excess), but other than this problem, American Gangster's direction is pure gold.Another thing I particularly like about AG is that the characters do not feel like archetypes or stereotypes, which is a huge danger for any crime film to fall into. A particularly interesting move is that Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington's characters are practically the same because they're exact opposites. Crowe's detective finds $1 million in unmarked bills in the trunk of a car and returns it. Yet he cheats on his wife—he's an honest cop, yet dishonest in family life. Washington's character, meanwhile, is a criminal. But he truly loves his wife and his family— he's honest in family matters but dishonest where the law is concerned. The two are shadowy reflections of each other, and this only helps the story even more.Another fascinating thing about American Gangster is that it doesn't end in the conventional, blockbuster-style shootout. As for the music— it's effective, but forgettable— nothing to write home about.Here we get to the themes of American Gangster. One of them is family, and how it really does matter. Frank Lucas is sure to take care of his family. For instance, when he shows his mother her new room, it is revealed that he had a dresser built for it, built from his memory of a dresser she had when he was a child, one that was taken away. Frank, as is pointed out, also stands for progress. He is a successful black gangster, even more successful than the Mafia crime families. This is pointed out late in the movie, that he doesn't just 'represent himself', he is a symbol of progress, and not a crude caricature of the ruthless drug dealer.The Verdict: Other than the excessive numbers of nude women walking around on camera, American Gangster is pretty much flawless. It is both entertaining and thought-provoking, a rare mix.Overall Rating: 10/10",10,0,1,14 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," George Lucas gets it right!
","After the extremely disappointing 'Attack of the Clones', I was expecting next to nothing from the next instalment in the Star Wars saga— 'Revenge of the Sith'. Luckily, 'Revenge of the Sith' completely outdid its predecessor. For once, George Lucas got it completely right: a good story, good acting, great special effects, and John Williams' fabulous music all add up to create a really good movie.Let's start with the acting: Natalie Portman is fabulous as Padmé. Her look, though, looks like a really cheap rip-off of Carrie Fischer's character in the original trilogy. Hayden Christensen's acting improved vastly since Attack of the Clones, but he still has his 'spoiled and annoying brat' moments. Samuel L. Jackson finally gets off his comfy chair in the Jedi Council for more than 10 minutes, and demonstrates some really neat lightsaber duelling. However, Jackson's acting is quite consistently poor. I found out that when signing his contract, he insisted that when it came for his character to die, he should die a dramatic death, and not be killed off 'like some punk'. Well, his death was certainly dramatic, but it was also obviously crafted just to fit the deal: in classic George Lucas style, it's too dramatic, and in the end, it just seems to lack something. Ian McDiarmid, however, who was absolutely perfectly villainous as the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, gives an equally stunning performance. At last, that friendly, industrious Senator Palpatine reveals his true, villainous face, coercing Anakin to join the Dark Side and turn his back on the Jedi. He is perfectly sinister every moment he's on screen.I wish George Lucas would stop this 'I-can't-go-wrong' attitude of his, though. His script writing is quite poor: the dialogue is cheesy, for lack of a more intelligent word, especially his love scenes, which are just 'bleh!' (for lack of a better, more intelligent word).On the bright side, to make up for his ineptitude at direction, John Williams returns yet again to compose a beautiful score, which helped take my mind off what Lucas did wrong, and focus on the story, which for once, was actually really good, despite the fact that we all knew what the end would be. Anyone who's seen 'A New Hope' knows for sure. Heck, anyone who reads the back of the DVD box knows the end! The special effects are stunning, and for once, not too distracting. The lighstaber duels, by the way, are breathtakingly choreographed- but they don't even come close to rivaling the breathtaking Duel of the Fates.So, all things considered, 'Revenge of the Sith' is surprisingly successful.",10,3,8,5 May 2009
The Terminal," A delightful surprise
","'The Terminal' is a delightful little comedy from Steven Spielberg's directorial chair. It centers on the plight of Victor Navorski (Hanks), who becomes stranded at the airport when his country erupts into a bloody civil war, where he meets Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones).I found the movie's plot to be fascinating, full of interesting possibilities. Tom Hanks delivers a top-notch performance, and he really has some fantastic chemistry with Zeta-Jones. But when it comes to Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), I really have to give the writers a hand here. What a temptation there would be to make Dixon a sadist, an unsympathetic caricature of corruption, bent on Hanks' elimination from 'his' airport. But no. Dixon insists Navorski must break the law. 'I'm not gonna lie' he says, 'especially to get rid of someone like Viktor Navorski.' He's a man so caught up in bureaucracy, he's become completely indifferent to the immigrant's plight, evidenced when he refuses to let a Russian man take medication home to save his ill father, because the man hasn't got the proper forms. Critics have focused almost exclusively on 'The Terminal''s romance between Viktor and Amelia, but when examining the movie a little closer, you can see that it is in reality a scathing political commentary by Steven Spielberg in the guise of a light romantic comedy. It critiques how, as a society, we have forgotten about the immigrant's plight in place of stricter, xenophobic security.Of course, now I'm making it sound as if this film were not funny at all. Au contraire! The situations Viktor gets into at the airport are hilarious, Spielberg's comic relief working overtime. A true Hollywood rarity this is: a comedy with thought behind it. After the dreadful toilet humour 'comedies' of late (such as the 'American Pie' or 'Austin Powers' films), we can take relief in the quirky humour 'The Terminal' has to offer. I sincerely believe this film has the chance to become a classic.",10,3,5,12 May 2009
Back to the Future Part II," Let's go back to the future again!
","Back to the Future Part II has a storyline that is almost more interesting than the original film's. In it, the idea of alternate time lines is introduced. This is handled admirably: the situations that Marty and Doc get into are inventive, creative, original, daring, bold, exciting, and all the rest of it. But one serious, serious flaw permeates the entire film.Here is the problem: the film is far too serious. It's too dark, it's too menacing, it's too (dare I say it?) intimidating. The original Back to the Future was pure, unadulterated fun. Part II follows the trend of nearly every trilogy after the highly successful Star Wars series: the first film is fun, the second is extremely dark, the third will often return to the original's spirit. This worked for Star Wars, but not Back to the Future. Had it been any other film, this would've ended up so much better— Back to the Future should be a lot of fun to watch. Part II was more thoughtful and contemplative, and although the film was strong, it did not feel like the same series or the same director.The Verdict: A very strong, well-made, original, and well thought-out sequel, but without the spirit of fun that made the original such a blazing success.Overall Rating: 9/10",9,0,0,26 June 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," I woke up one morning married to a pineapple! An ugly one. (But I loved this film so...)
","I was fortunate enough that my local theatre was not showing Ice Age 3 in 3-D. It is a technology that I thoroughly despise, and it is one of the most distracting gimmicks ever created for film. I was able to enjoy Ice Age 3 without getting relentlessly pummelled by 3-D (although, to be honest, I am slightly interested how 3-D was pulled off here).Hopefully, Ice Age 3 will be the final instalment in the series. After the extremely disappointing Ice Age 2, I was expecting next to nothing from this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which is the best of the series.Ice Age 3 finally solves the problem of the 'Scrat' sequences. As much fun as the original was, the scenes involving Scrat felt random, awkwardly placed, and irrelevant. Scrat now has a role more tied in with the plot, and enhanced thanks to the introduction of a romantic interest/rival. Not only do these sequences remain hilarious, they feel more like part of the movie.One of the great things about this movie is all the references. Ice Age 3 gloriously lampoons so many genres and films. It spoofs romance films wonderfully: when Scrat and Scratte kiss for the first time, lava shoots up behind them, bringing to mind the classic image of waves crashing high as lovers embrace. The interactions between the two bring countless romantic comedies to mind. Jurassic Park is often spoofed, such as one shot near the beginning that reminds one of the 'raptors in the kitchen' scene. The familiar group of animals meet an insane survivalist, Buck (gloriously voiced by Simon Pegg), whose role not only serves the story, but also spoofs 'stranded-in-the-middle-of-nowhere' movies. Pegg comes across as hilarious; Buck made me laugh the most. (Yes, I actually *laughed* during this movie.) There's even a fantastic spoof of action films, where the hero so often must decide whether he must cut the blue wire or the red.The Verdict: Ice Age 3 is a pleasant surprise. The first film was fun. The second was a disappointment. Ice Age 3 is the best movie in the series, and the funniest. Although geared for kids, I too enjoyed it. It was loads of fun.Overall Rating: 10/10 (Now don't get me wrong: the movie isn't flawless. But I'm giving this rating simply because it was that much fun.)",10,1,3,1 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Rather Good...
","Star Wars begins as a really dull, flat, and boring film. 25 minutes into the film, and I still couldn't care less about the main characters. To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes 'watchable'. It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.What's wrong with the first 25 minutes? It's just plain boring. Perhaps the biggest error is having the majority of the first 15 minutes spoken in an incomprehensible alien language. It is just so flat, that the appearance of Luke Skywalker does almost nothing to balance it out. But as soon as the plot picks up, it doesn't slow down.I also hate George Lucas' direction. His eternally wooden camera does little other than panning throughout this movie, and in fact, his career.James Earl Jones delivers an amazing performance as Darth Vader (O.K., I know he does only his voice, but still, that guy's voice is AMAZING!). Vader is the perfect choice for a movie villain: that mask is creepier than any deformed or disfigured face could be: always expressionless, constantly breathing heavily He's just plain, old-fashioned scary! This movie certainly has some fantastic acting, particularly from Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones (of course), and Mark Hamill (who would later voice the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series).Of course, the movie has its faults, especially when it comes to characters. Chewbacca and R2-D2 are quite possibly more annoying than watching Ace Ventura: The Animated Series.So overall, Star Wars begins very boring, but is very entertaining by the end.",7,5,7,12 March 2009
300," Oh, for the love of Greece!
","I heard nothing but praise for 300. Having seen it, I must say I was sorely disappointed.The main praise came from the film's unique look. Unique? Yeah, it looks like an XBOX game turned movie. And the dialogue makes it look even more like that ('Let's go for a walk' Meanwhile, I'm thinking: 'New Level! Kill the Persian Sentries!'). As for the performances, the only actor who was really good was Gerald Butler. His character was the only interesting one! Everyone else was really dull and boring. The beginning of the movie? Completely messed up. Irrelevant sex, killing a wolf in the wintertime to become king (?), etc. The movie was constantly slowing down then speeding up (I grew completely sick of this by the end- just about everything seemed to be in slo-mo), the blood spatters were overemphasized, over-exaggerated, and quickly became 'same old, same old', people jumped ten feet away when they were stabbed (?), legs and hands were chopped off with no difficulty whatsoever, demons and deformed monsters fight for the Persians, and there's also the 'tank' (whose main role is to provide the king with an opponent that lasts more than 35 seconds). Why all the praise for Snyder's direction style? I don't know. I hated it! And when we get to the historical inaccuracies, this movie takes the prize. I understand a movie can and should take artistic license, but rewriting history to this extent is unbearable!The only part of the film worth watching is from the final battle onwards (although even then, there are a few 'uhm.' moments). So, to conclude, 300 is completely unjustified in all the praise it's gotten. Appealing to the superficial teen audience after gore, perhaps, but not a deep film in the least. A much better 'Greece' movie is 'Troy'. It took plenty of liberties with Homer's Iliad, but at least it turned out as a good-to-watch movie, and not the year's annual gore-fest.",1,7,13,12 March 2009
Apollo 13," Houston, we have no problem...
","Many would argue that, because it is based on true events, history ruins the ending of Apollo 13, and thus, its thriller aspect is worthless. I will confess to ignorance here: I knew next to nothing about the real-life mission, and thus, I was able to really enjoy the movie's thriller aspect.The first half hour of Apollo 13 basically introduces the main characters. Its slow pace actually helps it in the long run; it plods along and finds its own, comfortable pace. Some mightn't like this, but I did. As soon as a little complication is introduced involving Gary Sinise's character, the movie skyrockets forward and doesn't stop. Characters that we've gotten to know and care for are then involved in one scary series of events, making the film that much more thrilling.Ron Howard really knows how to direct. The suspense sequences of Apollo 13 work out fantastically. He doesn't add unnecessary material to the film to make it more popular to the masses. There is no 'asteroid field' sequence that a superficial teen audience would go crazy over. As a result, the film really feels like it is taking place in outer space. This adds a layer of realism to the (fantastic) special effects, and the film is that much better.An added bonus is Tom Hanks in the lead role as Jim Lovell. He is one of the few popular actors who really deserve all the praise. Hanks adds a touch of humanity to his role; he doesn't feel like an unerring, invincible protagonist, and he doesn't feel like a 'Gary Sue' who will mess up at all the appropriate times. As the ship's crew begins to argue, Hanks joins in the shouting, trying to 'break it up'. But it isn't his voice that stops the arguing. Hanks makes his character and the danger he is in feel real. That takes real talent.But Hanks is not the only one who deserves praise. Every single actor in the film, from Gary Sinise to Ed Harris, does a fantastic job. Their characters are not imitations of real-life personages; they are their own. Everyone seems to fit their character perfectly, even Jim Lovell's elderly mother (who is introduced lamenting that her son's broadcast is not on TV).Arguably, Apollo 13's most pleasant surprise is found in its gentle inclusion of comic relief. It doesn't seem intrusive or inappropriate. The best way to describe it is 'gentle'. For instance, two world-famous astronauts are introduced to Jim's mother as regular, ordinary young men. It's funny and doesn't seem forced into the plot.The Verdict: Apollo 13 is a splendid little film, thrilling when it has to be, comic at times, and carried all the way by splendid performances from all the actors. Solid direction and superb visual effects just add to make it the great film it is.Overall Rating: 10/10",10,15,17,20 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A stunning success!
","For some reason, the beginning of this 'Star Wars' movie is 'messed up' again. In the original Star Wars, the first 25 minutes is boring. The same argument does not (indeed, can not) apply to The Empire Strikes Back. It starts on an exciting note, and the excitement never slows down. What's wrong then? The beginning is just too confusing! A while passed between the two films, and Luke's voice sounds somewhat different. So for about the first 10 minutes of the movie, (where no faces are shown, and only Han Solo's name was mentioned) I was wondering: 'Is it really him? Or was it someone else?' Omitting that confusing first 10 minutes, this movie was, to be perfectly honest, amazing. The acting really improved, I think, from the original. I positively loved Billy Dee Williams (who should've played Two-Face in Batman III) in this movie. James Earl Jones, who delivered a fantastic performance in the original, was even better here. (Darth Vader's sardonic line 'Apology accepted' was just amazingly delivered!) He was even scarier, I'd say. Harrison Ford's character was a little more developed, as was Carrie Fisher's. Mark Hamill did a great job, too.Of course, now we get to the list of annoying characters. C3PO really began to bug me in this movie, which he didn't do as much in the original Star Wars. I still found Chewbacca to be really irritating most of the time. R2D2's inability to communicate in anything other than beeps and whirs (that had to be interpreted by C3PO) got on my nerves really often. And, of course, before Yoda revealed who he was (although everyone knows by now how he looks like), he was the most annoying of the lot.What I loved about this movie was John Williams' music. He certainly went against my expectations. Instead of composing a sci-fi sounding score, with futuristic sounding instruments, he composed one 'traditionally'. And it was far more effective than any sci-fi music could've been! The plot is a lot more exciting, dangerous, and, I'd say, refined, than the original. It never slows down it's a wild ride. It certainly is a huge improvement over the original Star Wars.",10,0,1,12 March 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," A Truly Great Movie!
","There is one thing I disapprove of in our movies: the sex. I have seen several movies that were great ruined because of the infamous 'sex scene'. This is why I love THE PURSUIT OF Happiness: it is clean all the way through- a true rarity nowadays. A standing ovation goes out to Will Smith for his amazing portrayal as Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman, who pursues happiness for him and his son, overcoming several barriers such as bankruptcy, divorce, and poverty. There is one minor drawback to the movie: it deals with a very serious subject. Children shouldn't watch this film, in my opinion, as it deals with mature subject matter.EDIT: This comment was written in what I like to call my 'pre-taste' days, and will be updated soon.",10,3,5,27 December 2007
Back to the Future," One of the most fun-to-watch films to date
","Christopher Lloyd stars alongside Michael J. Fox in the fantastic Back to the Future. Essentially, the plot revolves around time travel— Marty McFly (Fox) goes back in time, messes around, and accidentally causes his mother to fall in love with him instead of his father. He has to fix his mistake or else he may be wiped out from existence.Robert Zemeckis was the perfect man to direct this film. In it, I couldn't help detecting some of the spirit of Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' (one of my favourite movies). This movie can be thrilling or exciting, but the key element throughout is fun. This is simply a fun film to watch. Cultures from the 80s and 50s clash, Marty discovers his prudish mother was once a teenager like him too, and in general, the film proves to be enjoyable.The film's music (a fantastic score composed by Alan Silvestri) really epitomizes the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Its triumphant tones at certain key moments are not obtrusive; instead of adding to the awareness that one is watching a movie, it seems to engross the viewer even more.I will freely admit that the film's outcome is evident from the very beginning. However, the road that takes the audience there is full of fun, unexpected twists and turns.The Verdict: Plain, old-fashioned fun, and it can be the topic of discussion for hours (although I've avoided it here for spoiler purposes). A great movie.Overall Rating: 10/10",10,1,1,26 June 2009
Goodfellas," As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster...
","To be frank, 'Goodfellas' is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that 'Goodfellas' far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved 'The Godfather' has to offer.In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of 'The Godfather' depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of 'Goodfellas' are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is 'As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster'. At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there.Another thing that is better about 'Goodfellas' is its length, 146 minutes compared to 'The Godfather''s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. 'The Godfather', as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about 'Goodfellas'. Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of 'Goodfellas' are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here.Martin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing 'Goodfellas'. One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) 'Vertigo effect' (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming clichÃ©, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies 'Goodfellas' is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. 'Goodfellas' is just about flawless.Overall Rating: 10/10",10,5,8,30 June 2009
Jurassic Park," Masterpiece hardly describes it
","Story time! I remember that, as a little kid, at a friend's house one day, everyone started watching a Jurassic Park movie (I now know it was the second one). Anyhow, I managed to get scared out of my wits within the first 10 minutes. Long story short, Jurassic Park was one of the movies my mom would never let me watch as a kid. So it kind of sucked, me 'playing the home game' while the other kids talked about how amazing Jurassic Park was (ah! I miss the grade school days). I miraculously managed to not have the movie spoiled (or not to remember having it spoiled). So when my film teacher announced 'we're going to watch a movie that, like Terminator 2, really developed special effects: Jurassic Park', I was really pleased that I would finally get to see just how good the film all the kids way back when loved was. I was not disappointed.Have I mentioned how much I love Steven Spielberg? Well, I will now. Spielberg is an amazing director, without a doubt my favourite. He has yet to let me down. First of all, the graphics in Jurassic Park are amazingly believable, even though it's obviously fake watching it today. Second, Spielberg's direction style is just amazing. Many shots were reinforced and made really powerful thanks to his handling of the camera (combined with a heavenly score from the great John Williams).Prior to Jurassic Park, I couldn't remember many thrillers where I was genuinely thrilled. Things don't explode to provide a moment's excitement in Jurassic Park, it is a pure roller-coaster of thrills from beginning to end. I also genuinely cared for what happened to the characters. Terrific acting took care of that. How good was it? Let's put it this way: I have a terrible habit of biting my nails. I never once did this while watching Jurassic Park.The movie's main villain, Dennis Nedry, is one of the most interesting villains I've ever seen. Spielberg purposely makes his intentions unclear. Was he planning to return and put the park back to normal? Or was he going to leave with the boat, and abandon everyone? Either way, as much as I hated the idiot for shutting down the electrical fences, I didn't hate him enough to want him to die. I was genuinely frightened for the guy when he confronted the dinosaur.'The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters', Mr. Ebert? I think not! I don't know just what it was: John Williams' music, Spielberg's direction, or fantastic acting, but every character, from Richard Attenborough's to the two kids, was fully developed in the movie. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills (I'm happy to say I've been desensitized as to the disturbing bits).Apparently, when Jurassic Park came out, my uncle bought tickets and saw it thirteen times. Before I saw it, I thought to myself, 'How could you see a movie so many times?' Now that I've seen it, I see why. Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, and a groundbreaking achievement in technology as well. Thank you, Steven Spielberg! The least I can do is give this movie a very enthusiastic 10/10.",10,5,8,12 March 2009
The Godfather," An offer you can conceivably refuse...
","WARNING! SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!The beginning of The Godfather is both horrifying and engrossing. The first shot is in a dark room, as a man speaks to Vito Corleone (Brando) of an appalling attempted rape on his daughter. The criminals have escaped American justice, but he wants (what he considers) real justice to be done. As it is his daughter's wedding day, Corleone (as a Sicilian) mustn't refuse a reasonable request. And thus, the opening scene of the film plunges the viewer directly into what is one of the most respected movies of all time.And yet, as effective as this move is, it can also be extremely confusing. As a non-Italian viewer, the sudden immersion into Italian culture created a disconcerting effect.Thankfully, for a film that is nearly three hours long, The Godfather has plenty of action going on, spanning 10 years, yet rarely becoming boring. Unfortunately, when it does become boring, it is because Coppola falls into the trap he fell into with Apocalypse Now: too much side material makes the plot irrelevant. His muddled concept of suspense at times left me completely bored. The Mafia is often treated as a bureaucracy, with men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other, then promptly killing each other. Many of these scenes end up being ineffective.Incidentally, it is curious that although the central characters of The Godfather are members of the Mafia, the viewer somehow sympathises with them. Why? I believe I've found the answer. We never see the individual victims of crime. We never see women reduced to prostitution, a family broken up by gambling, drugs ruining a man's life. The only cop we see with speaking lines is corrupt, and promptly killed off. Although the characters are, at heart, immoral, the effects of their immorality are limitedly shown. And this might be why the characters have such appeal: instead of gangsters, they become a dysfunctional family. Thus, The Godfather, often dismissed as a thriller, is most aptly classified as a drama.For me, one of the (if not the) best scenes in the entire film is when Michael (Pacino) attends his sister's son's baptism, where he stands as the godfather. As the priest asks him whether he renounces Satan and all his works (etc.), Michael answers 'I do'. In a masterfully inter-cut scene (kudos to Coppola), this moment of the baptism is shown to take place simultaneously as several murders Michael has arranged. The juxtaposition of these two moments is highly effective (much more so, in my humble opinion, than the brutal execution of Carlo minutes later), and is one of the moments that make The Godfather the oh-so-sweet treat it is.However, despite being one of the most respected movies of all time, The Godfather undeniably is flawed (gasps!). There are so many characters to keep track of, that several of them remain sketched-in shadows. In addition, Coppola has thrown in a subplot about Michael's life in Sicily after he flees America, which is not only ineffective, but also slows down the tone of the film, and brings in doubts over just how much Michael loves his wife, a situation affirmed when he lies to her at the film's end, denying his involvement in the murders. It just feels stiff, awkward, out-of-place, and slows down the film. And of course, I think that Michael ordering his sister's husband to be killed is possibly the film's biggest flaw. Michael shows positively no concern for Connie: his only thought is to avenge his brother. Well, this relentless circle of vengeance gets dizzying at times.When it comes to acting, there's practically no argument. The Godfather is one of the best-cast films ever. Marlon Brando in particular works well. (Nay, I'll revise that-- he IS the Godfather.) His final scene, as he dies playing with his grandson, works precisely because of Brando's acting.The score for The Godfather was composed by Nino Rota, and a very effective score it was! The theme in particular seemed to melancholically say: 'If only we had listened to the GodfatherÂ…' Finally, I find it fascinating how, with subtlety, later events in the film are foreshadowed. The most brilliant case of foreshadowing occurs when a film studio boss (whose name completely escapes me) shows off his prize horse, boasting of its price and how he plans not to race it. This serves as such a clever way of foreshadowing the (gruesome, yet effective) slaughter of the horse.The Verdict: Although The Godfather is undeniably a very good movie, it has been overrated, emphasis put on its good points, yet its flaws shockingly overlooked. It's currently #2 on IMDb's Top 250-- but it should, in my humble opinion, be a lot further down the list.Overall Rating: 6.5/10",6,0,3,4 June 2009
