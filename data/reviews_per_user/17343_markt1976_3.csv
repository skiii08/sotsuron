Requiem for a Dream," disturbing, yet thought provoking.
","Every once in a while you see a film that sticks with you a few days after seeing it. Requiem for a Dream is one of those films. It is a truly disturbing look at drug addiction that features some incredibly good performances from all actors, especially Connelly and Burstyn. Some may find the technical aspects from the film a bit 'artsy' but I enjoyed this film nevertheless. I don't know if it is the kind of film I could watch over and over but it definately warrants at least one viewing. Check it out, you will be glad that you did. 8/10",9,0,1,6 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," critically acclaimed does not mean it's good.
","All the critics seemed to love this film and it is number 98 on the all time list of this website at the time of writing. So, I rented it out. This movie has no plot, absolutely nothing happens and is total rubbish. Everybody says you do not need to understand this film to like it. These are the lemmings who always agree with the 'experts' and don't dare to have their own opinion. A blind dog with one leg could have made a better film than this.",1,7,16,3 August 2002
Signs," dreadful movie
","The first sign I got watching 'Signs' was a long yawn. The second sign I got was my eyelids feeling heavy. The third sign I could not wait for was the neon one spelling exit. The director who brought us 'the sixth sense' is what is known in the music industry as a one hit wonder. Even A-Ha had one good song. 'Signs' makes 'Police Academy 6' look like an Oscar contender. The plot is.....invisible. The characters boring, (I mean I was hoping that little brat with asthma would just stop breathing and die already.) Mel Gibson must have taken so much money on his salary little else was available for special effects. Check out the alien who looks like a Winter Olympian luge athlete with the tight green bodysuit. This is one of the poorest movies I have ever seen in my life. I could not even recommend this to my worst enemy. 0/10 (I can't see where to give it 1/10. Yes, it is that bad.)",1,2,3,7 August 2002
