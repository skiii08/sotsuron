The Rock," Interesting 'OCCULT Background' behind THE ROCK
","First, I should correct what was said in a previous comment : Stanley Goodspeed (N.Cage) was a an agent of F.B.I. not C.I.A.Second and most important thing :Many people know that the FBI was directed (before 'James Womack'!) by a curious and famous figure: John Edgard HOOVER.Of course, many books tried to describe his life, especially his fantastic-VERY LONG-Director-Career (from 1920's until his 'death' in 1970's !).Many of those books maintained that he was the 'Real Master of Puppets' behind the 'presidents' of USA (maybe one refused, and his tragic and enigmatic 'End' could have been answered by Goodspeed-in the french version:'Cherie! Tu veux savoir qui a tue KENNEDY!?').Also, it was known that JOHN E.Hoover was a member of FREEMASONRY,Scottish-Rite (Sure that this 'word' is very STRANGE for many of our 'compatriots'... however they should ask about its meaning!); the member of this Institution (or Secret Society??) is called a 'mason' .... Mason ?! Is it not the same like JOHN MASON ?! (who was Scottish!)So Now I can ask you :'Hey, Darlings! Do you know What Was OCCULT Behind the 'ROCK' !?!'Maybe the answer will be in 'ROCK2' .... Who knows ?!?",Null,1,2,22 February 2000
