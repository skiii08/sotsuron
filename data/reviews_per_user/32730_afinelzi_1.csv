Ford v Ferrari," Shelby and Miles
","I only know a little about cars and I effing love it! Ford v Ferrari is a movie that non race cars fans can experience such thrilling historical moments and I'm sure they'll enjoy it.I heard that this American sports drama was adapted from a memoir called The Carroll Shelby Story which was published in 1967 by Pocket Books. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes--the worst of which he describes as an 'explosion.' The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the Shelby Cobra. In Chapter 21, Shelby describes his life changing win at Le Mans in 1966 with driver Ken Miles against rival car manufacturer, Ferrari. (Anyway, this passage contains a little bit of spoiler, although in fact, it's not. It's merely a flash info I got from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Shelby'>wikipedia</a> right after I got out of the cinema and mesmerized).I like the idea of how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the story. Their relationship in the movie is spot on, portrayed really good by James Mangold and his team. My only complaint about this film is that, unfortunately, their in-depth story (relationship and adventure) wasn't dug deeper. We get to see the huge intrigue between two corporations. But that doesn't ruin the whole story. This drama is based on true event of an unsung hero. I didn't know all the true story until I watched this epic biopic the other night. I'm happy that I learned something from this movie. Even Matt Damon himself--in one of his interviews along with Christian Bale--didn't know the real story till he read the script. The way I see it, this film's not about winning or losing; this is all about 'achieving the goal'. I'm so impressed. It's totally worth to watch. No, it's actually a highly recommended film of 2019. Go ahead and see it in imax for better experience!",8,3,9,16 November 2019
