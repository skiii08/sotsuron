The New World," Wow.......this will put you to sleep.
","Terrible. The movie was so slow. The whole time there is an almost annoying sound in the music. It's like a trumpet that is to loud and only has one pitch. It plays over and over again. Also there are to many scenes were the actors are just running around in the grass looking at each other. It will drive you insane because they will stare and stare at each other but no one will talk. They just stare. I must say that with the talent of his actors Malick failed as a director. This movie is to flat. The trailer made it look like an action adventure when it is more like a documentary on the nature channel. Please save you money and the two and half hours of your life. Anyone who finds this movie entertaining has very low standards for a good movie. This is not a good movie, almost like 'Alexander' without the action. Do not see it.",1,6,17,22 January 2006
