The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Why is this a 2 part movie
","It makes no sense to make this movie a 2 part series, the worst part is how the movie is stretched to make more money from teens. Kristen Stewart is still awful and is making the movie dreadfull to watch.",1,0,0,21 May 2020
World War Z," Predictable
",The movie really tries to make up a story that is suprising and new. But during the movie the story becomes predictable and the actions which are taken become blund.,6,0,0,14 April 2020
The Danish Girl," A movie you have to see

Twilight," The worst
",One of the worst movies i've ever seen. Bad acting from both actors and the wat she falls for him is just uncomfertable. Tho whole creepy guy thing doesnt help his chqracter and in the real world Bella would have called the police for sure,1,1,2,20 May 2020
Get Out," Eye opening
",Beginning with an comforting setting that turns a full 360 degrees after the half time mark. The last part of the movie is strong and has a lot of hidden meaning. To understand the whole movie I watched it 3 times to find out about every hidden thing in this movie. Would definetly recommend.,8,0,1,10 April 2020
Room," Amazing story
",From the first minute till the last i was amazed by this movie and the story. The way it has been given form is amazing and the psychological ststement it wants to show the audience are remarable,10,0,0,20 March 2020
I Am Legend," Spectacular in its own way
",This movie has a great use of emotion where you can really feel the feelings that are shown on the screen. It really hits close to home when these specific emotionol scenes play. The only downside of the movie is the mediocre use of cgi.,7,1,2,26 April 2020
A Quiet Place," Interesting but marvelous
","The way this movie is shot makes for an interesting medium which is new for moviemaking. The use of sound is amazing and when the characters speak for the first time, makes it feel out of place compared to the silenced scenes before.",8,0,1,12 April 2020

Edge of Tomorrow," Incredible

Taken 2," Repetitive
",Compared to the first movie in the series taken 2 is to similair. Many plotholes are filled up with pure action and don't really axplain themselves.,6,2,3,8 April 2020
The Purge," Not interesting
","Looking at the 4 movies that are part of this, the first one is the worst. It is slow paced and has a very basic story to let the viewer understand what the idea of the purge is about. But if you are looking for a thrilling easy movie to understand, look nu further",5,0,1,26 April 2020
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The least worst of this already really bad saga
","The movie is a little bit better then the other movies, this is mainly because the actors who can act have a bigger role then kristen stewart.
