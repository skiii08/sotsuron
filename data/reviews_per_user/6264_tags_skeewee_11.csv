The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Finally A Half Decent Movie
","Because of the numerous terrible movies that come out now days and some of the reviews, I went into this movie with low expectations. Boy was I so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews. This movie was awesome. No there is no over the top action. And yes, there are some slow moments in the movie, but as a whole, the movie Rocked! I did not believe they would be able to make a good movie about the last book. And like others, I wondered why they would split it into two movies. They hit the mark with this pre-final movie. I actually got chills during some of the scenes like when Catniss goes to district 8 and is in the hospital and they throw up the mocking bird sign. There were so many great and intense scenes. I left the movie for once in a very long time, not regretting the money spent. I can't wait until part two. I hope hope that they don't mess it up. Can't wait to get this on DVD.",10,2,15,30 December 2014
The Equalizer," Denzel doing what he does best
","Some may say this is a usual Denzel movie. I agree in part but that doesn't take away that this was an awesome movie. Yes it's predictable, but the plot and action makes it OK. The movie does a good you in not fully explaining 'Roberts, background. It was fun trying to guess his background. It added to the suspense because just like the bad guys in the movie, I wanted to know 'who was he'. The action was great, not boring at all. Denzel does a great job playing these type of roles. The movie kept me engaged. The soundtrack was great. The robinhood/ninja character was interesting and kept you guessing. The special effects were not over the top. The last scene when Denzel is walking in water coming down and he has that cool, killer look as he slowly goes towards the bad guy while shooting him with the nail gun was priceless.",10,4,11,31 December 2014
John Wick," Awesome Action!
","This movie totally kicked ass. From the wonderful characters to the amazing action scenes. The soundtrack was on point. It drew the viewer into the movie. The hallmark of a good actor is to make you forget the actor and believe the character they are playing. Keanu IS John Wick. Yes the plot was predictable and a little over the top. WHO CARES! The plot was simple but the pacing and action scenes more than make up for the simplicity of the plot. You rooted for John Wick's character. I could imagine all dog lovers saying 'Kill em' All!' After the bad guys killed the most adorable puppy ever. The only thing that could have maybe helped believe John's motivation for destroying everyone was if more time between him and the dog was spent together bonding. But despite this...the movie was never boring. I never once thought 'this movie is stupid' or rolled my eyes at the ridiculous of it like I have at other movies like Expendable 3. You wanted John to come out on top. The action was exciting. It did try to be more than it was. It was an action movie. So great full that they didn't make this movie in stupid pg ratings. That is why many of the other action movies suck. People getting there heads chopped off but there is no blood..stupid. this movie held nothing back. It did not waste time on sappy love stories, sex was not overly displayed. Great characters, again one of the best action movies for the year. I hate I missed seeing it in a theater.",10,2,7,28 March 2015
The Maze Runner," Maze Runner...not
","I rented this from Red Box last night. Me and hubby started watching it. I fell asleep after 15 minutes. I woke up the next morning, thought maybe after a full nights rested sleep, maybe I fell asleep last night because I was tired,not because it was boring. So, I popped the DVD in and quickly surmised I fell asleep because it was boring. And stupid. It is evident that each year the average intelligence and common sense of today's youth is sadly declining. First off, the setting: we are expected to believe that a group of teenage adolescent hormones a blazing boys are communal, getting along...GET REAL! This may be more believable if this was a group of girls. The boys are supposed to have been in this maze/glade for 3 years, but their clothes look slightly used, there aren't any showers around but they look clean. The characters: who are these kids, where did they come from, why are they there, are the kids cloned, so many questions that are not answered. plot: made no sense what so ever. A forest in the middle of the desert?! Teens stuck in a maze and instead of trying to get out they farm?! Like another reviewer said, this should be called 'the field talker' not much time is spent in the actual maze. Ah, they finally get into the maze, I guess they ran out of money for set building. This has to the most boring maze ever. Spiders and falling rocks,that's all. There was no character development, you don't care about anyone. What is the point of the spiders? What is the point of the maze? So many questions left unanswered does not make me want to wait for the next movie. Think I will pass.",3,3,5,7 February 2015
Fast & Furious 6," You will either Love it or Hate it
","I loved this movie. Yes the plot, scenes are way over the top, but that's what makes this movie rock. It's an action, upon action movie, it was exciting to watch the scenes fly buy, the fighting was awesome, all through the movie, were super cool scenes, the cars, the locations, it was just great. I don't know what the Rock, Dwayne Johnson is doing, but he is a beast in this movie. The scene between him and the huge white boy at the end made me think of the fight between godzilla and mothra. The fight scenes between Michelle Rodrigues character and the other lady were tough, and exciting. All the supporting cast did their parts well. Laughter and good times by the whole crew was great to see. The plot was predictable but still enjoyable. You don't have any time to get bored because the breaks in action don't last that long. The movie is a great ride.",9,8,13,10 January 2014
Divergent," What the fudge sickle
","OK, where to begin. Why oh why does this type of crappy, stupid, make no sense, dribble, poor excuse for a movie get made? I rolled my eyes thru out the movie. So many issues, why this has over a 2 rating is beyond me. The plot was stupid, each scene was so predictable, You knew that Four and Trish were going to get together, they didn't bother with trying to develop why they ended up together, it just spontaneously happened, their 'love' story was completely unbelievable. Why was there a train running? Who was running the train? What was the purpose of the train other than something for the actors to jump on and off?! Trish becoming a kick ass fighter was totally unbelievable as well, the actress who played her did not pull off becoming 'tough' I laughed at the parts she was supposed to be beating up others, it was soo corny. This movie was boring, dumb, nonexistent plot that made any sense. Don't believe the 7.5 rating",2,3,6,21 August 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Unbelievable
","Was apprehensive about renting this from Red Box but said what the heck, it was getting better reviews than the horrible first one so I spent, I mean wasted my $1.50 on this poor excuse of a good movie. I really don't understand what rational, sane, person over 10 years old would find this movie entertaining. Like others have said so many issues with this movie would take all day to explain them all. This movie did absolutely nothing to add debt to the characters, you still don't or even care about any of the dwarfs. The action scenes a re so unrealistic they are boring. The crappy cgi once again makes this look like a video game. The characters did very stupid things like Bill tugging on obvious spiderweb which obviously was made by large spiders. The plot is ridiculous, Gandalf is not supposed to know about Saurons return until Lotr...it's just sad what Hollywood puts out.",1,6,8,19 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Well, not sure what else to expect
","I was going to wait until this movie came to redbox but got the urge to go see it in 3d. Oh how I wish I would have saved my $14. I'm not saying anything new. This movie was just 'ok'. It has absolutely no heart. There is no comparison to the LOTR movies. The hobbit movies are a poor, watered down version. What happened to Peter Jackson? It is obvious this was just about money. The crappy cgi characters did not help the movie. Video games have better graphics. The scenes were boring. Due to no character development, you do not give one iota who dies. You can't even remember their names. The ending was terrible. They didn't tie up any lose ends. Instead of wasting LOTS of time on Bilbo going back to the shire, they could have addressed many plot holes. Gandalf looked tired and bored. There were no surprises nor was any suspense. They most definitely overdid the superhuman Legolas defying gravity scenes. ..it was totally unrealistic. The fight scenes were boring...the same looking muscled up monsters, who could be felled with a rock thrown by a hobbit was just laughable. I agree with others, the 'love' triangle was not necessary and was rather boring and made no since...they were deep in love after seeing each a few times...really?! The pacing in the movie was terrible. There was no sense of passing of time. It's like the armies were just around the corner. Too many of the scenes had me thinking,'I've seen this before'. Too many lose ends: What happened to the gold? What happened with the elf jewels? What happened to Bard and his people? What happened to the dwarfs? What happened to the elves? It would have been interesting to see how Sauramon gets turned to the dark side. I could keep going but I'm sleepy now. That's my 2 cents.",3,7,14,23 December 2014
The Wolverine," Oh For the love of .......
","I had to take some No Dose to wake up to put in this review. This has to be the most BORING movie in the Xmen franchise. I was excited to rent the movie from red box, I should have saved my $1.50 or rented the something else instead. Who ever gave this drivel over 5 star had to be paid sponsors or smoking something funny. I fast forwarded thru much of the movie...I would have been upset if I had went to the movies..I just can't get over how utterly boring this movie is. The only good thing in this movie are a few, and I mean few fight scenes. Like other reviewers have pointed out, there are so many plot holes, there were no surprises, you knew that Logan was going to sleep with Miriko, you knew her fiancé was on the take, you knew the white lady was an evil mutant, I didn't care who lived or died...they just completely changed the makeup of the Wolverine, so what he is supposed to be indestructible, screw a plot that makes any sense..by the time it got to 'BIG' fight scene, my annoyed/suspend common sense quota had been Maxed out and I spent the rest of the movie writing this review. Save your money, and time..or better yet, if you have insomnia, play this movie, it will put you right to sleep.",1,0,1,17 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," SOOO glad I watched this bootleg
","It took me one week to finally watch this whole movie, fell asleep twice, got distracted by lint in my belly button, watching paint dry, etc. I don't know what people are looking at. This was SOO boring and the plot holes and ridiculous story lines was just too much. I agree with all the other negative reviews... couldn't understand anything Bane said, the fight scenes were 'yawn' boring, what happened to Batman's kick ass kungfu???He got slapped around like a 2 dollar hooker... no reasonable explanations for anything-how did he get back to US??? and what kind of 'hell on earth' prison has cable TV? Policeman come out of dark sewage like they are getting ready for a parade...the big melee fight, police have no guns, bad guys have guns and they just let the police beat them up???Talia's death scene, she needs to go back to acting school, I just burst out laughing...it goes on and on and on. Save your money, wait till it comes to video.",1,63,117,13 August 2012
Godzilla," Why?!!!
","Do not believe the positive reviews. Unless you enjoy monster movies that don't have monsters. It is unbelievable how utterly boring and crappy this is. My primary behavior throughout this movie was lots of eye rolling, face smerking, and lip curling. I laughed when Godzilla showed up, it was just plain ridiculous and lasted for 2 seconds. The characters in this movie are absolutely POINTLESS. Every move characters make makes no no sense. Giant monster coming at you, just stand there and stare. Why they called this Godzilla is beyond me. There is way too much people, the monsters, for there 2 seconds of screen time, just walk around. You don't see them destroying stuff, you just see the after affects. The plot is stupid, it would not matter if the movie was filled with lots of good action, but alas, they spend time throwing out stupid theories...WHO CARERS!!Obviously the wife of the soldier doesn't care. She and the son add absolutely nothing to this movie. Her husband is in a country where there is an earthquake, she can't be bothered. This movie is a Big waste of time. The monsters are boring, they look like plastic bugs. They are not scary or menacing at all. You don't care about anyone in this movie. A Godzilla movie with no Godzilla, not interesting just plain stupid.",1,1,6,21 November 2014
