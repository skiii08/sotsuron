Angels & Demons," Angelic Possession - Ron Howard and co attempt to atone for 'The Da Vinci Code', and mostly succeed
","Harvard professor and symbology super-sleuth Robert Langdon is back in this second adaptation of a Dan Brown novel. Besides the main character (played again by the inimitable Tom Hanks), the Oscar-winning team of director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer have returned for the sequel. In the wake of 2006's critically-derided The Da Vinci Code, how does its screen sequel fare?There's a terrorist threat to the Papal Conclave in the Vatican, and the clues seem to suggest an ancient evil is rearing his head, so the Vatican turn to Dr Robert Langdon. He is roped in by Inspector Ernesto Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) of the Gendarme Corps of Vatican City State (otherwise known as the Vatican Police) and decipher cryptic symbols left as clues by the Illuminati and assist the Swiss Guard and the afore-mentioned Vatican Police in rescuing the four cardinals and finding the antimatter before it consumes the Vatican. The beautiful CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) is also drawn into the fray, but even the combined expertise of both academics seems almost powerless to stop the looming Illuminati threat.Now, if the above synopsis sounds far-fetched, be warned that it is just the tip of this cinematic iceberg. Author Dan Brown is known for meddling fact and fiction and even passing off the former as the latter, achieving at-times laughable results. Plenty of plot points are downright ludicrous and there are enough contrivances to fill St Peter's Square. The key prefix in this film is 'pseudo' – the film is built on pseudo-science, pseudo-history, pretty much pseudo-everything. Stock characters and a fish market of red herrings also populate the picture. Therefore, suspension of disbelief is key. Thankfully though, the movie is paced well-enough, so much so that one eventually buys into the hodgepodge and goes along for the ride.We are treated to a wonderful tour of The Vatican City that is part The Amazing Race (but with dead bodies and shootouts instead of roadblocks and detours), part dramatic angel's-eye-views of the world's smallest country. The fortress-church Castel Sant' Angelo, the famous Sistine Chapel, Santa Maria Del Popolo with its imposing obelisk and the former Roman temple of 'all gods' the Pantheon all figure in this whirlwind romp. While some of Angels & Demons was shot on location, the filmmakers were not granted access to several sites within the Vatican Walls, as such set reconstructions and some digital magic was employed. The results are actually fairly impressive, one might even be fooled into thinking the computer-generated replicas are the real thing.Ron Howard and company are eminent forces in Hollywood today and exert that power by casting relatively big names. While this film boasts slightly less star power than its predecessor (The Da Vinci Code had actors such as Jean Reno and Ian McKellen among its cast), everyone puts in fairly credible performances here. Tom Hanks lends much credibility to the Langdon role, and gets plenty more to do in this than in the last film, from dodging bullets to saving a drowning man and from taking a dip in speedos to feverishly thumbing through ancient documents. Some of the time though, Hanks clearly has his tongue in his cheek, and especially excels in the rare humorous moments that do ease the cinematic tension. As the female lead, Israeli actress Zurer does barely as good a job as Hanks, relegated to tagging along in the mad dashes from church to church. However, she isn't a bad actress per se and I look forward to seeing her in more Hollywood projects.As for the supporting cast, it is good to see Ewan 'Obi-Wan' McGregor turning in his Jedi robes from the Star Wars prequel trilogy for the Camerlengo's cossack and back in a blockbuster, and truth be told he does a mighty fine job. The incredible Stellan Skarsgard (whom we've seen in such films as Good Will Hunting, The Hunt For the Red October and the Pirates of the Caribbean films), though seems under-utilized as the prickly Commandante; despite this the actor still fleshes out the slight bitterness his character bears towards Langdon with much relish.The film's small departures from the book seem to be a two-edged sword; on one hand the story has been streamlined and does work better for the screen, but on the other, interesting characters and other elements seem to have been sacrificed. Also, the book came before The Da Vinci Code, but the time-line has been altered such that this functions as a sequel, and the romantic subplot has been jettisoned in favour of a strictly professional relationship between Langdon and Vetra. It seems they learned their lesson from being too slavishly faithful to the book of 'The Da Vinci Code'.The movie is enjoyable in spite of (or perhaps because of) its sheer absurdity, offering up legitimate thrills and even a couple of outstanding action sequences. Far from being offensive or overly-controversial, Angels & Demons ends up being more cotton candy fluff than a 'lofty quest'. But have angels guided Howard and Co. in their mission nonetheless? Perhaps, though this film does have its fair share of demons to contend with as well.RATING: 3.5/5 STARS Jedd Jong",7,0,0,20 February 2011
Iron Man 3," Iron Man Tri-umphant!
","In the interest of full disclosure, I'm more of a DC Comics fan than a Marvel one. That said, I haven't missed a single one of the films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, established with 2008's Iron Man. The time has sped by on rocket boots, and with the Phase I films all in the bag, Phase II begins where it all started, with Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. (who else?) is back as Tony Stark, tinkering with new gadgets even as the events of The Avengers give him sleepless nights. His girl Friday Pepper Potts (Paltrow) has moved in with him, but Stark just won't give her the time of day even as the holidays approach. Enter the enigmatic terrorist mastermind The Mandarin (Kingsley), perpetrator of a series of vicious bomb attacks, one of which critically wounds Tony's ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). Tony swears revenge, and his home is assaulted by the Mandarin's forces in return. Stranded in rural Tennessee, he enlists the help of a local kid (Ty Simpkins) to help patch his armour in anticipation of The Mandarin's next strike. Tony also discovers links to Dr Aldrich Killian and Dr Maya Hansen, developers of the Extremis virus – a revolutionary piece of biotechnology that has turned dangerously unstable. Iron Man 3 is nothing short of a game-changer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the film, Happy Hogan doesn't work directly for Tony Stark anymore – a bit of leaning-against-the-fourth-wall winking, seeing as how Jon Favreau has passed on the director's baton to Shane Black, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Drew Pearce. Once one of the most sought-after screenwriters in Hollywood, Black proves he's still got the mojo he displayed with his screenplays for Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout in spades. Iron Man 3 has got his stamp all over it (notice the Christmas-time setting) and yet also delivers everything we've come to expect of a big-budget superhero blockbuster at the same time. The film is tightly-plotted and expertly paced; audiences certainly won't be twiddling their thumbs waiting impatiently for the next action scene to roll around. Said action scenes are plenty inventive though – a daring mid-air rescue which Stark compares to playing 'Barrel of Monkeys' and a dazzlingly-choreographed finale involving Stark hopping in and out of an array of Iron Man suits mid- combat being the prime examples. Black shows that he understands how important such displays are to the type of film he's making, but never lets the story get drowned out by the din of high-octane bells and whistles. A section of viewers have taken Iron Man 2 to task for spending too much of its running time in setting up the big event, The Avengers. Iron Man 3 suffers no such problem. The focus is squarely back on Tony Stark, and by now it is impossible to imagine the character being played by anyone other than Robert Downey Jr. At this point in a franchise, the leading man is wont to display signs of weariness or that he's only doing it for the paycheck – nope, not here. Downey Jr., armed with a new batch of one-liners and an even bigger new batch of armoured outfits, is having as much fun with the role as ever. He doesn't feel like he's hogging the spotlight though, because both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow get more to do here in their supporting parts. Col. James Rhodes' 'War Machine' has been given an image makeover and renamed 'Iron Patriot'; the film doing a good job of showing how Rhodey is at his best fighting alongside Iron Man instead of merely playing errand boy for the US military. Pepper Potts finally gets to step out of her 'beleaguered assistant' corner and throw some punches of her own, playing a pivotal part in the film's climactic shipping dock battle. The subplot with Ty Simpkins' character serving as Stark's kid sidekick of sorts could have come off as twee, but it doesn't eat into the meat of the proceedings and Stark's interactions with the boy are amusing and heartfelt. Also new to the series are Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall. The Mandarin, the Fu-Manchu like archenemy of Iron Man in the comics, is reimagined as an unkempt, somewhat theatrical figure of the shadows – though there is of course more to him than that. Stalwart comic book fans might not like the way the character is ultimately handled, but it is clever enough and didn't really bother me. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a scientist who was ignored by Stark earlier in his career and doesn't take too kindly to this, re-entering the fray with slicked- back hair and a spray tan. Pearce plays the 'mousy to charismatic' angle well, when it could well have been overly cartoonish à la Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever. The beautiful Rebecca Hall doesn't get a lot of screen time, but is one of those actresses who plays 'hot scientist' without a hitch. It would seem that doing anything new within the confines of the wham- bam comic book blockbuster genre would be difficult, since every new entry seems to be measured against The Avengers or The Dark Knight trilogy. It is to the credit of Shane Black and the team behind Iron Man 3 then that the film is effortlessly invigorating, assured in its tone with a good sprinkling of humour mixed in with awe-inspiring, effects- heavy action sequences and well-written character moments. There probably isn't a better way to kick off Phase II of Marvel's Cinematic Universe than with this flick.",9,9,25,24 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Abrams' Trek Journeys Into Greatness
","With 2009's Star Trek, director J. J. Abrams had set a course for the future of the series with a film that thoroughly invigorated what was, up to that point, largely seen as a flagging franchise. Love it or hate it, Star Trek '09 made the series accessible to the masses and perhaps the sexy young cast, the action sequences and the lens flares were just a way of helping the movie-going public at large let down their collective guards and learn to appreciate this cornerstone of science fiction through new eyes. Following a misadventurous opening sequence set on the planet Nibiru, Kirk and company return to Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco, where the higher-ups are none too happy about the recklessness they displayed on Nibiru. This is interrupted by a new threat: an unstoppable one-man terror cell who goes by the name of 'John Harrison' (Cumberbatch). Kirk leads the crew of the Enterprise in pursuit of Harrison, armed with 72 photon torpedoes and with newbie Dr Carol Marcus (Eve), daughter of Starfleet head Admiral Marcus (Weller), on board. Chief Engineer Scotty (Pegg) is suspicious of the contents of said weapons but his concern is initially unheeded. What follows is a dangerous quest that takes our heroes to the Klingon homeworld of Kronos, leading them to the discovery of the torpedoes' secret payload and the truth behind John Harrison's beef with Starfleet. Now, this is how you make a summer blockbuster. A tentpole sci- fi action flick doesn't have to be two hours of mind-numbing, cacophonous dross. Abrams, along with writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof and the countless others involved have brought us a film that is fresh, relentlessly exciting and overflowing with white-knuckle action, and none of this at the expense of a compelling story or well-drawn characters. From the very first minute, this reviewer was yanked right into this fantastical world. Abrams all but announces 'buckle up, because it's going to be one hell of a ride' – and what a ride Star Trek Into Darkness is. The Star Trek series has a magnificent legacy and has had an immeasurable impact on the genre, and to chuck all that away for all flash and no substance would be something of a crime. That's not the case here. Sure, there seems to be barely a minute to stop and catch one's breath, but that's probably preferable to a film that drags on and on any day of the week. The film has no shortage of pizazz in the form of stunning visual effects work, witty banter and edge-of-your seat near misses galore. Despite having 'darkness' in its title, this flick is far from dour or depressing. References, homages and shout-outs are skilfully weaved into the fabric of the story and some may disagree, but this reviewer feels this iteration of Trek actually is very respectful of what went before – just not slavishly so. In this movie, Captain Kirk truly comes into his own as leader of a starship crew and father to his men, Pine further proving there's more to him than just his handsome mug. Sure, Kirk's still the brash, womanising guy we all love (we catch him in bed with two be-tailed alien sisters) but there is character growth to be had. The ever-uneasy friendship between Kirk and Spock also gets a fair amount of play, and there are some great moments between the two, ranging from casual brickbats to a pretty dramatic bit near the end of the film. Quinto conveys Spock's struggle to get in touch with his human side, his resistance to emotion driving a wedge between him and Uhura, but never hits us over the head with this. Just as in the earlier film, everyone gets a chance to strut his or her stuff – for example, Sulu even gets to be acting captain. Simon Pegg as Scotty and Karl Urban as Bones in particular stand out in this one, both bringing different brands of comic relief to the proceedings while functioning as far more than merely 'the funny guys'. Bones mentions that he once performed a Caesarean on a Gorn and delivered octuplets. It's a funny bit that's also a nice nod to the original series. Speaking of alien species, there's a tribble which turns out to be integral to the plot. This is also brilliant. Of course, the attention is square on Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain of the piece. Suffice it to say that fangirls of his will not be disappointed. The guy is a riveting actor, one who knows when to chew just the right amount of scenery in order to not come off as silly. There has been a spate of more 'intellectual' villains in blockbuster movies as of late, but Cumberbatch does enough to differentiate himself from the bunch and Harrison isn't just all brains and no brawn – he single-handedly takes on a Klingon patrol in one action sequence. Star Trek Into Darkness is such a thrill that this reviewer left the theatre kind of breathless, but also really pumped. It's a big, big movie, but not the kind that's an extravagant insult to the intellects of audiences everywhere. Abrams has crafted a sequel that ups the game and elicits cheers, laughter, goosebumps, excited fist-pumping and even a tear or two at all the right moments. And isn't that warp effect just so sparklingly beautiful?Written for F*** Magazine",10,93,184,7 May 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of the Theme Park
","In 1989, Jordan Mechner created the first Prince of Persia video game on an Apple II. Since then, the video game franchise has come a long way and is one of the more successful and recognizable titles in the industry. Jerry Bruckheimer Films acquired the film rights to the 2003 video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and now it's a Disney blockbuster.Prince Dastan (Gyllenhaal), an orphan from the streets of Sixth Century Persia, is taken in by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) and his brother Nizam (Kingsley). Dastan takes his place as the adopted brother of the two sons of Sharaman, growing up as a Prince. Now adults, the three princes lead an assault on the Holy City of Alamut, suspected to be the site of several forges where weapons for enemies of Persia are manufactured.In Alamut, they encounter Princess Tamina (Arterton), the guardian of the Dagger of Time. The wielder of the Dagger can turn back time and only he is aware of what happened. Dastan is framed for murder at the victory celebration, and escapes with Tamina. Neither likes the other a whole lot, but have to cooperate so that Dastan can prove his innocence and Tamina can safeguard the dagger.Along the way, they meet Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), an 'entrepreneur' who runs an ostrich-racing syndicate. Amar assists Dastan and Tamina in traveling to a sanctuary where the dagger can be safe. They are ambushed by Hassansins, treacherous hired killers skilled in a variety of deadly arts.It is revealed that Nizam is behind the scheme and plans to use the dagger to turn back time such that he and not his brother Sharaman would be the true king. Dastan and Tamina thus have to prevent the dagger from falling into the hands of the evil Nizam.Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time sets out to be an epic, sweeping adventure. There is some spectacle, several good action sequences and well-choreographed fight scenes. Despite this, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time feels more like an average Hollywood actioner dressed as a sword-and-sandals tale.It is more than obvious that the film's main purpose is to try to replicate the success achieved by Disney and Bruckheimer's previous venture, the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. As such, comparisons are inevitable. Unfortunately, Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time does not feel as refreshing and swashbuckling as the Pirates of the Caribbean films, especially the first movie. It had a bigger scope, took greater risks filmmaking-wise and really broke more ground. Elements of other Disney films are readily recognizable: the street urchin-turned prince from Aladdin and the evil uncle from The Lion King, among others.The film boasts a cast that can be best described as 'interesting'. Indie darling Jake Gyllenhaal may seem the furthest thing from a marketable action star, but he is very charming and likable as Dastan. Gyllenhaal's dedication is also evident in the amount of muscle mass he gained to play the Prince, providing plenty of eye candy in what is not a typical ladies' film. Gyllenhaal performed many of his own stunts, including swordfighting and parkour-style jumping across rooftops. Who knows, this may be the start of the Brokeback Mountain guy's mainstream movie action star career.It is a bit of a pity then that his leading lady doesn't exude the same kind of appeal. The casting of Gemma Arterton seems to be inspired by choosing fellow English Rose Keira Knightley as the leading lady of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Arterton is stiff and shares little chemistry with Gyllenhaal, and looks nothing like the perceived image of a Far Eastern princess. There is a scene where Tamina removes her veil and the whole room gasps at her beauty-while Arterton is somewhat attractive, that's incredulous at best. I would have rather a Bollywood beauty be cast as Tamina, someone like Malika Sherawat, Frieda Pinto or Katrina Kaif.Ben Kingsley is excellent as a mustache-twirling evil uncle, and it is no surprise at all when he is revealed to be the villainous mastermind-that eye shadow should be indication enough. Being half-Indian, he definitely pulls off the Middle-Eastern look better than many of his co-stars.It is Alfred Molina who steals the show as the comic relief. His character Sheik Amar is greedy, shifty and untrustworthy, but somehow Molina makes him utterly likable, relishing the chance to ham it up just a little.Filmed partially on location in Morocco, the film possesses a hint of the exotic. However, the film feels culturally and historically ambiguous, especially since everyone speaks with a crisp British accent. Also, the audience can easily tell when the action moves to the sound stage, and, unlike Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, it's not going to win an Oscar for Best Visual Effects-or anything else, for that matter.That being said, the film is undeniably good fun, and is really something the whole family can enjoy (a good measure of violence keeps it from being too juvenile). Just keep one eye closed to the faults and go along for a theme park-style ride.",6,4,6,26 March 2011
Doctor Strange," The Sorcerer Supremacy
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe charts a path into realms unknown with this fantasy adventure, the 14th (!) film in the ever-expanding canon. Our hero is Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), a gifted but self-absorbed neurosurgeon whose life is upended following a car crash. His hands irreparably damaged, Strange is unable to find satisfactory treatment through western medicine, and heads east to Kathmandu. In a sanctuary called Kamar-Taj, the Ancient One (Swinton) holds court, opening Strange's eyes to unexplainable wonders. Strange sets about mastering the mystic arts, guided along by the Ancient One's disciple Karl Mordo (Ejiofor) and Wong (Wong), the keeper of Kamar-Taj's sacred relics. The Ancient One's students and humanity at large is threatened by Kaecilius (Mikkelsen), a former pupil who went rogue and is meddling in dark powers that could doom humanity. As Strange's colleague and ex-girlfriend Dr. Christine Palmer (McAdams) comes to terms with his transformation, Strange must use his newfound abilities to defeat Kaecilius and his followers. For all of the MCU's strengths and its branching into various subgenres, things have been feeling samey-samey. Audiences crave something all-new, all-different, and Doctor Strange is different enough. Director Scott Derrickson, known for horror films like Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, takes on his biggest, most ambitious project yet, emerging out the other side victorious. This is a film that's packed with eye-popping invention. Production designer Charles Wood and visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, among the legions of artists and technicians involved, are worthy of commendation. The trailer, with its origami folding cities, had me worried that the imagery would be too similar to that of Inception. It turns out that the trippiest stuff has been saved for the film itself, with kaleidoscopic vistas, Doctor Who-style tunnels through space-time, buildings morphing and shifting like Dark City on steroids, and ghostly Astral projections floating between this plane and the next among the tricks up its sleeves. The mind-bending geometry gives the action sequences a delightfully unpredictable landscape in which to play out. The results resemble weaponised Escher artwork. Doctor Strange may serve up eye candy unlike anything we've seen from the MCU so far, but for the most part, this is a straightforward hero's journey origin story. The haughty doctor must be brought to his lowest point, accept that there are things in this world and others beyond his understanding, and come into his own as a superhero. Things move along nicely and the screenplay by Jon Spaihts, C. Robert Cargill and Derrickson is witty without being smug. Just as Deadpool was a standard-issue origin story dressed with self-referential irreverence and attitude, Doctor Strange is a standard-issue origin story spiced up with logic-defying dazzlement. This reviewer will admit to thinking Benedict Cumberbatch wasn't the best man for the job, and that Cumberbatch was cast in an effort on Marvel's part to ride the Sherlock wave. This reviewer was wrong. It is gratifying to see a performer take the material as seriously as one would treat Shakespeare. Cumberbatch's commitment to the part is yet another indicator that the days of 'this is based on a comic book so it must be mere frivolity' are behind us. Cumberbatch rocks one of the most convincing American accents we've heard an English actor affect, and looks quite dashing in those robes and that cape. While we do already have an arrogant, brilliant MCU hero in the form of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Cumberbatch's portrayal of Strange doesn't feel like a repeat of that. Having an actor of Cumberbatch's calibre in the MCU roster is something we're grateful for. Ejiofor's Mordo is by-the-book and serious, but the actor's charm does shine through. Comic book fans know what becomes of the character, and that's hinted at here. While Swinton is fine as the knowing mentor figure with a glint in her eye, the movie doesn't make as a solid a case for its whitewashing as it promised. In the source material, The Ancient One is an elderly Tibetan man – your stock 'Asian mystic' archetype. Co-screenwriter Cargill compared the dilemma to Star Trek's no-win scenario, the Kobayashi Maru. Adhering to the comics and depicted an elderly Asian man as the wise mentor would have been one kind of racist, but it can be argued that substituting said Asian man with a white woman is just another kind of racist. The implication is that a white person has bested the locals at their own game and is now running the show. What I'm really saying is: wouldn't Michelle Yeoh have made an awesome Ancient One? McAdams doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, but it's great to see a lead female who isn't merely the designated girlfriend. She's also shown to be so skilled a surgeon, that even Dr. Strange acknowledges her prowess. Wong has been reinvented from the subservient tea- pouring butler of the original to a stern librarian who refuses to laugh at Strange's jokes. Strange, Wong and Mordo end up working well together as an unlikely team. By now, you've read the phrase 'MCU villain problem' in countless think-pieces. Alas, as far as villains go, Kaecilius is quite generic, but Mikkelsen does give the character a sinister, authoritative presence. The design flourish of burned-out crater- like scars around his eyes creepy. Keep a lookout for martial artist/actor Scott Adkins as one of Kaecilius' goons. The levity exhibited throughout most of the MCU movies is present here as well, with Strange making some smart-alecky quips and the sentient Cloak of Levitation behaving akin to the Magic Carpet in Disney's Aladdin. Just as elsewhere in the MCU though, the jokes sometimes diminish the stakes. Doctor Strange may not bend the established rules of the MCU completely beyond all recognition, but it reinvigorates the formula with a satisfyingly unique aesthetic. Stick around for a mid-credits scene and a post-credits stinger.",8,5,10,26 October 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man," The untold story? Not quite, but a well-told story? Definitely.
","After Spider-Man 3 became something of a critical and commercial letdown and plans for a sequel fell through, the folks at Marvel Entertainment and Columbia Pictures developed a case of itchy reboot button syndrome and immediately put The Amazing Spider-Man into production to swing in and save the franchise. Many fans rolled their collective eyes and the web was abuzz with fiery opinions. Early looks and promotional materials seemed generally underwhelming, and the film quickly became buried by bigger releases such as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus. However, this spider has become something of a dark horse and has somehow risen to greet detractors with a shot of webbing to the face.In spite of the poor first impressions, one would be hard-pressed not to admit that The Amazing Spider-Man is actually a competently-made, enjoyable flick. The approach that the aptly-named director Marc Webb of (500) Days of Summer fame took brings to mind last year's surprise hit Marvel flick X-Men: First Class, in that in combines the youthful appeal of teen drama with relatively large-scale super heroics and action sequences. This film does not repeat the mistakes of Spider-Man 3 – instead, we have character development and interaction and clear and easy-to-follow plot progression. Spider-Man has always been a hero all readers could relate to, with his transition from outcast to hero and his various personal, real-world struggles. Andrew Garfield, sexy nerd incarnate, is an ace casting choice. The actor has said that playing Spider-Man has been his dream since he was a young boy and the role went to the right guy. Garfield has an effortless, genuine charm and his slightly lanky proportions do seem very reminiscent of the Peter Parker of the comics, particularly the Ultimate version. For all the strengths of Tobey Maguire's interpretation of the character, Garfield's somehow rings more true. Whether he's being a smart-mouthed do-gooder, a teen sorting out his issues with his well-meaning aunt and uncle or a young lover unsure of how to go about a relationship with his dream gal, Garfield is in great form.Speaking of his dream gal, Emma Stone does a similarly good job of playing Gwen Stacy. Many were confused after Stone was cast and then announced as playing a different character from Kirsten Dunst's. Gwen did pop in Spider-Man 3 played by Bryce Dallas-Howard, and is touted as Parker's first love. In an interview, Stone states that 'Mary Jane fell in love with Spider-Man, but Gwen Stacy fell in love with Peter Parker'. Gwen is smart, kind and funny, surely what every guy looks for in a girl, and her role in the story is just the right size. Sure enough, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is among the strongest of on screen couples in recent memory and it's no surprise that the couple continued their romance off the set.One has to feel bad for Dylan Baker who portrayed Dr Curt Connors in Spider-Man 2 and 3 but never got the chance to transform into the Lizard after the cancellation of a fourth entry in Raimi's series. Rhys Ifans fills those shoes, and he marshals a tragic figure who hopes to better society and to fix his own perceived physical flaw. This definitely will push the excellent actor further into public consciousness, and he does a decent job. However, Connors' split-second snap from rational scientist to raving mad supervillain does seem a tad rushed and the design of the Lizard, as has been stated before, is pretty goofy. Also, the relationship between Connors and Parker, while given some attention here, could have benefited from a little mo re.The rest of the supporting cast is good too. Martin Sheen is easy to buy as the earnest, down-to-earth uncle and father figure who serves as an upstanding role model to his nephew, and so is Sally Field as his concerned, protective wife May. Casting these veteran film industry stalwarts was certainly a good move, especially since this retelling doesn't particularly focus on the two but does convey their involvement in Peter's life. Denis Leary is also well-cast as the Inspector Javert-type Captain Stacy, who could have been an over-the-top, 'squash Spider-Man dead!' figure. Instead, Leary makes him a stern but well-meaning authority figure and gives him a good dynamic with his daughter and Peter. His resemblance to Willem Dafoe, aka Green Goblin from the first Spider-Man film, is a little distracting though.In terms of aesthetics, the movie looks sleek and dramatic – director Webb uses his ample experience shooting music videos in the right way. While it could have been something like the horrid Catwoman movie, there is instead clever use of lighting and composition and the action sequences are kinetic yet coherently-shot. This reviewer isn't a giant fan of the costume, produced by the people at Cirque du Soleil (really) and the afore-mentioned facial features of the Lizard. The large amounts of digital effects supplied mostly by Sony Pictures Imageworks (also responsible for last year's Green Lantern film) are also a cut or so below expectations for a big-budget superhero movie, but these don't significantly hurt the end result.The film brings up the issue of Peter's parents but never fully addresses it, with a slightly ham-fisted mid-credits sequel hook hinting at what is to come. The Amazing Spider-Man has been marketed as 'the untold story', which is rather bold given that it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and five years since Spider-Man 3. Still, it defies expectations and is thoroughly entertaining. Untold story? Not quite, but well-told story? Definitely.",8,332,623,26 June 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne's Legacy Remains Untarnished
","The last movie that this reviewer saw was the remake of Total Recall, and films like that one would make one think: 'do we really need another Bourne movie – let alone one that doesn't even have Jason Bourne in it?' Paul Greengrass, director of the later two Bourne films in the original trilogy, jokingly suggested making a fourth one named The Bourne Redundancy, and its star Matt Damon similarly expressed a degree of disdain for a new film. The whole concept of a franchise spin-off does seem to reek of Hollywood cash grab. However, rest assured – Bourne's legacy remains completely untarnished, because, boy, is this a good one.The Bourne Legacy is, unfortunately, a movie people haven't really been excited about. It's been lost in the shuffle of late-Summer blockbusters, and its premise has been met with indifference. Well, Tony Gilroy and co. have to be given their due. This was intended to be a straight sequel to The Bourne Ultimatum, with Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass set to reprise their roles as star and director respectively, but it eventually fell through. It's safe to say that Gilroy, who co-wrote all three of the Bourne films and who co-wrote this one with his brother Dan, has more than salvaged the situation.The Bourne Legacy is taut, intelligent, bristling with tension and excitement and is an overall harrowing ride from start to finish. Gilroy finds a near-perfect blend of smarts and action such that one never drowns out the other, and, thankfully, he's less of a shaky-cam proponent than his predecessor Greengrass was. The story is coherent, the characters reasonably well-defined, and just like the first three Bourne films there's always an undercurrent of credibility, and the realism that The Bourne Identity reinvigorated the espionage film genre with is in good form here. While some bits, particularly the 'super-soldier' angle, are a bit of a stretch, it's never ridiculous and always absorbing. There's a sense of continuity established by the inclusion of some footage from Ultimatum as well as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney reprising their roles in briefer parts, and it's used just enough so the connection doesn't feel contrived.One of the primary challenges this film faced was making Aaron Cross a well-defined character and distinct enough from Jason Bourne. This challenge is mostly overcome, in that while Cross isn't as complex and intriguing as Bourne, he's still great fun to watch. Jason Bourne was a confused and disoriented man who had to come to terms with his muddled past, make sense of the remarkable skills he possessed and preserve whatever new relationships he formed. Aaron Cross on the other hand knows full well what he's doing, and is a little more idealistic and fresh-faced than Bourne was. With the help of those special pills, he gains incredible physical and mental skills, shuffling between martial artistry, official documents forgery and resourceful Mac-Gyvering with ease. In an early scene, he outfoxes a pack of wolves and bests a military drone sent to kill him at the same time. That's pretty badass. Of course, there's a little of the inner conflict Bourne had so much of, but Renner makes sure to keep the angst perfectly in check.Dr Marta Shearing, as played by Rachel Weisz, is a lot more than the token action movie chick. It's a clever move to have the female lead be a scientist indirectly involved in the protagonist's predicament, who is as integral to the plot as he is. Sure, Rachel Weisz probably doesn't quite look like a genetic scientist, but she's a lot more believable than the boatload of hotties Hollywood has been trying to pass off as geniuses for years (Denise Richards and Jessica Alba, anyone?) – and a much better actress too. She's the frightened woman jolted out of her everyday existence as much as she is an intelligent and level-headed scientist, and this isn't one of those films with a romantic subplot crowbarred in for no reason.The antagonists in this film, much as in the first three films, aren't cackling, maniacal megalomaniacs – they're intelligence officers, analysts and bureaucrats acting under orders, efficient, quietly menacing and dangerously amoral, with a frightening wealth of resources at their fingertips. Edward Norton plays the main bad guy – which, for the geeks out there, means Hawkeye is pitted against the (other) Incredible Hulk. He's undoubtedly a brilliant actor, and doesn't let the fact that his character is mostly confined to mission control hinder his performance. For the most part though, he never comes face-to-face with Cross, but he and his team always feel like a menace. It's an exciting game of cat and mouse to watch, with Cross half a step ahead of his pursuers, but never for long.The Bourne Legacy pulls through, retaining much of that Bourne spirit yet nary a sense of been-there-done-that or, God forbid, a direct-to-video feel. It turns out to be quite a bit more than a decently-written piece of fan-fiction – it's a clever, high-energy espionage thriller that could have easily felt slapped-together or cheap, but is instead well-conceived, well-crafted and well-acted. We certainly hope Matt Damon will be tempted to return to the series to team up with Renner should a sequel materialise.",8,12,26,7 August 2012
World Trade Center," Oliver Stone turns respectful and sensitive in this solemn and well-told tribute
","Touching, humane, scrupulous and realistic. Not words that are usually heard describing an Oliver Stone film, with all due respect to the director. Despite the extremely touchy subject matter (or perhaps because of it), many other paths could have been taken, from the flamboyant to the downright controversial, judging from Stone's previous works at least. However, he chose to take the docu-drama route, basing the film on testimonies of two particular survivors, the 18th and 19th out of only 20 rescued from the rubble.Nicolas Cage plays the hard-edged veteran New York Port Authority cop Sgt. John McLoughlin, while Michael Pena is the wide-eyed rookie Will Jimeno. The real-life duo are the two remaining survivors of a Port Authority police squad helping in evacuation efforts when the towers collapsed that fateful September morning. The unlikely pair find themselves alive, but badly injured, trapped under 20 tons of concrete and mangle metal, the aftermath of the terror attacks on the Trade Center. It becomes a struggle for everyone: McLoguhlin and Jimeno fight to stay awake and alive, their families brave the emotional trauma and rescue teams attempt a tricky extrication. Beinga true story, we are assured a happy ending, and are relived when it comes.However, it is the journey that counts, a harrowing one expertly portrayed with honest, gritty storytelling which is mostly factual anyway. The lives of a sergeant and his subordinate abruptly splice together, the story on all sides seamlessly narrated. Flashbacks and scenes of how the two families deal with the situation provide respite from the darkness and claustrophobia of the rubble. John and Will's wives, Donna (Maria Bello) and Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) respectively, go through the most pain as they fear for their beloveds' lives.The film is carried by the leads' credible performances, acting from the neck up but still delivering credible performances that move and convince. Cage and Pena play each other off with near-perfection, the two exuding just enough chemistry under the most impossible of situations. The normally glamorous Bello and Gyllenhaal are believable-enough as the traumatized wives, though they definitely fall short of Cage and Pena's deliveries.The only traces of director Stone's usual flamboyance are the dramatic computer-generated imagery (CGI) depictions and the large, true-to-life set-piece reconstruction of Ground Zero. The director wisely uses these as mere tools in the telling of a very human story, noticeably steering clear of anything that might be offensive. Even the planes smashing into the towers are not fully depicted; a passing shadow of the first airliner hints and the tragedy to come.However, as the story is based on real life and revolves simply around the two men's ordeal, fans of Stone's more high-octane motion pictures such as Platoon and Alexander will find World Trade Center mildly uninteresting at best, terribly boring at worst. Before watching the film, one must understand that the action and thrill are mainly psychological, and is all about appealing to one's nobler sentiments. World Trade Center is not your average summer action flick, but rather, as corny as it sounds, is a testament to hope, faith and the human spirit, displaying the fragility of family and the strength that lies dormant within us all. A first-rate human drama, a solemn and unexpected offering from Oliver Stone.RATING: 4/5 STARS By Jedd Jong",8,0,1,20 February 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," The Training Wheels Come Off
","Dragons. They're the mythical creatures prevalent in one form or another in almost every culture. Dragons have also been a cinematic mainstay, starring in films such as Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Reign of Fire and animated films such as Shrek and the classic Pete's Dragon.Now, Dreamworks, also responsible for the Shrek franchise, have breathed life, just as dragons breathe fire, into a popular children's' book. It is during the time of the Vikings, and they have made a living out of killing dragons that terrorize their village. The story focuses on Hiccup (Baruchel), a teenage misfit who prefers to use brains over brawn and doesn't seem to be going down the traditional dragon-slayer route, much to the chagrin of his father, the chief Stoick the Vast (Butler).Using an invention of his, Hiccup manages to down a Night Fury, a very rare breed of dragon. However, he cannot bring himself to kill it, and subsequently befriends and tames the dragon, which he names 'Toothless' for its retractable teeth. Through his interactions with Toothless, Hiccup becomes a kind of 'dragon whisperer', bewildering his classmates in dragon training, and inciting the jealousy of Astrid (Ferrera), an 'action girl' Viking whom Hiccup nurses an unrequited crush on.It is not long before Hiccup's double life is unveiled, and he has to convince the Vikings, most of all his father, that the dragons are not the vicious beasts that they are made out to be.First of all, How to Train Your Dragon looks stunning. Beautiful animation brings a stylized Viking village to life, and every detail, from Stoick's impressive beard to the scales on the dragons, is vividly realized. Toothless is given very expressive, liquid eyes that dilate and contract, and convey so much emotion. The film is also very kinetic and boasts beautiful camera-work that makes it feel more like a live-action film, and the action scenes are great as well.The 3D technology is used to its full potential here, giving depth to the already-lovely landscapes and fleshing out the characters. It also pulls the audience into the action scenes, especially sequences of the dragons in flight. Most of all, it makes the characters, be it human or dragon, that much more real and relatable, which is the greatest way that 3D technology can be used.But visual spectacle is nothing if there's no story to back it up. Thankfully, there's a good one here, a simple but effectively-told tale about the bond between man and animal. It's also a coming-of-age story that every teenager who has felt awkward or outcast (make that all of us) can relate to. Hiccup's relationship with Toothless almost recalls classic boy-and-animal films such as the Lassie movies, Black Beauty and the Flipper and Free Willy films. It goes without saying that Toothless is a most adorable creature, comparable almost to Pixar's lovable robot WALL-E, and probably the cutest dragon one ever will see.The voice acting, while perhaps not a highlight of the film, is undeniably good. Dreamworks is notorious for capitalizing on star power, with actors such as Eddie Murphy, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Will Smith having provided the voices for their past films. Here, Gerard 'King Leonidas' Butler is perfectly cast, his gruff Scottish accent giving a sternness to the tough Viking chief. Butler is also able to express the frustration many parents feel at their children who seem to march to a different beat than they did. Jay Baruchel inflects his delivery with wit and a certain dorky charm, which suits Hiccup to a T. Ugly Betty star America Ferrera is also good at the 'tough gal' shtick, and actually sounds believable as a teenager.John Powell, who has previously scored the Jason Bourne movies, X-Men and Mr. & Mrs Smith, among others, provides an excellent soundtrack for this animated adventure. The music during the action scenes is rousing and kinetic and conveys a Viking toughness, but there are also romantic and subtle moments in the score, particularly during Astrid and Hiccup's shared flight.In the end, How to Train Your Dragon is a bit of surprise, considering this is the studio that always plays second fiddle to Pixar animation, and has produced roundly mediocre films such as Shark Tale and Madagascar, that rode primarily on pop-culture in jokes and not much else (surprisingly, and to its benefit, How to Train Your Dragon has nary a pop-culture reference). Sure, this is probably no Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it is Dreamworks' best effort yet, and comes darned close.",8,0,0,26 March 2011
Thor," By Odin's Command, See this One!
","The folks at Marvel Studios have good business sense, and have put a lot of effort into building a Marvel movie universe populated by popular Marvel Comics characters. Iron Man 2 closed with a secret teaser ending, showing the discovery of Thor's hammer Mjolnr, and introducing an important piece of the Marvel movie universe puzzle.Thor is a staggering achievement, filled with imaginative energy and crackling with excitement, but the greatest weapon this warrior wields is its strong plot. Director Branagh brings his Shakespearian senses to the fore, stirring elements such as the Cain-and-Abel tussle between Thor and Loki, the star-crossed romance between Thor and Jane and also the friction between Thor and his disapproving father Odin into the cinematic pot.Branagh proves that he is no pushover when it comes to action sequences and wide panoramic vistas either. He has a keen eye for what looks good to excitement-hungry moviegoers, and this movie is packed with fantastic and beautiful visuals. From the sparkling spires of Asgard to the desolate wasteland of Jotunheim, this is a ten-course feast for the eyes – especially when given the 3D treatment.Chris Hemsworth proves himself as a charming and charismatic leading man. Thor is portrayed here as a skilled but reckless and headstrong warrior prince, and Hemsworth takes the audience along as Thor learns humility and finds love on Earth, even as he experiences some hilarious moments of culture shock. He also does well in the fight sequences, having trained and gained 20 pounds of pure muscle for the role.The supporting cast hits all the right notes as well, Anthony Hopkins imbuing Odin with thundering authority, Tom Hiddleston always possessing a malicious glint in his eye as Loki and Natalie Portman at her most normal and girlish as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Stellan Skarsgard grounds the film as Foster's level-headed mentor, and Kat Dennings is well-cast and very funny as the comic relief sidekick, usually a male role.An all-round movie-going experience, Thor is the explosive and substantial summer movie season opener everyone has been hoping for, and is unmissable on this and any other of the eight known realms. Oh, and don't forget to stay past the credits for a mind-blowing revelation.",9,4,9,20 May 2011
Inception," Sophisticated Spectacle
","As many reviewers have noted, this summer movie season...well, it's almost not deserving of being called a summer movie season at all. Sequels. Remakes. Reboots. Rehashes. Re-what-have-yous. Granted, they were not all bad, but neither were they all good. Along comes Christopher Nolan, Savior of the movie universe, with Inception.The psychological action-thriller centers on Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), a skilled 'extractor'. Cobb is a master of a specific kind of corporate espionage: he enters peoples' minds while they are asleep to retrieve secrets from their dreams.Cobb and his partner Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) are approached by the wealthy Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform 'inception': planting an idea instead of stealing one. Their target is Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy), the son of a terminally-ill tycoon. Saito wants Fischer to disband his father's empire.However, Dom is a deeply troubled individual, and with valid reason: he is wanted for the supposed murder of his wife Mallorie (Cotillard), and visions of his wife manifest themselves in the dreams Dom enters. Being a fugitive, Dom is unable to return to their children.Dom assembles a team to help perform the inception, consisting of Arthur, college graduate and 'dream architect' Ariadne (Ellen Page), 'forger' Eames (Tom Hardy) who impersonates others within a dream, Yusuf (Dileep Rao) the 'chemist' who formulates the drugs needed to enter the dream state and Saito himself, as a 'tourist' in the dream world.And then things get (even more) complex.In many ways, Inception, despite its mind-bending premise, is classic Christopher Nolan. Memento, Insomnia and the Prestige all display similar traits in that they enjoy playing with the audiences' minds. However, Nolan is a director who learns, and after gaining the experience of the big-budget Batman films, is able to translate his ideas into mind-blowing spectacle.Inception exemplifies the thinking man's blockbuster, and it is very rare that filmmakers of tent-pole summer fare treat their audiences like geniuses. After scores of films that are so painfully dumbed-down, it doesn't hurt to watch a brain cell-jolting flick like this one once in a while.Inception operates on its visuals: the notion that anything is possible within the world of the dream allowed production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas to go wild. The film includes such scenes as an entire city folding in on itself, a freight train running through a city, an assault on a fortress that wouldn't be out of place in a Bond movie and a desolate, abandoned dream city filled with crumbling buildings. One of the many great sequences in the film is a zero-gravity fight scene performed by Gordon-Levitt along the corridors of a hotel. Even for audiences jaded by the proliferation of 'wire-fu' since the Matrix films, it's exciting.Inception's greatest asset however is arguably its emotional core that functions like a rope guiding the viewer through the labyrinth of story. Leonardo DiCaprio has carved a career out of playing emotionally-complex characters, Cobb indeed brings to mind DiCaprio's recent performance in Shutter Island. Cotillard is also commendable in that it's never easy to play a character who exists only as a figment of another character's imagination, and Cotillard does this hauntingly well.The rest of the cast, too, is an iron-clad ensemble. There is literally not one weak link, everybody is perfectly cast. Gordon-Levitt especially seems to be emerging as a bona fide movie star, after making a name for himself in smaller character films. Watanabe manages to be dignified yet possess a misleading sinister streak as the employer and money man.Tom Hardy is a hoot as the comic relief who is actually really useful. My favorite however (it could be just that I'm a 17-year-old male) is the lovely Ellen Page, who has no problems portraying the youngest yet deepest character in the film. My only complaint with regards to the cast is that Michael Caine, as Cobb's mentor and father-in-law, is woefully underused.If you're tired of being insulted by blockbusters that throw money at the screen and hope it sticks, then treat yourself to one of the best cinematic uses of money ever. There's no shortage of spectacle or intelligence in what I can safely say the best movie of the year. And it's only July! Or is it...",9,0,6,26 March 2011
Mary and Max," Heartwarming to the Max
","appears on screen: 'God gives us our relatives – thank God we can choose our friends'. The simple, heartfelt sentiment of a longing for meaningful friendship, understanding and an outlet to share is a huge driving force that makes Mary and Max a cinematic gem one finds hidden in the cave buried amongst heaps of awful movies – a gem one only finds every so often.The Narrator (Humphries) lays it all out: Mary (Bethany Whitmore as a child, Collette as an adult) is an eight-year-old Australian girl, bullied in school, mistreated by her kleptomaniac, drunk mother and neglected by her factory-worker father. She has no friends. Max (Seymour-Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged New Yorker who has Asperger's Syndrome. He has no friends either. When Mary finds the strange name 'M. Horowitz' in a phone book and decides to write to him, it's the start of an unlikely friendship spanning two continents and twenty years and enduring countless hardships.Directed, written and designed by Australian animator Adam Elliot, Mary and Max may at first seem inaccessible because of its art-house sensibilities – there's a misconception that claymation is only ever used to make either films for very young children, or bizarre adaptations of Kafka's Metamorphosis. The delightfully whimsical style here is very comfortable, honest and real, raw emotions balanced with an appropriate sprinkling of black humour.To get an idea for the feel of the movie, take the heartbreaking opening sequence of Pixar's Up and stretch that to 80 minutes. The movie's childlike honesty belies a large range of very real and mature themes, making this not ideal for very young children, but something that older kids will appreciate. Danny Boyle's film Millions, also about a young outcast kid making sense of life and the world at large, comes to mind.Unlike such claymation films as Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline and Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Mary and Max doesn't derive most of its charm from being dark and grotesque. The characters feel so real that their appearances are the only thing remotely caricature-like. Through their letters to and fro, Mary and Max work through issues such as making friends, dealing with bullying and teasing, approaching relationships and so on. Just as Max mentors Mary, so the young girl has a thing or two to teach him. The film tracks as their lives progress, Max winning the New York lottery, Mary going on to study in university and get married, all the way up until they finally meet face-to-face in New York.The film contains a heartfelt and accurate (at least compared to most movie depictions) portrayal of Asperger's Syndrome. Max decides that he likes being an 'Aspie', that there's no point in finding a 'cure', and that it's all about working around the anxiety attacks, sensory overload and social awkwardness that is part and parcel of the 'syndrome'. Max finds solace in order, routine and comfort foods like his invention, the chocolate hot dog. 'If only there was a mathematical equation for love,' he sighs.One feels as much for Mary as for Max, the young girl lacking the life experience, with tragedy and heartbreak heaped onto her. From having a school bully pee on her lunch, to being unlucky in love and unable to have a good relationship with her parents, let alone any friends, it's hard not to immediately want to give the awkward bespectacled girl with the birthmark on her forehead a great big hug.I spent the whole movie fighting back tears – partly because of how genuinely moving it was, but also how happy I was that here was a wonderful film that had got everything right. While charming and beautiful throughout, the movie isn't afraid to offer a real and unflinching perspective, and never once feels preachy or contrived. There are very few movies that can truly be called 'life-changing' – this is one of them.",10,0,2,26 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A meaty, satisfying last course of Nolan's Batman 'set meal'
","Is it bright where you are / Have the people changed / Does it make you happy you're so strange / And in your darkest hour, / I hold secret's flame / You can watch the world devoured in its pain So go the lyrics to Smashing Pumpkins' The End is the Beginning Is the End, from 1997's Batman and Robin. It seems at least a little ironic that a song from the worst Batman film ever made seems to sum up the plot of what is possibly the best Batman film ever made. Christopher Nolan, his brother Jonathan, wife and producer Emma Thomas, co-plotter David S Goyer and their whole production posse seem to have had a Sisyphean task thrust upon them in topping 2008's The Dark Knight, widely hailed as the best comic book-based film ever made and having bragging rights as the only Batman film that won an Academy Award in an acting category. Laconically put, they have. They have made a Batman film better than The Dark Knight. Nolan has said that he and his brother were inspired by Dickens' classic story A Tale of Two Cities, and that it just so happened that the recession and the 'Occupy Wall Street' movement occurred, so if he is to be believed, it is partial coincidence that this is a very, very timely story. Bane's role in the story is that of zealous liberator who sees himself as a saviour who 'frees' Gotham from the clutches of the 1% by ambushing the stock exchange, isolating Gotham City from the country at large and seizing control through intimidation and bravado. There are many parallels to be drawn to such events as the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, the 9/11 attacks and the Oklahoma City bombing. This is also echoed by the characterisation of Catwoman, who steals from the rich not to give to the poor, but rather to spite the rich. Bane launches an attack on a sports stadium right after 'The Star-Spangled Banner' is sung, and there is a shot of a tattered American flag. A city's resolve broken, with Batman and his allies stepping in to patch it up in the face of insurmountable odds. While no one actor in the film matches the tour de force of the late Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker in the previous installment, the overall effect of this film certainly carries more impact. For one, it follows a solid plot line and doesn't lapse into false endings the way The Dark Knight sometimes did. Some felt that Nolan might fall into the trap of a tangled web of subplots and extraneous villains along the lines of Spider-Man 3, but it is safe to say he didn't. The big thing this one does that Part 2 didn't was it ties back to the previous instalments, making character arcs come full circle in a deeply satisfying manner. Also, it is more faithful to the source material than one might think; this isn't merely a war movie with Batman characters tacked onto it. There are some explosive plot twists and revelations – comic book devotees may see these coming a mile away, but Nolan plays a game of 'maybe I will, maybe I won't', so that when such turning points occur they are truly sensational. Compared to other villains who have appeared in Batman films, Bane is a relatively recent introduction in the comics, having made his debut in 1993. Tom Hardy does quite the job of making Bane more than Batman's mental and physical match. Even withhHalf his face obscured by a mask that is a cross between an attack dog's muzzle and venomous spider, the actor still manages to be charismatic and larger-than-life while displaying commendable restraint.Despite being widely lauded for his strengths as a writer-director, Christopher Nolan's Achilles heel is widely regarded to be writing women. He breaks that spell with Catwoman, her characterisation damn near perfect and portrayed with very surprising skill by Anne Hathaway who transforms from kooky sweetheart to confident, self-assured, oh-so-seductive and quick with a scathing remark. Marion Cotillard fulfils the more traditional damsel-in-a-degree-of-distress role, her Miranda Tate kind and disarming, and it is easy to see why Bruce Wayne would fall headlong for her.Beyond the story and performances, The Dark Knight Rises looks, sounds and feels like the event it is touted to be. Cinematographer Wally Pfister throws in some very inventive shots, including a brief moment where a charging Batman is lit by muzzle flashes, and delivers dizzyingly gorgeous panoramas as well. Chris Corbould and his practical effects crew help stage several awe-inspiring action set-pieces, and the tone is set well with an opening scene involving a staged plane crash orchestrated by Bane. There is a level of admiration to be had when a film fits a massive brawl shot on Wall Street, the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur, India and a terrorist attack on a football stadium (Pittsburgh's Heinz Field) into one movie. Christopher Nolan and co. have brought the curtain down on their trilogy in truly bittersweet fashion. These three films were emblematic of The Dark Knight rising, rising from an outrageously campy, seemingly franchise-killing film. This is the final cape flourish, the big send-off, the tearful goodbye. As Dickens wrote in the book that partially inspired this movie, 'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times' – this is the Caped Crusader's finest hour, and seeing this incarnation hang up the cape and cowl is quite saddening indeed.",10,14,29,18 July 2012
The Social Network," Man in the Net(work)
","When news that this film would be made was first released, the internet was aflutter - but mainly with skepticism. The names seemed solid enough - David Fincher as director, Aaron Sorkin as the scribe, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross scoring - but, understandably, everyone asked 'how would one make a movie about Facebook? Who's going to watch that?' The thing is, 'The Social Network' is not about Facebook. It's perhaps like saying 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was about the Ark of the Convenant. We all know 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was about Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Belloq, Thot...but less I digress, the genesis the success of this movie is in deciding the route to take.The film is based upon the book 'The Accidental Billionaires', by Ben Mezrich. Mezrich has had another of his books turned into a film before, and that film was the awful '21'. That's the thing - when I heard of '21', I desperately wanted it to be something like 'The Social Network' turned out to be.Spurned by his ex-girlfriend (Rooney Mara), gifted but very unlikable Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) spitefully creates 'facemash', a website to rate the appearance of the campus femmes. And so begins his roller-coaster journey to becoming Time magazine's 2010 Person of the Year and the youngest billionaire alive. His best friend Eduardo Saverin (Garfield), the affluent and influential twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer, Josh Pence as stand-in) and freewheeling and charismatic Napster founder Sean Parker all become chess pieces Zuckerberg plays – and pieces will fall off the board.David Fincher is known for being able to spin engaging yarns that affect on a psychological level, and pull audiences along for the ride. 'The Social Network' is no different. From the get-go, it's a kinetic, mile-a-minute experience, akin to watching a high-quality action film - only that there's not one explosion in 'The Social Network'. With a screenplay like Aaron Sorkin's, it doesn't need any at all.'The Social Network' is slick and a complete filmgoing experience - it feels like a great amount of effort was put into every aspect of production. Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield carry the film ably, natch, and have immediately become hot commodities in Hollywood - the former nominated for a Best Actor Oscar (up against the likes of Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges), the latter the new Spider-Man. Indeed, Garfield gave off a strong Peter Parker-type vibe, changing my early opinions about 'The Amazing Spider-Man' (after seeing that horrid costume).Stylistically and aesthetically, the film is pretty much perfect, glamorous and sexy – Jeff Cronenwerth's cinematography is smooth and cool, the film fashioning itself as an exclusive inside look behind the scenes, giving us hoi polloi a peek at the dangerous and exciting underbelly of the Facebook machine. However, that's the thing – it looks too pretty to feel like it's based on a true story. Indeed, most of the film does feel like conjecture, but it doesn't matter because it tells a good story. 'The Social Network' probably didn't set out to be a documentary anyway.Jesse Eisenberg's Mark Zuckerberg is actually one of the greatest screen villains of all time, in the company of the likes of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, Heath Ledger's Joker, and Malcolm McDowell's Alex. When characters who display traits of Asperger's Syndrome feature in movies, they're usually very nice deep down, or quirky and odd but likable. Zuckerberg as portrayed here is anything but – ruthless, cold, incredibly intelligent and with barely a shred of sympathetic quality until the very end of the film.The way the film presents it, the only true 'good guy' swimming in the sea of sharks is Eduardo Saverin, as played by Garfield – probably because the real-life Saverin was the only member of the Facebook team who served as consultant to author Ben Mezrich. Still, Garfield is charming, real and puts his game face on to tackle the screenplay, and wins.The supporting cast is strong, particularly Justin Timberlake's suave, self-assured turn as Napster founder Sean Parker. However, I do question the decision to have Armie Hammer portray both Winklevoss twins, his visage digitally pasted onto body double Josh Pence to achieve the effect. Sure the CGI looks almost flawless, but it does sometimes (blasphemous as it sounds) remind one of any of the awful Eddie Murphy comedies where he insists on playing both characters. Hammer is a decent actor, but try as he might he was unable to sell the idea of two separate characters who look and sound alike but are otherwise individuals.Aaron Sorkin, master of the 'walk-and-talk' genre as displayed in The West Wing, gives us a 'run-and-talk' instead, his screenplay demonstrating incredibly brisk and astute pacing, throwing in the right amount of technobabble so we can tenuously believe the computer know-how that went into creating the website, and also developing compelling, complex characters that you just can't look away from.Ultimately, the film is much like a modern-day retelling of Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' – of how a brilliant, misunderstood and possibly evil genius created a monster, a monster that escaped his control, granting him fame and fortune by way of invading the lives of 600 million people around the world – and for so effectively getting such a frightening reality to take strong roots in the minds of such a mass audience, The Social Network is exceedingly praiseworthy.Jedd Jong",9,1,2,19 February 2011
