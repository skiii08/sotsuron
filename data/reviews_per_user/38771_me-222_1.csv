The Ring," Bizarre Horror at its Best.
",I watched this film not expecting a whole lot from it.  I was definitely surprised at what a good film this turned out to be.  I myself have always found gore-blood type horror movies really monotonous.  The things that frighten me are EVERYTHING that The Ring had to offer - scary and twisted imagery that gets into your head and never lets you forget it.  This movie was definitely disturbing and a lot more than even I expected... Definitely worth seeing and definitely difficult to forget.  I can't remember the last time I saw a horror movie like this where I couldn't predict the ending within the first 10 minutes - The Ring leaves you guessing and just when you think you've got it figured out it completely surprises you...,Null,0,0,15 November 2002
