Raiders of the Lost Ark," Professor of archeology, expert on the occult, and how does one say it..obtainer of rare antiquities.
","The ultimate peak of the adventure film, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie so masterfully-crafted that a type of magic seems to shine out from every frame. Steven Spielberg, one of the most talented directors of all time, has also given us some of the other greatest American movies ever made, from Jaws to Schindler's List, and in Raiders of the Lost Ark he shows us the film-making edge that has made him so extremely successful.Raiders follows the exploits of Indiana Jones, part time archeology professor, full time fedora-wearing, pistol-slinging, whip-cracking adventurer. Set in the late 1930s, Jones is hired to track down the Biblical artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, a chest in which the mythical Ten Commandments sent down by God are said to have been kept. The Nazis are after it too, their expedition led by the villainous Belloq, Indiana's career-long nemesis.Everything about Raiders of the Lost Ark clicks in place with complete perfection. The script is fantastic and Spielberg's direction is flawless, a style which has influenced countless other movies since. The action sequences are heart-thumpingly exciting and full of edge-of-your-seat, such as the brilliant famous opening scene which introduces us to Indiana as he attempts to uncover a golden tribal idol.The performances are all beyond excellence here as well. Harrison Ford creates one of the cinema's most memorable characters in the heroic Indiana Jones, a rugged warrior of the arts who all women love and who all men want to be. The beautiful Karen Allen is excellent as well as the two-fisted Marion Ravenwood, and Paul Freeman lends a smug sense of devilish satisfaction to each word he speaks. Other great performances include John Rhys-Davies as Jones' friend Sallah and Ronald Lacey as the cold, menacing Toht.Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best movie experiences a film fan can ever have, and it deserves its place among the best ever.I give Raiders a 10 out of 10, and I recommend it to any and all fans of film in general",10,0,1,8 March 2000
The Matrix," Welcome to the real world.
","It seemed like the days of The Terminator, Aliens and Predator were over. Nobody had the vision anymore to craft a hardcore action sci-fi masterpiece that would kick our faces in. We had a few glimmers of hope here and there, but in 1999 it exploded right under us in the form of The Matrix, a brilliant experience that brought us into a world we had never seen.I'll keep the plot overview simple, because to ruin the movie's big surprises would be a shame, although I'm sure you already know the gist of it. A haggard and frustrated computer programmer named Thomas Anderson, also known by his online alias Neo, is awakened by a band of para-military freedom fighters and their fatherly commander, Morpheus. What is he awakened to? Reality, a horrifying reality that he can barely comprehend, but one that he must quickly learn to live with.The sprawling plot is an expertly-forged epic of mythic proportions, and it is directed and edited in a haunting way that perfectly shows off the cold deadness of Neo's new reality. The Wachowski brothers have tapped into the primal emotions that made the Star Wars saga such a success: Man, using his cunning mind and heroic brawn, can rise up and rebel against evil and retake his freedom.The kung-fu battles and gunfight sequences are without a doubt the finest action scenes ever put onto film, and their mind-bending, over-the-top coolness propels The Matrix far beyond anything that has ever come before it; seeing Neo freeze time and watching Trinity spin weightlessly through the air must simply be seen to be believed.All the acting here, along with the excellent writing and direction, is flawless as well. Keanu Reeves is fantastic as Neo, and Laurence Fishbourne is, as usual, exceptional as Neo's mentor Morpheus. All of the cast gives great, sometimes career-making, performances as well; Carrie Anne-Moss as Trinity and Hugo Weaving as the villainous Agent Smith especially shine.Quite possibly the best action movie ever made, The Matrix is the type of film that will inspire and influence the future of the science-fiction genre for years to come.I give The Matrix a 10 out of 10, and I recommend it to any and all fans of film in general",Null,0,0,7 March 2000
